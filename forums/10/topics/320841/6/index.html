              <p><br> Like I said before, show us the results first before even

              <p><strong>What is Swiss standards? - A rolls royce in every

              <p>If you think we have already arrrived, I guess it's just self
              delusional again. Old folks scavenging in the streets for cardboard

              spent it in China, and now live on govt welfare of est.$300. But
              then i personally don't have that large a fund to help all. Would

              <p>This problem can't be solve solely by rising GST. Instead, rising the GST will just backfires and will hurt their already broken pockets more.</p>
              <p>From my understanding of your post,  i'll will take it that you are emphasising on how our elderly today have weak financial management.</p>
              <p>Partially true. However, have you taken into consideration that they may had use their life savings to fund their unfilial children studies or business? Or perhaps was being cheated of all of their possession?</p>

              <p>Maurizio i'll just copy and paste ur points into this post as quoting it requires lot of space. Hope you understand :)</p>
              <p>Ok back to topic</p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">~First of all the Transparency International Index is not a yardstick of corruption in the government, the index is a measurement for the country as a whole (e.g. businesses, the people, etc).</span></p>
              <p>True. But you must understand this, if the leader of the country would be corrupted, wouldn't his assistances be corrupted too? And if they are corrupted wouldn't that bring corruption all the way down the hierachy, thus destroying the country's reputation?</p>
              <p>Corruption is a snowball effect. The source is usually from the higher ranking and, as even the higher ranking is corrupted, other lower ranking officials will feel safer follow. This will soon flow into the public and private sector as people finds out that it is safer and profitable to be corrupted. Examples of such cases can be seen in most Asean countries.</p>
              <p>There was this time when i went to chiang mai and brought this painting. I checked with the authorities and they say its legal to bring this back to sg. However at the airport, i was stopped by a guard who said its illegal. Guess what! I gave him 400 bhat and he immediately ASSISTED me pass the custom. If even the national security is corrupted, you could expect the same from the top.</p>
              <p>However, will u experience such a thing i SG? I guess we people would even be afraid to bride the police. Thats how clean SG is, and that can be used to show that the government is somewhat corruption-free. Despite what i've said, i still believe that corruption still do exist in SG, just at a small extend.</p>
              <p>~<span style="color: #000000;">Like I said, you do not give more money to a corrupt person to prevent corruption. If a person is greedy, the amount of excess money you pay is irrelevant, laws are what binds him to the straight and narrow.</span></p>
              <p>True. But are you trying to say that our officials are corrupted? If thats so pls do show me some evidences? Cause this beautiful sentence holds no strength if you can't show that a person is corrupted.</p>
              <p>~Also, if you look at the scale of corruption free index, Singapore is ranked 4th after Denmark, Finland and New Zealand. Are the Prime Ministers and the equivalent Ministers in these countries paid in the millions like their Singaporean counterparts?</p>
              <p>True. However, like what i said earlier, we should not use other country's standard as our own. Are you telling me that since these countries don't pay their civil servants more we should not too? Are you trying to say that we, as singaporean, should assign to whatever bondaries other nations had set up?</p>
              <p>Rather, i think it would be better if we use their standards as a comparision and create a standard that we can call our own. Who knows? Maybe they will be following our standard and increasing their pay for civil servants.</p>
              <p>Salary for a politician is a very sensitive subject. However, i believe everyone agrees that a person should be paid what is worth his/her contribution to the nation.</p>
              <p>~<span style="color: #000000;">Like I said before, show us the results first before even exploiting the commoners.</span></p>
              <p>Proof pls?</p>
              <p>~<span style="color: #000000;">So have the standard of living for Korean, Taiwanese and Hong Kongers, but are their Ministers paid in the millions?</span></p>
              <p>I've personally been to Taiwan and stayed they with a friend who was living there. Yes, that country have a high standard of living. However, compared to sg, i should say that taiwan's sercurity and S.O.L still have place to catch up.</p>
              <p>So if i were to credit the politicians, i would definetly say that Sg's gov deserve a higher pay than taiwan's gov. Though i am in no position to say the exact amount.</p>
              <p>~Old folks scavenging in the streets for cardboard boxes and aluminium cans; old folks not being able to afford medical treatment.</p>
              <p>True. Very true indeed. It makes me think whether our gov is worth it whenever i met up with this people who deserve a better living standard.</p>
              <p>However, i also see many,many more people who drive BMWs,</p>
              <p>many, many teenagers who owns hps, mp3s/ipods, laptops</p>
              <p>many, many aunties going for high tea in orchard</p>
              <p>So i guess you know what i'm getting at.</p>
              <p>I know by now you may think that imma PAP dog. I'm not, as a matter of fact there are many points i hate about our gov, its just that i find it best if we would be more open minded and learn to accept more alternative POVs. These will allow us to think deeper into each and every issue, rather than make pointless commend which can easily b swept under the rug by gov.</p>

And if they are corrupted wouldn't that bring corruption all the way down the hierachy, thus destroying the country's reputation?</span></p>
              <p>That's why there are laws enacted to curtail such acts. Law is a deterrent to corruption, not money, which is the initiator to corruption. <strong>Ask yourself this, if your own child steals $1,000 from you. Do you give him $2,000 to prevent him from stealing from you again; or do you explain to him his actions and give him punishment ? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> Isn't this what the government is doing? To prevent his Ministers from being corrupt, he gives them more money.</strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Corruption is a snowball effect.

              <p>That's why you need CPIB to be reporting directly to an independant President, instead of reporting to the Prime Minister. If a CEO discovers issues with his management team, be it fraud or otherwise, it is more likely that a CEO will cover up such issues before it reaches the shareholders. Laws govern the actions and behaviour of all who are bound by it. Of course if all the CEO in the world thinks like LKY or LHL, then they will be paying money in excess of the actual rate to the management team, so that they won't be corrupt.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">There was this time when i went to chiang mai and brought this painting. I checked with the authorities and they say its legal to bring this back to sg.

              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Do they have anti corruption laws in Thailand? Is it strictly enforced by the government? Maybe they should follow the actions of the Singapore government, increase the salary of these custom officers by SGD100,000 a year, then all of these officers will cease to be corrupt. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">However, will u experience such a thing i SG? I guess we people would even be afraid to bride the police. Thats how clean SG is, and that can be used to show that the government is somewhat corruption-free. Despite what i've said, i still believe that corruption still do exist in SG, just at a small extend.</span></p>
              <p>People here won't even dare try bribing. Why? Because we have laws that prevent corruption. Going by LKY and LHL logic, maybe it's better to pay these police officers another $5,000 each month, so that they won't be corrupt.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">True. But are you trying to say that our officials are corrupted? If thats so pls do show me some evidences? Cause this beautiful sentence holds no strength if you can't show that a person is corrupted.</span></p>
              <p>By the amount of salary they are receiving, it's very clearcut that the amount they received has elements of corruption money (they would receive if they engage in corruption) built into it. If other world leaders are getting SGD300,000 a year, Singapore leaders are paid SGD3 million, won't the excess of the SGD2.7 million be the amount that they would receive if they were corrupt. Maybe you can cite which other country in the world, Ministers are paid $3 million (other benefits not included)?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">True. However, like what i said earlier, we should not use other country's standard as our own. Are you telling me that since these countries don't pay their civil servants more we should not too? Are you trying to say that we, as singaporean, should assign to whatever bondaries other nations had set up?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">It is the global standard, a benchmark for all to follow. Don't see any reason why we should divert from it. Do you live on Earth or Mars?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Rather, i think it would be better if we use their standards as a comparision and create a standard that we can call our own. Who knows? Maybe they will be following our standard and increasing their pay for civil servants.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Our standards are substandards, else we won't be following Oxbridge for our entrance exams. Even the textbooks we read are written by anglophone authors. Laws are even copied over from the British, of course with changes to limit the liberty of the humankind.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Salary for a politician is a very sensitive subject. However, i believe everyone agrees that a person should be paid what is worth his/her contribution to the nation.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">I believe a person should be paid for his position and responsibility. Else very soon we will be paying plumbers like Bill Gates afew millions to repair our faucets. Doesn't seem logical to be having a PM that used to be a renowned heart surgeon paid $10 million a year to run the government. His skill set is different to the task at hand.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Proof pls?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Are you blind? HDB, GST, ERP, Petrol Tax, COE, excessive Electricity Tariffs, Hospital Charges, etc.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">I've personally been to Taiwan and stayed they with a friend who was living there. Yes, that country have a high standard of living. However, compared to sg, i should say that taiwan's sercurity and S.O.L still have place to catch up.</span></p>
              <p>The cost of living is many times less than Singapore. Security wise, it's still acceptable, you don't see any terrorist bomb going off anywhere.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">So if i were to credit the politicians, i would definetly say that Sg's gov deserve a higher pay than taiwan's gov. Though i am in no position to say the exact amount.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Seriously, you don't need much intellect to run Singapore, turn it to a stricter police state, limit human rights and during election time buy the electorate by giving out Singapore Shares. You don't have to fool everyone, you just need to fool the poor, the old, and the stupid, because they are the most vulnerable. Afew thousand dollars would buy their vote.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">True. Very true indeed. It makes me think whether our gov is worth it whenever i met up with this people who deserve a better living standard.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">However, i also see many,many more people who drive BMWs,</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">So i guess you know what i'm getting at.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">So does this mean that ALL Singaporeans have BMWs and Notebooks? What you are seeing is just a segment of the population, it is in no way representative of the whole population. Maybe you should take a walk in those 1 room and 2 room HDB blocks; or maybe take a walk in some of the void decks during the wee hours of the night. I remembered last year, someone in the forum asked if everybody received a raise, most replied "yes". But is this representative of the whole population of Singapore? No. It only represents a well to do segment of the population who has access to a broadband internet account, time to spare from the better paying jobs, possession of a notebook or PC. These are often the well to do segment of the population. If you take a look at the Gini Coefficient, it has increased quite significantly through the years. Which more or less proves that the rich are getting richer, while the poor are getting poorer.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">I know by now you may think that imma PAP dog.

              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Don't need to think who you are, I already know who you are. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></span></p>

              heading here. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> We are already feeling the effects of
              the 2% increase resulting in inflation and the increase in foreign
              talents to deprive our own citizens of jobs. Maybe you can
              elaborate what kind of policies that needs a time horizon of afew
              decades? The Global Crossing, Shin Corp, Suzhou Industrial Project,
              Merill Lynch or UBS? That's a common understanding amongst
              investors, if they lose money in the stock market, they will claim
              it as a long term investment with time horizons of afew decades. So
              long as they don't sell, it's still a paper loss.</p>
              <p>Benefits filtering down to the common men? Hardly, the common
              men are facing job losses due to foreign talents. The situation is,
              the increase in GST and Electricity tariffs has brought about
              supernormal profits for the government, but they decide to put it
              back into the coffers and let citizens suffer. Which utility
              organisation in the world earns 20% return on equity? Most earn
              around 10% in the US, while banks in Singapore earn less than 15%
              return on equity.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Whether it be top down approach, bottom down approach or even
              sideways approach, the integrity of the politician is of the utmost
              important. While they persist in self authorizing their pay
              increments to afew millions, concomitantly asking that low wage
              workers bite the bullet by taking pay cuts. Hardly the case for
              most large organisations, most of the time senior management takes
              a higher pay cut than the lower rungs.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Each country has it's own set of problems to deal with, not that
              any country with or without resources is immune these problems.
              Hong Kong for example was a colony of the British empire, a similar
              set of circumstances, yet Hong Kong developed into a far better
              country than Singapore.</p>

              <p>I agree with your views. But there are some misconceptions that i want to highlight to you.</p>
              <p>1st, HK is not a far better country than SIngapore. Yes its HDI won SG's by a little, but its GDP per capita and living space cannot be matched with SG's. I think it would be more appropiate if we say that both countries are of an equal standard with its own high points and low points.</p>
              <p>2nd, Senior management are supposed to get more than the lower rung. If not, why would there be promotions?</p>
              <p>3rd, Yes, FTs have been and will be a challenge to us local men, who needs to go through NS and thus delay our career. However, the only people whom i hear have problem over job issues are those who dosen't want to improve themselves or don't have the die-die-must-fight mentality that is crucial for success. It is not that they are better than us in any way, its just that some of us can't take up the challenge.</p>

              <p>If you have evidence as to corrupt behaviours of these politicians in other countries, don't hesitate to provide us with facts of these corrupt behaviours. Else don't speculate.</p>
              <p>If you still don't have the mentality to understand, we have a budget surplus every year. Temasek has funds that belong to Singaporeans. These increases in investment values are from overcharging her citizens through government monopolies. Why not distribute the excess of these investment returns (leaving the capital intact) to citizens so that they can have more of a life? Or you prefer to build up funds like what NKF does, for a doomsday event that will never occur.</p>

              <p><br>Speculations? Do you even read the newpapers?</p>
              <p>"Don't have the mentality to understand" - so you do? The only thing i see you understand is that with a budget surplus, and you claim from 'overcharging her citizens through monopolies'.</p>
              <p>1.) Have you any definitive proof of such 'overcharging' - which means over and above the normal rates others' charge? For example:- healthcare - the govt charges more than private clinics and hospitals. HDB flats costs more than Condos. School fees more than what a Singaporean would have to pay if he studies in eg; Australia or US, which are of comparable if not lower standards than our high school equivalent.( Not comparing Colleges, Uni, as the standards are higher there)</p>
              <p>2. ) How much of these investments returns will be? You left out the amounts, on purpose? Usually it is much lower and seldom more than double digits. Would that be enough to fund social spending in education, healthcare, transportation, etc?</p>
              <p>3. ) NKF is a private charity foundation. It's monies are non-refundable. It was a good thing our media, whom you profess as a govt mouthpiece, spilt the beans on its mismanagement. Only a fool would use NKF as a comparison to our treasury.</p>
              <p>Unlike NKF, our funds in the treasury are in terms of CPF and tax revenues and have to be returned back to the People, espacially CPF which promises 4% annual returns. How else to give such returns except to invest it prudently for slightly more than the 4% returns, and with any excess, use it for social spending so as not to tax the citizens further?</p>
              <p>As any investor knows, risk adverse blue chip investments are in it for the long haul and seldom see double digit % annual returns. You claim a doomsday will never come. Why don't you work out how much actual medical care subsidy alone costs are, espacially with our aging population whom requires it most and tell me if even with a budget surplus used solely just for it, if we can promise full medical care for them ALL.</p>
              <p>The only reason why our health care subsidize are not more than S$1.6billion this year is rather, fortunately or unfortunately, patients cannot even afford the 'co-pay' of 20% on the full course of treatment, and would rather take pills to sustain themselves to see another sunrise till the pain overcomes their heartbeats. I don't mind to subsidize all, pay more taxes, but what about CPF monies which must be returned with interests earned from investments? Where will other money come from other than us whom are gainfully employed? What about other funds for social spendings?</p>
              <p>Any person would realize the importance of saving up monies. Can you tell what the future will be? You can't. Better to be safe, than sorry, for the sake of our future generations, just as the previous generations sacrificed for us all now. $100 million in our coffers in 1965 didn't grow to become US$300 billion by magic, but by prudent management with strict controls, so that we can still afford within our ability to help most, if not all of those less well off than us.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">True. But you must understand
              this, if the leader of the country would be corrupted, wouldn't his
              assistances be corrupted too? And if they are corrupted wouldn't
              that bring corruption all the way down the hierachy, thus
              destroying the country's reputation?</span></p>
              <p>That's why there are laws enacted to curtail such acts. Law is a
              deterrent to corruption, not money, which is the initiator to
              corruption. <strong>Ask yourself this, if your own child steals
              $1,000 from you. Do you give him $2,000 to prevent him from
              stealing from you again; or do you explain to him his actions
              and give him punishment ? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> Isn't this what the government is doing? To
              prevent his Ministers from being corrupt, he gives them more
              money.</strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Corruption is a snowball effect.
              The source is usually from the higher ranking and, as even the
              higher ranking is corrupted, other lower ranking officials will
              feel safer follow. This will soon flow into the public and private
              sector as people finds out that it is safer and profitable to be
              corrupted. Examples of such cases can be seen in most Asean
              countries.</span></p>
              <p>That's why you need CPIB to be reporting directly to an
              independant President, instead of reporting to the Prime Minister.
              If a CEO discovers issues with his management team, be it fraud or
              otherwise, it is more likely that a CEO will cover up such issues
              before it reaches the shareholders. Laws govern the actions and
              behaviour of all who are bound by it. Of course if all the CEO in
              the world thinks like LKY or LHL, then they will be paying money
              in excess of the actual rate to the management team, so
              that they won't be corrupt.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">There was this time when i went to
              chiang mai and brought this painting. I checked with the
              authorities and they say its legal to bring this back to sg.
              However at the airport, i was stopped by a guard who said its
              illegal. Guess what! I gave him 400 bhat and he immediately
              ASSISTED me pass the custom. If even the national security is
              corrupted, you could expect the same from the top.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Do they have anti corruption laws
              in Thailand? Is it strictly enforced by the government? Maybe they
              should follow the actions of the Singapore government, increase the
              salary of these custom officers by SGD100,000 a year, then all of
              these officers will cease to be corrupt. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">However, will u experience such a
              thing i SG? I guess we people would even be afraid to bride the
              police. Thats how clean SG is, and that can be used to show that
              the government is somewhat corruption-free. Despite what i've said,
              i still believe that corruption still do exist in SG, just at a
              small extend.</span></p>
              <p>People here won't even dare try bribing. Why? Because we have
              laws that prevent corruption. Going by LKY and LHL logic, maybe
              it's better to pay these police officers another $5,000 each month,
              so that they won't be corrupt.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">True. But are you trying to say
              that our officials are corrupted? If thats so pls do show me some
              evidences? Cause this beautiful sentence holds no strength if you
              can't show that a person is corrupted.</span></p>
              <p>By the amount of salary they are receiving, it's very clearcut
              that the amount they received has elements of corruption money
              (they would receive if they engage in corruption) built into
              it. If other world leaders are getting SGD300,000 a year, Singapore
              leaders are paid SGD3 million, won't the excess of the SGD2.7
              million be the amount that they would receive if they were corrupt.
              Maybe you can cite which other country in the world, Ministers are
              paid $3 million (other benefits not included)?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">True. However, like what i said
              earlier, we should not use other country's standard as our own. Are
              you telling me that since these countries don't pay their civil
              servants more we should not too? Are you trying to say that we, as
              singaporean, should assign to whatever bondaries other nations had
              set up?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">It is the global standard, a
              benchmark for all to follow. Don't see any reason why we should
              divert from it. Do you live on Earth or Mars?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Rather, i think it would be better
              if we use their standards as a comparision and create a standard
              that we can call our own. Who knows? Maybe they will be following
              our standard and increasing their pay for civil
              servants.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Our standards are substandards,
              else we won't be following Oxbridge for our entrance exams. Even
              the textbooks we read are written by anglophone authors. Laws are
              even copied over from the British, of course with changes to limit
              the liberty of the humankind.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Salary for a politician is a very
              sensitive subject. However, i believe everyone agrees that a person
              should be paid what is worth his/her contribution to the
              nation.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">I believe a person should be paid
              for his position and responsibility. Else very soon we will be
              paying plumbers like Bill Gates afew millions to repair our
              faucets. Doesn't seem logical to be having a PM that used to be a
              renowned heart surgeon paid $10 million a year to run the
              government. His skill set is different to the task at
              hand.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Proof pls?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Are you blind? HDB, GST, ERP,
              Petrol Tax, COE, excessive Electricity Tariffs, Hospital Charges,
              etc.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">I've personally been to Taiwan and
              stayed they with a friend who was living there. Yes, that country
              have a high standard of living. However, compared to sg, i should
              say that taiwan's sercurity and S.O.L still have place to catch
              up.</span></p>
              <p>The cost of living is many times less than Singapore. Security
              wise, it's still acceptable, you don't see any terrorist bomb going
              off anywhere.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">So if i were to credit the
              politicians, i would definetly say that Sg's gov deserve a higher
              pay than taiwan's gov. Though i am in no position to say the exact
              amount.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Seriously, you don't need much
              intellect to run Singapore, turn it to a stricter police state,
              limit human rights and during election time buy the electorate by
              giving out Singapore Shares. You don't have to fool everyone, you
              just need to fool the poor, the old, and the stupid, because
              they are the most vulnerable. Afew thousand dollars would buy their
              vote.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">True. Very true indeed. It makes
              me think whether our gov is worth it whenever i met up with this
              people who deserve a better living standard.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">However, i also see many,many more
              people who drive BMWs,</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">many, many teenagers who owns hps,
              mp3s/ipods, laptops</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">many, many aunties going for high
              tea in orchard</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">So i guess you know what i'm
              getting at.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">So does this mean that ALL
              Singaporeans have BMWs and Notebooks? What you are seeing is just a
              segment of the population, it is in no way representative of the
              whole population. Maybe you should take a walk in those 1 room and
              2 room HDB blocks; or maybe take a walk in some of the void decks
              during the wee hours of the night. I remembered last year, someone
              in the forum asked if everybody received a raise, most replied
              "yes". But is this representative of the whole population of
              Singapore? No. It only represents a well to do segment of the
              population who has access to a broadband internet account, time to
              spare from the better paying jobs, possession of a notebook or PC.
              These are often the well to do segment of the population. If you
              take a look at the Gini Coefficient, it has increased quite
              significantly through the years. Which more or less proves that the
              rich are getting richer, while the poor are getting
              poorer.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">I know by now you may think that
              imma PAP dog. I'm not, as a matter of fact there are many points i
              hate about our gov, its just that i find it best if we would be
              more open minded and learn to accept more alternative POVs. These
              will allow us to think deeper into each and every issue, rather
              than make pointless commend which can easily b swept under the rug
              by gov.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Don't need to think who you are, I
              already know who you are. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></span></p>

              <p>~Because we have
                                      laws that prevent corruption.</p>
              <p>So why are you still saying that our folks up there are corrupted?</p>
              <p>~<span style="color: #000000;">It is the global standard, a
                                      benchmark for all to follow. Don't see any reason why we should
                                      divert from it. Do you live on Earth or Mars?</span></p>
              <p>You're merely repeating what i've said, doesn't a benchmark act as a comparision? I do see a reason though, to have something we can call our own. I live on Earth if that is what you wanna know.</p>
              <p>~<span style="color: #000000;">Our standards are substandards,
                                      else we won't be following Oxbridge for our entrance exams.</span></p>
              <p>You can't compare the educational system in accoradance to how you run your country. BTW isn't it suppose to be Oxford or something? UK's educational system maybe better than ours, but i can say that Tony Blair screwed up by assisting the american in Iraq.</p>
              <p>~<span style="color: #000000;">I believe a person should be paid
                                      for his position and responsibility.</span></p>
              <p>A useless person is a person who can't show results</p>
              <p>A responsible person who have a high rank but can't show result is still a useless person</p>
              <p>Do you want to use your tax money to pay a useless person?</p>
              <p>~<span style="color: #000000;">Are you blind? HDB, GST, ERP,
                                      Petrol Tax, COE, excessive Electricity Tariffs, Hospital Charges,
                                      etc.</span></p>
              <p>Yes, it does seem that they are trying to suck out our money. But there is still reasons behind the all these charges. ( though i hate paying them :P)</p>
              <p>~The cost of living is many times less than Singapore.</p>
              <p>Of course! Their average pay is also lesser than SG's.</p>
              <p>~<span style="color: #000000;">Seriously, you don't need much
                                      intellect to run Singapore, turn it to a stricter police state,
                                      limit human rights and during election time buy the electorate by
                                      giving out Singapore Shares.</span></p>
              <p>Is it? So are you telling me that you have the capability to run this country?</p>
              <p>~<span style="color: #000000;">You don't have to fool everyone, you
                                      just need to fool the poor, the old, and the stupid, because
                                      they are the most vulnerable. Afew thousand dollars would buy their
                                      vote.</span></p>
              <p>The poor, old and stupid have brains too you know. You'll be shocked when you see how they utilise them.</p>
              <p>~<span style="color: #000000;">So does this mean that ALL
                                      Singaporeans have BMWs and Notebooks? What you are seeing is just a
                                      segment of the population, it is in no way representative of the
                                      whole population.</span></p>
              <p>Yes and No. This doesn't mean all Sgeans. But it isn't a segment, it's the majority of the population.</p>
              <p>Go down any road, except backstreets, and you can find a least one subaru, evo, bm, mec or other fancy cars.</p>
              <p>Go ard and ask any teen if they have a hp. I did a survey due to a project last year and found out that 7 out of 10 teens have hp. The number shuld have increased by now.</p>
              <p>~<span style="color: #000000;">Don't need to think who you are, I
                                      already know who you are. <img src="../../../images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></span></p>
              <p>I'll take that as a compliment :)</p>
              <p>There are some problems with the colouring, like half-way though run out of colour, sry folks gotta strain your eyes a little.</p>

              <p>I just wonder alot by reading all these posts. Yes, LKY did alot of good for Singapore as Tun Perak did for Malacca. Then you have mercenaries aka FT coming in. And when Tun Perak died , Malacca started declining because he didn't pass the reins down properly to have a stranglehold on power. Is Singapore going the same way too?</p>
              <p>I applaud LKY on how he runs around the world on Singaporean business despite his age . However how much use is it if he keeps running the country behind the scene when his son should be taking on the reins and doing what he does? LKY should just stop what he is doing now and enjoy his golden years. At least if LHL makes a mistake , he still can consult daddy on how to fix it . Not just let daddy run about when it is his job to do so. I worry about the succession issue when LKY does die.</p>

              <p><br> Russia, like other oil rich middle east countries, are nations
              which are more recession proof than others during the time of high
              energy prices. What Singapore government is trying to do is to
              diversify our risk so that during time of recession, our country
              will still have foreign investments coming into Singapore, because
              foreign investment create jobs.</p>
              <p>Singapore and GCC in the mist of concluding a
              free trade agreement, while recently we have seen an influx of
              big spending Russian tourists coming to singapore for holiday and
              seek medical cares.</p>
              <p>Beside that, Singapore government is also trying to encourage
              Russia to engage East Asia, because a strong
              and stable Asia will benefit Singapore. I am sure the
              business delegate who joined LKY for this trip will
              also have their own agenda.</p>
              <p>If I am a businessman from Russia, I will feel honored to be
              able to host LKY at my country and listen to what he has to say
              about my country and the region. I will also admire him for making
              time to attend this event which was planned way before his wife is
              sick and the court case with Dr. Chee. Plus I will also
              admire the fitness of this 85 year old man, his quick thinking
              and knowledge.  </p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff6600;">Law is a deterrent to corruption,
              not money, which is the initiator to corruption. <strong>Ask
              yourself this, if your own child steals $1,000 from you. Do you
              give him $2,000 to prevent him from stealing from you again; or do
              you explain to him his actions and give him
              punishment ?</strong></span></p>
              <p>Firstly, you must ask yourself why your child want to steal? Is
              it purely greed? Or is it because you've not been giving him pocket
              money?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff6600;">That's why you need CPIB to be
              reporting directly to an independant President, instead of
              reporting to the Prime Minister.</span></p>
              <p>This point i agree with you totally. However, i can predict the
              "independant President" part will be a little hard to get.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff6600;">Of course if all the CEO in the
              world thinks like LKY or LHL, then they will be paying money
              in excess of the actual rate to the management team, so
              that they won't be corrupt.</span></p>
              <p>Well, i find that your views lack evidence despite showing your
              strong understanding about our nation's politics. If you're going
              to accuse someone of something, make it a point to have backups,
              reliable ones rather than the usual ERP etc.</p>

              they have anti corruption laws in Thailand? Is it strictly enforced

              <p>Every country have one, even nigeria. It is suppose to be
              "strictly enforced" though, cause no government is going say it is
              corrupted.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #000000;">~Maybe they should follow the actions of the

If you have any experience in international trade and business, you wont be so crazy as to suggest a teleconferencing as a substitute to establish bilateral ties between 2 nations with extremely different language and culture.

              <p>I truly admire your guts for knowing nuts.</p>

              <p>The above points are irrelevant . Irrelevancy has no importance. You don't send two ministers with experience in running Singapore to one country for the obvious reasons. MM or SM could have gone with George Yeo. If anything happens and both are gone - you still have one as a backup to mentor the next generation. Furthermore LKY is more important as a mentor than his son as a PM- anything happens to LHL - groom the next PM lor.</p>

              <p>Your points were irrelevant. Your answers were irrelevant.</p>
              <p>Let me simplify it for it.  If you actually read about social healthcare cost , the TS stated that the government are caretakers and cannot spend too much of taxpayers' money on health and welfare. I am questioning why  are we paying the ministers so much from taxpayers' money. It could be re-directed into more appropriate needs like health and welfare.</p>
              <p>You cannot isolate one thing from the other when we are talking about governance of a country and health care . All runs together. Take UK's example : NHS was in absolute crap and verging bankruptcy but it bounced back because of the change in all  policy directions. Health can be basically used as the reflection of a country's socioeconomic status  and directly dependent on the government's policies. <strong>If the government pays its ministers based on the value and talents they bring into economic well being of the country and prides itself on bringing affordable health to all Singaporeans , then health of the citizens are one of their performance measures. </strong></p>
              <p>Take the government's advice yourself: Think out of the box , or has the education system failed you as well?</p>
              <p>You come up with the tendency to insult like deerhunter. It makes me think whether you both are one and the same or just another lot who thinks that just because the government says so ,it must be right. You took Jojo's words about the flight class out of context as well.</p>
