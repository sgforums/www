              </div>
              <div class="post-body entry-content"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-style: italic;">extracted from The Straits Times - June 6, 08</span><br><br>Many parents feel stressed when their children sit for high-stakes milestone exams like the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE) or the O and A levels.<br><br>Many schools use shock scare tactics that are remarkably out of date. I'm talking about the habit of many schools to set mid-year examination papers of an unduly high difficulty level.<br><br>One parent cited her daughter's experience in an all-girls school with a Maths paper set at such a difficult level that half the class flunked. Concerned about the impact of this on students' motivation levels, she wrote: "I appeal to the Ministry of Education to compare the disparity between the simplicity of published primary Maths textbooks and worksheets with the difficulty of exam papers set by the schools.<br><br>Many schools set mid-year exam papers at an unrealistically high level of difficulty, deliberately to "jolt" the students and parents into a state of panic to work harder for the PSLE or O level exam. When the preliminary exams roll around later this year, the same pattern will repeat itself.<br><br>Thousands of students will be in tears over unwanted failing grades. Thousands of parents' stress levels will rise,fearing their children will do as badly in the PSLE or O levels, as they did for their prelims.<br><br>I am not a pedagogist, but it seems sheer bad educational practice to deliberately set an exam paper that seeks to fail most students.<br><br>That is not education; that is a psychological manipulation of a rather negative and perverse nature.<br><br>Schools justify it by saying that a little bit of failure spurs students to try harder. The practice results in better grades, they may argue. But people who argue forget the impact of repeated failure on a child's motivation and self esteem.<br><br>Some principals and teachers who use this "fail-them" exam scare tactic will point out that it has worked for years and raised the school's average scores in PSLE.<br><br>My retort to that is simple :<br><br>Your school's aggregate average may improve, but how many vulnerable children's self-esteem have you destroyed in the process?<br><br>And just as pertinently, how many children's zest for learning have you destroyed? And how many individual students end up doing worse, not better, because of anxiety and stress?</span></strong></div>

              <p>Look at other<strong> developed</strong> countries, their political climate change once in a while and still they are surviving . Don't look down on your fellow Singaporeans who present a different view of how the country can be better ran as pigs who know nuts.</p>
              <p>Do you think the ministers really  know how to run <strong>everything</strong> ? They depend on the civil service and consultants to carry out and advise them on their policies.  When LKY first started, he had to invite military advisers from Israel to set up Singapore's defence , a dutch economist to draw up plans for Singapore's economic future and train his new party how to run a country.</p>
              <p>Stagnancy breeds complacency . Just like how stagnant water breeds a crapload of dengue carrying mosquitoes. So you really don't want a whole parliament with members of the same party all the time. You want someone to challenge their policies and present another opinion.</p>

              <p>Yawn, lionnoisy deserves what he gets. When you play with the bull, sometimes you get the horn. At the very least lionnoisy ought to be able to hold his own when people start to play the game he is playing, but apparently he is incapable of that.</p>
              <p>What more is there to add to the subject when you have a deerhunter getting pummeled badly? More nails into the coffin? More replies from recently created counter-insurgency accounts?</p>
