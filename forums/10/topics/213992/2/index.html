            <div class='col-md body'>Very, Very well written, Robertteh, Please allow my 2 cents worth addition to your well-worded statement. As long as the majority of the population are too young to know and too old to remember, this scenario will be status quo here in Singapore and it is really sad and disappointing. We always talk about the Separation ACT but we never touch,  NEVER EVER touch on the INDEPENDENCE ACT. Maybe the new Ministers or someone here would care to tell us more about the INDEPENDENCE ACT (About the British Law of the KTM Land and about the Railway line operated by Malaysia all these years faithfully to assist the POOR to visit their relatives in the Mainland.)<br></div>
