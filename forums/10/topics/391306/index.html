              <div id="story_content"><br>
              <p><strong>Like a relentless tsunami, high-tech gimmicks from abroad keep flooding Singapore to the detriment of homegrown innovative capabilities.</strong></p>
              <p>AS ONE born here seven decades ago, I have been watching the quickened pace of new digital imports with a tinge of anxiety about Singapore’s future.</p>
              <p>Take the latest high-tech Hollywood film <em>Avatar</em> that is mesmerising large audiences here with its awe-inspiring scenes of an imaginary planet.</p>
              <p>In just two weeks, it had grossed a record-shattering US$1bil (RM3.38bil) worldwide. My family of four paid S$40 (RM97) for two-and-a-half hours – roughly what an unskilled worker earns in a whole day.</p>
              <p>Months earlier, Singapore was invaded by the Internet-phone, or I-Phone, with thousands of young people queuing up for hours and paying top dollars to lay their hands on one.</p>
              <p>These were the latest digital innovations to hit our shores, some of them at heart-wringing costs.</p>
              <p>The film, like the I-Phone, is a breakthrough in marketable ideas that are lapped up by young Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>These kids are spending thousands of dollars on Blackberries, mini-computers and other mobile gimmicks to download music or network with each other. Many are teens who are still years away from their first job.</p>
              <p>These are stuff they insist on having for their education – or so they say – and so papa and mama, including the poor, will have to finance it. An endless flow, because technology goes on and on.</p>
              <p>Such imports do not necessarily pose great worries if Singaporeans can find benefit from using them.</p>
              <p>“It is a drain because we ourselves lack innovation or the means to pay for it,” said a father of two teenage sons.</p>
              <p>In short, Singapore’s move towards a higher-skill economy (to counter threats from countries like China and India) has fallen short of success.</p>
              <p>In a competitive world when it comes to fresh ideas, Singaporeans – with their regulated, structured upbringing – are hugely handicapped. They are too compliant to venture into the unconventional.</p>
              <p>As I watched <em>Avatar’s</em> widescreen magic, gripping my chair as its awesome plants and animals leapt at me, I thought of our own fledgling movie industry. They are separated by at least a generation.</p>
              <p>Innovations and inventions are not just about high-faluting subjects like science and bio-medicine that postgraduates can deliver. More often than not, it involves turning simple ideas into what the public wants.</p>
              <p>In 1993, the world was wowed by a film called <em>Jurassic Park</em> that transformed the movie business and almost killed off the industry in Hong Kong.</p>
              <p>“After seeing this film who wants to watch ours?” a producer then asked. But some producers re-adapted, moved West and flourished.</p>
              <p>On top of the pack were the Japanese and Koreans – and the older Bollywood – who succeeded in creating at least regional best-sellers with their own stories and cultures.</p>
              <p>After returning from two years’ work as a journalist in Hong Kong, I wrote that with its <em>laissez faire</em> it was 10 years ahead of Singapore in the fields of movies, music and fashion.</p>
              <p>Today the gap may have widened. Many of its top stars and producers have moved to California or improved at home to produce some world-beaters.</p>
              <p>Singapore’s film-makers have made strides in the past decade, but they are too hobbled by regulations and sufficient talent to appeal to a world audience.</p>
              <p>“Ours is still a cottage industry, not a global one,” said a retired cinema executive. “The advances in other countries are making our deficiencies even starker,” he added.</p>
              <p>Even the Indonesians and Thais have produced horror movies with popular foreign appeal. I noticed they had even come up with their own Jet Li-type heroes, complete with lightning fast stunts.</p>
              <p>The imported innovations do add value to our lives, but they have also made us more conscious of our creativity backwardness despite our huge investment on education.</p>
              <p>I must admit that they have made me a little envious of the people who dare to experiment in, and come up with, winning tricks.</p>
              <p>Singapore not only lacks that but is becoming too hooked on expensive Western products and services at a time when its own innovative competitiveness is dropping.</p>
              <p>Even IT manufacturing, the mainstay of the economy, is facing possible extinction as factories move to cheaper countries.</p>
              <p>Among the top 500 fastest growth tech companies in Asia Pacific countries, only two – or 0.4% – are in Singapore, compared with 99 in Taiwan, it was recently reported.</p>
              <p>The republic appears to be losing some of its technological capacities.</p>
              <p>For example, Seagate, the world’s largest maker of hard-disk drives, will close one of its factories and move to China by the end of this year.</p>
              <p>Some 2,000 employees, many of them engineers, will be retrenched. Another giant, Motorola, shut its plant in 2008.</p>
              <p>Earlier Chartered, the world’s second-largest semiconductor firm with nine chip plants spread across Singapore, Germany and the US, was taken over by an Abu Dhabi company, after years of losses.</p>
              <p>Three other local tech firms were delisted in the last two years.</p>
              <p>Many fear the relocations may signal the end of the republic’s role as a supplier of value-added computer parts to the world.</p>
              <p>A post-crisis economic review is in progress to see what else Singapore can do to earn a living in the world.</p>
              <p>Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong cautioned his people not to expect a return of the pre-crisis growth rates of 7% or 8%. Instead, he expects from now on, Singapore should settle for 3% to 5% a year.</p>
              <p>This means that value-added expansion in future will come mostly from innovative Singaporeans or companies, rather than by just providing service to the region</p>
