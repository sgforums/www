            <div class='col-md body'>New York has been known as a city that is bringing down its crime rate but it seems to also pick up some characteristics of our country along with it.<br><br>The new yorkers are hopping mad. City authorities are on a ticket writing spree such as this woman who spoke loudly to her neighbour and got fined.<br><br>This man who had to shell out a US$100($173) fine for sitting on a milke crate.<br><br>There was even a case of  a 18 years old and 6 months pregnant Crystal Rivera who was fined $US 50 after sitting on subway stairs to catch her breath.<br><br>Carrying an open bottle of water onto a bus or being a man in a playground without a child can get you fined too.<br><br>Parking fines are also increased at more than $100 each.<br><br>And the Americans say we're a "Fine" City!<br><br>To read the exact article,it's on pg 36 of the New Paper Thursday June 12, 2003.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Read that article, I bet those in the US who criticised Singapore as a fine city will not stand up and admit to it now.<br><br>Actually, Singapore's reputation as a "Fine City" is a bit unjust now. I was in Melbourne for 4 years and trust, me, there are fines for just about every damn thing too, eg fail to put on a helmet when riding a bicycle and you're liable for a A$20(A$1 = S$1.156) fine when you meet the Aussie bicycle cops(man some of those sheila cops look HOT!!) although, to be honest, you deserve everything you get when you ride a bike without a helmet.<br><br>Cheat on public transport fares and you get slapped with a A$500 fine. It was A$100 when I first went to Melbourne, increased to A$200 some time after I got there and increased to its level now just before I left. And the inspectors work in teams of 4-8 and have been known to arm-lock and physically restrain fare cheats. And you thought those uncles and aunties who take your ez-link cards are draconian huh?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
