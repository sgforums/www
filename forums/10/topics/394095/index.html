              <p>Notice Singapore have also fired all of its big guns - low interest rates, sheer population number increase, Increase in military spending that also increases GDP figures, running into government deficits, enormous stimulus packages to narrowly avoid a recession. When the next crisis comes, and it will soon, we will have no bullets left to defend ourselves.</p>
              <p>Our tourism industry is healthy only to the extent that there is so much liquidity. What then when this liquidity party stops? And it will have to sooner or later. I see tough times ahead that our 'elites' will sooner or later have to face</p>

              <p>The <strong>Rogers International Commodity Index</strong> ( <strong>RICI</strong> ) is a composite, USD based, total return index, designed by <a title="Jim Rogers" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Jim_Rogers"><span style="color: #002bb8;">Jim Rogers</span></a> in 1996/1997. The first fund began on July 31, 1998.</p>
              <p>The initial value of RICI was set at July 31, 1998 to 1000. Since then up to June 30, 2009, the index has grown by more than 190.8% to a value of 2908.59. <sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="http://sgforums.com/forums/10/topics/#cite_note-1"><span style="color: #002bb8;"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></span></a></sup> The RICI has been known to have higher compound returns than other commodity indexes since 1 August 1998.</p>

              <p><br>yes, we are innovative, we are cheap but certainly cheaper than the westerner, we might not have that financial muscle create a center here, but we can try to be better. And because we lack of natural resources, our peoples are the most important resources.</p>
              <p>Because we are brought up in a society of inward and academy base education which base on result and results, we fail to create innovator, we failed miserably to take risk and put failure as a shame to family, school, mates etc etc. That concept have to change, we must not be so academy and allow failure to progress.</p>
              <p>To be the financial centre, we need the right insitutions here, the right people (no corruption or least corruption) to sell our shenton way to them, we want peoples doing business in China or other part of Asia, to have their account department and HQ here, we can provide auditing just next door, banking just a few step away and good entertainment in a world class way. And most important, a stable and peaceful environment. We are doing it, and we can do it.</p>
              <p>In globalise world, vessels still move, product still move, and infact more faster and more demanding, and our port provide that fast, easy and convience way of trading for our customers. We are glad that our neighbour countries are not able to function that well, must we must not be arrogant and think that they cannot beat us, we must alway be on our toes to be cheaper in term of productivity, better, in term of quality and faster, in term of time. The only differences between Singapore, malaysia, indonesia or thailand is that in business, Singapore walk the talk, most other just talk only.

              <p>First of all, MNC dont really need any Asian HQ anymore. They are disintegrating into smaller business units and they are discentralised with local country management to cope with the growing speed. Spore HQ concept is good for the old day not now.</p>
              <p>Even if they wish to create any HQ, Hong Kong has more advantage than Spore..</p>
              <p>I operates many goldmines and iron-ores in Russian, China and Indonesian and many are listed, each time when my bankers choose a location beside Singapore for listing, it break my heart as I love this country will surely will return for retirement oneday.</p>

              <p>Notice Singapore have also fired all of its big guns - low
              interest rates, sheer population number increase, Increase in
              military spending that also increases GDP figures, running into
              government deficits, enormous stimulus packages to narrowly avoid a
              recession. When the next crisis comes, and it will soon, we will
              have no bullets left to defend ourselves.</p>
              <p>Our tourism industry is healthy only to the extent that there is
              so much liquidity. What then when this liquidity party stops? And
              it will have to sooner or later. I see tough times ahead that our
              'elites' will sooner or later have to face</p>

              <p>yes, looks like you can see through all the illusions and delusions of economic recovery................</p>
              <p>but the elites don't have to face anything, worst-case scenario LKY and family will resign and abandon ship...........maybe migrate to Hawaii and enjoy life .</p>

              <p><br>yes, we are innovative, we are cheap but certainly cheaper than the westerner, we might not have that financial muscle create a center here, but we can try to be better. And because we lack of natural resources, our peoples are the most important resources.</p>
              <p>Because we are brought up in a society of inward and academy base education which base on result and results, we fail to create innovator, we failed miserably to take risk and put failure as a shame to family, school, mates etc etc. That concept have to change, we must not be so academy and allow failure to progress.</p>
              <p>To be the financial centre, we need the right insitutions here, the right people (no corruption or least corruption) to sell our shenton way to them, we want peoples doing business in China or other part of Asia, to have their account department and HQ here, we can provide auditing just next door, banking just a few step away and good entertainment in a world class way. And most important, a stable and peaceful environment. We are doing it, and we can do it.</p>
              <p>In globalise world, vessels still move, product still move, and infact more faster and more demanding, and our port provide that fast, easy and convience way of trading for our customers. We are glad that our neighbour countries are not able to function that well, must we must not be arrogant and think that they cannot beat us, we must alway be on our toes to be cheaper in term of productivity, better, in term of quality and faster, in term of time. The only differences between Singapore, malaysia, indonesia or thailand is that in business, Singapore walk the talk, most other just talk only. And that is the plus point for us to upgrade our +cost. The other most important aspect that Singaporeans have to withhold is "TRUST"</p>
