A bus system overhaul was announced last week.<br><br>When the plans come to fruition in 2020, there will be one MRT station within five minutes' walk in the city, in a network that will become denser than Tokyo's.<br><br>Outside the city, more areas will be served by high-speed MRT.<br><br>There are currently 138 kilometres of rail lines. By 2020, authorities hope to double the network length and expect it to carry three times as many journeys, from today's 1.4 million a day to 4.6 million in 2020.<br><br>Two new lines will be built.<br><br>The Thomson Line, to be ready by 2018, will run from Marina Bay through the Central Business District, all the way up to Ang Mo Kio and Woodlands. It will connect to another new Line, the Eastern Region Line, at Marina Bay.<br><br>The Eastern Region Line, to be ready by 2020, will serve areas such as Siglap and Marine Parade.<br><br>Existing lines will also be extended.<br><br>The North-South Line will be extended one kilometre south to serve the Marina Bay area developments while the East-West Line will be extended another 14 kilometres west into Tuas.<br><br>To avoid long waiting time and crowded trains, there will be 93 additional train trips during the morning and evening peaks.<br><br>The authorities will work with SMRT to increase the number of trains and to improve the infrastructure over the next four years to reduce waiting time from the current 2.5-4 minutes to two minutes at busy stations during peak periods.<br><br>"When all this is done, what will we have? We hope we would have transformed the public transport system... And by doing so, Singaporeans will indeed consider the public transport system as their other car," said the transport minister.<br><br>Completion dates of the various lines are also being fast-forwarded. Part of the Circle Line which was due to open from 2010 onwards, will now open in mid-2009. Completion of the Downtown Line will also be brought forward by two years to 2016.<br><br>Mr Lim made the announcement when he visited Kim Chuan Depot on Friday morning.<br><br>Click here for the Transport Minister's speech on expansion of Singapore's MRT network.<br><br>Share your views and comments on the latest transport proposals here.<br><br>- CNA/ir/ac </blockquote><img src="http://www.straitstimes.com/STI/STIMEDIA/image/20080125/ln-sg-rail.jpg"></div>

The Government has given the go-ahead for the TSL to be built by 2018, and the ERL by 2020.<br><br>Mr Lim said the TSL and ERL will shorten journey times and significantly enhance the connectivity of the rail network. Commuters staying in Sin Ming, for example, can save 20 minutes out of their current 45-minute journey to the city, whereas a trip from Marine Parade to Marina Bay on the ERL would take about 20 minutes, almost as fast as travelling by car.<br><br>New extensions to North-South and East-West Lines (see attached maps)<br><br>The North-South and East-West Lines will also be extended and should be completed around 2015.<br><br>The North-South Line, which now ends at the Marina Bay station in the south, will be extended 1-km southwards to serve upcoming developments in the southern Marina Bay area, such as the new cruise terminal in Marina South. The East-West Line will be extended by another 14km into Tuas.<br><br>Presently, a commuter who lives in Clementi and takes the MRT to work in Tuas has to alight at Boon Lay station and then take a 35-minute bus ride to get to his workplace. With the new Tuas Extension that brings the East-West line right into the heart of Tuas, more of the journey will be on the high speed MRT, reducing his journey time by 20 minutes.<br><br>Doubling of rail network by 2020 (see attached map)<br><br>Mr Lim said the new rail lines will cost some $20 billion to build, over and above the $20 billion that government has already committed for the on-going Boon Lay Extension (BLE), the Circle Line (CCL) and the Downtown Line (DTL).<br>......<br>'Together with the rail lines now under construction, the new rail lines will double our network from today's 138km to 278km in 2020. We expect our rail network to carry 3 times as many journeys, rising from today's 1.4 million a day to 4.6 million in 2020.'<br><br>He added that many more people will be served by the MRT, and they will be able to use it to get to many more places.<br><br>The density of the rail network will increase by 60 per cent, from 31 to 51 km per million population by 2020, comparable to cities like New York and London, and surpassing Hong Kong and Tokyo.<br><br>Turning to the existing rail lines, Mr Lim said train ridership is increasing steadily and commuters have said that they are feeling the squeeze, especially on the North-South and East-West lines.<br><br>'Now, we are far from the crowded conditions of Tokyo trains, which Mr Norman Chong, a Singaporean who has lived in Tokyo for 10 years, describes as being 'so packed that bodies are crushed against one another.' He calls it his 'regular morning massage',' said the Minister. 'Other MRT users have likened the average peak period loading on our trains to an off-peak crowd in Shanghai.'<br><br>He said LTA is closely monitoring the passenger loading on trains.<br><br>To ensure a more comfortable ride for commuters, LTA has worked with the train operators to run 93 additional train trips per week during the morning and evening periods from February 2008 on the North-South East-West and the North-East lines. For commuters, this will mean less crowded trains and a reduction in waiting time by about 10 to 15 per cent during peak hours.<br><br>Additionally, the carrying capacity of the North-South and East-West Lines will be expended, with more trains to be added.<br><br>When completed in about four years' time, their carrying capacity will be increased by a further 15 per cent, and commuters can look forward to shorter peak waiting times of two minutes, compared to the current 2.5 to 4.5 minutes at stretches that experience heavy loading, and an even more comfortable ride, assured Mr Lim.<br><br>DTL 3 to be brought forward by 2 years<br><br>The Minister also announced that Stage 3 of the Downtown Line (DTL) will now be completed two years earlier - from 2018 to 2016 - to benefit residents of Bedok Reservoir and Tampines.<br><br>It will be ready just one year after that of DTL Stage 2 serving the Bukit Timah corridor.<br><br>Earlier opening of Circle Line in 2009<br><br>He also have another piece of good news.<br><br>The Circle Line (CCL), which was due to open from 2010 onwards, will now open its Stage 3 segment in mid-2009 to benefit residents in the north and north-east.<br><br>This CCL segment connects Bishan station on the North-South Line and Serangoon station on NEL and opens up multiple new connections for residents in the north and north-east.<br><br>With the CCL 3, Serangoon residents will take only 25 minutes to get to Yishun by transferring to the North-South line at Bishan station, compared to 45 minutes by bus or by taking the NEL all the way to Dhoby Ghaut before transferring to the North-South line.<br><br>As for residents staying in Marymount, Lorong Chuan and Bartley, they will enjoy more seamless and direct travel to the city and other parts once CCL 3 commences operation.<br><br>More Circle Line stations will be opened<br><br>Commuters can also look forward to more stations on the Circle Line. This will enhance the reach and connectivity of the Circle Line, and allow many more people to benefit from the MRT.<br><br>'We had earlier decided to build the Thomson and West Coast stations as shell stations and fit them out only when there are sufficient developments around them. As the pace of development around these stations is picking up, LTA will now fit out these stations and open them together with the other CCL stations,' said Mr Lim.<br><br>'To enhance the accessibility of the Marina Bay area to the rest of the island, LTA will also build and open the Marina Bay station as part of the CCL extension beyond Bayfront station in 2012.'<br><br>'With all these developments that I have highlighted, commuters can look forward to new extensions or stages of new lines opening almost every other year until 2020.' </blockquote></div>

Most of the victims were in Aceh.<br><br>But Rice said Singapore remains within range of shockwaves from any earthquake off Sumatra's western coast, where major quakes occur every 200 to 300 years.<br><br>A quake measuring 9.0 on the Richter scale occurred on the western coast of Sumatra -- the point where quake shockwaves would most strongly affect Singapore -- in 1833.<br><br>Rice is in Singapore to deliver a public lecture at the National University of Singapore (NUS) about his studies of the Great Sumatran Fault, which runs through the Indonesian island.<br><br>While some research on earthquakes has been done by the civil engineering department at NUS, these were mostly one-off projects.<br><br>"There is no cohesive national thrust in looking into the effects of earthquakes," said Lee Fook Hou, an associate professor at the school's civil engineering department.<br><br>Rice said a sustained study was necessary because Singapore's situation is "roughly analogous" to that of Mexico City, which was devastated by an earthquake in 1985 because it was built on an old lakebed.<br><br>"You have extensive areas of marine clays, soft sediments, reclaimed land and you're going to have more," he said.<br><br>Singapore should not rely on its experience as a modern nation to think it was immune from the threat of a major earthquake off Sumatra's western coast, Rice said.<br><br>Rice noted that US scientists learned that Los Angeles was built on "terribly treacherous ground" only in the 1970s as the faults under the city had been inactive following a big earthquake on the San Andreas fault in 1857.<br><br>"It's just what happens when you put cities up fast -- you don't get a good picture of the seismic environment that you live in," Rice said.<br><br>Source: Agence France-Presse</div>
