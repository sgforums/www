              <p>Thursday, 04 September 2008	
              <img src="http://www.yoursdp.org/images/stories/people/CSJ_booklaunch_2008.JPG" border="1" alt="" width="150" align="right"><em>Singapore Democrats</em><br><br><em>We published <a href="http://www.yoursdp.org/index.php/news/singapore/997-has-singapore-been-cheated">Part I</a> of Dr Chee Soon Juan's speech launching his new book </em><em>A
              Nation Cheated at the SDP's Annual Dinner on 31 Aug 08. Below is the
              second and concluding part where he talks about how civil disobedience
              has helped bring about political change and that its application needs
              to be stepped up.</em></p>
              <blockquote><strong>Singaporeans not interested in human rights?</strong><br><br>The
              Government insists that we Singaporeans exist only to make money. Human
              rights are not in our makeup. To Singaporeans, even Martian values are
              less alien than democratic ones.<br>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">This really seemed the case because for
              years when I talked about protests, people looked at me as if I was a
              raving lunatic. I'm sure many still do. Here is this island paradise
              that works and here is this green-eyed monster wanting to tear
              everything down.<br><br>And when I embarked on a course of civil
              disobedience, even some of my more progressive associates thought that
              I had really lost it, that I had gone too far. When I stood up at
              Raffles Place during lunch nearly ten years ago on 28 December 1999 and
              made a speech without a permit, I was roundly and almost universally
              castigated for being a radical who could not see that Singapore was
              different and that Singaporeans were not interested in their civil and
              political rights.<br><br>Mr Lee Kuan Yew said then that if we allow
              such activity on the streets, "there'll be pandemonium. We are not that
              kind of society."<br><br>Several months later he was confronted in
              Davos, Switzerland if my memory serves me correctly during the World
              Economic Forum by William Safire, a <em>New York Times</em> journalist
              and former speech writer for Richard Nixon, who asked him point blank
              whether he would allow free speech in Singapore. The MM said he would
              consider it. <br><br><img src="http://www.yoursdp.org/images/stories/people/csj_rafflesplace.jpg" border="1" alt="" align="left">Whether
              he was caught by surprise and didn't want to look bad and so said that
              he would consider it, no one knows. But shortly thereafter Speakers'
              Corner at Hong Lim Park was established.<br><br>That gave me the first
              glimpse of how civil disobedience could work. I knew that with the
              right strategy, we could win or, at the very least, extract concessions
              from the Government. <br><br>I didn't stop there because restricting
              free speech to a grass patch beside a police station was a human rights
              joke. And so we pressed on, now focusing also on freedom of assembly,
              that is, the right to stage peaceful protests. <br><br>Again I was
              chastised and called all sorts of names from being a show-off pulling
              on publicity stunts to playing up the to the West to being a traitor,
              undermining the interests of Singapore. But I knew deep down in my
              heart, I was right and they were wrong. <br><br>All through this, a
              few people remained steadfast with me. Gandhi Ambalam was one of them.
              Together we persisted and we fought on. Slowly our numbers began to
              grow.<br><br><strong>A stunning admission</strong><br><br>Now years
              later and after several arrests and prison terms, the Government has
              finally acknowledged the moral imperative of the freedoms of speech and
              assembly. Last week, the <em>Straits Times</em> reported:</p>
              <blockquote><em>Asked
              by an undergraduate if the move towards more political openness was
              done out of 'necessity', Mr Goh replied: 'Necessity, in a way. Because
              to be relevant as a government, you must know the aspirations of the
              people.</em><br> <br></blockquote>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">What are these aspirations? He answered the question in his next sentence which is a stunning admission of the reality:</p>
              <blockquote><em>'We can control you, oppress you. But we'd lose you - you'll move elsewhere. So we have to move with the times.'</em><br></blockquote>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><br>He
              hit the proverbial nail right smack in the middle of the head. Mr Goh
              has acknowledged that the aspirations of the people are to live in a
              society where they are not controlled and oppressed, in other words
              they want a democratic Singapore. What's all this talk about
              Singaporeans not being interested in human rights?<br><br>What was
              political and social taboo only a couple of years ago is now accepted
              by the Government as a necessity. This admission is much more
              significant than the Government's decision to allow protests at Hong
              Lim Park because for the first time the PAP has conceded the legitimacy
              of public demonstrations.<br><br>But it wasn't put on a platter for us. We had to fight for it. We had to sacrifice for it.<br><br>I
              tell you this not to claim credit or to gloat for there is nothing to
              gloat about because nothing has been achieved yet. I tell you this
              because I want you to see that the PAP is not this immovable wall that
              we keep talking about and we are certainly not the eggs. I want to
              banish the unfortunate and long-held perception that it is no use going
              aganist the PAP because we just cannot win.<br><br>Martyn See's
              production of his films despite the prohibition of the Films Act is
              another case in point. It started it 1996 where I wanted to make a
              video about the SDP and we produced a 20-minute documentary. There was
              no law against that but the Government banned it anyway and thereafter
              passed legislation to outlaw political videos.<br><br>Martyn challenged
              that law by breaking it. Today many can see the absurdity of the law
              and the real intention behind it and the PAP is under pressure to amend
              it.<br><br>The truth of the matter is that the Government can be made
              to back down. You have seen with your own eyes that civil disobedience,
              if carried out in an astute and disciplined manner, works.<br><br>Civil
              disobedience is not just about breaking laws will-nilly and challenging
              the authorities on a whim and fancy. There are moral considerations and
              the responsibility is a heavy one to bear. Civil disobedience is not
              about unruliness and anarchy. It is a form of civil action that
              requires strict disciple and sacrifice on the part of the people who
              advocate and practice it.<br><br>It is an effective method of compeling autocrats to listen to the people, of wrenching power back to the people.  <br><br>Confronted
              with an authoritarian regime that is unwilling to reason and be
              persuaded to mend its ways, civil disobedience becomes a necessary
              weapon and, I repeat, it works.<br><br><strong>Change is afoot<br></strong><br>It
              works because of a few factors are at play one of which is that times
              are changing. The dusk of an old era is passing on and the dawn of a
              new one is upon us. Change is waiting to be born. The Government knows
              that. It knows that change is inevitable.<br><br>But if we don't act
              now, nothing will happen. If we don't become the deliverers of change,
              then change will be stillborn. This is because there are still some
              very powerful forces against change and power never concedes without
              demand. <br><br>In other words, people like you and me who want to see
              change must demand loudly and clearly for reform. We cannot just be
              spectators. We must be the advocates and the agents of change.<br><br>The
              time is right and the conditions favour the reformers. We have the New
              Media, we have an educated population, and we have the fading away of
              an old era. These factors are coming together and they spell change.<br><br>The
              biggest, and possibly fatal, mistake that we in the pro-democracy camp
              can make is to freeze at this point. At a juncture in history when we
              have momentum and favourable conditions on our side, the worst thing to
              do is nothing. If we do that we will lose the initiative and the
              progress that we have made will be irretrievably lost.<br><br>No, there
              is not a moment to tarry. Now is the time to press home our advantage.
              Now is the time to ensure that we consolidate on our gains and push
              further into our opponent's territory. We must let the PAP know
              unequivocally that it either opens up the political process or it as a
              Government will become irrelevant.<br><br>We must seize the day. <em>Carpe diem</em>!
              Make that change that we are all capable of, that we all have a duty to
              carry out, that we all owe to ourselves and our children to effect. <br><br><em>Carpe diem</em>! Seize the day!<br><br><strong>Challenging the laws<br></strong><br><img src="http://www.yoursdp.org/images/stories/15mar08arrest15.jpg" border="1" alt="" width="250" align="right">In
              the weeks ahead, 17 of my colleagues and I will face a trial for taking
              part in an assembly and procession without a permit. Many of us are
              prepared to go to prison. We can't wait to go to court and face the
              judge and prosecution and to tell the world how politically ridiculous
              and morally offensive this Government is. <br><br>We all know that it
              is the Government that has done wrong, not us. We are proud of what we
              have done. In fact we pledge to do it again. We may have to pay the
              price of sacrificing our liberty, but that is an honour. That is
              something we are proud of and want to tell everyone rather than hide
              it. For what can be a higher honour than to be jailed for the sake of
              justice and freedom?<br><br>This is not just false bravado. It is
              detemination and resolve borne out of an extended process of
              self-examination and confronting our own fears. <br><br>This is not
              just a political fight, it is a moral fight as well. It is a struggle
              for justice, a struggle against the preponderance of greed and
              exploitation by those who rule over us, a struggle for the lives and
              dignity of the hundreds of thousands of our fellow Singaporeans who are
              consigned to live more like serfs than citizens.<br><br><strong>We need your support<br></strong><br>But
              as clear and as determined as we are, our campaign cannot succeed
              without your support. As many activists have stepped forward, I hope
              all of you too will step forward to play your part. The more we get
              into our ranks the quicker will be the change. <br><br>The PAP is like
              the guy standing on the shore and trying to stop the tide from coming
              in. Don't stand on the sidelines. Get in and be part of the tide. Be on
              the right side of history. I tell you today that victory will be ours.
              I say this not out of hubris and cockiness but a very humble reading of
              history. No authoritarian regime will last forever and when an idea
              whose time has come no one, absolutely no one, can stop it.<br><br>We
              will be announcing a major protest-campaign hopefully in the
              not-too-distant future which will include but not be limited to the
              Speakers' Corner. We will need your support physically, financially and
              morally to make it a success.<br><br>But for tonight, I would like to
              ask you for your support. Join us, contribute financially, be on our
              mailing list and come to our meetings and functions so that together we
              can strategise our campaign which is slowly turning into a movement.<br><br>Let
              this truly be a new beginning in the chapter of Singapore's journey to
              democracy. With the advent of new technology and the determination and
              passion of democracy activists, freedom is not far away.<br><br>Now is the time to tell the Government that we want transparency, we seek accountability and we demand democracy. <br><br>It
              has been said that it is far better to light a candle than to curse the
              darkness. Light that candle in your heart and together we can make the
              flame of democracy burn brighter and ever more iridescent.<br><br>Thank
              you once again for honouring us with your presence this evening and on
              behalf of my fellow Singapore Democrats, I wish all of you the very
              best.<br><br>I leave you with this thought: "You may never know what
              results come of your action, but if you do nothing there will be no
              result." <br><br>Thank you and good night.</p>

              <p>u like!!</p>
              <p>CSJ regards <em>Lim Chin Siong</em> (Chinese: æž—æ¸…ç¥¥) as his model.</p>
              <p>LKY also regarded Lim and his buddies as model in thrifty life style.</p>
              <p>Lim would not throw himself into jail .Lim would not</p>
              <p>acted so stupid to get arrested.He had  more important</p>
              <p>missions to accmplish,not reading books in jail,dear.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The role of leader is lead outside from the jail.</p>
              <p>In SG,u cant lead from inside the jail or while u attending</p>
              <p>the hearings in court.</p>
              <p>CSJ said just one case took 5 weeks in court and he wanted</p>
              <p>his case decoupled from Uncle Yap's case.</p>
              <p>But he have few cases to attend in court!!</p>
