              <p>Dr Chee Soon Juan was interviewed by Bureau Chief Ellen Ratner on Talk
                      Radio News Service (TRNS) last night. He talked about the repression in
                      Singapore, including the use of the Internal Security Act and
                      defamation laws to silence dissent.</p>
              <p>He also called on the US not to
                      ignore human rights violations in Asia because democracy, with its
                      emphasis on transparency and accountability, and trade go together.<br> <br> TRNS broadcasts from Washington DC and New York City where it covers
                      news from the White House, US Congress and the Unted Nations.<br> <br> Listen to interview <a href="http://cdn4.libsyn.com/talkradionews/20091109SoonJuAnCheeFull.mp3?nvb=20091109223517&amp;nva=20091110224517&amp;t=049cbccbb4c3ac6f104f2">here</a>.</p>

              <p>Change must come from within. A person can only change something when he is within the system, not by shouting from the outside. To make change, make sure he is in the position to do so.</p>
              <p>He should know that people will only help you only if you're useful to them and there is nothing free in this world. Favour has to be repaid eventually.</p>
              <p>He is doing this on the pretext of helping the society but deep down it is more so for himself as his heart is full of hatred for what the Lees had done to him. All this at the expenses of the well-being of the society.</p>

              You mean as long as the US can park their naval assets in Singapore while Singapore can trade with US?? How true. US is not concerned about democracy or human rights they are concerned about themselves. They are aloud about Sang Suu Kyi simply because Myanmar is not opening up to US wishes. It's called Realpolitik Henry Kissinger is a well proponent of which.

              <p>Chee can kpkb all he wants to the US but the fact is that Obama has bigger problems - the US economy. He will probably spend what little time he has at the economic forum trying to negotiate deals beneficial to the economic needs of the US. Sad but true but the little red dot's political situation is probably not high on his to-do list. Didn't he shake lky's hand last week on TV?</p>

              <p>By your standards - CSJ should have quit long ago, and so would you.</p>
              <p>Fortunately for Singapore, CSJ is made of stronger stuff then you can possibly hope to have for your backbone.</p>
              <p>If CSJ had asked for favor from LKY to allow CSJ to enter the political system - what price do you think CSJ has to pay for that favor given by LKY to CSJ ?</p>
              <p>Should CSJ pay the price - of being blind and silent to all the PAP mistakes and bad policies to Singapore - in exchange for a seat in Parliament to change the system from within ?</p>
              <p>What has LHL changed in the Singapore SYSTEM that his father had created - even as Singaporeans have built Singapore to what it is today ?</p>
              <p>Has it not been a fact that after the 1997 economic melt-down - even as LHL boasted that he will be his own Man, and that there will be no sacred cows in his review of the SYSTEM to prepare Singapore to better cope with the next recession, all that LHL could say was that he had turned over all the stones on the road he took, inspected the stones, and feel more comfortable that some of the stones should be placed back to their original positions ?</p>
              <p>After 14 years at the helm, GCT generation has come and gone, and now the LHL generation has taken over the PAP System since 2002 - has there been any major change in the PAP System that has benefitted Singaporeans or Singapore ?</p>
              <p>It seems that with LHL's preference to leave some of the stones in their original place, change has not happened - which resulted in the worst economic recession to hit Singapore since the 1930s world economic depression.</p>
