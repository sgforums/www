            <div class='col-md body'>I know that this is a pro-Singapore forum. People discuss about how powerful the SAF is and that the SAF has twice as many planes as both Malaysia and Indonesia combine. Singapore may be a regional power in SEA but surely the SAF have some weaknesses. I mean no countries or armies in the world is perfect. Singapore can't be the best in everything in this regional. May be Malaysia or Indonesia have some military advantages over Singapore. We always talk about how good the SAF is or how hi-tech the SAF is. How about for a change we discuss about lousy the SAF is in an area which the SAF is weak in.<br><br>This is just my comment. Please don't get offended. And also please don't flame me. I meant no harm.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Of course we do have weaknesses. Most glaring of all is that we are a conscript army. Its slightly migitated by the fact that since we are all conscripts, our army's general educational level is much higher than that of others, and thus we are able to absorb what we need to learn faster. However, no matter what, having a consript army which does not live, breathe an army life will always be a disadvantage.<br>Another disadvantage is our over emphasis on educational levels in the army. I find it hard to accept that there will always be a limit to a soldier's advancement if he's less educationally qualified than others. Also, scholars and bootlickers get a high chance to go to OCS. I'm not saying that scholars should not go to OCS, what I'm saying is that a person should be evaluated not so heavily on his educational level.<br><br>(of course this has been stated in "defending the lion city', but upon entering the army, these 2 problems have become quite glaring to me)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Singapore's weaknesses include the two specified by YourFather. There are others as well:<br><br>1. Morale. We are untested in battle, and a conscript army that is unused to hardship. We have no way to see what will happen in a real war. However, Israel is similar in situation to us and fares well in war, so hopefully this will turn out OK. While everyone hates NS, it is another thing entirely when there is a fight for survival.<br><br>2. Poor anti-submarine capability. At this point, our Navy's ASW capability is substandard. Our ships are nearly deaf and poorly armed against subsurface threats. We also do not have ASW helicopters to hunt submarines (though the new Endurance ships can carry them). This will hopefully be resolved with the new Lafayette frigates and the acquisition of submarine capability (the new Sjoormens are just for training and evaluation, not war).<br><br>3. Light infantry. We are considered to have one of the best light infantry forces in the world. This is probably because most modern armies no longer employ light infantry. Considering that casualties are particularly painful to us since our soldiers are also civilians, we cannot afford to pit flesh against fire. Our infantry forces need some form of body armor and greater mobility (trucks, tracked carriers, jeeps). This will give us a tremendous edge in combat (especially close combat) and improved strategic mobility.<br><br>4. AMX13SM1. Our primary tank is now not merely a decrepit dinosaur, it is a moving deathtrap. The new light tank programme had better hurry up. I believe that the new tank should have at least the following capabilities:<br><br>A. Stabilized 105mm high velocity gun capable of being elevated for city fighting and with computer assisted targeting. 120mm gun would be even better. Decent number of ready and reserve rounds. Coaxial and commander's MGs.<br><br>B. All around protection against 30mm API and all existing LAWs, frontal protection against 105mm HEAT.<br><br>C. Mobility at least as great as the Bionix, including the ability to swim.<br><br>There are probably more, but these are the problems I can think off of the top of my head. Anyone want to add anything?</div>

We are a conscript army, and 2 1/2 years of our lives to be trained as light infantry is actually considered quite fast liao.  US 10th Mountain are practically all regulars, and they are a pretty top notch light infantry division.  We don't have the luxury to operate more mechanized infantry partly due to costs and terrain constraint.  In any case, I still feel light infantry is darned effective in urban ops.<br><br>SM1, agreed.  The old workhorse is due for retirement.  Replacement, on the way.  Meanwhile, it will have to do.</div></blockquote>A,,,,i heard that these SM1 replacement is in progress the DSTA is assign this task.I thought that Singapore technologies kinetic is using Bionix chassis fitted with 105 mm that is what i heard them some of you out there????? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just to correct a mistake, ours is not Light Infantry, the correct term is Mechanised Light Infantry, BTW the "light" is a bit misleading as our division is actually a heavy conventional combined arms division less the MBT. In operation, order @ divisional level, fight @ brigade level, actual combat @ battalion level.<br>So in the division, we have 2 brigades of mechanised light infantry, 1 regiment of armour plus support elements like air support (heli/air strike), engineer battalion, artillery battery, signal battalion, recce battalion, MP, DISCOM, special forces like sniper, ranger bla bla bla. Each infantry briagde comprise of 2 battalion of light infantry and 1 battalion of elite guards. These light infantry troops are highly mechanised as they move in 3 tonners, minimorg, landrover, light strike vehicle and motorcycle, equipped with mortar, HMG, AGL, spike ATGM and own organic support elements like engineering, recce etc.<br><br>BTW, US Army still have tons of light infantry element, I mean really light infantry operate as national guards, reserve. Just that they are not highly exposed like full-time troopers marine corps, airborne, special forces etc as shown in TV that's all. BTW all these full-time troopers only make up a fraction of the overall US Army size, but they are given the best equipment as they are actively deployed.<br><br><blockquote><strong>Originally posted by dkhoo:<br>3. Light infantry. We are considered to have one of the best light infantry forces in the world. This is probably because most modern armies no longer employ light infantry. Considering that casualties are particularly painful to us since our soldiers are also civilians, we cannot afford to pit flesh against fire. Our infantry forces need some form of body armor and greater mobility (trucks, tracked carriers, jeeps). This will give us a tremendous edge in combat (especially close combat) and improved strategic mobility.<br></strong></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Haha.  The 10th mountain is an example of light infantry.  And you're right, "light" infantry isnt exactly very light.  "Light" means they travel without heavy equipment support, like trucks, jeeps armored vehicles.  So whatever gear that is usually stowed in vehicles, well, end up on the soldier's back.<br><br>A more accurate term would be... err "leg" infantry.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I guess its understandable why Singapore ordered 4 Sjoormen subs instead of 4 of the newer gen subs. Just look at China as the perfect example. Even with their experience in operating SSKs, (with their Mings) they still manage to F*** up their Kilos. Heard they busted their Kilo's batteries so bad they had to go for complete overhaul or something like that. If we have to gain experience, we will definitely make mistakes along the way, and better to make them on cheaper platforms, I guess....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Previously, Joe Black had brought about a new idea(or is it old already?) of the use of the smoke grenade launchers on tanks. He said that we can use the smoke launchers on tanks to fire fragmentation grenades, maybe something like a bigger version of a M203 launcher perhaps? I think this is a great idea! I am a tankee myself and we have frag grenades in our turret for use against entrenched troops by lobbing the grenades into their trenches while on the move. Well I personally never tried that before but I think there will be definitely some problems involved by using this metrhod. One thing is that the person lobbing the grenade will be exposed to enemy fire as he need to get at least half of his body out to throw the grenade. Another factor is that the range and accuracy by throwing is not very good,maybe by using the smoke bomb launchers it will be better accuracy?
