            <div class='col-md body'>My opinion is that our strategy of arms procurement is a weakness. The premise is that we need to have an outright military technological edge in order to deter aggrssors. That means that we must always spend more OR we can't keep the enemies at bay.

            <div class='col-md body'>The SAR-21 came out soem time before the TAR-21 did, but I greatly suspect both countries traded a lot of notes. For your information, there is also quite a bit of spark of genius in singapore, and they dun have to be graduates.<br><br>The SAR-21 is an amazing rifle, people from all over the world who tried it, love it and gave rave reviews about it, only we Singaporeans seem to pick every fault with it but when given a far inferior system like the M-16 we instantly gloss over it and adapt ourselves to it's shortcomings. Singaporeans suffer from a "made in singapore syndrome" where they are rapidly against anything that is locally manufactured and will be a harsh critic on it, the opposite of the American "not made in USA syndrome" where they will accept their own systems, no matter how flawed and costy but reject using designs from other countries which are far superior and effective.<br><br>In all fairness, the SAR-21 is NOT a weakness, short of the OICW, it is one of the most advanced infantry assualt rifles in the world today, and if you bothered to take an objective view on it, you'll realize that it is far superior to the M-16 which the conservative soldier hang to like toddlers to their "blankies".<br><br>The SAR-21 is far more forgiving, durable, easy to maintain, egronomic, and most importantly, EAST TO SHOOT AND ACCUCRATE! And they have the stats to prove it. In SAR-21 shoot runs, wowo kings who could not shoot anything with the M-16 were soon hitting targets out to 300 meters with regularity with the SAR-21, with a calculated <span style="font-style: italic;">90</span> percent increase in accucracy. In fact it is so good that the army has decided to train all future batches of infantry on M-16s for the reason that the SAR-21 is so good and user friendly that it promotes bad shooting habits and weapons discipline.<br><br>It's just blind bias and "weapons from other countries must be better" attitute that appears to be most of the actual reason behind the supposed "criticism" of the SAR-21. The M-16 was a total reject nightmare when it was first introduce to US troops back in vietman, now we see people going "I'll stick to my trusty M-16". Hello people, wake up your idea. Dun be like those marines I've seen who claim in their incredibly idotic conservative ignorance that  they can do as much with their "trusty" M-16/203 combo as the OICWS... yeah right...<br><br>The SAR-21 is a far more advanced, and capable system then the M-16, and any of Singapore's potential enemies better be wary of it.</div>

Anyway the SR-21 is a pretty good rifle though i think they really should consider having better iron sights.My friend who was tested it said it was a great weapon but the only thing he did not like was the scope being almost useless in the rain and the lack of a good iron sight prevented him from using the rifle more acurrately.</div>
