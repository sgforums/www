              <p>Channel NewsAsia - <span><strong>1 hour 30 minutes ago</strong></span></p>
              <p><span>
              </span></p><p class="first">SINGAPORE: Acting Manpower Minister Gan Kim Yong has said the unemployment rate due to the current recession in Singapore could reach the levels recorded during the Asian financial crisis in 1998 and the economic downturn in 2001.</p>
              <p>And, with the US and European economies likely to recover only in the second half of this year, Trade and Industry Minister Lim Hng Kiang warned that recovery will be a slow process.</p>
              <p>Both ministers laid out the jobs situation in Singapore in Parliament on Monday.</p>
              <p>The industries that may be most affected by job losses are manufacturing, tourism, transport and wholesale trade. These are the sectors that are most exposed to the external economic environment. The financial services sector will also remain weak.</p>
              <p>Mr Gan said based on preliminary numbers, some 8,100 workers were either laid off or facing retrenchments in the fourth quarter of last year and over the next few months.</p>
              <p>Already, some 7,400 workers lost their jobs in the first three quarters of last year, two thirds of whom are locals.</p>
              <p>The silver lining is that more than 30,000 new jobs will be available in growth sectors such as construction, healthcare, public administration and the integrated resorts.</p>
              <p>Mr Gan said: "Close to 30,000 workers were retrenched in 1998 due to the Asian financial crisis, and about 26,000 workers were retrenched during the economic downturn in 2001. If our economy were to contract sharply this year, it is possible that retrenchments could reach these levels seen in previous recessions."</p>
              <p>Also speaking in Parliament, Minister Lim said Singapore’s job losses will increase and consumer sentiment will weaken as the manufacturing and financial industries slow further this year.</p>
              <p>He said the economic slump has spread to all parts of the economy.</p>
              <p>Mr Lim said 2009 will be a difficult year with consumer demand in key exports markets such as the US and Europe expected to remain weak.</p>
              <p>As such, the manufacturing sector will continue to face a slowdown.</p>
              <p>The financial sector meanwhile is expected to see a sharp decline because of the impact of the financial crisis.</p>
              <p>Mr Lim also said weaker consumer sentiment among Singaporeans has affected the retail sector and the property market.</p>
              <p>But he said there are still sectors that are showing positive growth.</p>
              <p>These sectors collectively make up slightly less than 10 per cent of the economy. As such, Mr Lim said their growth will not be able to compensate for the decline in other sectors.</p>
              <p>Mr Lim also said the government’s S$2.3 billion loan support package for businesses in Singapore has been "promising".</p>
              <p>Giving an update in Parliament, Mr Lim said banks’ loan commitments increased even before the scheme was introduced in December last year.</p>
              <p>For the whole of last year, loan commitments rose by 50 per cent to over <br>S$1 billion, compared to S$680 million registered in the previous year.</p>
              <p>Since the government—backed loans for businesses were launched in December, some 500 applications were received in that month alone.</p>
              <p>Mr Lim added that the approved loans for December last year increased by 30 per cent over the same period in 2007, rising to S$80 million from S$62 million.</p>

              <p>In the first place, we should not be too dependent on the government. When US and Europe hits recession, Singapore is the first to be affected. The government has no control over it. We should not even expect them to have control over the global recession at all(sad to say some people even think that our economy will only slow down and not enter recession), needless to say jobs and employment.</p>
              <p>When the tide rises, all boats rise. They can only do so much, but yet pay themselves excess of what they had performed.</p>
              <p>This crisis is also a reflection of excess. Imagine young bankers in their mid-twenties earning 10-20 Million a year of compensation. *pokes* bubble burst! <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"></p>
