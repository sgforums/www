              <p>But what if the music stop?</p>
              <p>Take note,Oz Banks think they collect 3 % of the property price as</p>

              <p> </p>
              <ul class="articleDetails">
              <li><strong> Natalie Craig </strong></li>
              <li>August 6, 2008</li>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Banks are still offering 100% home loans, despite an increasing risk
              that falling property prices could mean borrowers owe more than their
              house is worth.</p>
              <p>ANZ, Commonwealth Bank, NAB and Westpac
              will still lend 100% of the purchase price of a property, less about 3%
              mortgage insurance, according to broker Loan Market Group. St George
              will lend 100%, including insurance, at a higher rate.</p>
              <p>Consumer
              protection and welfare groups have described the ongoing practice as
              "staggering" given the outlook for the housing market, with capital
              city prices down 0.3% this quarter and some analysts predicting a fall
              in prices of up to 10% in the next year.</p>
              <p>But
              banks say their low mortgage default rates show their lending practices
              are sound - contrary to those of some "innovative" non-bank lenders.</p>
              <p>David Imber, of the Victorian Council of Social Service, said 100% loans were luring people who could least afford to borrow.</p>
              <p>"If
              we're seeing people borrowing 100% of the price of a property in an
              unstable market, it's reasonable to conceive that we could be seeing
              more people in negative equity," he said.</p>
              <p>Negative equity
              occurs when the value of a property falls below the sum borrowed to buy
              it. British credit data shows one in seven homeowners may soon have
              negative equity after house prices fell 8% in a year. It is predicted
              US house prices will have fallen about 30% in two years and almost a
              third of owners will be in negative equity.</p>
              <p>Australian house price data suggests it is those in outer suburbs who are at greatest risk of negative equity.</p>
              <p>BIS
              Shrapnel residential property analyst Angie Zigomanis said home owners
              in western Sydney had suffered increasingly from negative equity and
              foreclosure after job losses and severe house price falls. He said
              Melbourne had similar, smaller pockets of weakness.</p>
              <p>Ian
              Mackintosh, of the Financial and Consumer Rights Council, said it was
              the responsibility of lenders to properly inform consumers.</p>
              <p>"Banks
              and other lending institutions must share the responsibility of
              heightening consumer awareness," he said. "It is not just the financial
              situation of would-be purchasers that must be considered. The personal
              and social damage that is caused by financial stress is something
              everyone has a stake in.</p>
              <p>"We find it staggering that banks
              could even be contemplating 100% housing loans … All the reading we
              have been doing indicates that housing prices are not stable and may
              continue to decline in the outer suburban markets."</p>
              <p>But the major banks defended their lending practices, saying it would be bad for business to lend to risky clients.</p>
              <p>A
              Commonwealth spokesman said the bank had not changed its lending
              standards and still lent 100% to first-home buyers, who had to pay
              about 3% lender mortgage insurance.</p>
              <p>"The performance of
              banks in lending has been responsible," he said. About 80% of
              repossessions were on loans that originated with non-bank lenders, he
              said.</p>
              <p>ANZ, NAB and Westpac said they lent 100% before
              lender mortgage insurance was deducted. St George said it would
              occasionally lend 100% including insurance, but client checks were
              extremely tight.</p>
              <p>St George said it had about 500,000 home
              loans. Of those, about 80 houses were repossessed each year and
              mortgage arrears were consistent.</p>
              <p>Arrears on "subprime"
              loans - generally made to riskier borrowers - in Australia grew about
              4% in the three months to March 31, according to credit data.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">But subprime loans account for only 1% of the Australian market, compared with about a quarter of the US market.</span></p>
              <p>Loan
              Market Group chief executive Jennifer Nielsen said she expected banks
              to strengthen their criteria. "If you were a borderline 'yes' in the
              past, your chances of being a 'no' today are getting higher," she said.</p>

              <p>Is it true?</p>
              <p>The key is how many buffer for banks if price drop?</p>
              <p>Near 100% house loan cant provide too much buffer.</p>

              <blockquote>
              <p>And now, according to the more reliable figures produced by
              Australian Property Monitors, we see house prices falling in the three
              months to June in all capital cities bar Adelaide.</p>
              <p>In Sydney they fell by 2.1 per cent; in Melbourne, by 0.6 per cent.
              In the mining boom towns of Brisbane and Perth, they fell by 1.3 per
              cent and 2.8 per cent.</p>
              <p>In the two cities where prices rose highest, the softening has been
              greatest. Over the year to June, prices rose by just 1.1 per cent in
              Sydney and fell by 1.6 per cent in Perth.</p>
              <p>The bigger they are, the harder they fall. And since the past decade
              has seen by far the biggest property boom in memory, I won't be
              surprised to see prices fall back a fair way. Australian Property
              Monitors' prediction is that national house and unit prices will fall
              by 10per cent over the coming year.</p>
