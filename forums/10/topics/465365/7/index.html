              <p>Retirement age is now 62. nobody force you to retire at 55,  question is, does your company wants you? I see so many aunker auntie still working, think they are 60 already. Ask them why they work, they said at home nothing to do.</p>
              <p>I think I will retire at 50, got enough money, got enough energy, got many thing to do for fun.</p>
              <p>Remember, retirement is your choice and your employer's choice.</p>

              <p><br> 55 is not too old. 55 get your hard earn CPF money then decide
              whether you want to retire in Singapore or outside Singapore. What
              you want to do with your money. When you retire at 55 you can still
              work on contract basis or part- time basis. That was the ways of
              the past. Now the CPF change so much. If your CPF failed to reach
              the minimum sum then you will receive small amount of money from
              your CPF on a monthly basis..usually 200 plus or 300 plus dollars a
              month. If you stay in Singapore, I think you will continue to work
              until you die...no retirement for average Singaporeans.</p>

              Well the FTs and especially the Malaysians are smart to make themselves wealthier than Singaporeans. Besides that most citizens from 1st world countries are retiring outside their own country because its practical and rational....cost of living is lower and affordable for their retirement.

              The fact now Singapore is a 1st world country and the cost of living is high now. That has changed the whole concept and view about living, working and retiring within Singaporeans mindset.

              Even when you can't afford to sustain your own living cost in Singapore? Maybe when you reach the age of 50 or 55 you will start to think differently. Now you are still young and probably you don't see it what will happen to you when you are a senior citizen.

              SECURITY BOND WHEN EMPLOYING MALAYSIAN WORKERS IN SINGAPORE
                  
              For Singaporeans who are working in Malaysia, the malaysian companies need to pay a RM5000 bond with the Malaysian government when applying for the Singaporean workers' work permit. Currently in Singapore, companies in Singapore employing Malaysian workers do not need to secure a S$5000 security bond when they apply for the Malaysian worker's work permit. I want MOM to implement a new law for companies in Singapore intending to employ Malaysian workers to secure a S$5000 security bond when applying for the Malaysian worker's work permit.

              <p><br> Well the FTs and especially the Malaysians are smart to make
              themselves wealthier than Singaporeans. Besides that most citizens
              from 1st world countries are retiring outside their own country

              I did query my department before why is it for Malaysian workers their Singapore employers do not need to secure the S$5000 security bond before their job employment whereas the other foreigners from other countries need to have that security bond. Malaysian workers are foreigners too. They can't answer my query or they don't know how to answer my query.

                          little hard earned CPF money, if you spend it too quickly, you will
                          become a social burden to us, if you are a Singaporean.</p>
                          <p>Spend your little money wisely, don't buy anything you cannot
                          afford. Most importantly, don't go to MBS, Santosa, or
                          Genting...you can't depend on luck.</p>

              The tourists come and go within two or three days as a transit then they go other neighbouring asian countries for a longer holiday...could be months too. As about spending the hard earn CPF money too fast and don't gamble in casinos..I agree with you. Is the gambling addictions in Singapore in the rise now or is it declining now?
