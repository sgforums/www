They have plenty of durian trees at the backyard. They plucked a couple of durians using along pole with knife at the end and gave us to bring back to Singapore..once reached Singapore kampong home..my father placed those not really ripe ones in the container and covered it up with uncooked rice...afew days later it was ripe. Those durians plucked from the trees can be stored for exports and let it ripen by itself. Over ripe durian is considered inferior quality..</span></p>

              You are also saying good luck to the Singapore Government too not only to Singaporean investors or buyers in Malaysia property market there. Is it because personally you have no confidence in Iskandar, Johore? As you said...its Singapore people money...if you are not concern its up to you...but most Singaporeans would be concern where the Singapore government spend their money....how much they loss and how much they profited in overseas investments. We would not know the truth unless there is a new Singapore government that take over Singapore administration....when that happens maybe some politicians will run hard and far far from Singapore.. 
              
              I said they should invest more in Singapore than overseas market...to create more jobs for Singaporeans rather than hoping for foreign companies and local SMEs to do that job for them. It looks like they washed their hands and let the private sectors to do most of the job creation for them.  The Singapore government seems to have no confidence to invest more in Singapore market themselves.

              <p>For the poor souls after feeding govt could well mean they are
              left with nothing or very little for themselves.</p>
              <p>Just yesterday my neighbour in her 60s asked for help in looking
              for job.  she is staying alone and paying all the bills.
                The constant rise in the costs of living can possibly takes
              toll in one's life.  What is the point of having the most
              expensive govt in the world and in reality average / middle and no
              income groups are "suffocating" to be alive in sg .....</p>
              <p>Govt are suppose to make life better and this purpose is not met
              better "put them to sleep"   .  In sg it is either you
              die or we die.</p>

              There was this incidence that happened to me while eating at the coffeeshop in Singapore...I saw an old woman in her 60s pushing a trolley full of flattened cardboards and empty soft drink cans in a big plastic bags . Then she stopped, walked to my table and asked me whether she could take my empty soft drink can. I said ok and then softly she asked me whether I could give her $2 for her food expenses...I gave her some cash. I knew that I was not the only one she asked for some cash there were others.

              followed my parents to Segamat in Johore state to visit a relative
              there. They have plenty of durian trees at the backyard. They
              plucked a couple of durians using along pole with knife at the end
              and gave us to bring back to Singapore..once reached Singapore
              kampong home..my father placed those not really ripe ones in the
              container and covered it up with uncooked rice...afew days later it
              was ripe. Those durians plucked from the trees can be stored for
              exports and let it ripen by itself. Over ripe durian is considered
              inferior quality..</span></p>

              <p>There is no over ripe durian, when durians are kept too long, its husk opens up and it is no good for eating, doesn't become inferior quality. Only unripe durian is used for durian cake.</p>
              <p>Thai durians are havested by climbing up trees and cutting them down, may be stored to ripe and such durian is available all year round. I don't like that kind of durian.</p>

You are concerned that the government make the wrong decision, so you conclude that the decision they made must be right...lol.</p>

              70 percent of foreign buyers in Iskandar and Danga Bay, Johore, are Singaporeans. In that areas itself the properties are condominium apartments and landed properties. Singaporeans bought the properties there for property investment and make profits when they sell it in the future or for their retirement. Currently, the minimum amount for foreigners to own a property in Malaysia is still RM500,000 and above. Within this year 2014, that minimum amount for foreigners to own a property in Malaysia will be raise to RM1,000,000. This is what you said within the topic of "Ridiculous HDB Prices" within sgforums, "HDB is for Singaporean residence. it is people like him who are abusing the use of HDB, depriving other Singaporean residents, causing prices to hike. Those staying in JB should buy properties in iskanda or danga bay." http://sgforums.com/forums/10/topics/400849?page=71

              <p><br> 70 percent of foreign buyers in Iskandar and Danga Bay, Johore, are
              Singaporeans. In that areas itself the properties are condominium
              apartments and landed properties. Singaporeans bought the
              properties there for property investment and make profits when they
              sell it in the future or for their retirement. Currently, the
              minimum amount for foreigners to own a property in Malaysia is
              still RM500,000 and above. Within this year 2014, that minimum
              amount for foreigners to own a property in Malaysia will be raise
              to RM1,000,000. This is what you said within the topic of
              "Ridiculous HDB Prices" within sgforums, "HDB is for Singaporean
              residence. it is people like him who are abusing the use of HDB,
              depriving other Singaporean residents, causing prices to hike.
              Those staying in JB should buy properties in iskanda or danga bay."

              <p>Yes, Singaporean staying in JB should buy properties in JB, leave the HDB in Singapore for those who stay here.</p>
              <p>Its good to buy property in JB if you want to retire there, but if you want to sell and take money for retirement else where, then your property should be worth RM1 million by then, otherwise you can only sell to Malaysian. This policy will be effective by May this year. If you are taking a long term view and say over 5 years, then you have to consider renting it out, or you should really hope that the 500K property will rise to RM1 million within a short period of time. I like Singaporean who bought properties in Malaysia, many in Malacca, can't sell, can't rent, so let friends go there for holidays, but have to clean house for them, so if it is just a few days, hahaha...nothing is for free.</p>
              <p>There is a big difference buying properties for investment and for own stay. In any case, more so if it is in foreign land.</p>

              Ok. About Malacca...a working colleague of mine, her husband bought a landed property in Malacca many years ago intending to retire there...but then her husband passed away..now she doesn't want to retire there alone and all her children are working and living in Singapore. She doesn't know what to do with property there and just leave it empty and occasionally she and her children will go there for holidays. Maybe after the completion of the bullet train from Singapore to other states of Malaysia, Malacca will be good for foreigners to invest.
