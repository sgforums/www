              My Letter to NTUC - Protecting PMEs in Singapore
              BY JACKY TAN
                      
              I am happy to hear that you have organized this meeting to gather the opinions of PMEs (professionals, managers and executives) like us. Really appreciate your effort in seeking PMEs' view to create a better and fairer working environment.
                       
              I am writing as a concerned citizen who wants a fair and harmonized working environment so that everyone, (the employer, the employee and the government) can win.
                       
              Here are some of the thoughts that I have gathered on the ground.

              Debunking the official myths about HDB flats (Part 1): Singaporeans are owners of their HDB flats (revisited)
              
              The Housing Development Board was set up in 1960 during a time when large numbers of people are living in squatter settlements and slums around the city centers.
              
              Under the then indefatigable Minister for National Development Mr Lim Kim San, HDB began the task of solving Singaporeâ€™s housing crisis and resettling the squatters.
              
              It built 21,000 flats in less than three years. By 1965 it had built 54,000 flats, exceeding the 50,000 target of its First Five-Year Building Programme.
              
              Today, about 84 percent of Singaporeans live in HDB flats compared with only nine percent in 1960 when HDB was first established.
              
              The ruling party has always prided itself for building homes to house the majority of the population. HDB has become its crowning achievement and the mainstream media never fails to attribute Singaporeâ€™s high home â€œownershipâ€� to the PAP during every elections.
              
              While it is true that most Singaporeans have a roof over their heads, whether they actually own the flats they live in is debatable.
              
              There are three categories of properties in Singapore: freehold, 999 year and 99 year leasehold properties.
              
              Technically speaking, only those living in freehold properties can claim to own them since they are permitted to bequeath the estates to their descendents forever.
              
              All HDB flats are 99-year old leasehold properties which means that the government can reclaim them after a period of 99 years. When Singaporeans purchase HDB flats, they sign a Tenancy/Lease Agreement  with HDB and the usual Sales and Purchase Agreement for private properties. (thanks to reader Ang Kong Kia)
              
              In a sense, HDB dwellers are only â€œleasingâ€� their flats from HDB for 99 years, they do not strictly own them though the misconception has been perpetuated for years by the ruling party and the state-controlled media.
              
              Addendum contributed by reader Papsmearer:
              
              [Basically, when you borrow money from the bank to buy your 99 year leasehold HDB flat, you are in effect borrowing money to pre-pay your lease (you can call it rent too) for 99 years.
              
              Normally, when you rent from a landlord, you might be required to sign a 1 year lease agreement which stipulates among other things, the monthly rent. At the end of the 1 year, the landlord may not decide to renew your least. In the case of a HDB flat, by prepaying your lease for 99 years, you avoid the uncertainty of the normal lease.
              
              Secondly, people claim that they own the flat because they make a profit when they sell it. What they are actually selling is their interest in the pre-paid lease, not the actual flat themselves, because they donâ€™t own it. They are selling the right to live in that unit, and basically, assigning their rights as tenants to another individual for a fixed price.]
              
              Furthermore, there are some restrictions placed on the sale of HDB flats: e.g. one must live in it for a period of 5 years before they can be sold; the ethnic quota must be maintained in the process, previous HDB subsidies will have to be returned and a hefty resale levy is slapped on the seller which can be as high as $50,000.
              
              If Singaporeans are really owners of their HDB flats, then they should be allowed to sell them to anybody at any time like in the private property market without being subject to these restrictions imposed by HDB.
              
              Besides, most of them have to take up a bank loan to finance the purchase of the flats. In the event that they are unable to service the loan, the bank will repossess the flats.
              
              The reality is, Singaporeans do not own their HDB flats. They are merely renting it from HDB for a maximum period of 99 years and paying a pretty high monthly â€œrentalâ€� at that.
              
              When old flats are demolished by HDB for redevelopment, its inhabitants are not paid at prevailing en bloc rates. Instead, they are given discounts for new flats built to replace them.
              
              The remarkable success of HDB in transforming the landscape of Singapore lies in the small size of the island and population. Given that almost all land is owned by the government, HDB has no difficulties in acquiring land, much of which is undeveloped to build new towns.
              
              Post-independence Singapore has a small population which makes it easier for the government to relocate them to the newly built HDB flats. The feat will almost be impossible to replicate in an already densely populated city like Hong Kong or in a larger country like Malaysia.
              
              The government deserves credit for ensuring that the majority of the population has a roof over their heads, but to claim that Singapore has one of the highest home ownership in the world when its citizens are merely renting leasehold properties at exorbitant prices from HDB is stretching oneâ€™s imagination to the limits.
              
              It is time for Singaporeans now and the future to realize the truth â€“ that they do not own the HDB flats they live in and they belong ultimately to the government which retains the right to acquire and demolish them anytime they wish.

              Many Singaporeans defaulting on their housing loan...
              
              TIME FOR RELOOK AT HOUSING POLICIES : RESEARCHER
              
              "IT SHOULD not be assumed, for example, that "investing" in an HDB apartment will continue to be a safe bet, given the already high resale prices.
              
              In a prolonged depressed market, home owners may incur losses. Indeed, HDB resale prices were depressed for 13 years between 1996 and 2009 before prices recovered to their 1996 high.
              
              Given current HDB home prices, high mortgage payments also raise the risk of default in, say, a recession, or when structural unemployment rises. More households are in mortgage payment arrears: from 4 per cent in 2002 to 7.9 per cent in January 2009. From 2002 to 2006, 360 households surrendered their flats after defaulting on their mortgage loan repayments.
              
              It is also risky to assume that young Singaporeans will enjoy the current favourable economic conditions and hence high income growth in the next three decades. The risks from future adverse economic conditions are not limited to the low-income earners.
              
              Among the unemployed, the proportion of those who are managers, professionals and technicians has been rising steadily, from 14.7 per cent in 1991 to 27.8 per cent in 2001 and 36.2 per cent in 2011. There is also a rise in the number of jobless older workers. The share of workers in their 50s and above among the unemployed tripled from 7.3 per cent in 1992 to 22.4 per cent in 2010.
              
              These trends suggest that high mortgage commitments may drive default rates up in the future as the workforce continues to age and earning power wanes.
              
              While policymakers should strive for public housing prices to rise in value in tandem with economic growth to reflect their true market value, asset enhancement should not remain the predominant tenet guiding policy."

              MOM, SNEF call for progressive wage system
              
              30 April
              
              SINGAPORE â€” The Manpower Ministry and the Singapore National Employers Federation (SNEF) yesterday called on employers to work with the unions in implementing a progressive wage system, which sets out career ladders and pay benchmarks for low-wage sectors like cleaning and hospitality.
              
              Acting Manpower Minister Tan Chuan-Jin said in his May Day message that better jobs can be created for all workers, even though Singaporeâ€™s economy is experiencing a period of slower growth and restructuring. This can be achieved by building better workplaces and helping workers upgrade their skills, he added.
              
              Mr Tan said Singapore must continue to move towards â€œa manpower-lean economyâ€�, pointing to â€œimpressive successesâ€� achieved under the National Trades Union Congressâ€™ Inclusive Growth Programme, where businesses have seen productivity improvements and shared gains with workers. â€œI urge employers to work with the unions to press on with progressive wages for their workers,â€� Mr Tan said.
              
              SNEF President Stephen Lee said in his May Day message that arresting productivity decline, which fell 2.6 per cent last year, must be a priority this year. Noting that the United States experienced a productivity resurgence between 1995 and 2004, he said the growth was attributed to better management practices and the adoption of technologies in the service sector. Workers must also take ownership of their upgrading by reskilling and upskilling, he added.
              
              Both Mr Tan and Mr Lee noted that changes will be made to the Employment Act, providing better protection for an additional 450,000 workers next year. 
              
              To ensure fair workplaces, Mr Tan said the ministry is studying employment systems in other countries. â€œWe aim to foster an environment to develop and nurture the talents and abilities of the local workforce. This includes tapping on those who are economically inactive and who are keen to rejoin the workforce.â€�
