              Losing money. Government Ministries and subsidiary companies should stop the outsourcing practices of their services to 2nd party. There are many cases 2nd party will outsource it to 3rd parties. 2nd and 3rd parties are more interested in making profits rather than looking after their staffs' welfare.  This created career instability, insecurity, wage stagnation etcs. Majority of 2nd or 3rd party staffs prefer to be employed directly by the government.

              Your question was, "If Singapore remains a good market, why do you say that the government is washing hands, off what?"
              
              You mentioned GOVERNMENT not GIC.

              Tangs, Nestle, F&amp;N, Singapore Crocodile Garment, Bata Shoe etcs..still here in 
              Singapore.
              
              "Samsung, Sony,....all venture abroad to grow"
              
              After they innovated and produced their own national products and captured their own county market...they ventured abroad.
              
              "We must see the market and then invest. We do not invest, hoping to create a market!!"
              
              The market already exist in Singapore...Singapore just need to innovate and produce its own national products and capture it's own market e.g. food, electronics &amp; electrical appliances, energy &amp; automobile industry etcs...Rather than relying on foreign import goods only Singapore can manufactured local products and captured its own market...then Singapore can follow the footsteps of Sony, Samsung

              Why not? Aren't Singapore having excellent Entrepreneurship, R&amp;D, Scientists, Designers, Engineers etcs to innovate, back-up, improve and capture Singapore own domestic market? Temasek Holdings is a private investment entity within GIC that invest in local market besides overseas. 
              
              "We are fortunate GIC has management who are focus and know what they are doing, WITH SINGAPOREAN MONEY!!!"
              
              Why are there still so many Poor Singaporeans? Is GIC rich in assets only but poor in cash too like majority of ordinary Singaporeans? We wouldn't know the TRUTH until there is a NEW GOVERNMENT takes over the current PAP government...only then all Singaporeans will know THE WHOLE TRUTH about GIC. 
              
              Even our former decease President encountered problems to obtain the TRUTH about GIC.

              <p>The market already exist in Singapore…Singapore just need to
              innovate and produce its own national products and capture it’s own
              market e.g. food, electronics &amp; electrical appliances, energy
              &amp; automobile industry etcs…Rather than relying on foreign
              import goods only Singapore can manufactured local products and
              captured its own market…then Singapore can follow the footsteps of
              Sony, Samsung</p>

              <p>Why not? Aren’t Singapore having excellent Entrepreneurship,
              R&amp;D, Scientists, Designers, Engineers etcs to innovate,
              back-up, improve and capture Singapore own domestic market? Temasek

              <p>Why are there still so many Poor Singaporeans? Is <span>GIC</span> rich in assets only but poor in cash too like

              <p>in your opinion, local companies must innovate, produce national products and capture your own country market first then venture abroad. so who is stopping them?</p>
              <p>you are full of ideas about business, very good. Take the opportunities that the GIC are missing, I am sure you can be very successful in helping the young and poor Singaporean, and when that happens, if it ever happens, I will vote in your government.</p>

              <p>thye fool u by comparing. i alwasy thought smartass will have smartass sons. but not. when they compare rather list similarities they are restricting out of the box ralities. when we make ourselvesd similar to other countrys and let it pass as a common phenomeneon of globalization, then we already deny the probablility of making a difference as CXOMPARE to thos eother countries. in short - they are taking us for a ride. againa and again. ppl should do like i did.</p>
              <p>during last election i put a 'cross' on opsition and walk out of the polling area immediately. earlier on seeing a cheena national walked right into the out of bound area and the pollice only stop in when he already walked into the ballot area.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>just like how the little india incident can go on unchecked. later then the court and law and wayang wayang. we are too soft, too complancent in the wrong way. we let in too many labor that we not pure breed sgreans, addicted the companies. we raised our standards of living too high too fast until sgreans have to demand more slaries, forceing companies to us ethe foreign labor instead of sgreans, making companies addicted to cheapness, not knowing its a paid workforce, not local loyal sgrean workers, just like comparing mercenaries to soldiers.</p>

Your are still a new citizen in Singapore...which is slightly above 10 years only. What early memory life you have about Singapore huh? You talk about the past of Singapore like a trained parate without knowing and experiencing the hardship yourself.

              <p>Dont' get worked up, haha...anker....voting is my rights, as a Singapore citizen, not because you need me.</p>
              <p>You see so much opportunities that the GIC is missing, why don't you just go ahead make the money? teaching GIC or any other people what is do is at most arm chair general. We don't need that.</p>
              <p>The singapore government is elected by the people to run the country. So for the time being, the rights, power and our money is entrusted to them, until we vote again. You understand the process?</p>

              your childhood and teen years in Malaysia. Your are still a new
              citizen in Singapore...which is slightly above 10 years only. What
              early memory life you have about Singapore huh? You talk about the

              Young people born in Singapore they know what their parents and grandparents had gone through...for your case your father run from China went to Malaysia after having family there and then run to Singapore...and you still new a citizen want to show off your arrogance....you probably begged that Singapore citizenship from the government for immigration convenient and in the future run back to China. I'm still working in Singapore and contributing to Singapore while into semi-retirement in JB not far still connected with Singapore.
