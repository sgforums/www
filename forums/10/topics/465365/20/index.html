              Chinese government declared that several attacks within China as extremist terrorism with terrorist influence outside China mainly from Pakistan and there are Chinese extremists from China already receiving terrorist training with ISIS and fighting along side with ISIS in Syria and Iraq...its no longer an internal problem or isolated case for China now. In fact the Chinese government emphasize on greater co-operation with the International Intelligence and Security agencies to counter terrorism. You will never know maybe one day too China will send PLA troops to the trouble region to fight against terrorism too. Most countries now are not immune to ISIS terrorism influence now, it could happen any part of the world no matter how small the occurrence of terror incidence is/are.
              
              About Chinese companies and Chinese tourists from China investing and visiting Malaysia....as long it is about promoting business and tourism I see no problem with that but when it comes to promulgate the Communism Ideology again....I'm very sure the Malaysian Government will catch those Communist propagators and sympathizers, place them under ISA detention. I know the Singapore Government will do the same thing if Communism Ideology arise again within Singapore.

              <p>There has always been trouble in the eastern part of China, especially the tibet and xinjiang provinces, between the minorities and the Hans Chinese, different races and different religions. The Tibetan buddhists made their voice heard through dissidents outside of China, in India primarily. The xinjiang muslim, have resorted to terrorist attacks, even before the existence of the ISIS. instead of blaming the ISIS, I would say it is probably the twisted religious teachings that encourage the fanatics to resort to killings and suicide. the only ISIS influence now is the provision of trainings to the terrorists all over the world.</p>
              <p>As for the presence of Chinese, from mainland, the trouble is their nationalistic attitude and arrogant behavior. The taiwanese Chinese cannot tahan, the HK chinese are up in arms against them. The neuva rich attitude, and total lack of respect for local culture have earned them bad reputation all over the world. If Malaysian government think they can arrest Chinese using ISA for peeing on the road, speaking loudly in public places, ....good luck!</p>

              Lets hope the Chinese government can stop their people from travelling outside the country to receive terrorist training or funding for their terrorism plans within China.
              
              Good, as long the Chinese tourists from mainland China loves shopping and don't mix it with Communism, Malaysia and Singapore government will be very happy with them. Let the Chinese from mainland China or abroad decide what they want from their Chinese Communist Government, like U.S.S.R. who knows one day the People's Republic of China will be rule by a Democratic Government.

              <p>No government can stop their people from travelling. But whether they go shopping with their own money or receive free terrorist training or even funding, the government  AND the society need to act.  Two things are necessary:</p>
              <p>Make the monorities feel being part of the society, no special priviledges to the "son of the land", ....you see this lacking in certain part of China, you see this grossly lacking in some countries near us.</p>
              <p>Teach the right values! The terrorists in the middle east, the al qaeda, the ISIS are embarasssing the true muslim worldwide. But why are people from Malaysia and Indonesia still joining them? Somebody is not teaching the right thing!</p>
              <p>over the last 20 years, how many people died because of ideology? how many countries got into turmoil because of communism? and how much trouble is due to religious fanatics!!! and who else...the greatest democratic government of all time, the United States of America....I won't be so excited about China being ruled by a Democratic government, just look at Taiwan.</p>

              No governments, societies and religious preachers in the world can stop those self radicalize lone wolves joining the terrorists in the middle east, the al qaeda, ISIS and etcs totally. Most of them were influenced and recruited by the covert recruiters in various countries via the internet social medias and surprisingly through online games too. This can be construed to the effects of one being confused and disillusionize mixing religion with politics. Religion is simple but man makes it difficult and worse still if one has make himself as a god, in religions or politics.
              
              There is no government without the people and when a government takes power and self proclaim itself as the ruler over the people and controls their lives without even care to hear the voice of the people without the veto of the people to elect for their lawful and rightful government; and destroyed the other legitimate existing political parties, that per se is a dictatorship government like those infamous dictators of the world from the last century.
              
              Taiwan is a country to the Taiwanese but the Chinese Communist Government regards them as a rebel state. Wars were fought by the people from these two parties in the past...its over..PRC should just let ROC be. They were successful politically and economically in the past and known by countries within this region as the Asian Tiger before the One China policy. PRC and ROC will have better close neighbourly friendship, diplomatically and economically if only PRC can just let ROC be and recognize it as a country with the right to exist. Let the Taiwanese decide, elect their own government and declare independence without the PRC political manipulation and threat of PRC invasion in their mind. This move by PRC will be seen and hail by many countries around the world as the image of a great nation.
              
              The great U.S.S.R. collapsed, there were chaos, civil wars and new nations emerged...Cold War over...Cuba were left alone and isolated..its up to them when they are ready to rejoin the world. And Russia overcome all those events and emerged stronger diplomatically and economically as a new Democratic Nation before the Ukrainian political turmoil...Russia big mistakes intervening Ukrainian welfare. It could happen to PRC too and North Korea will be like in Cuba position but we can never know for sure but only anticipate it to happen. PRC could take Russia as a precedence to move forward as a big nation and win ASEAN confidence with or without the presence of the U.S.in this region....its yet to happen...its up to PRC now to show it to ASEAN nations especially The South China Seas dispute.. 
              
              The key word for peace in the middle east is Israel and Palestine...that region has been in political and religious turmoil for thousands of years...a curse maybe from mighty god..the Jews were cursed by god and the moslems are taught never to trust them because they are the enemy of Islam until the end of the world. I can never blame Israel either after 6 millions Jews were executed by Hitler of Nazi Germany in the Holocaust during WW2 in the last century.

              <p>I think a peaceful settlement between the Israel and Palestine today is not enough to bring about peace for the world. It is now the clash of civilization, the western values based primarily on Christian belief and the islamic faith. for years most people in the middle east suffers, together with israelis, especially the palestinian, not sure who has God cursed.</p>
              <p>the question now is how to prevent the fanatics from bring terror to the rest of the world, even for those who are not taking sides.</p>
              <p>As for Taiwan, the island is part of China, historically, peirod.  so is Hong Kong and Tibet. The ROC government lost the civil war against the commie who founded PRC and Chiang ran to Taiwan, that doesn't give ah bian the right to declare Taiwan an independent state, or else the commie would complete the war, finish till the last man stands, nobody wants to see that. Hong Kong was taken over by the Brits due to opium war, and it was also the Brits who encouraged an independent tibet. If we are not clear with the history, we might want to believe in Shinto Abel who said that Japan during WW2 was actually liberating China, Korea, Malaysia, Singapore.....from the Western Imperialists, through raping, killing, conquoring....</p>
