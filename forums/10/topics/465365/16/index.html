              <p>Who are the one elected Ah Bian then? Although in some way we
              know it is due to the back-stabber Lee who drive an wedge between
              good-for-nothing Lian and Song from their own good 'party' that
              give chance to him to be President, and not to forget in Taiwan's
              past, they ruled with Iron fist before they had an 'official'
              election.</p>
              <p>The point is I don't see how their gahment help their people in
              anyway. It is Taiwan's local entrepreneurs (e.g Acer) and their
              entertainment celebrities who make Taiwan success, definitely from
              not their gahment, Singapore is the other way round.</p>

              <p>I don't disagree!</p>
              <p>The Taiwanese government or political parties had not helped the people, but used the people for their own political agenda. The local entrepreneurs, the big and the small SME brought success to Taiwan economy. But I must say that the Taiwanese people are a lot more resiliant in adapting  to changes in their society, they have not waited for their government to act. that is the big difference between Singaporean and Taiwanese.</p>

              <p>Singapore lease tenure system originated from the British law. We have properties on 99 yrs, 999 yrs or freehold, same in HK, for residential properties. Industrial lease shorter.</p>

              <p>In Singapore, you buy a 1000 sq ft condo, or HDB, your actual living area is 1000 sq ft. In Taiwan, and HK (following China), you buy 1000 sq ft apartment, your live in is only about 850 sq fit, the other 150 sq ft is the life area, the walk way.....</p>
              <p>You buy condo in HK and Taiwan, you have to buy car park.</p>

              <p>The council, comprising a tripartite committee of officials, unionists and employers, will meet this month and next month.</p>
              <p>   In drawing up the annual guidelines, it will consider factors such as Singapore's economic performance and the domestic and global economic outlook.</p>
              <p>   The country's economic competitiveness, labour market conditions, inflation and productivity growth will also be taken into account.</p>
              <p>   As part of the council's suite of wage recommendations last year, it had called on companies to give a minimum monthly wage hike of $60 to employees drawing a basic monthly salary of $1,000 or less.</p>

Malaysia is your country of birth, came to Singapore in the late 90s, you're a Malaysian still...in your heart and mind because you were born Malaysia, grew-up in Malaysia and your past is in Malaysia too. Many former Malaysians who are old now are going home to their own country of birth to retire now...you too will retire in Malaysia one day.

              <p>Taiwan is actually the worse country to compare to.</p>
              <p>Their politics is crap, with politicians literally fighting in parliament. </p>
              <p>As for their economy, it had actually regressed. When I visit Taipei 10 years ago, I saw many job opening posters advertising retail positions paying NT$25,000 (S$1040).</p>
              <p>When I visit Taipei last year, salaries actually fell to NT$19,000 (S$790).</p>
              <p>Also, with 100% of each cohort going to university, starting pay for Taiwanese university graduates is NT$22,000 (S$913), which is now commonly referred on Taiwanese TV programmes as the "22k é­”å’’" (22k curse).</p>
              <p>What we need is to seek the best practices from different countries, instead of blindly following any particular country's example.</p>
              <p>I.e. Finland's education, Australian employment practices, Hong Kong's economic performance, American home prices and of course... Swiss Standard of Living. :P</p>
