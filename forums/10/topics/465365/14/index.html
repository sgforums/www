              <p>thye fool u by comparing. i alwasy thought smartass will have
              smartass sons. but not. when they compare rather list similarities
              they are restricting out of the box ralities. when we make
              ourselvesd similar to other countrys and let it pass as a common
              phenomeneon of globalization, then we already deny the probablility
              of making a difference as CXOMPARE to thos eother countries. in
              short - they are taking us for a ride. againa and again. ppl should
              do like i did.</p>
              <p>during last election i put a 'cross' on opsition and walk out of
              the polling area immediately. earlier on seeing a cheena national
              walked right into the out of bound area and the pollice only stop
              in when he already walked into the ballot area.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>just like how the little india incident can go on unchecked.
              later then the court and law and wayang wayang. we are too soft,
              too complancent in the wrong way. we let in too many labor that we
              not pure breed sgreans, addicted the companies. we raised our
              standards of living too high too fast until sgreans have to demand
              more slaries, forceing companies to us ethe foreign labor instead
              of sgreans, making companies addicted to cheapness, not knowing its
              a paid workforce, not local loyal sgrean workers, just like
              comparing mercenaries to soldiers.</p>

              <p>call yourself Singaporean, but full of Malaysian mentality...."I was

              Singapore and live in JB because the S$ exchange rate is now 2.6 of RM".</p>
              <p>anker (just a respect for your old age, not reflecting what is in your brain), you are far from the so called pioneer generation which is 65 years and above, and if you know what your parents had gone through then you won't be leaving them here and run to JB, or worst took them to JB.</p>
              <p>You contribute to Singapore? hehe...</p>

They don't have enough cash/budget to sustained their lives in Singapore because its expensive. I've seen many Singaporean old people at the Malaysian JB checkpoint pulling trolleys full of groceries to bring back with them into Singapore. I planned my semi-retirement and retirement a long time ago and I planned to retire in JB because its spacious and I like the neighbours and environment there....reminded me of my kampong days....which Singapore cannot provide me. Any Singaporeans can choose where they want to retire, whether in Singapore or abroad to their liking...regardless whether Singapore is govern by the currently government or in the near future by the new government. Aren't you the one who told me that JB is good for Singaporeans to retire too? hehe. About my parents, both have passed over. Prior to that, they spend their time by staying with each of their children home for a certain period on alternate basis until they passed away. We took care of them when they were sicked without the government help....they aged gracefully...and passed over peacefully. By the way, are your parents entitled to the pioneer generation package? If the present government is really sincere in honouring our pioneer generation, why subsidized...give them free public transportation ride, health treatment, nursing home accommodations especially those without families or the homeless old people. About the pioneer generation, I worked with them side by side to build HDB flats in Bedok during my school holidays, in health industry etcs to build Singapore and its economy. You came to Singapore when Singapore has already developed and reaped the fruits of our core Singaporeans effort...is it not? You are still a new citizen (hope it was legal)...so what is your contribution to Singapore? hehe. There are many unhappy middle and lower income earner Singaporeans now which constitute more than the elite and rich SIngaporeans themselves.....The OPPOSITION PARTIES have more than enough votes to place more opposition members in parliament or worst to vote out the current government. You think PAP can rely on the new citizens like yourself to put them in power forever? hehe.

              <p>There is no need to stand behind any political parties to talk about Singapore. I won't predict the outcome of 2016 election, I watch what all the parties are doing. Right now, the PAP are seen working, although as a government, I see the WP elected members working, many of them like Sylvia and Chen actually quited their job to run their constituency diligently. The other opposition so far remain visible on the internet. If things go on like that, it is not difficult to predict what would happen in 2016. Good luck, you need it.</p>
