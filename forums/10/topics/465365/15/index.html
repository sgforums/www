              <p>Taiwan is a safe place to travel at night, like Singapore, if you are
               talking about Taipei city. Their medical benefits å…¨æ°‘ä¿�å�¥ is much 
              betterï¼Œold folks see doctor free of charge, hospital benefits cover you 
              till you die (that is why many Hongkie are talking up Taiwan 
              citizenships when come to old age, in Hong Kong, they are covered only 
              till 75). But this is subject to much abuse, as many old folks see 
              doctors, especially the young ones to talk cock, then throw away the 
              medicine. Many Taiwanese are wondering how long more the young people 
              have to pay to support these old folks.</p>
              <p>In the eyes of many 
              Taiwanese, Singapore is a place they wish to live. What is holding them 
              is that the place is too small, they prefer USA and Canada.</p>
              <p>Taiwanese
               can go to Hokkien to make money, in the rural areas outside Taipei, 
              Taichung and Kaoshiung, they can set up small business without much 
              trouble. Can make a living but annual family tour is only around Taiwan 
              or China, not to Europe or America. In that sense, Taiwan is much better
               than Singapore.</p>
              <p>Cars are cheap but in holidays the highways become big car park.</p>
              <p>There
               if you speak english, you will be very well respected, but if you don't
               speak Hokkien sooner or later they would kick you out. You can be very 
              well entertained with their local TV programs, but if you watch only 
              æ–°é—»é¾™å�·é£Žï¼Œyou won't see anything further than you toes, and they would tell 
              you you have a big foot.</p>
              <p>There are lots of food in Taiwan, very nice, but you will miss char guey tiao and laksa,  I suppose you can get used to that.</p>
              <p>Singapore
               is no better or worse than Taiwan, we are just different. Many 
              Taiwanese want to migrate to Singapore, we now have Singaporean wanting 
              to migrate to Taiwan, it is just different preferences, or grass is 
              always greener on the other side.</p>

              <p>that is true, taiwan people, especially those from the smaller cities
               or towns, have more äººæƒ…å‘³ã€‚But don't get involved in politics, the blue 
              and green divide is very deep, the æœ¬çœ�äºº and å¤–çœ�äºº divide also quite deep. 
              The better people are the é˜¿ç¾Žæ—� and other aborigins, they speak very good 
              mandarin, and sing very well.</p>
              <p>I always enjoy visiting Taiwan as a 
              Singaporean, but not sure how they would treat me if I were to become a 
              ROC citizen. Staying in æ°‘å®¿ and eating in the less touristic places have 
              been great fun and educational, when the stall holders got time to chat 
              with you.</p>
              <p>Typhon comes and go, if you are prepared it is ok. 
              don't kena earthquake, I ever spent one night on the street. no fun. I

              was there 19 days, everyday rain, not heavy but enough to wet you 
              through if you don't have rain coat or umbrella.</p>
              <p>If you are not married, having a Taiwanese girl friend is very nice. 
              Dont' try if you are married, they stick to you like glue. If you do 
              married a local girl, set up your family in places around Taichung would
               be very pleasant, beautiful places, friendly people, good weather, nice food, and cheap.</p>

              You know they make money after selling their HDB flats. Hmmm....aren't PRs too got CPF besides Singaporeans or New Citizens of Singapore? Good to hear you know WP members are working hard in your own constituency to make a difference for your life there and you are happy with them....so make sure you vote WP in 2016 and not PAP hehe. Hmmm...you keep forgetting and eating your own words that you said that its good for Singaporeans to retire in JB hehe.

              <p>Who are the one elected Ah Bian then? Although in some way we know it is due to the back-stabber Lee who drive an wedge between good-for-nothing Lian and Song from their own good 'party' that give chance to him to be President, and not to forget in Taiwan's past, they ruled with Iron fist before they had an 'official' election.</p>
              <p>The point is I don't see how their gahment help their people in anyway. It is Taiwan's local entrepreneurs (e.g Acer) and their entertainment celebrities who make Taiwan success, definitely from not their gahment, Singapore is the other way round.</p>
