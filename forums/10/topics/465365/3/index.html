              "Ask for too much."
                      
              Not asking too much but a reminder to the Singapore government. In the past Singapore was very serious with anti-communism movement and successfully eridicate that threat within Singapore. However, from the start when Singapore open up its job market to foreigners, I believe strongly in a way that Singapore has easily compromised its national security to Communism again and Terrorism now. Imagine, how many PRC workers are brought up with the ideology and philosophy of Mao Zedong Communism Red Book. How many of them are given the PR status and Citizenship? Hopefully none of them have infiltrated within Singapore sensitive areas like the SAF, Singapore Airforce, Singapore Navy, Singapore Technology etcs. How many Arabs with radical jihadist ideology and philosophy are on the job training pass with Singapore Changi International Airport or the Muslim radical jihadist construction workers from India and Bangladesh issued with work permits working in Singapore. I'm really not sure how the Singapore government going to monitor these possible threats.

              Yes, as long their health is ok...no disease like AIDS. Those who have TB &amp; VD must be treated and healed...must show the treatment document from a doctor and a letter of acknowledgement from the company hiring them. Even heart problem and high blood pressure must have a letter of acknowledgement from company hiring them....but most of the time, company will not hire heart problem foreign workers. Many Malaysians above 50 are still working in Singapore.
                  
              Some of them have been working for so long in Singapore...they just need to renew their work permit...of course with good health...without coming down to collect their work permit themselves. Every 5 years....they need to come down personally to process their work permit with their new recent photograph...and now with right &amp; left thumbprint.

              All the abovementioned oppression in Malaysia may cause Malaysian Chinese look up at PRC.

              <p>The MZD red book is now still available at many souveniour shops. It was a piece of propaganda during cultural revolution and cultural revolution is official recognized by the communist Chinese government as a national catastrophe. Chinese communists used to worship Mao like their god but now they know the god is dead. But, suddenly people like you jumped out of the blue and worry about mao zhe dong. Whether worship Mao like god, or fear him like devil, you are just acknowledging him with a position that is totally irrelevant now.</p>

              Haha...
              
              So you worried about those communists from Mao Zedong and perhaps Deng Zhao Ping era will reawaken the old and young Chinese in PRC and overseas....about fundamental communism again.
              
              History always repeated itself....and the way I see...with the great income gap within the society of PRC.....it can happen again...Communism usually starts well with the peasants in China..
              
              You were still a baby when countries in Indo-China fell to Communism like dominoes. It was a very fearful thing to witness that event.
