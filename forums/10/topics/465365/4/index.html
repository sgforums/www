              ahboy you don't know many things..Singapore is a small country, communists no jungle to hide... can kena catch easily by the government like in the past. China as you say is a big country so when the fundamental communism arise again many chinamen and chinawomen will kill one another and difficult to control..if that happens you will be worried about your family in PRC.
                  
              You should ask the singapore government what they can do for your prc family?

              <p>The moral of the story is that the no dialect policy is wrong!! you want to work for banks dealing with Indonesian you have advantage if you speak Bahasa, if you work for BNP and you speak French, wow, you will be the blue eye boy !!</p>

              I want to see the Singapore Government to lower the inflation further by disallowing banks to use HDB flats as collaterals like in the past. About lifting the 10K ceiling for buyers, rich or poor to buy HDB flats, it will not affect the market as long the banks are not involve in the loan scheme. Separate the HDB resale market prices from the new HDB flats. HDB really must go back to the very basic foundations scheme for public housings for all Singaporeans. HDB should provide the loan scheme to HDB flat buyers, regardless whether the HDB owners are 1st, 2nd or 3rd time buyers. After the 5 or more years of minimum occupancy period when the new HDB flat owners want to sell to the open market, the price will commensurate with the resale HDB market prices accordingly base upon the renovation within the flat done by the owners, the location, amenities, flat level and view; and lastly the exterior upgrading of the HDB flats. We had no problems of new HDB and resale HDB market prices in the past. The HDB market prices went up after the banks were allowed to use HDB flats as collaterals for flat owners to get loans from the banks  in 1997.
                                          
              Separate the private properties market totally from HDB market. Let the rich or those who can afford or those who want to buy the private properties in Singapore with their own source.

              I want Ministry Of Manpower to standardise the working hours and annual leave for employees in Singapore. 
                          
              1.   44 hours work week for all industries and above that working hours is considered overtime.
                          
              2.   14 days annual leave and subsequently after that 1 day added each year.
                          
              To avoid these problems.
