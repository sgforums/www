All movements by Singaporeans on the World Wide Web do not escape the watchful eyes of the gatekeepers and rulemakers. The book launch is scheduled for later this month.<br><br>Singaporean Surfers<br>Â“A little know case involves the Socratic Circle, which was set up in 1994 as a society and one of the first political groups to experiment with the Internet. Problems began when its members posted survey questions online to solicit opinions from Internet surfers. Officials from the Registrar of Societies asked the group to discontinue reaching out to non-members through the Internet. Socratic Circle members were reminded that they were given permission to conduct political discussion only among their members and by soliciting information from surfers through the Internet they were contravening this rule. This shows the mindset of the Singapore authorities, how rigid they were about keeping a tight control over political communication by groups on the Internet and the how early into the game Singaporeans on the World Wide Web were already being monitored.Â”<br>Â“September 11 fallout in Singapore will also take its toll on the Internet. Just before Islam took centre stage in the national media starting late 2001, the discussion group Cyber Ummah was the main web forum for Malay and Muslim affairs. Discussions were robust and on one occasion it gave rise to threats of a civil suit initiated by a PAP politician against a poster for libel which was settled out of court. But the setting up of Fateha.com took the discussion of Muslim affairs to a greater debate when it accused the PAP of collaborating with the US and denying female Muslims student the right to wear their head scarves Â– Â“tudungÂ”. The Singapore Broadcasting Authority (SBA) publicly admitted to tracking the website for some time and asked Fateha.com to register their site in accordance with (rules put in place in 1996) requiring websites which spread, promote and discuss political issues to be registered. SBA's Internet Code of Practice prohibits material which is "objectionable on the grounds of public interest, public morality, public order, public security, national harmony, or is otherwise prohibited by applicable Singapore laws". Failure to comply with the code can result in fines and other unspecified sanctions.Â”<br><br>Tune in next time for Â“SnoopingÂ” and Â“Self-CensorshipÂ”<br><br></div>

He has published widely and has been associated with a variety of universities, think-tanks and international organisations in Asia.<br><br>His first involvement in politics was as a student activist where he was editor of several student publications and was active in organizing political talks and seminars during his university days. He graduated with an Honours in Political Science in 1992, and then went to the UK to undertake postgraduate studies in Politics, graduating with a Master of Arts in Politics from the University of Essex in 1994.<br><br>Upon his return, he released his book Self-Censorship: Singapore's Shame (1999), which examines why people are afraid to speak up. The book reached the number one spot on the best-sellers list at MPH, the local bookstore chain.<br><br>Events around the book and his use of the Internet led to the founding of Think Centre, a multi-partisan organisation. As its Head, he organised political forums and tested the limits of the Speaker's Corner. He also organised the 'Save JBJ Rally' and in 2001 published his second book on Singapore entitled Internet Politics.<br><br>In recognition of his ability to mobilise people for political action through the Internet, <span class="large"><strong><span style="color: blue;">Asiaweek voted him as one of Asia's Most Powerful Communicators in 2001. Soon after, Newsweek named him as one of Asia's Top Ten "Rebels &amp; Mavericks".</span></strong></span><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Philosophy:<br>James believes that without communication there is no politics. To him, developing and promoting policies involve communication in every aspect: clarifying issues, developing and refining ideas, meeting and persuading people, enlisting their support, and employing different methodologies and instruments. He says: "We should never be afraid to think of new ideas and to act on them."<br><br>James feels that one of the most important challenges facing Singapore is to help the "New Poor" - the group of Singaporeans who find themselves financially and intellectually strapped due to the prevailing political climate and a saturated economy. He believes this will be one of the main concerns in policy-making for years to come.<br><br></div>
