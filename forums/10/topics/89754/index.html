            <div class='col-md body'>i bet many ppl arent PAP supporter if they have a better choice. i knw many friends who are on the friends and also know many relatives who care got ppl wash their corridor and trees in the walkway than interested in polical issue. well can we blame them. some year ago, i dont understand why ppl vote for PAP if they dont like them. but it change my mind. singaporean are selfish and indeed we need to fight for ourselves. can anyone blame someone who wish to keep thei estate clean and tide. some year back when opposition party won the bukit batok area, the area was dirty and few walkway was constructed. after PAP won it back, area was cleaner amd more walkways and community center was build.<br>as for myself, i will vote for opposition party no matter who fight in my area. coz i juts cant convince myself to vote for the PAP. anyway the opposition need to be given more chance to prove themselves then just a few years. when PAP first won the election, they can also asking ppl to give them a chance to prove themselves.<br>if there need a change in our political scene , it need to start somehwere, i dont want to be a lagger.<br>as for chee, he talk crap, but he dare to stand out and fight PAP. there are saying that he actually a spy from p.p to create havoc in the oppoistion party. well, we really see it now.<br>just my 4 cents worth.</div>
