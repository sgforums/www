            <div class='col-md body'>I think all could argue until the cow comes home and still cannot solve the present problems faced by our economy - high costs and loss of economic competitiveness due to certain past policy constraints.<br><br>Many ideas were given to SSS (Staff Suggestion Scheme) but out of 100 only 2 were eventually implemented which were not minor nature that cannot really turn around our moribund economy.<br><br>Only monopolies and big companies are happy. The rest 9 out of 10 enterprises are not doing well.<br><br>Past suggestions already cover all areas of economic activities from out-of-the-box killer idea to unthought of solutions of all kinds. Some usually the minor ones were implemented as revealed by SSS.<br><br>Why not forget about all the justifications and presentation and straightaway turn all in-house talents to good use - of their practical knowledge and develop them to assets through doables. Put aside all the constraints from past conceptual policeis for a change. Without any more additional ideas or suggestions, existing ideas and suggestions well considered with open minds will see more mileage.
