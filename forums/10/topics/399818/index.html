              <p><strong>Albert Winsemius</strong> (1910-1996), a <a title="Netherlands" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands">Dutch</a> <a title="Economist" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist">economist</a>,
               was <a title="Singapore" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore">Singapore</a>'s
               long-time economic advisor from 1961 to 1984. He led the <a title="United 
              Nations" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations">United Nations</a> Survey Mission to Singapore,<sup id="cite_ref-leipziger_0-0" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Winsemius#cite_note-leipziger-0"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> and was to play a major role in the formulation of Singapore's national
               economic development strategy.</p>
              <p>In 1960, Dr Winsemius led the United Nations team to examine 
              Singaporeâ€™s potential in industrialization. At that time, Singapore had 
              just attained self-government and was facing high unemployment and 
              growing population. He presented a 10-year development plan to transform
               Singapore from an <a class="mw-redirect" title="Entrepot" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entrepot">entrepot</a> trade port into a 
              centre of manufacturing and industrialization.</p>
              <p>His first emphasis was on creating jobs and attracting foreign 
              investment. Labour intensive industries, such as the production of 
              shirts and pajamas, were expanded. He also encouraged the <a title="Housing and Development Board" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Housing_and_Development_Board">large-scale public housing 
              programme</a>, believing that it would bolster the country's image, thus
               attractive to investors. One of his earliest pieces of advice was not 
              to remove the statue of <a title="Stamford 
              Raffles" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stamford_Raffles">Stamford Raffles</a> as it was a symbol of public acceptance of
               the British heritage and could alleviate concerns that investors have 
              toward a new socialist government. With his help, Singapore attracted 
              big oil companies like <a title="Royal Dutch
               Shell" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Dutch_Shell">Shell</a> and <a title="Esso" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esso">Esso</a> to establish refineries here.</p>
              <p>During his term as Chief Economic Advisor from 1961 to 1984, Dr 
              Winsemius worked closely with <a title="Lee Kuan Yew" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Kuan_Yew">Lee
               Kuan Yew</a>, <a title="Goh Keng Swee" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goh_Keng_Swee">Goh Keng Swee</a> and later with <a title="Goh Chok Tong" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goh_Chok_Tong">Goh
               Chok Tong</a>. He visited the country two or three times a year to 
              review economic performance indicators and to discuss macro-economic 
              strategy with government planners. In the 1970s, Singapore was upgrading
               its industrial capacity to use higher technological methods, including <a title="Electronics" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics">electronics</a>.
               He personally went to persuade large Dutch electronics companies like <a title="Philips" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philips">Philips</a> to set up production plants in Singapore. He also proposed that 
              Singapore could be developed as a financial centre, as well as an 
              international centre for air traffic and sea transport. Over the next 
              twenty years, these predictions proved to be accurate.</p>
              <p>Dr Winsemius retired as Singapore's economic advisor in December 
              1983, at the age of 74. He was then quoted saying, "<em>I leave with a 
              saddened heart. It (Singapore) has become part of my life, more or less.
               It can do without me. It could do without me years ago. But it became 
              part of my life. So I will shed a few tears, imaginary tears</em>." 
              Singapore was a country he regarded almost as home.</p>
              <p>For his contributions to Singapore's economic development, he was 
              conferred several honours. In 1967, President <a title="Yusof bin 
              Ishak" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yusof_bin_Ishak">Yusof bin Ishak</a> awarded him the Distinguished Service Medal. 
              In 1970, he was conferred an honorary degree by the <a title="National University of Singapore" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_University_of_Singapore">National University of 
              Singapore</a>. In 1976, he received the <a title="National Trades Union Congress" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Trades_Union_Congress">National Trades Union Congress</a>'
               May Day Gold Medal of Honour.</p>
              <p>Dr Winsemius died in the <a title="Netherlands" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands">Netherlands</a> on December 4, 1996. In a letter of condolences to his family, Lee Kuan
               Yew wrote: "<em>It was Singapore's good fortune that he (Dr Albert 
              Winsemius) took a deep and personal interest in Singapore's development.
               Singapore and I personally are indebted to him for the time, energy and
               development he gave to Singapore. I am proud to have known him and to 
              have been his friend.</em>"</p>
              <p>When asked about his life as an economist, Dr Winsemius once said, "<em>There
               is quite a lot of satisfaction, perhaps not like that of, say, an 
              architect who can look at something and say, 'I made it'. But there is 
              that satisfaction in knowing that you have contributed to the well being
               of people you don't know..."</em></p>
              <p>In <a title="1997" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1997">1997</a>,
               <a title="Nanyang Technological University" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanyang_Technological_University">Nanyang Technological 
              University</a> established the Albert Winsemius Professorship as a 
              lasting tribute to Dr Albert Winsemius for his significant contributions
               to the economic development of Singapore.</p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #004080; font-size: x-small;"><strong>Singapore's
                      economic architect was right about building the port,
                      right about the industrial push, and right again about
                      turning the country into a financial hub. But a fish once
                      proved him wrong. RACHEL TAN reports</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">DUTCH economist Dr Albert
                      Winsemius had an "annoying habit of being
                      correct".</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">Well, nearly always.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">A fish he caught in the
                      Singapore river in 1993 proved him wrong.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">Dr Winsemius had pushed
                      for the then polluted river to be turned into a highway
                      because he felt it was beyond saving.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">Singapore leaders
                      disagreed.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">Former health minister and
                      friend, Mr Howe Yoon Chong, took a 'bet' with him that
                      the river was still alive. A fishing trip was arranged
                      and Dr Winsemius had to eat his words.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">Mr Howe related what Dr
                      Winsemius, who had a wry sense of humour, said: "One
                      garoupa had sacrificed himself... to be caught to show to
                      me that the river can be cleaned up and I was
                      wrong."</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">The economist's daughter,
                      Ms Ankie Aeyelts Averink-Winsemius, 57, added it was a
                      family joke that divers planted the fish.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">A professorship at the
                      Nanyang Technological University has been named after Dr
                      Winsemius.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">Mr Howe spoke of how the
                      man, who only learnt about Singapore in his 50s, yet grew
                      to love it deeply. He first came to Singapore in 1960 on
                      a United Nations mission to "find out how this
                      godforsaken place could be fished out of this
                      morass".</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">He drew up plans to
                      transform Singapore and became its chief economic adviser
                      for the next 25 years. He worked for Singapore without
                      being paid.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">"All his trips here
                      were totally out of (his) pocket and pilgrimages of
                      love," said Mr Howe.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">Even till he died from
                      pneumonia last December, he kept up with Singapore's
                      developments through newspapers and official reports.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">Mr Howe believes Dr
                      Winsemius, who had survived two world wars, empathised
                      with the Singapore leaders who were building the country.</span></p>
              <p><img src="http://ourstory.asia1.com.sg/dream/lifeline/home.gif" alt="" width="190" height="56"></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">DR Winsemius made
                      Singapore a second home for his family. His daughter
                      Ankie Averink-Winsemius was the first to be roped in.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">Then working on a separate
                      UN project, she was called to "decipher his
                      handwriting" for his survey report on Singapore in
                      1961.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">"His handwriting was
                      so atrocious no one could understand it," she
                      quipped.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">Over the years she and her
                      mother accompanied Dr Winsemius on his regular trips to
                      Singapore and the region. She still visits yearly.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">"We become
                      Singaporeans for those short periods then," she
                      said.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">Two of her three children
                      have worked here briefly and her daughter Jolijn, 25, met
                      her fiance here.</span></p>

               was a Dutch Economist who was Singapore's long-time economic advisor 
              for his invaluable contribution to its development. He was a foreigner, 
              who had faith in Singapore and believed strongly in the fact that it had
               a future, at a time when not many people did.<br>Dr Winsemius' first 
              impression was anything but hopeful. "It was bewildering," he remembers.
               "There were strikes about nothing. There were communist-inspired riots 
              almost every day and everywhere. In the beginning one has to very 
              careful about passing any judgement - one does not know the country, one
               does not know the people, one does not know the men and women who are 
              trying to steer this rudderless ship. But after a couple of months the 
              pessimism within our commission reached appalling heights. We saw how a 
              country can be demolished by unreal antitheses. The general opinion was:
               Singapore is going down the drain, it is a poor little market in a dark
               corner of Asia."<br>Within a year, on 13 June 1961, the Winsemius team 
              offered Singapore a development plan. The final assessment was written 
              by Winsemius personally: 'Expectations and Reality' was his motto. This 
              was permeated with an emotional appeal for unity, a passionate warning 
              that time was running out if Singapore was not to sink away into the 
              mud. The gloom was not completely unrelieved, there was one bright spot 
              on the horizon: "In our opinion", wrote Winsemius, "Singapore has the 
              basic assets for industrialization. Her greatest asset is the high 
              aptitude of her people to work in manufacturing industries. They can be 
              ranked among the best factory workers in the world."<br><br>a) During 
              his younger days<br><br>He had been a cheese salesman in his younger 
              days and understood the importance of salesmanship and marketing 
              strategy.<br><br>b) Contributions to Singapore<br><br>He firstly wanted 
              to create jobs and attract foreign investment. Labour intensive 
              industries, such as the production of menâ€™s and womenâ€™s wear, were 
              expanded. He encouraged the large-scale public housing programme, as he 
              strongly believed that it would boost the country's image, thus 
              attracting investors. He advised that the Sir Stamford Raffles statue 
              should not be removed, as it was a sign of the British heritage. With 
              his help, big oil companies such as Esso and Shell set up their 
              refineries here in Singapore.<br><br>From 1961 to 1984, as a Chief 
              Economic Advisor, Dr Winsemius worked closely with Lee Kuan Yew, Goh 
              Keng Swee and Goh Chok Tong by visiting the country two to three times a
               year to check on the economic performance indicators and to discuss 
              macro-economic strategies with the government planners. During the 
              1970s, Singapore was upgrading its industrial potential to use higher 
              technological methods, including electronics. He personally persuaded 
              Dutch electronics companies such as Philips to set up plants in 
              Singapore. He also considered the fact that Singapore could be developed
               as a financial and an international centre for air traffic and sea 
              transport. He managed to fulfill those dreams of his, over the next 20 
              years.<br><br><span style="color: #000099;">Upgrading</span><br><br>The
               Separation in 1965 marked the beginning of the second phase. The 
              Housing and Development Board (HDB) started with an enormous building 
              programme, under the leadership of Mr. Howe Yoon Chong. "This was very 
              inspiring, people could see what was being achieved.<br><br>On Sundays 
              fathers and mothers showed their children in what kind of new dwellings 
              they would live presently. In that same period the government succeeded 
              in interesting, just as had happened in Holland fifteen years earlier, 
              big oil companies like Shell and Esso in establishing refineries in 
              Singapore.<br>The third phase was that they started as soon as possible 
              with the upgrading. Singapore became very active in promoting education 
              for technical jobs, especially for the electronics industry. In the 
              beginning it was quite a difficult job for me to convince people at the 
              top of the big Dutch electronics company Philips to set up production 
              plants in Singapore. Doctor Winsemius went to Eindhoven, where the 
              headquarters of Philips are situated, to warn them: you have to hurry, I
               told them, otherwise there is a very real danger you will be too late 
              and then you will be sure to miss the boat in the growing market of 
              Southeast Asia.<br>The result is that Philips is now one of the big 
              investors in Singapore and is doing a very fine job here.<br>The fourth 
              phase was to make Singapore an international financial centre. Formerly 
              the young state was bound to the English pound sterling. I knew a 
              Dutchman who had lived and worked in Singapore; he was an employee of 
              the Bank of America in London at that time. I visited him and told him 
              we wished to transform Singapore into a financial centre for Southeast 
              Asia within ten years. He told me it could be done in three or four 
              years. He took a globe and showed me a gap in the financial market of 
              the world. Trading, he explained, starts at nine o'clock in the morning 
              in Zurich in Switzerland. An hour later London opens. When London 
              closes, New York is already open. After closing time on Wall Street, San
               Francisco on the American west coast is still active. But as soon as 
              San Francisco closes, there is a gap of a couple of hours. This gap can 
              be filled by Singapore, should the government not shun taking some 
              drastic measures - such as cutting its links with the British pound.<br><br><span style="color: #000099;">Shaping Singapore</span><br><br>He 
              helped shape Singapore to move away from Entrepot trade into 
              manufacturing and industrialisation, to attain full employment, higher 
              standards of living and to transform itself into a financial centre for 
              Southeast Asia.He also aided Singapore to become an international centre
               for air traffic and sea transport. And his plans were fulfilled within 
              20 years.<br><br><span style="color: #333399;">His later years</span><br><br>Dr.
               Winsemius was awarded the Distinguished service medal in 1967. In 1970,
               he was given an honorary degree by the University of Singapore. In 
              1976, he received the National Trades Union Congress' May Day Gold Medal
               of Honour.<br>He retired at the age of 74 in 1983 shedding a few tears,
               as he regarded Singapore as his own home. He passed away at his home in
               Holland on 4 December 1996 </span><br><br><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms;"><span style="color: #333399;">His

               Winsemius passed away in December 1983, at the age of 74.<br><br>This 
              is what he said when he left.<br><br>"I leave with a saddened heart. It 
              (Singapore) has become part of my life, more or less. It can do without 
              me. It can do without me years ago. But it became part of my life. So I

              <p><br>sometime selling sotong and men briefs on the street is better than having so much foreigners and disparity of the elites and poors. If you will to ask me, i would said that as long as we are happy, living within a moderate lifestyle for all, peoples be motivated to strive for the best with the country. So, without Winemius, we could be better off, because there might be no LKY, no PAP and certainly, no high cost of living here.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, try to look at thing from a different perspectives, my former humanity teacher always asked me, there are great thinkers and peoples in this world, without them, do you think that the world will be a better place to live in??</p>
