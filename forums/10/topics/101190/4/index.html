The real world is getting more and more fluid and sporeans who have always depended on the govt to foster a relatively more stable environment (which is getting harder) has got to learn to adapt better to today's conditions. Frequent reinvention of your own circumstances is required if you do not want to be rendered obsolete.</div>

I am not referring to NTUC ,which is one useless union. NTUC is good for supermarket discounts, chalet bookings etc but not changing any work conditions.<br><br>Technically under my current work contract  , I cannot be fired unless I breach my duty in a negligent fashion, be unfit in health or lose my visa status -  all thanks to the worldwide shortage of my profession .  However I work in the public sector overseas , not the private sector.<br><br></div>

I have frickin competencies every year - which is good in a way . Keeps you on ur toes.<br><br>Really , what I see here truly differs from what I see in Singapore. There is so much talk in singapore keeps talking about upgrading skills - however master degrees scholarships are only given to the "selected people with leadership qualities"( the academic elite)  and they bond  for a long long time (like 3 years).<br><br>Over my side here - sponsorship of master degrees are given to people on the basis of work experience and potential ( not because they do specially well in the academic arena)  and they only bond you for about the duration of the course.<br><br>That is why I prefer to work overseas than Singapore , like so some of my fellow singaporeans.</div>
