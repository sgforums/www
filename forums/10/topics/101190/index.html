You said that you spoke to one who has migrated and he has the chance to buy a car and a house. Can I ask you do you know how much is the currencies there? It's much more than Singapore currencies. You shouldn't look things on one side. You have to look on both sides.<br><br>Even though you said that government has gained profit through HDB etc.... what can you do? Complain? You are being childish! You are now serving your National Service here and you have two years to complete.<br><br>To migrate to oversea, first of all, you must have the money to do so. Second, you must have qualifications. If you dun have either one of them, no matter how you said or mentioned, won't help.</div>
