Yes they save our country's face from Amnesty International out of love for us....NOT because AI was actually blaming the government instead of the country.<br><br>The locals , despite the government loving, are so untalented that we need foreign talents .The ministers are so specially selected that they need to be the highest paid ministers in the world. Yes they deserve the a million/year pay because they  make more sacrifices and contributions than impoverished families.  The ministers are so specially talented that if they end up in the private sectors instead - they are not at risk from the american "hire and fire" system. Yes We should all worship the government....sincee they did so much for us. Never mind if the top orders the poor and struggling elders to accdept less pay- even though some of the top elders is paid very very well .<br><br>All hail our government for making so much sacrifices for us commoners.<br><br>I will worship the government from outside of Singapore as a foreign talent. Thank you ,government for the policy that shows to stay is to be a local untalented ....to go out of singapore is to be foreign talent , like our foreign talents in Singapore<br></div>

They send their people out for skills they lack in or try to train them domestically.<br><br>Anyways I am a foreign talent now in Australia . So in a way Singapore's policy on FT has taught me one thing or two. Difference between those Singapore FT and me , I get called a quitter for leaving my country in search of opportunities while they are not called quitters by their own countries.<br><br>What i don't like to see is locals without jobs , while FT are holding their jobs , or locals working under FT (unless it is an MNC).  I just tell you lar....1st and 2nd class talents don't come to Singapore- they go to USA /Europe/Australia. Even Australia 1st class talents want to jump to USA. So go figure what class of FT Singapore is getting. Remember 1st and 2nd class taken up...which leaves 3RD CLASS talents which no other countries are interested in.<br><br>Then we have foreign workers , especially from China and India , who are classed as talents as well , willing to work for less. From Singapore, they jump to Australia and then laugh at Singapore- why I know? Because i met some of the "talents" who jump ship from singapore to Australia.  They thought I was malaysian so they badmouthed Singapore all the way. of course I keep diam diam because I want to see how much they say and it was alot.  That is why FT policy makes my blood boil.<br><br>YES!- fame and glory will happen when you go to Singapore. ...or  no...was it USA?<br><br><blockquote><br><br>They are paid more because of their responsibilities. The social wont work paying people with lesser responsibilities more well paying people with more responsibilities less. ........<br>All in all, if you dun like the current government's pay. You can raise it to them or ....next time dun vote them. But it just seems to me that most people are alright the pay...<br><br>[/b]</blockquote>arrr...I think the USA president , who incidentally is paid less than our ministers, work harder to run a huge country with multiple resources. The Australian PM has to run A CONTINENT with multiple resources  and he is paid less. We can even cut it down to state level. NSW and VIC are  bigger than Singapore but even the state governments have to regulate the multiple industries they have. And the Federal government has to oversee the state governments.  Singapore only has one resource - human  , and one state and one capital called Singapore. WOW A singular resource is such hardwork.....yes the ministers deserve 1 million /annum for running JUST only ONE resource.<br><br>Walkovers....how to vote? Vote WHAT? They placed conditions on OVERSEAS voters - only government and civil servants who stay out of the country indefinitely can vote . Otherwise no vote for us commoners who don't stay 2 out of 5 years to vote. They should cover the 2 out of 5 years rule to EVERYONE . Even Australia OVERSEAS voting don't have that rule. BUT THEN AGAIN.....Who cares? We all know the end result .....people being people will always vote for the fella who threatens to take away their crumbs..oops I mean offer not threaten.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Lokks like fymk's covered most of the key points here already, so I'll just throw in my two cents' worth of what the overall picture is.<br><br>As someone else has mentioned, we don't know where the money is, or even how much we have.  If you put your money into a bank, and when you try checking your balance, the ATM displays, "Sorry, we can't tell you", what would you say?  Why should the case be different for the money that is held by the government, that in theory belongs to us?<br><br>For years Singapore has been bragging about its educational standard, and now we have a shortage of talent?  What happened to that wonderful educational system of ours?<br><br>The government justifies ministerial salaries by saying, "You pay peanuts, you get monkeys", and at the same time tells people that they shouldn't be fussed with the salaries they are offered during a recession.  Perhaps Singaporeans should adopt the old Soviet philosophy: "As long as they pretend to pay us, we shall pretend to work" - but no, the powers-that-be wouldn't stand for that, would they?<br><br>The government takes pride in the racial harmony we find in Singapore - it is an achievement to get people from such different cultures to live together.  Then again, they seem to have forgotten that such diversity is the result of immigration, and when the immigrants' descendants do as their forefathers did, they are labelled "quitters".  Then again, I'm surprised they haven't progressed to using the term "traitors".<br><br>What is the common thread in the four examples above?  It's the glaring inconsistency that shows up when the relevant facts are put together.  Yet Singaporeans insist on taking a macro view of things, compartmentalising everything so that they can take a look at one piece of information and say, "It's not so bad" without having to worry about the bigger picture.  Maybe it's time we woke up and realised how badly we've been scammed.<br><br>Sure, you might say that there's too much democracy in other countries - I look at the Australian government's shadow-government system and wonder how they ever gat anything done - one side will automatically oppose the other's propositions unless a war breaks out.  Then again, such debate brings out issues that the people do need to be aware of - after all, it is up to them, and not any corrupt-practices legislation or exorbitant miniterial salaries, to keep the government honest.<br><br>It's not a case of cheaper cars and houses - it's a case of getting the respect that an individual deserves, regardless of his or her race, language, religion, salary, education or political affiliations.  Then again, the Singaporean pledge doesn't cover the last three conditions, does it?  Just too bad.</div>

I will tell you how the american corporate system works. MNCs pay the upper levels of the organization very well. However , should they fail their shareholders, they pay a price. It is a hire and fire system in private companies especially american ones. The CEOS , VPs, board of directors etc are paid million dollar salaries to keep the shares up. Shares go down - their heads roll, they lose their directorship and sometimes everything.<br><br>Now for ministers, whose heads are going to roll more? The government justifies payment by the virtue that ministers could earn more in private sectors. Therefore the payment by virtue makes the ministers as liable as in private sectors.<br><br>Ministers are a governing body . Salaries come from taxpayers, who are like shareholders.  They are elected to rule , almost like the board of directors. Any bad decision will affect the country itself - a population of millions rather than tens of thousands ( as in the MNCs).  Unlike MNCs , these decisions do not just affect financials , it has a widespreading effect on social structures, healthcare and other essential structures.<br><br>You cannot deny that there are failures from the system :<br>Let's apply the corporate america strategy here<br>1. Education : we need foreign talents, therefore there is a failure to train locals to attain the so called global competitive edge. Teachers are not happy.<br><strong> point : Education minister's head needs to roll. Minister of Manpower and Minister of National Development have better evaluate the current and prospective job markets  . Both deserve a huge pay cut </strong><br>2. Sports - Singapore still lack the elusive Olympic medals despite importing "talents"<br>point : Minister of Sport's head needs to go. Minister for Manpower have better evaluate what type of talents we are importing or else he goes too.<br>3. Finance - Minister of finance have better give Singaporeans a transparent accounting of all finances used like Annual Reports of the corporate world.<br><br>I could continue  but I shan't . <strong>People have to understand - the government was never given the mandate to rule us totally- they were given the power to make Singapore a good country to live in and work in for Singaporeans . This is not in the ancient imperial time when the King was GOD.<br><br>The government serves Singaporeans for the GOOD of all Singaporeans. The Singaporean TAXPAYERS are the employers of the government. The government is owned by these taxpayers - Singaporeans ARE NOT OWNED by the government. Yet some singaporeans chose to listen to the almighty words of the government , instead of the other way around. Nor did we give them the power to redraw electorate boundaries every time an election is looming </strong><br><br></div>

Singapore is a small island so it is difficult to have large population. BUT you don't see everybody in the world go to Australia or USA. Many still choose to immigrate and stay in Singapore.

I see that what you have stated is not a failure in our system but a inevitable result of our demographical constraints.<br><br>You see that the lack of talent in here in Singapore is due to the failure in our education system. But didnt you know that most developed countries in the world not exclusively Singapore are also in the talenthunt race? Are you going to say that their education system fail as well and that their government are ought to be removed.<br><br>As i had said before that Singapore have talents in various fields but definately not ALL fields and therefore it is crucial for us, like many other countries, to import talents so as to make up the gap. Why is there not enough talents in some fields? Well i will be damm surprised for a country with 3.5million people to have talents in all fields while large countries like Australia and USA do not have. So how can be our education system at fault?<br><br>I agree with you that the top global talents will always go to the US or aussieland due to their depth over there. And what make that depth? The depth in those countries are either made by their local talents or in most case by local talents and pioneering foreign talents imported. I wont be surprised in the future, top foreign talents in certain fields will choose Singapore over the other countries like what u are seeing now in our Bio-medical research hub. And with that depth make in Singapore by our local and foreign talents, we will better able to train our next generation for that field. It is something like building an empire out of nothing and the limited local talents and the imported pioneering foreign talents will be our foundation. It is like without foreign talents for our SAF, you think we can be such a strong force now after building it from almost nothing?<br><br>U have further the argument to why despite the foreign talent, Singapore still cant get the medal. I will bring it back to what you say abt top talents going to countries with a field depth.  You see, Singapore's sporting culture is still at infancy and certainly we lack of that depth. As u had said (which i agree) that because of the depth issue, we wont get the best global talent here. But is it so that our third class foreign sporting talent here is useless? I beg to differ. I find that it is anytime easy to train our local talents with foreign talents than training them with nothing at all. Our foreign talents scheme for sporting event is at infancy, give them some time to mature dude. So i wont say it is the minister's fault.<br><br>So i wont totally blame the govt for the foreign talent thingy. For your info, everything in our life are shaped by local and foreign talents. From our SAF to our economy to SIA to education system are by these people. It shows that foreign talents have been a stepping stone for them and i will put my bet on other developements.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Good points, foxtrout, but that still doesn't get around the fact that something's gone wrong with the system to create the dearth of local talent, and going by fymk's corporate comparison, quite a few ministers would have had to resign already.  This goes back to fymk's central point about ministers being paid corporate-equivalent salaries, but without being exposed to the risk that corporate leaders face.  Helluva sweet deal they've got.<br><br>You argue that not all fields are being covered by foreign talent - fair enough.  However, if the number of fields and the associated foreign talents is large enough for the locals to make noise about it, doesn't that in itself say that that number is way too large?<br><br>With the number of Singaporeans studying overseas, wouldn't they have brought the foreign talents' knowledge back to Singapore with them?  Why are they not doing it?  Perhaps we should consider that the locals do indeed have the talent, but are being under-utilised by the powers that be.  With such lack of recognition, fulfilment and plain decency, is it a wonder why we have enough of a brain-drain to induce the desperate "quitters" ploy?<br><br>Corporate leaders don't get to say, "Okay, I screwed up - let's start agin", because they are held accountable for the salaries that they are paid.  For the money they get, ministers need to be answerable for their results or lack thereof, and saying, "Sure, there have been failures, but....." just doesn't cut it at that pay scale.</div>

US is the nation of immigrants and Auzi started as a settlement for convicts from England. World's great immigrations started since 1820, and have always been into these two continents. Immigration rules in these two countries take into accounts many factors including rights of family union, asylum for those under persecution. In Singapore we only want a bigger population to build a credible domestic economy. But the island is only so small so there must be criteria. The attraction/opportunities and constrainsts are therefore very different.<br>Besides, the yankees and the ozis can hold dual citizenships while singaporean must denounce yr citizenship when you hold another passport. that makes a lot of difference for those who want to apply to migrate.<br>Mainland Chinese do not spit on Singaporeans, but some singaporeans think too highly of themselves, especially many of those who study in overseas universities.<br>In singapore we don't have everything, but we make do with what we have got.
