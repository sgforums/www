Whose side are you on anyway, mine? <img src="http://instagiber.net/smiliesdotcom/otn/realhappy/xxrotflmao.gif"><br><br><blockquote>It is stupid and ignorant to compare Singapore with US and Auzi in the respective immigration policies. </blockquote>Agreed .  So why did you bring it up then?  After all, I just responded to your post.  Are you calling yourself stupid and ignorant?  I'd agree with that too!<img src="http://instagiber.net/smiliesdotcom/otn/realhappy/xxrotflmao.gif"><br><br><blockquote>US is the nation of immigrants and Auzi started as a settlement for convicts from England. World's great immigrations started since 1820, and have always been into these two continents.</blockquote>Sure, they're both a nation of immigrants, but how does that differentiate them from Singapore?  And what's the point of the 1820 reference?  If you want a relevant year, you could use 1840, which is when the British stopped sending convicts to Australia.<br><br><blockquote>Immigration rules in these two countries take into accounts many factors including rights of family union, asylum for those under persecution. In Singapore we only want a bigger population to build a credible domestic economy. But the island is only so small so there must be criteria. The attraction/opportunities and constrainsts are therefore very different.</blockquote>So let me get this straight.  Singapore's a small place, and they can only afford to take so many people, but they're still happily taking in foreign talents instead of looking for resources within?  That's an insult to Singaporeans, isn't it? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br><blockquote>Besides, the yankees and the ozis can hold dual citizenships while singaporean must denounce yr citizenship when you hold another passport. that makes a lot of difference for those who want to apply to migrate.<br>Mainland Chinese do not spit on Singaporeans, but some singaporeans think too highly of themselves, especially many of those who study in overseas universities.</blockquote>Those who study in overseas universities?  Where were you during that fracas with that Chinese student saying that Singaporeans were dumb?  Was it the overseas-educated Singaporeans making a hue-and-cry about it, or was it the locally educated ones who shared classes with them, and the ones who complained about losing class places to Chinese students?<br><br>You're making things up as you go along, aren't you?<img src="http://instagiber.net/smiliesdotcom/otn/realhappy/xxrotflmao.gif"><br><br><blockquote>If you are out, we welcome your comment but WE decide if your 2 cents comment is worthy of listening pleasure.

Companies in other countries have to make a strong case for hiring FT before their foreign employees are issued visas, to not only ensure that the locals are given shots at jobs in their own countires, but also to ensure that the local population grows with the demands over the long term.

Conversely, if, as you now insist, it's an ongoing thing, what's your problem with discussing it?  Oh yeah, I forgot, you change your tune according to convenience. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br><blockquote>Not so sure if Qitai is in Singapore or in NZ but it does not matter, their views and positions are well respected as they do respect others.
