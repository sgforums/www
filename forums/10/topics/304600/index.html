            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span class="large">Medisave balance of $33,000 adequate for hospitalisation needs: Khaw </span><br><br>Tue, Jan 22, 2008<br>The Straits Times  </strong><br><br>SINGAPOREANS have an average $13,600 in their Medisave accounts, which can cover up to 13 Class C or 10 Class B2 hospitalisations.<br><br>Coupled with their MediShield, the current Medisave balance of $33,000 is sufficient to take care of most Singaporeans' basic hospitalisation needs, said Health Minister Khaw Boon Wan.<br><br>But he acknowledged that as hospital services are upgraded to meet rising expectations of patients, and new medical technology is brought in, costs will continue to rise. And with this, the demand on Medisave will grow.<br><br>He said that is why the Government has periodically adjusted the Medisave minimum sum, currently set at $28,500, and the Medisave contribution ceiling, at $33,500.<br><br>Mr Khaw said this in his written reply on Monday to a question from NMP Eunice Elizabeth Olsen, who had asked if the Medisave balance of $33,000 was enough to pay for eight years of treatment, given a recent Ministry of Health survey which found that Singaporeans suffer eight years of poor health.<br><br>Responding, Mr Khaw said the MOH survey on poor health refers to ill-health of varying severity, and being in ill-health does not necessarily mean a person requires hospitalisation.<br><br>'Many of us continue to lead a normal life with our health being less than perfect,' said Mr Khaw.<br><br>He explained that Medisave is designed to help Singaporeans cope with their hospitalisation expenses at the Class B2 and C level.<br><br>'On average, Singaporeans have $13,600 in their Medisave accounts. This amount is sufficient for 13 Class C or 10 Class B2 hospitalisations. Coupled with MediShield, it should take care of most Singaporeans' basic hospitalisation needs,' said Mr Khaw.<br><br>He also stressed the need to preserve Medisave savings for our age, and whenever possible, Singaporeans should work to increase these savings.<br><br></div>
