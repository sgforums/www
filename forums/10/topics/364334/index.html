              </span></p><p id="articlecontent"><span>SINGAPORE: Five years ago, they were a rare sight in Punggol Central. These days, foreigners make up roughly 10 per cent of the estate's residents, or so Mr Charles Chong reckons going by the number he meets on his door-to-door visits. <br><br>The ward's Member of Parliament reckons they are flocking there for various reasons: It's a new town, housing is cheaper compared to mature estates, and it is close to the new industrial areas that have sprouted up in the north-east. <br><br>While foreigners have added to the constituency's vibrancy, integrating them has also become a priority. For instance, a Cricket Interest Group was formed to get new citizens involved in community events. Mr Chong suggested this after noticing migrant groups playing the sport in the empty fields across his estate, which has 48,000 residents. <br><br>"If left on their own, they would form their own enclaves," he said. "By offering them a common group, we try to assimilate them together, and integrate them into our society as well." <br><br>In the past two years, about 400 Punggol Central residents have taken up Singapore citizenship or permanent residency, according to Mr Chong, and this is reflective of a growing nation-wide trend. <br><br>Last year, some 20,513 foreigners took up citizenship here, while 79,167 more took up permanent residency. This is up from the 17,334 new citizens and 63,627 new PRs in 2007. <br><br>Acknowledging that more needs to be done to integrate new immigrants with locals, a National Integration Council was recently set up. And such efforts at the community level are as important to avoid misunderstandings and fights. <br><br>For instance, Mr Chong cited how, at the Holi Dhamaaka Festival in March – which is celebrated mainly among Indian immigrants here – he was showered with coloured powder. While it is considered a blessing among them, however, it could make Singaporeans who don't understand the ritual see red, in more than one sense, noted Mr Chong. <br><br>The same goes for the habits of China nationals who may talk too loudly or appear too pushy to their neighbours, he noted. <br><br>One community in Sengkang that has formed a group to showcase their culture to residents are the Filipinos. <br><br>Resident Janet Quek said she has had no problems with her new Filipino neighbours, though there were times they may have played music a tad too loudly. <br><br>One neighbour's reaction was to complain; Ms Quek chose to strike up a friendship with them: "Reaching out could just take a simple 'Hi' that could go some way to preventing any future misunderstandings." <br><br>Other than new migrants, Punggol Central grassroot leaders have reached out to another oft-misunderstood group nearby. <br><br>The Sengkang Community Club Women's Executive Committee has adopted a ward in the Institute of Mental Health. <br><br>Once a month, members either take some of the patients out or visit them. The aim is not just to bring them cheer, but also to bridge the gap between the patients and the community's residents. <br><br><br>- </span><a class="path" href="http://www.todayonline.com/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">TODAY</span></span></a><span>/so <br></span></p>

              <p>Yes, more foreigners will add to vibrancy of Singapore.</p>
              <p>I suggest import more foreigners to Singapore. Why not add another 4 or 5 million foreigners, bring them over here to add vibrancy to Singapore?</p>
              <p>I suggest add some foreigners to parliament also to increase vibrancy.</p>
              <p>Most of the MPs are like dogs, only follow what their master says, no opinion of their own, so import foreigners may add vibrancy.</p>

              <p>Foreign workers are also human and they have a different culture with us and also with other foreigners who are working. It make sense to build some understanding with them since they are part of the population here for quite some time. Maybe in the future, Singaporean will required to adapt to them and not they trying to adapt to 'our society' which is already falling apart as our local population drop and drop.</p>

              <p>The PAP has sensed that their streak of political good fortunes cannot run continuously with the 3.5 million Singaporean electorates, of whom only 1.5 million had actually participated in any election process over at least the last 15 years.</p>
              <p>If the election process had involved all the constituencies - without any walk-over that lay off almost 2 million Singaporeans from casting their votes - there is a possibility that the PAP will not get the same 66.6% result as in Election 2006.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To overcome any possibility of the "freak results" that MM LKY had said of Singaporeans decision to vote in an Alternative Political Party - the PAP had opened the flood gates to new immigrants who will at least vote PAP in the next one or two elections - simply out of gratitude from the change of circumstances in their lives.</p>
              <p>What change is there for Singaporeans who have tolerated the PAP and their sham policies of supporting Singaporean Citizens, who have served National Service and lived through all the PAP economic and social experiments since 1957 ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is time for Singaporeans to register our political views in the next Election that will be due in either an early election in 2010, or when the PAP term expire in 2011.</p>
