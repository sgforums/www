              <p><br>There are many more need to be "saved".   What I emphasized was that China govt pay pension.   IN sg it is different.  WE the people pay the ruling party pension, they don't give us pension.  INstead they going to force us to buy our own pension which is annuity.    Like that the china people understand.   </p>

              <p>the economy factor itself is unstable..from 1986 to now Sg has gone thru 3-4 recession..with each time rocovering more slower than the last.</p>
              <p>in 1986- sg own recession</p>
              <p>1997-SE Asia economic crisis</p>
              <p>2001-911 incident (if that counts)</p>
              <p>2008-2009-wold wide economic crisis</p>
              <p>with each incident, the number of people  sporeans losing jobs goes more, while the FT/FW workers also grew more.</p>
              <p>while companies abuse it to "axe " local and get their official excuse to hire FT/FW,i believe a recent repot on the ST where these companies are using the IC of locals to physically not working or were ex employees but still put them in the list so as they got their Ratio citeria and permission to hire more FT/FW.</p>
              <p>add the recent implenented system to boost those companies who need help, the sux part is like what the opposition has stated-prone to abuse again..with no proper checking rules to ensure the genuine from the fake.</p>
              <p>guess we have to thank for our govt for allowing it to be abused.</p>

              <p>He said this :</p>
              <p>"When you ask Singaporean residents for feedback, they will complain that they have to wait more than 15 minutes for the bus. But when you ask new immigrants, they are happy that the bus comes in under 30 minutes."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1. Are you comparing 1st world with 3rd world or developing nations? There was hikes after hikes on transport fares alone in the last few little years. How much is the transport fare there? How small is the place there to provide transport services? How far does singapore commuters need to travel compared to 3rd worlds ? How much our talents paid compared to theirs?  </p>
              <p>Want to compare ? SURE ???  Okay, compare with 1st world Swiss standard . Their transport on the dot. Want to compare? Compare with French 'MRT'. Its service Frequency is superb. Miss any train, no issue , another one on the way in a flash or short while.</p>
              <p>2. I disagree with his method of comparison.</p>
              <p>3. I ever worked with many FT colleagues before. They also complain the waiting time what. So, what is his Basis for his comments? What is the sample size used? Who are the foreigners he talking about? Are there ZERO foreigners who complain the same way as singaporeans?</p>
              <p>4. How do you know they happy that bus come in under 30 minutes?</p>
              <p>Who happy? Which one? All happy? Could some foreigners have higher expectation also?</p>
              <p>I suggest there be a public debate held to talk to him. Like this clearer and more spontaneous.</p>

              <p>He said this :</p>
              <p>"When you ask Singaporean residents for feedback, they will complain that they have to wait more than 15 minutes for the bus. But when you ask new immigrants, they are happy that the bus comes in under 30 minutes."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1. Are you comparing 1st world with 3rd world or developing nations? There was hikes after hikes on transport fares alone in the last few little years. How much is the transport fare there? How small is the place there to provide transport services? How far does singapore commuters need to travel compared to 3rd worlds ? How much our talents paid compared to theirs?  </p>
              <p>Want to compare ? SURE ???  Okay, compare with 1st world Swiss standard . Their transport on the dot. Want to compare? Compare with French 'MRT'. Its service Frequency is superb. Miss any train, no issue , another one on the way in a flash or short while.</p>
              <p>2. I disagree with his method of comparison.</p>
              <p>3. I ever worked with many FT colleagues before. They also complain the waiting time what. So, what is his Basis for his comments? What is the sample size used? Who are the foreigners he talking about? Are there ZERO foreigners who complain the same way as singaporeans?</p>
              <p>4. How do you know they happy that bus come in under 30 minutes?</p>
              <p>Who happy? Which one? All happy? Could some foreigners have higher expectation also?</p>
              <p>I suggest there be a public debate held to talk to him. Like this clearer and more spontaneous.</p>

              <p>Must understand pee ay pee, they compare on things that benefit them for eg comparing public servants, pay and pay ministers' salary with those of the corporate ppeople.    </p>
              <p>WE are just so shortchanged to have such a greedy, selfish, self serving ruling party in Singapore.    The sad thing is they will continue to rule generations after generations.  </p>
