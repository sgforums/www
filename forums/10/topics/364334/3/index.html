              <p><br>Most expats tend to treat this place as a "hotel" because they can. The govt allows them to do so. Many Singaporeans like you find it unacceptable and intolerable, but the expats couldn't care less, simply because they are here because the govt welcomes them; it has nothing to do with the people.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Also, for many (or most) expats Singapore is not the last stop. It's merely en route to a PR or citizenship in Oz, NZ, UK, Canada, or US.  The govt knows this, the expats know it, the citizens know it....but there's no remedy. If the govt tries to enforce NS, no one will take up citizenship. And if they try to retain CPF money, few will take up PR. See, it's a vicious cycle. The govt wants new citizens/PRs, but cannot succeed if they change the rules now.</p>

              <p>I don't get the bold parts.</p>
              <p>With regards, to the TS's article, it makes senses to integrate new migrants into our society because they consists a big part of our population for the time being. Anyway, this is globalized era - networking with people from all the over world would probably proved to be useful in the future. Just like what happened in the past, our ancestors came here to find new opportunities, and in turn their descendents have the advantage to network with other asian countries because of our heritage.</p>
              <p>With influx of workers, yes the job market is becoming more competitive. It caused alot of frustration and pressure. For any policies implemented, there is always pro and cons and It is about balancing the pro and cons. The government made a lot of decisions based on benefits of the economy and most of the time it kills the social benefits. But you think about it, everybody will be enjoying some of these benefit as long our economy continue to prosper - though there are some additional problems that come along with these benefits.</p>

              <p>I think there will be a very destabilising effect on national identity if the flooding of foreigners continues.</p>

              <p>...The once almost universal equivalence between residence and
                              citizenship may be weakening. If the ideological state continues to
                              develop its likely characteristics, persons of different ideologies and
                              thus of different allegiances may become intermingled on the same
                              territory. The number of refugees and resident aliens is now increasing
                              in most countries...</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>It would be interesting to find out the ratio of resident aliens in Singapore and local born citizens and compare it with other countries.</p>
              <p>I think it would be one of the highest, if not highest in the world</p>

              <p>Charles Chong, I would rather you think of more ways to help create jobs or improve public services than go and talk about "integrate migrants" into Singapore society.</p>
              <p>Now economy is bad, people cannot find job, but still hear you talk bullshit about integrating foreigners into Singapore society really makes me want to give you two tight slaps across your mother fucking face.</p>
