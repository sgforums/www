              <p>Will the opposition win more seats in the coming election given the unhappiness over the influx of foreign workers and talents who take away the rice bowls of the citizens and the rapidly rising cost of living ?</p>
              <p>The opposition will definitely get more votes from the unemployed citizens and their families. But this might not translate into higher percentage of votes for the opposition as the huge influx of the new citizens who will likely to vote for PAP.</p>
              <p>In addition, the drawing of the election boundaries might not be in favour of the opposition. Moreoever, the opposition lack finances to field candidates in all the constituencies. The opposition also lacks of strong candidates and with insufficient ground support and logistics.</p>
              <p>The only factor that is in favour of the opposition will be the internet whereby they can reach the voters. </p>
              <p>There are more issues that the opposition can raise for the coming election. However, whether the opposition will be able to turn these issues in their favour depend largely on their abilities to plan and implement its plans and strategies.</p>
              <p>One issue is that should the opposition makes known its new candidates and policies as soon as possible so that more voters can get to know them and their policies OR should the opposition only makes known its new candidates after the election date is announced but by then it might not be enough time for the voters to know the new candidates and their policies.</p>
              <p>Hand in hand to this issue is that PAP will get  a lot more time to dig and tackle the new candidates if they are known to the PAP before the election date.</p>

              <p>If the efforts and pre-emptive actions of the albino gorrillas are to be studied carefully - there is certainly concern that the Alternative Political Parties will make some inroads in the next election.</p>
              <p>It will not be a surprise that the gorrillas will double their efforts to design new plans to hamper the abilities of the Alternative Political Parties to travel a smooth road going forward to the coming election.</p>
              <p>For the Alternative Political Parties to succeed in any ways, it will need Singaporeans to be as brave as the Singaporeans who will step forward to be nominated to stand on the side of the Alternative Political Parties.</p>
              <p>Without Singaporeans support there cannot be success for the Alternative Political Parties, and it will require Singaporeans to follow the footsteps of the generations of 1950s who gave a younger LKY without any political experience to hold public office.</p>
              <p>This time, the history of past vile schemes of deceit and power plays are all known, and Singaporeans should be prepared to resist being succumbed by the obvious fear tactics that will surface again to move Singaporeans to cast their votes that will cement the albino Gorrillas into power again.</p>
              <p>The albino gorrillas have always taken advantage of uncertain times to capitalize on the worries and fears of Singaporeans for their future, and will stretch such concerns and fears to their advantage.</p>
              <p>This was used before by LKY during the uncertain times in the late 1960 when the British announced the withdrawal of their military force from Singapore.</p>

              <p>The by-election strategy adpoted by the opposition has worked well.</p>
              <p>The opposition should bring it one step further.</p>
              <p>The opposition should contest only one or two GRCs and field the strongest team members (could be from different opposition parties but compete in the election under one party) and let all the voters know well in advance so that the voters in the targetted GRCs will be familiar with them and policies.</p>
              <p>Let the voters know that PAP will still rule the country (must admit that the opposition still do not have the capability to form the government) and urge them to vote for the opposition so that the opposition will be able to prove that it can run the GRC as well, if not better than the PAP just like Mr Chiam's record of running the single seat constituency as well as the PAP single seat constituency.</p>
              <p>In addition, the opposition will be in a better position to voice the voters' frustration against the PAP policies in the parliament.</p>

              <p>Good? Only 1991 please. In 1997, the opps has lost 2 of the 4 seats and in 2001, the remaining 2 opp saw a decline of their support despite they still hold their seats. And there is a traditional of whenvever an election is held in a year ends with 1 (E.g 19X1 or 20X1), it will have freak results to PAP (Except 2001, That was freak to opps). Hence, the by election strategy is a failure.</p>

              <p>The by-election strategy did not work in 1997 because the opposition especially SDP has quarrel among themselves. Remember, Mr Chiam is "forced" to leave SDP and form SPP due to CSJ and some SDP members.</p>
              <p>The by-election strategy works well when the opposition put up its strongest candidates and co-operates and work as a team.</p>
              <p>In the last election, WP has put up a good and strong fight as it puts up a very strong team while SDP fades into oblivion. The by-election strategy is also adopted by the opposition in the last election.</p>
              <p>Hope that in the coming election, the by-election strategy will work well when WP, RP, NSP and SPP will put up strong candidates and co-operate and work as a team to achieve the goal of winning 1 or 2 GRCs and 3-4 single seats constitutency.</p>
