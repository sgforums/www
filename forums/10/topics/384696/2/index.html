              <p><br>Does everyone possess an eagle eye with its own preferred methods at hunting successfully ?</p>
              <p>Sadly a reminder is not too late that even an eagle with a sharp eye will miss its catch, it needs more to achieve personal wealth and to continue growing it.</p>
              <p>If your methods are "fail proof" - you should make more money becoming a financial guru then continuing to work after your "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">first 1.5 yea</span></em><em><span style="color: #0000ff;">rs</span></em>".</p>
              <p>Like all the good sales people, they talk alot about success, but fight shy talking about their failures - which are often left to those with more wisdom to recount and warn others how to avoid pitfalls.</p>

              <p>NOBODY's going to suck your cock because you're a retarded peasant. The only way you could ever get your cock sucked is if you paid for a PRC whore in Geylang to do it.

              <p><strong>The thing is, in Singapore and the rest of the world, SUCCESSFUL men get their cocks sucked.</strong></p>
              <p>They could either afford it, or they get lots of pussy because of their success and eligibility. YOU, on the other hand, will never have your cock sucked by anyone else you didn't pay, although you could probably only afford $10 and hence could only afford paid cocksucking in third world countries.</p>

Are you the part of the intelligentsia? If without outstanding brains, are your parents comfortable? Were you one of those packed to Goldsmith or USC or BU or UCLA at 17 or 19, with parents who automatically knew they would only send their children overseas to fancy universities? Did you live a day outside of Singapore, not counting your Chan Brothers tour package to China?

              <p>Is that all there is inside a pathetic "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">inside story</span></em>" ?</p>
              <p>Which side of the amoebic IQ are you using to drive your DICKHEAD to look for the watering hole from which you exited into your deluded world ?</p>
              <p>Or has the prostitute blew a hole into your DICKHEAD even at birth, to help you find your way to a successful birth ?</p>
              <p>Did the prostitute continue blowing hot gas up your arse to help you believe that success in life is guaranteed by clutching golden papers from some US Ivy League ?</p>
              <p>For one who will deride others as dumb peasants, are you certain that tracing your own roots will not arrive at some dumbest peasants with IQ of a plant ?</p>
              <p>Three generations have always been a guide in tracing successful families, and this can be clearly seen with your pathetically amoebic IQ and EQ displayed, which surely is the familiar signs of failure that will doom the family lineage. Mark these words.</p>
              <p>The Third Generation is not always a charm - and you certainly cannot be any more a charm as a Dickhead.</p>

              <p><br> Does everyone possess an eagle eye with its own preferred

              <p>Sadly a reminder is not too late that even an eagle with a sharp
                      eye will miss its catch, it needs more to achieve
                      personal wealth and to continue growing it.</p>
              <p>If your methods are "fail proof" - you should make more money
                      becoming a financial guru then continuing to work after your
                      "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">first 1.5
                      yea</span></em><em><span style="color: #0000ff;">rs</span></em>".</p>
              <p>Like all the good sales people, they talk alot about success,
                      but fight shy talking about their failures - which are
                      often left to those with more wisdom to recount and warn
                      others how to avoid pitfalls.</p>

              <p><br>Which period would you include as the baby boomer generation that was really poor ?</p>
              <p>Did Stevenson101 consider his parents to be the "baby boomer generation" ?</p>
              <p>If you do, perhaps you must be younger then Stevenson101 considering the arrogant petulance in your insolent attitude, which ironically reflect an amoebic IQ that failed to grow with the seeds left in some animal womb.</p>
              <p>For a DICKHEAD, you should find a place to cool your dick first before it get lopped off and leave you hobbling to wonder why you are not wanted here.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><br>Which womb did you come from to tell the wrong "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">inside story</span></em>" that even LKY had even brush off as not even concerning Singapore ?</p>
              <p>For a DICKHEAD with a gung-ho attitude, it looks like you got your brain stuck in your arse, and your dick in your mouth.</p>
              <p>Which country are you claiming to be yours ?</p>
              <p>Are you sure you got out of the womb in the right country when the pathetic "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">inside story</span></em>" whined by a DICKHEAD is all stuffed with the U.S. sub-prime issues ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>From one with an amoebic IQ that failed to grow from an animal's womb, it is not surprising that the true "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">inside story</span></em>" is its familiarity with all the traits of a rabies infected bitch - as evident in all its raving whines.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">inside story</span></em>" is finally revealed in all its glory.</p>
              <p>The "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">inside story</span></em>" of a DICKHEAD is that it enjoys a good suck, and obviously has got its dick sucked the wrong way for all the pent up petulance exploded.</p>
              <p>Can a dumb peasant be worst then a DICKHEAD that needs to be guided by its DICK ?</p>
              <p>Obviously, it knows LKY better then anyone in Singapore from the "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">inside story</span></em>" that it knows about the SUCCESSFUL PERSONS getting sucked.</p>
              <p>Or did the DICKHEAD got its head blown and got it confused with it being sucked ?</p>
              <p>It looks like the full "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">inside story</span></em>" has yet to be revealed.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">inside story</span></em>" is that no one should accuse anyone of being immature until they get old enough to disagree with others.</p>
              <p>Is the "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">inside story</span></em>" not fully revealed that you have been arguing with yourself all the time since birth ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If the "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">inside story</span></em>" is that "<span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>SGforums</em> <span style="color: #000000;">(is)</span> <em>where the dumbest people in SG converge</em></span>" - what possibly could be the "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">inside story</span></em>" of its dumbest existence here ?</p>
              <p>If stupidity lead to poverty, what good can success be when the "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">inside story</span></em>" needs the prostitute to blow success into its dickhead ?</p>
              <p>Is it any wonder that the "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">inside story</span></em>" of its IQ is already infected by its amoebic beginning with the possibility of HIV at birth ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>With the world filled with peasants, what is the worth of an "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">inside story</span></em>" on this planet of plants ?</p>
              <p>Is it any wonder that its IQ and EQ remains at the amoebic level ?</p>
              <p>It should not have left the animal womb from which it came.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The  "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">inside story</span></em>" should never forget that it is a DICKHEAD that has yet to be successful beyond its amoebic state, even as it will delude itself waving angrily with a big dick which can only be no larger then a plant twig.</p>

              <p>But still, I find your methods too exhausting. At your age, probably it's fine, but I hope your next plan works off well (I think it's the one you told me) so that the next stage is less hard work, more expansion of income.</p>
              <p>Good luck :)</p>

              <p>The world is forever changing. It's up to each individual to realize that, and not lament that life is unfair.</p>
              <p>Instead, accept that life is unfair (sometimes more fair to you, sometimes more unfair to you), and think about what you can do to attain your goals or dreams.</p>

              <p>From a Gen Y perspectives,</p>
              <p>Govt expect the Y gen to further sow what the O gen had left behind, and it is a blessing that most of our O gen who are savy and thrifty left behind a well of wealth for us, the Y gen, to savour.</p>
              <p>Wealth creation depends on many factors, from governing policies, to environment, to location, personal risk factors, foresight etc etc and with a bit of luck added. It is not entirely the govt responsibilites, the govt can provide you the space, the skill and education, the condition and the opportunity, but if you are not shrew in business, nerdy in approach and alway contented with a wage earning life that cannot get rich nor get poor but stuck in between which most typical singaporeans are, then you blame no one for not creating wealth for you. Beside the govt already create wealth for the Y gen by their earlier policies of productivity, saving, investment opportunity and good wages in the 70s and 80s for the Y gen parents, who works like mad dogs and end up the Y gen gaining from it. So, to me, like my Dad left a sum and asset for me, he struggled and toll thru all his life, save and save, now old already, i just walk over and take it, so if you said govt failed to create wealth for the Y gen, i think that is not true.</p>
              <p>Alot of these oldies from the 70 and 80s are still saving like crazy, even at 60 and 70++ they still want to earn and save, just like most of our govt peoples do, but you cannot take that along in your coffin.  </p>
