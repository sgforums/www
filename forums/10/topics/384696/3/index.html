              <p>It is obvious that a "zwei-siao-Hog" too embarrassed of its country of origin, will strut on its toes as a psuedo-Bavarian Hog and divert attention from itself as a Turd from a Turd World Country of Turdistan.</p>
              <p>Is it in any position to claim others to be not worth of being called a Singaporean - even as it will hog its role as a "zwei-siao-pseudo-Bavarian-HOG" in a Speaker's Corner ?</p>
              <p>So much for its pseudo-pride in its pseudo-claims of its pseudo-interests for Singapore - and it is not a surprise that it will find some other Fraudsters to hang on to its trousers as both attempt to delude each other of their ass-pirations.</p>
              <p>What does it matter to a "zwei-siao-Hog" if SDP "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">should gets into power</span></em>" ?</p>
              <p>Does it even know what should be coming its way, as long as the "zwei-siao-Hog" gets the swill that will still be gathered to be delivered to a special pen for "zwei-siao-Hogs" suffering from men-o-pause ?</p>

              <p>Because like most Singaporeans do, he expects a silver platter with silver spoon infront of him all the time. Provided you ah kong is damn rich, you may have it now, otherwise, keep working and breathing.</p>
              <p>"the rich get richer and poor get poorer" dun really apply in Singapore, i had seen a lot of poor people childrens graduated, work and become big bosses and of course rich, Singapore is a place of opportunities, that phrase or saying only suit some third world countries. In Singapore, if you dare, hardworking, smart, clever, educated and dare to take risk, you can go up and own a few bungalows, otherwise you can go on chanting the phrase of the rich gets richer and the poor gets poorer.</p>

              <p>The pathetic "zwei-siao-HOG" will find it hard to shake off the "zwei-siao" label that it will wear as a Gucci outfit that is fit for a "kuchi-kuchi kid".</p>

              <p><br>Actually i would disagree.</p>
              <p>There is very tight control on the HDB and the system discourages speculative buying so i see very little basis for a bubble to form. I believe it would only happen under the effects of multiple severe recessions and major unemployment.</p>
              <p>And if it really happened, it's more of the effects of the recessions and unemployment not neccessarily a real esate bubble.</p>
              <p>After all, it is in the interest of the government to make sure they could maximise the money they could get from us but not enough to cause mass poverty.</p>
              <p>Private homes...maybe but i don't see it capable of forming a bubble big enough to ripple to the HDB market. Most of the population after all still lives in the HDB.  </p>
              <p>Now, what's happening in the China real estate would be a real bubble.</p>

              <p>Of course Singapore is doing good at the moment with 5.2% unemployment, and it is expected more factories will close in 2010 as more factories will move to lower cost centres of lower labor, lower land cost, and lower recurring costs that are charged for essential services in doing businesses. </p>
              <p>Was this Structural Unemployment been a failure on the part of the "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">great thinkers</span></em>" in bringing industries here without the proper manpower in place, and with more high value jobs created too early and too fast that see these jobs being taken by foreign talents - as Singaporeans are still under-going training ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>With the aged Singaporeans being encouraged to work after age 55 and up to 62 or 65, can these experienced older folks be fairly paid at half their original salaries, and with equal work load as before ?</p>
              <p>Are there fair and equal terms offered to the aged Singaporeans - when the hire and fire powers are arbitrarily held by the Employers with the NTUC approved short term 3 to 5 year employment contracts ? </p>
              <p>Has it not been the situation that by the time even younger Singaporeans are pushed through the education system to graduate for the selected high value industry, the technology has been superceded by newer developments that require new issues and new training ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Pride and ego only - or has it not also been guided by Confucian morals that LKY and his PAP Government insist on hammering into Singaporeans to change their values ?</p>
              <p>Will any Singaporean lower their pride and ego to participate in the Flesh Trade of a Taiwanese 'hum' ?</p>
              <p>Obviously, no Singaporeans will want to take on a lower class job in the Flesh Trade, which the Taiwanese 'hum' will control the payout to be "<em><span style="color: #888888;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">lower with less benefits</span></span></em>". </p>

              <p><br>Sorry, mistake, thankyou teacher for correcting, the world should be interconnected, type to fast already. Didn't know teacher really read what i wrote.</p>
              <p>oK, here is my answer for the rest of the question beside those hummmings.</p>
              <p>In late 1960s, when our wise economy Minister, Mr Goh Keng Swee, decided to open up singapore into an industrial economy, we already knew that to do that we need Foreign Investment, as we lack resource and capability to provide ourselve a vibrant economy. Base on a bare thread domestic economy is not going to make what you and me are today. Thanks Mr Goh for his swee swee idea and plan, we enjoyed all these years of prosperity. But Mr Goh at that time, already warn that whatever happen, we depend on a global economy, there are risk in it, but the risk is worth taking, because the pros outweight the cons. We must serve the global market, if not, our dollars in your bank and our life will not be that strong and respected. As much as we can deviate from any risk as we employ thinkers, certain crisis can hit us hard on, but with thinkers as buffer, we expect only a great global economy failure that hit every countries can shake singapore economy, and that when economy rebounce, our thinkers will be the one to helps us bounce back fast and furious.</p>
              <p>In earlier 90s, when i was schooling, i already heard about structural unemployment from LKY, his foresight is good, he said that "we cannot go on making bata shoes, soap, shampoo, "A" brand plastic wares etc etc,  we cannot go on making lower grade jobs that depend on lower skill, our neighbours are catching up with us , and with a seniority base wage system, high cost of land and property, we can never compete with them, i said (he adjusted his trouser, his usual trademark and very seriously said) we must take on a knowledge economy"</p>
              <p>Uncle, i agreed with you that we had moved too fast that most people failed to catch the bus that is alway moving forward, as i said many times, Singaporeans should be bosses if they are able to take on the words of LKY earlier or at least an owner of certain big property and business. The main failure here is to what i see, is education, we failed miserably to educate our people to be bosses and shrew entrepreneurs, instead we churned working class people, good working class people, so to speak. As much as the school reformed itself, I would say it is still not enuf to give the that niche of innovation and business class.</p>
              <p>I quote my taiwan experience, in school, they are given business project to complete, they got entrepreneur club and lesson to fulfill, they are taught on ownership and private property, having said that, because taiwan had so much people, the opportunity greatly reduced, but you can rest assure taiwanese are more daring and willing to take risk. By 40s to 50s, taiwanese enrolled themselve to study business rather than working skill,  the taiwanese come out with a rule of 45/38, 45yo being for man and 38yo being for woman. It is said that by 45yo, as man, if you want to study, you should study business, and for 38yo woman, it is the same. Turn your working skill into business, for eg, if you are good a good Machinist, learn how to open a machine shop and run it as boss, if you are good in sowing, by 38 yo, you should learn how to start up a clothing business.</p>

              <p>Because like most Singaporeans do, he expects a silver platter with silver spoon infront of him all the time. Provided you ah kong is damn rich, you may have it now, otherwise, keep working and breathing.</p>
              <p>"the rich get richer and poor get poorer" dun really apply in Singapore, i had seen a lot of poor people childrens graduated, work and become big bosses and of course rich, Singapore is a place of opportunities, that phrase or saying only suit some third world countries. In Singapore, if you dare, hardworking, smart, clever, educated and dare to take risk, you can go up and own a few bungalows, otherwise you can go on chanting the phrase of the rich gets richer and the poor gets poorer.</p>

              <p>All children rich or poor, have equal opportunity for education here, and in most other places, up to a certain level. Not all have the opportunity for overseas university education if their parents can't afford, many have to forego university to work to relieve their fathers who are sole bread winners. On the other hand, many don't have to give a cent of their salary to their parents because their parents are rich. Some who are very fortunate will probably inherit a house from their parents so all their money can go to investment to make more money, in fact, if they are the only son of the family, everythings that belong to their parents will be theirs,....and there are still some who have pocket money to buy shares when they are still undergrads....</p>
              <p>Hardwork, smart, clever, educated,....are necessary, but that's not all. It is easy to say how others can own bungalow, the fact is if you are starting from scratch, it will be a long while before you can smell a bungalow.  </p>
              <p>If I have money, I have a headstart, even if you think you are smarter.</p>

              <p><br>To become Rich and stable, Struggle and suffering is inevitable, my grandfather leave behind a wealth that may last 3 generations, that is what most chinese of those years suffering and struggling said, if 3 generations of your remain rich, you are rich. And wait for a stupid wasteful playboy son to siphone it and declare yourself bankrupt, what you struggled now, may not reap now, it is your future generation that grip your wealth and hopefully carry on to expand the richness in whatever business in their endeavour. If you dun headstart, when i u going to headstart. If you notice singapore true rich people 50% are not from well educated people, and because of less education, they tend to dare to take risk, die die nevermind, nothing to loose, but if you ask a graduate to venture into a business, he will start calculating the risks and fears, and of the other 50% are from rich grandfather, ah kong money.</p>
