Unless you are implying that our almightly system is too weak to handle some alternative voices that we need to leap at the chance to make our media quite worthless in the sense of the word?<br><br>And yeah we wondered what happened to Speakers Corner, go ask any man on the street what was with that, and I doubt you get the answer that goes "it was a threat to our economic prosperity and stability and we see no use for it.", and more of "there were so many regulations in place and OB markers that it was more or less like the ST forum." Another "safe" and "bland" way of showing that we have the freedom to express alternative opinions but actually being another thing entirely.<br><br>Indeed, even if you disagree with the people in here, could you at least take the effort and show some basic courtesy by refraining from posting vapid and one-liner paragraphs that put nothing proper out for discussion?</div>
