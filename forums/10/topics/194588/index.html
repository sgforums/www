I am saying that the one man-one vote democratic system is not sacrosant and it does not resolve practical issues on the ground. Contrary to what you said, Ceylon was far more stable during colonial times. One needs strong government to put down social unrest that can unravel a nation. Look at Yugoslavkia after Tito died. In a way, I think Ceylon's experience has influenced the way Singapore is governed and lends support to the GRC system.<br><br>UK is a terrible example to cite. They haven't had the experience of dealing with significant minority populations as they exist in Ceylon or Singapore, and now face increasing racial unrest in cities in the north where the minority population has become more vocal. The tragic events on July 7 last year are a sign of their failure in this respect. The terrorists who bombed the London underground weren't foreign Muslim radicals...they were homegrown.<br><br>Singapore has its share of racists and we cannot allow the country to descend into chaos because some irresponsible elements (and I have seen plenty in this and other forums) post racist and defamatory remarks. Strict laws are necessary to curb such action and if we have to limit freedom of speech to some extent, that is a price I am more than willing to pay.<br><br>Our current laws do not prosecute you for making remarks opposing government policies and certainly people in this forum are not afraid to make such remarks. But if you would make unjust personal attacks and defame someone, surely the law must protect the victims.<br><br>The Opposition parties can do better to engage minority races than they have done so far. The loss of a certain constituency in the recent election was in part due to the Malay support for the ruling party. The WP must reflect and consider why this is so..<br></div>
