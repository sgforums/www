            <div class='col-md body'><br><br>It is no surprise to me. The more corrupt, the more money they (rulers in Asia or the world) make, unlike USA. Look at Myanmar for example. In Myanmar standard although in International standard Myanmar is regarded as a very poor country, the illegal Generals (rulers) make in Billions (Kyats) annually Myanmar money and Myanmar standard they are Billionaires (1,000,000,000 and over) of their nation. As for me it is NOT the amount of money that counts, it is the truthful, transparency and legality of lawful system that counts with Â“corruptionÂ” as low as possible in fact zero percent of Â“corruptÂ” system, laws, principles that counts. In USA, it is a nation FOR the people, BY the people, OF the people (excellent Constitution) thus it is people who are superior/richer than rulers for rulers are just the SERVANTS of the people who elected them every 4 years and these SERVANTSÂ’ job as PRESIDENTS is to serve the interest of the people. These Â“servants/rulers/PresidentsÂ” are just given Â“temporaryÂ” power BY the people, FOR the people and OF the people to do job for the people and the salary is restricted at certain amount. The intention is to give reasonable amount of money and NOT to make the ruler/President rich!. ThatÂ’s why it is the PEOPLE or PRIVATE citizens who are richer than Presidents, much much richer as Billionaires. There are many Billionaires in America, the most Billionaires maker of the world indeed.<br>In other words the POWER stays in the hands of the PEOPLE/CITIZENS of America.<br><br>The point is, IF the legally elected, voted President did NOT do his job (with a reasonable pay) which is the interest of the people/nation FIRST and NOT his personal wealthÂ…Â…Â…that President is Â“votedÂ” OUT from the job in 4 years (maximum) and sometimes when there is Â“impeachmentÂ” it is much shorter. The true power is in the hands OF the people, BY the people and FOR the people only. Case rest!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>myanmar military rulers is rich because they have precious stones, jade.<br>it kinda different type of corruption compare to singapore, USA or even china.<br><br>yes i agree with you that more money doesnt no corruption.<br>i strongly urge govt to restructure theoir workscope for the civil sector. open their eyes and ears openly and see for themselve that most ministries are in fact overstaff. the very reason why it seem there aint enough manpower is because of poor human resource planning, redtape and low productivity of our civil service.<br><br>but hey, which country in the world civil service aint that bad?<br>thus it dont justify for their pay rise.<br></div>
