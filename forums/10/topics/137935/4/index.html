            <div class='col-md body'><br>well the last I heard from a couple of the MIW was that we are the reason for our own situation and should never look to the government for any handouts - ir shift the blame.  I wondered about all the housing debt and stress and high cost of living we are now having to put up.. I suppose that MIW will come tell us that we are all hallucinating. Upon rare times when I watch parliment - Lee was saying our cost of living was lower and he compared to the base year 98 (It was the peak of the boom period) and based on that, said that our cost of living has instead gone down (he was so happy to announce that - but I guess he thinks no one understand economics).<br><br>Besides, what's the point of telling anyone. Its not as if they understand or will do anything. Its not their pockets that is hurting or that their daily lives are hard. For example, we cram into MRTs everyday, pay so much more and still service suck, plus no improvements at all for all that increases in costs to everything we had been hammer with.  But to MIW, earning5 digit figures, driving in big cars. 2-3 cents increase is til them nothing but its something to those who make 1K and having to take public transport.  Here's an analogy:  Bush had reading skills issues. when it hit home, then he started a foundation to help people who had trouble reading. But he's not an iraqi suffering the current terrible life or the life during the wars. So its easy to order a shoot and kill or the people ove there. Its easy, he will not have to live through the loss nor suffer the consequence of his own actions.  Sama sama.<br><br>The fact that going to the system we might be charged more. For example the last fiasco about public healthcare bills/services compared to private... Well some MIW commented we are not communist and should not force public healthcare to lower their price just because some private healthcare is able to provide better and cheaper healthcare... Well.. that sums it all up.<br><br></div>
