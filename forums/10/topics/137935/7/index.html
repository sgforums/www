Because your grandfather was not LKY therefore today you have to migrate. do you want to make your grandchildren migrate?<br><br>Most in singapore know about the biaseness of the pro bumi system but do we realise exactly how it affects our lifelihood? In KL, if you have money, staying in Bangsa area, then you will have less problem. You don't realise how many things taken for granted here. Take water supply, you get regular brown water from your tap and you need to change your water filter once every 3 weeks!! No exaggeration. Always plan to send your children overseas, like coming to singapore, I was told.<br><br>You need to live in a place to know what it is like. You see nothing travelling there as a tourist. I travel all over the world except Africa and south america. In the beginning, with money, everywhere is comfortable, but after 3 weeks, the most comfortable place is back home where my family and friends are.<br><br>Respect your decision to migrate, it is a bold move, but pls remember those in singapore as singaporean, not PAP worshippers.<br><br>cheers.<br><br></div>

Hmm...what abt alternate tax...like GST, ERP, High petrol cost, high housing cost tat's sucking s'porean high n dry??<br><br>To be frank, i have lived extensively in both countries and assuming with 3000 bucks (the currencies abt the same in both countries)...my quality of life is much much better in aussie land. I have my own landed house, brand new car and still have much to save. In singapore, cant even start a family, got to get my parents to down the deposit for my 4room hdb flat...<br><br>Try talking to the hdb heartlander, everywhere i heard is complains...</div></blockquote>Alternate taxes? Well, when GST was implemented in July 2000, it started at a whopping 10%! Bus fares went from $2.50 to $2.75 for short distances (2 zones:10-20 min ride) &amp; private bus companies were charging $3.20 for the same distance. It was then that I truly appreciate what we had here. Bus freq can be 45min and service ends at 6pm in some suburbs. Shall not start on the expensive and inefficient train system.<br><br>ERP? Well, you have to pay toll to use highways and it's worse cos not many uses electronic so you have to wait to pay toll or have the correct change to throw into toll machine. You get horrid jams at peak hours. Parking is expensive in city... $6 p/hr.<br><br>Currency at same level? No way! Hasn't been for over 3 years and in range of 1.24-1.30. This will affect tourist &amp; student expenditures.<br><br>When were u there? Cos the info u provided seems outdated. Cost of living has gone up a lot in Australia. Regular detached houses in suburbs, 30-45min from Sydney (Leave Perth out, that place is on its own) can cost $750k to over $1M. With home loan rates at 7.3%, how much of your income goes to repaying for your place? Go buy economic rice in food courts? $6-$8... where got cheap?<br><br>It's very different if one is staying as a student and if one actually works there. While I was there, I spoke to many who migrated and despite the landed house and car, they admit that it is not as easy as it seems. If you want to migrate, better migrate with money. Otherwise, there will be little savings and with some superannuation funds ('CPF') in the red, one will worry about the "promised" pensions.<br><br>I love Oz for hols and travel there annually. But racism, paying high taxes to sustain the other half of the non-working population (I hope that both do not happen in Singapore) and many other factors are why I will not migrate.<br><br>I'm not saying that Singapore is perfect... far from it but Oz is definitely not what is seems.<br><br>Grass always greener...?</div>
