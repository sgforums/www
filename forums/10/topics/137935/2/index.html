It is not easy to run a country, that I agree, but there are always improvements to be made in everything that's done or being done, especially for complex things like this. It is not easy to change the mindset of people, especially a mindset that he has created himself. Is LKY that altruistic? he worry abt what govt will be like when he is gone, or he afraid of PAP losing power when he is gone? Ok, I daresay that whether or not there is public holiday when LKY dies is not very important by itself, but the fact that such a suggestion/question is made kind of gives away sth, doesn't it? The fact that they care about their own entertainment does show sth abt SIngaproe, doesn't it? Perhaps that it's too stressful a place to live in?<br><br>Anyway, why do companies need to accept everything? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"><br><br>the sad pikamaster<br><br>P.S.: Don't be so quick to point the "useless" finger at others.

But they seem to cling on to their past belief that by confucianistic moralizing the population on their leadership abilities or presumed abilities or talents everything will  be taken care of and we will get out of the woods.<br><br>Leaderships and talents are the basics of any society or political system. There is no need to harp on such and look-good conceptual stuff. Leaders must possess real abilities and talents to run a country - that is understood. But the way it is done here, it is made to look conditional on finding among our leaders having talents or abilities presumably because they lack those abilities.<br><br>What is important is: do our leaders have the sense of commitments and mission to accomplish what they once set out to do, altruistically to achieve a certain solid and accountable programs for the good of everyone to keep up with China, India, Korea etc and not just for the good or high salaries of the elites claimed to be the world's best in their self-presentation.<br><br>Finland, Switzerland, Denmark, Korea, Taiwan and Japan achieved many international economic competitiveness without all these self-aggrandizements.<br><br>It is time to grow up and act real and produce results instead of all the moralizing and conceptual stuff. Lead from behind, support mass participation programs to spread practical knowledge application and coordination by all. Open up the whole process of political renewal and economic upgrading to the masses and get them on board. That is the way forward is to be objective and accountable and do away with past narrow self-proclaimed abilites and propaganda-driven management.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Do we love our country unconditionally first or when we get something back then we will love? Maybe some of us do love our fellow people and identify with sg, but did it happen the other way round.. But somehow, it is only when we slave away our miserable lives and still our country tells us we are not good enough. They rather listen to FT/elitist academic scholars, not only look at the young spoilt kids and think they are the only future, promote things that are irrelvant to us, goldplate things and make the surface looks good but basically everything is rotten inside. Every common man carried the york to move this small country forward and without everyone of us, those people would not be up there talking down so loudly to our own people as if they are better than us (Some guy commented SG people got no "service genes" - is he not a sg? Then he even worse to make such a comment!). But there's very little appreciation than to quickly brush us aside the moment we contribute less to the economy like discarded old shoes. We earn our owe keep through cpf, but its being sapped away though all the GLCs and whatever monsterous money sucking machines like ERP, COE, transport, ntuc and whatever. We had to take up so much more work (compare us to any angmoh country and look at their labour laws. Look at ours and you'd know how shortchanged we are. Not that we should follow but at least be aware that being a worker over there has more protection and rights from their own government!) and stress for some one to have million dollar annual salary which is higher than US president. (These people will continue to be paid after they retire cause you cannot expect them to work in any place anymore) And yet the common man also forgot that there are more of us together then the so called 'leaders' who run the country on elitist concepts with very limited democracy. But no one rasied a voice and accepted quietly that this is just a land we happen to be born on. Fortune or misfortune. Sometimes its hard to tell. Somethings I myself is appreciative of but somethings, I wish we can do without. But who dares says anything anymore when it can be held against the person ? Who dares to play the devils advocate when all people up there running the country wants only pats on the back and to hear what a good job they've done? Who dares to go against the system when they can easily repo your assets and make your life really miserable? Who wants to say anything, when we had repeated ourselves dry and over many times and yet, the leaders choose to ignore, call us full of complains and think we don't have 'service dna' and continue to do whatever they please ?  Would they be able to make that change amount that small elit group of people as fasst as they force all those changes onto the common voiceless people? I doubt very much so. Its their fat belly against the thin belly skins of the common, broken man. the common men no longer have any spirit left to fight for anything or have drive for anything cause we cannot be sure if we can survive another day.<br><br>Just know that the people who make the policies do not live our daily lives as we do.<br>And they do not have to care as long as it looks good on paper.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Politics have never be easy. That's why there are only a few credible people who truly want to be politicians.<br><br>Running a country, no matter how big or small, always has its own unique difficultes. Running Singapore is also different from running a big country like China or the United States.<br><br>Nonetheless, no matter how difficult it is, it can be done. Reforms can be launched, realistic goals can be reached. Recessions can be reversed back into economic growth.<br><br>But no matter what happens, people and politicians must know that in politics, there's an expiry date for almost everyone. At one point, people will start believing that you are becoming irrelevant to the current form of politics. If you are young when that happens, you can still re-invent yourself.<br><br>Bill Clinton did that when he was Arkansas governor and later when he was running for the presidency in 1992.<br><br>Whereas, when you are as old as LKY and your views are still stuck primarily on the issues such as communist rebels, old appliance of the ISA, family-run companies and monopolies and iron fist rules, then simply put- it's time for you to retire for good.<br><br>Instead of slowly looking like an old fossil and your reputation going down the drain as time passes. LKY is slowly becoming irrelevant as times goes by. In young people's eyes, he was a legend but they dunno why is he still there. In their view, he should have retired for good by now.<br><br>And that's what I feel strongly about. LKY should have gone from the political scene for the last 16 years.</div>

Hw wants to change so that ppl think he is working, eg, there is a time when u want to enter U, u need SAT, after that another new education minister comes in he scraped it, he used us like we are guinea pigs, n then when an indian minister comes in he wants changes to the Chinese Syll, does he understand chinese lang or not or he is just puppet under control. Education in singapore is so stress , so early in primary school want to do streaming, EM1 EM2 what the F***. Good ones go one class, no good ones stay together one class , dont study, u expect them to improve? wrong policy, ppl still blind, they say government no good, but election they voted PAP. Singaporeans are really..... dont know how to describe them</div>

But they seem to cling on to their past belief that by confucianistic moralizing the population on their leadership abilities or presumed abilities or talents everything will  be taken care of and we will get out of the woods.<br><br>Leaderships and talents are the basics of any society or political system. There is no need to harp on such and look-good conceptual stuff. Leaders must possess real abilities and talents to run a country - that is understood. But the way it is done here, it is made to look conditional on finding among our leaders having talents or abilities presumably because they lack those abilities.<br><br>What is important is: do our leaders have the sense of commitments and mission to accomplish what they once set out to do, altruistically to achieve a certain solid and accountable programs for the good of everyone to keep up with China, India, Korea etc and not just for the good or high salaries of the elites claimed to be the world's best in their self-presentation.<br><br>Finland, Switzerland, Denmark, Korea, Taiwan and Japan achieved many international economic competitiveness without all these self-aggrandizements.<br><br>It is time to grow up and act real and produce results instead of all the moralizing and conceptual stuff. Lead from behind, support mass participation programs to spread practical knowledge application and coordination by all. Open up the whole process of political renewal and economic upgrading to the masses and get them on board. That is the way forward is to be objective and accountable and do away with past narrow self-proclaimed abilites and propaganda-driven management.</div></blockquote>Land Acquisition Act, it is such a bullied.  Many lands were aquired and paid to previous land owners with dirt price.  After acquiring of the lands, the gov just leave the lands there for nothing.  When in good time, the gov will take the opportunity to auction it off at high price.<br><br>Many industrial parks and factories are vacant.  The gov over priced the land value; the rate they charging is ridiculous which resulted high operating cost in business.  when in good time, they took the opportunities to call for tender by taking the advantage of market force to bid for the small cake.<br>Capitalland, JTC &amp; HDB are the giant landowner which they will be the ones to control the price,  they would rather leave the land empty if the market is bad or low demand.<br><br>Why can't they let us earn more pocket $$$ instead of charging high rentals, high utilities bills, expensive properties, expensive postage fees in such a tiny island and etc.  All they know is to dig into our pockets by monopolise the market.  They are only good in deepen their own pockets.<br><br>Take for example, the Telecom and internet Charges.  The setting of the network infrastructures on this tiny island is nothing and much much much much much cheaper as compare to other countries like Australia, Canada and etc.  Still, they charge as they wish by measuring their profits that someones personally owned incredible amount of shares.  <span class="large"><strong>What justice is this?!!!</strong></span><br><br>Hypocritic gov!!!</div>

Which country don't. This control is absolutely necessary. If a company has no control over their employees, what is going to happen? If the parents do not control their kids, what is going to happen when they grow up? Can SG go without control?<br><br>Can SG afford a small faction of peole who goes around creating problems if they are not controlled? JI is an example. Can we afford to have riots, violence, crimes, triads... etc evey now and then? Look at our safety and security standards. They don't come just like this. It requires effort from leaders.
