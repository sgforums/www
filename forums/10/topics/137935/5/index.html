Whereas in Malaya/Singapore, the Malay rulers willingly gave up their traditional authority to the British Residents. Of course, the Pangkor Engagement was open to interpretation, and some descendants of the Perak royalty claimed the Sultan had been fooled. It was only after the Japs started stirring $hit that hatred for the West took root. But then again, Japan was worse.
