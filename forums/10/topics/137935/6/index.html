Housing cost is not high, considering the fact that we do not have much land here.  At least, most ppl can afford a decent flat to live in, with the help of CPF.  You may think that government is sucking us dry by forcing us to save money in CPF.  But we have to admit that this generation is so spoilt that we do not know how to save anymore.<br><br>ERP, High petrol cost .... Well, if a person chooses to live in luxury of driving to and fro work every day, ERP and petrol cost is nothing to him (it is his choice after all).  Likewise, if you choose to live in the private condo, you cannot complain paying the high maintenance fee every six months cuz it's your choice.<br><br>If you complain about insurance and road tax, how much is it every year?  It is nothing, compared to having to pay 40% income tax every year, right?  If you earn $4000 a month, $1600 goes to govt's pocket.  Since income tax is only paid once a year, can you imagine every year, when the income tax filing is up, you have to start scratching your head, thinking of how to pay the 5 digit figure of income tax.  Even our AWS and variable bonus can't cover that.<br><br>But of course, it is personal perference.  If you prefer to own a landed property (owning a landed property in Aust, which is so cheap) and buy cheap cars, and at the same time, don't mind paying income tax with almost of your salary, then of course Aust is anytime better.</div>

Remember, not all singaporean are PAP worshippers and singapore is not built by PAP alone!!!<br><br>[quote]</div><div class="quote_body">and take what was written in our local media with a BIG pinch of salt -&gt; for example, many Singaporeans believe China Chinese are very hardworking. NOT SO. Many of them enjoy 8-5pm work life balance and 5 working days! Another misconception is China media very restrictive. Again NOT SO. China media did alot of social work by exposing many im-moral businesses and government officials. In Singapore what? Just NKF?</div></blockquote>NKF is indeed a big lesson for singaporean and it just remind us that our society is by no mean better than any other societies in the region. we have our life style, and misconception about other societies? there will always be. If you have travelled as widely as you claim, why don't you show some comparisons about the different societies in the region, anything singapore can learn and do better?<br><blockquote><div class="quote_from"></div><div class="quote_body">Try travelling more will ya? ....So let me repeat again. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Travel more </span>and you will see that Singapore is not very much different from KL, Beijing, Shanghai, Japan, etc.</div></blockquote>Beijing and Shanghai are two very different cities and even the ppl there think very differently! How can KL and Japan (tokyo, kagoshima or Sapporo) be not much different??<br><br>If you choose to look only at the misgivings, ill treatment or whatever bad experience you have had in singapore, you will only see the bad things about singapore and you WILL have the misconception that everything outside is better. Then you are blind to the beautiful world. Flowers are not of the same colour, trees are not of the same heights, birds don't sing the same tune, cities cannot be "not very much different", ppl cannot be the same!!<br><br>don't need to repeat yrself, just speak the same language as we do here.
