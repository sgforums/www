            <div class='col-md body'>Re the topic, Singapore will.....<br><br>go on as usual.<br><br>The tabloid type news magazines like newsweek and Time magazine will likely splash his mug on the front cover, while more respectable publications like The economist will probably mention his death on one of its back pages (unless of course it was a really really boring week).<br><br>The Singapore media will of course plaster his face all over the front pages and the paper will be peppered with quotes like "I am very sad that our Great Leader has passed on. After all, it is dues to His foresight that we are where we are today" and "Even though i do not agree full with him all the time, i respect him for what he has done" (this will likely be some opposition member).<br><br>Watch for the glut of Full-page offer of condolences in the ST's obituary section by all the huge companies who can afford it (After all, his son IS the Prime Minister).<br><br>No doubt ALL Singapore TV channels will be broadcasting his funeral live, and in all four languages. Watch out for lots of documentaries (in all four languages no less) depicting how He built singapore up from scratch, how He single handedly  developed Singapore from the backwater it was into the economic powerhouse it is today. No doubt there will be much broadcasting of the black and white newsreel of Him shouting "Merdeka!" ad nauseum.<br><br>BUT, i am sure the question that is on everyone's mind is "Will there be a public holiday on Monday if his funeral is on Saturday?"<br><br></div>

He won't live as long as he can. That's up to someone Higher to decide. Even LKY can't decide when and where can he go.<br><br>Secondly, no-one is indispensible. As I said, no-one is so high and mighty that he deserves to be treated as a demi-God. Singapore will exist as long as Singaporeans want it to exist. Even if LKY goes, Singapore will continue to exist.<br><br>In soccer, there's this saying that "no player is bigger than the club". In a similar way, there's no-one bigger than this country. Singapore will exist even after LKY dies. Even if the PAP becomes a fragemented party after he goes, S'pore will continue to exist- it just won't be as good as now. But it won't collapse because as I said, there's not only the PAP who can keep this show running on time. There will be other parties come 15-20 years who will do a better job than LKY's party.</div>
