Even election system like GRC, election deposits and electioneering defamation suits were gerrymandeered to suit his own political control purpose.<br><br>The Asian Financial crisis and last two deep recessions saw our leaders and talents totally helpless trying to talk out of problems and responsibilities.<br><br>Yet, the leaders continue to pay themselves upward, higher and higher. They continue to pretend high costs do not exist. They continue to practise narrow pro-foreign policies of all kinds thereby stifling the whole economy. Many academic and practical entrepreneurs have migrated to other countries under such conditions.<br><br>The so-called general conceptual leadership of a few men could not produce real economic competitiveness. Most of our entrepreneurs are non-academic talents but they drive the economic growths and create jobs. This important criterion of good government he didn't understand. Good government has to involve and motivate the whole populations including the not-so-talented non-academic lots who are actually the real firing power of the economy.<br><br>Because of MM Lee's major policy errors being too theoretical about talents and leadership without broad-based knowledge application and coordination with all, Singapore is very short of real economic competitiveness in the form of world-selling products with a general helplessness unlike the Korea, Taiwan and Japan and to a certain extent Thailand, Malaysia who do not have to tax their populations in the like manner as Singapore did. If Singaporeans are more demanding of him to perform above benchmark, they are not wrong in making such demands - because he considers his team the world's best talents and pays them the highest ministerial and civil servants' salaries in the world. Then they must be judged accordingly and not flinch from challenge or judgmentalism.<br><br>If our leaders can only manage by high taxes on COE and HDB, they are not real talents or good leaders. It appears that they can only maintain or at the most wait for another world tide ..even that tide is becoming increasing difficult to ride.</div>
