              <div class="wp-caption aligncenter"><em><span style="font-size: x-small;"><img class="yapb_thumbnail wideImage" src="http://enquirer.sg/wp-content/uploads/yapb_cache/czl_0706a.84vv60bklqo84o4ws404sck8o.623dhwacru88cg4swgwwc8okg.th.jpeg" alt="Singapore Citizenship: A National Credit Card?" width="530" height="353"></span></em>
              <p class="wp-caption-text-big">Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong responds to a question about citizenship from a member of the audience.</p>
              <p class="wp-caption-text-big"><strong>How much money is a Singapore citizenship worth?</strong></p>
              </div>
              <div class="storycontent">
              <p>Budget packages, GST credits, CPF top-ups, subsidies for public housing, education, health and so on.</p>
              <p>This slew of financial benefits offered to a Singapore citizen, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said, is the reason why a permanent resident from Malaysia recently decided to apply for Singapore citizenship after living here for many years.</p>
              <p>Speaking at Nanyang Technological University Student Union’s Ministerial Forum, he told the crowd made up mainly of undergraduates, <strong>“I asked her why do you need this? You are a PR, your family is here, there is no problem.”</strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">“She said: ‘If you take citizenship, you get (financial) benefits!’”</span></strong></p>
              <p>While the former American president John F. Kennedy could once proclaim to his citizens to ‘Ask not what your country can do for you; Ask what you can do for your country’, such patriotic declarations today might simply drive people to immigrate elsewhere instead.</p>
              <p>The onslaught of globalisation has shifted today’s dynamics of citizenship towards the people. The ease of uprooting from one country to another has made each of us consumers in a supermarket world of countries.</p>
              <p>The product: Citizenship.</p>
              <p>During the forum’s Question-and-Answer session, one international student asked PM Lee on the benefits of becoming a Singapore citizen.</p>
              <p>Another haggled with PM Lee to provide affordable housing to attract foreign talent like him to stay in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Citing his fiancée and himself as an example, the PhD student from China said it was hard to make Singapore his home without a house. He could not afford a condominium, nor was he allowed to buy a new HDB flat as both his fiancée and him were permanent residents.</p>
              <p><strong>Hence, in this global fight for talent, how can Singapore tweak its citizenship scheme into an attractive card that a top talent would want in his or her wallet?</strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Show them the money.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The lure of low income taxes and attractive subsidies has definitely made Singapore the destination of choice for many.</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Thus, PM Lee pledged at the forum to sharpen the difference in these benefits so that “citizens come first”.</span></strong></p>
              <p>But how different would citizenship be from a credit card subscription then? If the choice of where to make a home boils down to the place that gives you the most monetary benefits – then what happens when there is no credit left?</p>
              <p>To brand our citizenship by highlighting only its financial benefits surely attracts the wrong kind of people.</p>
              <p>After all, a nation is nothing more than an “imagined community”. To tie the imagination entirely on money would mean the people, and the country, could be gone in one economic recession.</p>
              <p style="position: relative;"><span class="pull-right pulled-right"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">People should want to be citizens of Singapore because of what they can and will do to make it their home.</span></strong></span></p>
              <p style="position: relative;">It is why the appeal of a Singapore citizenship must go deeper. <span class="pull-right">People should want to be citizens of Singapore because of what they can and will do to make it their home.</span></p>
              <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><strong><u><span style="font-size: 22pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The pink card in your wallet and the red passport you use to travel is not a key to more money. Rather, it symbolises where you’re from and who you are.</span></span></u></strong></p>

              <p> </p>
              </strong></span>
              <p>As a popular credit card advertisement puts it:</p>
              <p>There are some things money can’t buy. For everything else, there’s a credit card.</p>

              <p>My two cents is that the notion of citizenship as a credit card is important but is only valid for a small population of highly mobile, highly professional workforce, e.g., Ph.D as stated in the article. This is maybe 5% (I would think even less) of the global workforce?</p>
              <p>So "<span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">People 
              should want to be citizens of
                                      Singapore because of what they can and will do 
              to make it their
                                      home,"</span></strong></span></p>
              <p>is still relevant to the majority of the population, and should still be an important aspect of our national policy.</p>

Sure it is good, if give me, i also want, dun have to pay tax, easy to get degree in their own local U, relax, and then come here and become citizen to enjoy all these so called benefits.?????</span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Benefits is a term use in business organisation, it should not be use on a nation. It is a term that can change from time to time due to business enivroment and condition. As for nation, it is a product of the citizens hard work and contribution, and should be ploughed back to the citizens in poors take more and richs take less analogy, so as to close the income gap and the rich and poor disparity. Bloody hell, i think i can be a better PM than him...who wants me to be PM of Singapore??? a female one</span></p>

              <p>so what is the credit limit going to be? 2 times your salary? so
              who is the issuing bank? government of Spore or MAS? got discounts
              or not at merchant shops? those who are not working, do they also
              get a credit card? no income, still 2 times the credit limit?</p>

              How much does a Singapore Citizenship cost?
              
              10% of your monthly income locked away for a million years, harebrained CPF schemes to lock it away for another million years. subsidies for totally affordable public housing which is pegged to resale values for some weird reason. after paying half a mil, gotta wait half a decade more - efficiency for you! our health "medisave should not be your only security" care system -yeah tell that to someone earning $1000. 
              
              not really the fault of govt but rather corporate greed  - $94 dollars to watch World Cup. fyi it's free or you pay a pittance in Malaysia, Indonesia (comparing with Asean), Japan Uk US (comparing with developed world). 
              
              Man we should be counting our blessings!

              <p><br>i thot is was 20% locked, and even the other 15.5% which is consider a welfare fund from employers is also locked up. so it not just 10%, a total of 35.5% being locked up, that is about $355 for a $1000 salary being locked up, well you can pay your bills with that or buy premium social and health insurance yourself , so they said we do not know how to control our money, well, we are the most educated people around this region and the govt said we do not know how to use our money???any logic??</p>
              <p>on service provider charge $10++ 4 year ago, with 2 svc providers, things should get cheaper in term of economic of scale, but instead they charged nearly 9 times more than 4 years ago...9x more...omg, even property prices also nvr mark up so high</p>
