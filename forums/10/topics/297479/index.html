            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>I happen to come across this article, read it, and yeah it make sense. So copied here and share with my fellow Singaporeans.<br><br>1. SingaporeÂ’s economic growth miracle of the 1960s-90s came mostly from added inputs, not from growth in productivity.<br>Hong Kong         Singapore<br>Average growth p.a., 1960-85                             6%                    6%<br>Worker productivity increase, 1970-90               150%                100%<br>Savings rate 1970-90                                        20%                  40%<br>Change in output per unit of capital, 1970-90        0%                -50%                   source<br><br>In other words, Singapore had to invest twice as much as HK to produce the same level of output. To compensate for the poor productivity and diminishing returns of investments directed by the state, its people had to save twice as much as Hongkongers, and consume less.  Pathetic.<br><br>2. The Singaporean people do not really have the fundamental right to make their own investments.  The Singapore government forces people to hand over up to 40% of their net income, and it invests most of it as it sees fit.  The government Â“allowsÂ” people to individually direct only a small part of these forced savings (mainly into non-voting shares in state-owned enterprises).  The government tells Singaporeans how lucky they are to be Â“allowedÂ” to choose to use their savings for education, home purchase, medical coverage, etc Â– as if the money werenÂ’t theirs in the first place. Pathetic.<br><br>3. This is therefore a planned economy, in which civil servants attempt to pick winners.  As well as (mis)managing its peopleÂ’s savings, SingaporeÂ’s government also arranges subsidies to encourage favoured industries.  Needless to say, these subsidies are at the expense of other industries.  For example, the rest of the economy has subsidized forex traders and fund managers (the last people who need a subsidy) in order to push Singapore higher up the list of international forex trading and fund management centers.  The government sells this to its people as a Â“successÂ”.  Meanwhile, the government is ordering its state-owned business to expand beyond the little city state.  In their desperation to become regional players, they are paying over the odds for assets of doubtful quality.   Pathetic.<br><br>4. One big mistake made by the controllers of the Singaporean economy was to maintain a large manufacturing sector long after factories would otherwise have been moved to lower-cost sites (as they did in Hong Kong in the 1980s-90s).  They have put their peopleÂ’s wealth into direct investment into local manufacturers, or into tax breaks and other subsidies for inward manufacturing investment.  It is therefore left with a large and increasingly unviable manufacturing base in such loser industries as semiconductors.    Pathetic.<br><br>5. Faced with such mismanagement, most people would complain.  Not Singaporeans.  Their government effectively controls the media and runs a highly effective PR campaign aimed at convincing the people the government is wonderful.  Many sincerely believe it. Those who donÂ’t fall for it keep quiet, or wish they had.  The few people who dare to speak out suffer reduced career prospects or even spurious legal action. Unlike Hongkongers, Singaporeans have no right, in practice, to walk down the street handing out anti-government leaflets and shouting anti-government slogans.  It is a crime to speak in public without a permit.  Pathetic.<br><br>6. Democracy is impossible without free speech.  Singapore is therefore no more a democracy than Hong Kong (where the government is appointed by Beijing).  However, Hong Kong at least allows an opposition to exist openly, and to present its views in independent media, without fear of persecution or harassment. In Singapore, opposition politicians who ask awkward questions can be (and have been) sued for libel by ruling politicians and convicted (and bankrupted) by a judiciary that mysteriously consistently sides with the government. Neighbourhoods that vote in low numbers for the ruling party receive lower government funding for public facilities in retaliation for their lack of gratitude Â– in flagrant violation of the basic democratic principle that the government is accountable to all its people, not just its voters.  Pathetic.<br><br>7. SingaporeÂ’s Â‘father figureÂ” is Lee Kuan Yew.  One of his interests is eugenics.  He believes that a more-intelligent population can be achieved through selective breeding, and at one stage Singapore encouraged people with high educational levels to marry each other, and it offered financial incentives for them to have children.  (After hearing his ideas during a state visit, BritainÂ’s Princess Anne said, Â“Well, Mr Lee, it doesnÂ’t work with horses.Â”)  Social engineering continues today, with the government, which used to go to great lengths to encourage people to have fewer babies, begging them to have more Â“if they can afford itÂ”. This means Â“unless youÂ’re MalayÂ”.  SingaporeÂ’s schools systematically leave Malays disadvantaged and stuck in low-paying jobs.  They have also tried to attract more (Chinese) immigrants from Hong Kong.  DonÂ’t all rush.  Pathetic.<br><br>8. Singapore is famous for not being corrupt.  It is true that if you are Lee Kuan YewÂ’s eldest son you can become brigadier general after just five years in the army, and six months later you can become a member of parliament, and soon after that you can become deputy prime minister.  And then become the PM!!!  And if you are the eldest sonÂ’s wife, you can be put in charge of the state holding company (it holds key interests in 40% of the stock market by market cap).  And if youÂ’re LeeÂ’s number-two son, you can run the main Telecoms company.  But thatÂ’s not corruption, or nepotism.  ThatÂ’s Â“meritocracyÂ”.  (No, that's pathetic.)<br><br>9.
