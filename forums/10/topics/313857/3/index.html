              <p>its the sales and not the IT department, get it?</p>
              <p>when u have 9:1 IT dept comprised of mostly Foreigners, u
                  end up lowering the salary. is this an employment malpractice?
                  employing true rare talents is reasonable. but employing
                  non-talents takes away rice bowl from locals who are the ones who
                  can sacrifice and defend the nation. the issue here is , is there
                  an oversupply? lowering the cost ? why europe do not lower their
                  citizen salary ? 1st worlds. highly expensive living. some more low

              <p>It seems that you cannot accept a question reply that puts doubts on your conclusion. I shall tell you now that since the immigration labour laws are stricter on foreign talents, they will simply move operations overseas, to the place where cheaper FTs will come from. In addition, the salaries of the FTs in the countries of the FTs are usually cheaper than the salaries of FTs going to Europe to work.</p>
              <p>I'm still asking you why they would expand overseas if you think they would do only employing locals in their countries. And finally, why would you think that every competent company in the world expands overseas? Other than being nearer to other sales markets, isn't it also because they seek foreign and cheaper talents since there's so much negativity on them in their own country?</p>

              <p>In addition, if companies are, as you said, employing more foreigners than Singaporeans, what do you think is the propensity for them to move their operations elsewhere in this region if the Singapore requires them to employ much more citizens, perhaps at a higher wage? Do you think, in the longer term, that they would move their operations to perhaps China to cut costs, or perhaps employ even cheaper workers there, or would they stay to pay higher wages for citizen workers whose productivity are not really higher than cheaper foreigners?</p>

              <p>In the end, it was still PAP's policy that results in such a situation today.

It is the PAP policy on FTs that has something wrong with it. With better foresight, the current situation wouldn't have happened, and you wouldn't have complained.</p>

              <p>My point was europe is able to protect their citizen rice bowl and only rarely are asians hired. their IT staff is the world's highest paid. These all true 1st worlds.</p>
              <p>Japan also succeeded without many FTs.</p>
              <p>So is S.Korea.</p>
              <p>I know u always try to say they have operations overseas hiring foreigners there.</p>
              <p>Again, I will remind you that I am talking about japan / korean/ european citizens locally do not need to compete with foreigners in such a big way. 90-99% of their jobs are given to locals.</p>
              <p>Again, and again, I tell you this. Talents, even if foreign should only be required if the skills needed is lacking. Else, unnecessarily allowing too many to come in or loosely controlling this influx or inefficiently controlling this aspect or oversight in this aspect does the citizens harm and injustice. If you need world record holders, not avail in the pore, to compete in olumpics, by all means. If you need foreign talent gubbymen officials, by all means, I have no objections, even if they do not ask for millions a year, i dont care. if you need inventors, gravely lacking and in shortage in the pore, by all means, if you can afford and attract them.  IT is a very easy entry level skill. Why is there such a situation created where me and some forummers here have pointed out the 90:10 employment phenomenon?</p>

              <p><br>yes, for certain jobs like IT, FTs outnumber locals, common to find such situation in many large  companies here. based on my  personal experience, as extreme as 90:10. Several here have also voiced their evidence that they too know of companies hiring FT:locals ,  95:10.</p>
              <p>eagle does not admit this due to some strange reasons. maybe he is countering for the sake of countering.</p>
              <p>Me and several others here are voicing up at our own expense. Voicing up for the rest of local IT staff. Not many poreans dare to voice up , even in this day and age of youtube, google, facebook, democracy.</p>
              <p>poreans may appear modern but when it comes to voicing up. They are apathetic, conservative and kia.</p>
              <p>1 generation of cultivated genes passed on to the next.</p>
              <p>bad habbits die hard.</p>
              <p>Yet, I will still continue to voice up at my own expense. For the good of the masses.</p>
              <p>If i do not sacrifice for others, then wait for others to help me is it? </p>
              <p>pragmatism, self-preservation. the end.</p>

              <p><br>its very dangerous or scary that u interprete that i am afraid of losing my job that is why I report the facts here. maybe in some minor ways. natural. Every employee in the pore, everyday worry about this, in some ways. when appraisal comes, no one is worried right? zero worry hor.</p>
              <p>But the main issue on hand and discussed is the 90:10 ratio of employment. This is my main reason for asking.</p>
              <p>The key word here is ratio.</p>
              <p>As I said countless numerous endless times, FT is needed in some cases like when u dont have olumpic champion, u want fast results, go and get some world level sports person and offer him or her a piece of paper.  that is understandable. When you talk about IT, an easy entry level job that locals can do, why is there a need to have 90:10?</p>
              <p> If it is the case of Casino or F1, I can understand 90:10 if that is the case. since not many are skilled in these fields. But IT ? come on!  who is not IT savvy nowadays? its so easy now compared to the past!</p>

              <p>My point was europe is able to protect their citizen rice
                          bowl and only rarely are asians hired. their IT staff is the
                          world's highest paid. These all true 1st worlds.</p>
              <p>Japan also succeeded without many FTs.</p>
              <p>So is S.Korea.</p>
              <p>I know u always try to say they have operations overseas hiring
                          foreigners there.</p>
              <p>Again, I will remind you that I am talking about japan /
                          korean/ european citizens locally do not need to compete with
                          foreigners in such a big way. 90-99% of their jobs are given to
                          locals.</p>
              <p>Again, and again, I tell you this. Talents, even if
                          foreign should only be required if the skills needed is
                          lacking. Else, unnecessarily allowing too many to come in or
                          loosely controlling this influx or inefficiently controlling
                          this aspect or oversight in this aspect does the citizens harm
                          and injustice. If you need world record holders, not avail
                          in the pore, to compete in olumpics, by all means. If you need
                          foreign talent gubbymen officials, by all means, I have no
                          objections, even if they do not ask for millions a
                          year, i dont care. if you need
                          inventors, gravely lacking and in shortage in the pore,
                          by all means, if you can afford and attract them.  IT is
                          a very easy entry level skill. Why is there such a situation
                          created where me and some forummers here have pointed out the
                          90:10 employment phenomenon?</p>

                                                  simply move operations overseas, to the place where cheaper FTs
                                                  will come from. In addition, the salaries of the FTs in the

              <p>How is that beating around the bush? Please explain. If you cannot understand the answer, please ask for a paraphrase. But instead, you would ask a totally different set of questions</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Why is there such a situation
                                                  created where me and some forummers here have pointed out the

              </blockquote>
              <p>Even then, the answer has been pointed out so clearly to you.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>PAP's policy that results in such a
                                                  situation today. The reverse that you are asking for in the current
                                                  situation cannot really be done without much lashback. As you have
                                                  too mentioned, FTs are needed. It is the PAP policy on FTs that has
                                                  something wrong with it. With better foresight, the current
                                                  situation wouldn't have happened, and you wouldn't have
                                      complained.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>You tell me yourself, are you dumb or what? You quoted the answer, yet you are asking me for the answer? What is your point here?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>yes, for certain jobs like IT, FTs outnumber locals, common to find
                                                  such situation in many large  companies here. based on
                                                  my  personal experience, as extreme as 90:10. Several here
                                                  have also voiced their evidence that they too know of companies
                                                  hiring FT:locals ,  95:10.</p>
              <p>eagle does not admit this due to some strange reasons. maybe he
                                                  is countering for the sake of countering.</p>

              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Now don't need to put words into my mouth</span></strong>. It only shows how bad you are at comprehension. None of my statements have denied this fact. It is of no wonder you would find competition from FWs hard, simply because you cannot even understand simple sentences used in this thread.</p>
              <p>It seems more likely that you are countering for the sake of countering, when I have merely started off by listing the fact that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">IT is a sector where the information can be passed around extremely fast because we are living in the information age. Thus, companies can always move their operations overseas instead of Singapore, and thus will have the motivation to do so if they are forced to employ more locals.</span> Now tell me what's wrong with that?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I hope you have seen that I have already replied you long ago. I have no idea why you would be so insistent on an answer that has already been fed to you. Is it because you are speechless about the following?</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Tell me why don't they expand within their own countries? Any
                                                  reason? There are still quite a number of jobless people in the EU
                                                  you know? They can always not expand overseas, but within the EU
                                                  and employ more people. But why not?</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>It is a wonder why you would continuously avoid answering this question by telling me I have not gave you a reply when in fact, it has been spoonfed to you not only once.</p>

              <p>Why do european companies continue to be successful? Why is
                              europe so successful without relying on cheaper asians?</p>
              <p>Why they do not replace all their expensive europeans with
                              cheaper asian? save cost right according to eagle.</p>
              <p>its alright, eager, i am sure you do not have the
                              answer. </p>

              <p>Never mind, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">it seems extremely clear that you have no idea why companies move operations overseas</span>. All your questions has been answered, yet you continued to ask for them. Quite clear that you just want to act dumb. Suit yourself. You are already soon becoming a joke of this forum.</p>
              <p>Or do you still require me to repost all the answers back for you again?</p>
              <p>And I don't need to mention to you that your info that "europe is successful without relying on cheaper asian" is totally wrong. Wonderfully inaccurate fact. And you are now giving me a wrong fact and asking me to explain. You should take a trip to Europe. Or maybe it is clearer if you go to Paris, to see the number of Africans working there. Or Germany to see the number of Turkish and those from Somalia, Israel, etc, working there. This is already excluding the number of PRCs already there.</p>

              <p><br>Many forummers already have witnessed the same situation in their companies.</p>
              <p>That is why I asked where you work .</p>
              <p>Your company is it big global MNC?</p>
              <p>does it have a IT dept?</p>
              <p>if so, pay a little visit there.</p>
              <p>all HR personnel can understand what I mean.</p>
              <p>If you want concrete official figures, and you believe in those, go and get statements on every large MNC IT department employment statistics. I am not saying all companies are like this. As I have always said, these are based on my personal experience and observations having worked in numerous large MNCs in their IT departments. 90:10 are the worst cases I experienced.  I have experienced many other that are either 85:10 or 90:10 and some between 70 - 80 %.</p>
              <p>So, I counter ask you. Are you saying that IT departments in the pore do not have companies employing 90:10 ratio of foreign workers in their IT department compared to locals hired?</p>
              <p>Are you really saying that ? ZERO?</p>
              <p>say it.</p>
              <p>Even if its not all companies like this, remember, my point is this is a troubling phenomenon. The key purpose to raise the concern and let others be informed.  Some work in non-IT depts and may never really know the extent of the problem. They may only meet the tech support. They do not know the army of FTs in the IT dept who are working in the backend.</p>
