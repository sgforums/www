              <p>Most obvious sector of companies moving overseas (neighbouring countries, especially China) is the manufacturing sector. The cost savings are substantial since the delivery costs could be quite low for such a near place. Even in Europe, they do manufacture/import clothes from Turkey or Bangladesh just like what we do from China/Thailand.</p>
              <p>There's definitely no stopping companies in other sectors from taking the plunge to move operations overseas if we stopped them now from employing excessive (in the eyes of some here) foreign workers.</p>
              <p>Some of the major sectors that won't really move much operations abroad, no matter what labour policy there is, in my opinion, are<br>1) Biomedical -- pple will still fall sick here<br>2) Education -- still need to study<br>3) Property/Construction -- obvious<br>4) Financial -- this one is more of due to Sg's reputation.</p>
              <p>There might be some more... But didn't come to mind at the current moment.</p>

              <p>What if a biomedical institute budget can hire 10 scientist per
                  dept. and you have 8 locals, and there are 3 foreign scientists who
                  have good portfolios and you can't fire any locals, and one of the
                  foreign scientist is a potential vaccine superstar.</p>
