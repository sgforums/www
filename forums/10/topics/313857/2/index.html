              <p><br> Hi TS,</p>
              <p>You asked : What happens when FT  outnumber locals?</p>
              <p>I have this news for you.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">FTs    A L R E A D
                  Y      OUT-NUMBERED   L O C A L
                  S </span></span> in almost all large private sector MNCs IT
                  department.     I  welcome someone to
                  challenge me on this. I really am overconfident on this
                  aspect. Chinese saying : "Put your horse come over".</p>
              <p>Do not be surprised. If you are, your life as it was, was
                  wasted.</p>
              <p>AND!</p>
              <p>not just private large MNCs IT dept,  many if
                  not most private and large and small companys also.
                  Its very common scene in public sectorial also.</p>
              <p>Many FTs compete fiercely with locals. To them its just a matter
                  of this place welcomes them, so why would anyone of them not
                  take it for granted ?  and i thought they would show some kind
                  of gratitute to the pore for allowing them their happiness. If they
                  so FT and do not enjoy happiness here, why still here?</p>
              <p>I do not blame FTs for coming in , recommending their relatives,
                  and whole family tree over to a free for all place.  They are
                  allowed.</p>
              <p>Thus, is it not clear? </p>
              <p>Your wish comes true when you accept. </p>

              <p>In my definition, if FT, they must at least hold a post graduate degree, or has been pioneering in some research areas... or... a successful entrepreneur with damn good human management skills... etc...</p>

              <p>this is why they can come in.</p>
              <p>FTs are also in Japan. But very rare. Japan is able to be world best with only rare few FTs. And due to the strict entrance requirement, I think they are true FTs. Like those who can entrance into European market.</p>

              <p>if cert is indicator of talents, all poreans are foreign talent calibre as long as they have a cert.</p>
              <p>they compete with locals seriously. They want to keep their rice bowls too. They still have some plans to bring their family tree over.</p>

              <p><br> Hi TS,</p>
              <p>You asked : What happens when FT  outnumber locals?</p>
              <p>I have this news for you.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">FTs    A L R E A D
              Y      OUT-NUMBERED   L O C A L
              S </span></span> in almost all large private sector MNCs IT
              department.     I  welcome someone to
              challenge me on this. I really am overconfident on this
              aspect. Chinese saying : "Put your horse come over".</p>
              <p>Do not be surprised. If you are, your life as it was, was
              wasted.</p>
              <p>AND!</p>
              <p>not just private large MNCs IT dept,  many if
              not most private and large and small companys also.
              Its very common scene in public sectorial also.</p>
              <p>Many FTs compete fiercely with locals. To them its just a matter
              of this place welcomes them, so why would anyone of them not
              take it for granted ?  and i thought they would show some kind
              of gratitute to the pore for allowing them their happiness. If they
              so FT and do not enjoy happiness here, why still here?</p>
              <p>I do not blame FTs for coming in , recommending their relatives,
              and whole family tree over to a free for all place.  They are
              allowed.</p>
              <p>Thus, is it not clear? </p>
              <p>Your wish comes true when you accept. </p>

              <p>From my German teacher last semester:</p>
              <p>Germans complained a lot about the large intake of immigrants (many Italians) coming to work in their country, and stealing their jobs, driving down their wages. It was only after a while that they realised that these people were doing jobs that locals do not really want to do, and they are actually helping the economy a lot.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I do not know exactly which policy the german government took (most likely not the same as sg), but the info is most likely on the net somewhere. The result was there: Germany was the 3rd largest economy in the world. But I think it has been overtaken by China now.</p>

              europe is a group of countries. They have european union. europeans are free to work and travel within this 'continent'.
              
              even if  italian is working in germany, their salary is way much higher than the pore and anywhere else.
              
              euro is king.
              
              You should also point out that european union protects europeans so much that very very few asians are allowed to work there. 
              
              This is why european IT staff are paid so much higher.
                                
              
              i ask you . why european companies never pull out of europe and let their it staff die ? why they doont let cheaper asians come in like what you preached? globalisation mah, you said. has the european economy crashed due to IT cost? A company does not pull out due to IT cost. Its the sales , u dong dong!  "its the econonomy, stewpig!" 
              
              u diy too much or watched knn too much?

              <p>No need to post the same post twice in 2 threads.</p>
              <p>There is a reason why there are so many foreign IT companies from Europe and America present in economies in the Asian region. Since they cannot bring people in, they go out to get the people. You don't want this to happen in Singapore.If they move out, even if it is only 10% jobs for Singaporeans, their jobs will still be gone.</p>
              <p>In addition, the complains on foreigners in a German economy before the EU was people from around Europe too, near proximity to them. Similarly, the complains that you are giving now are on people in near proximity to Singapore too. So in your logic, you would not complain on PRCs coming in to Singapore to work if there's an Asian Union?</p>

              <p>you did not reply to why european companies do not move out  of europe when their IT salary is so high. they Expand overseas. but they do not migrate.</p>
              <p>thus your logic that if IT department don't hire FT , companies will exit the pore is 1-sided.</p>
              <p>its the sales and not the IT department, get it?</p>
              <p>when u have 9:1 IT dept comprised of mostly Foreigners, u end up lowering the salary. is this an employment malpractice? employing true rare talents is reasonable. but employing non-talents takes away rice bowl from locals who are the ones who can sacrifice and defend the nation. the issue here is , is there an oversupply? lowering the cost ? why europe do not lower their citizen salary ? 1st worlds. highly expensive living. some more low low quality of life.</p>
