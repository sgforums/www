              <p>Eh the propoganda people think that ethnic Chinese Singaporeans are FT too. Fine by me ... if PRC have right of return (wikipedia it) like Israel. In fact I dont really mind Singapore become part of PRC but that would mean that LKY and etc clan are at the mercy of the CCP.</p>
              <p>Actually the propoganda people are not that bad off, they show the CCP their resumes and I think they will get hired for their (slightly better) English. Just hope that they dont hiam the pay.</p>

              <p>Guess what? If the govt were to ban all foreigners from working in Singapore, it will be Singaporeans that will raise a hue and cry. Will you work as laborers at the construction sites? Will your daughters work as live-in maids, 12 hours a day, 7 days a week for less than $600 a month? Will your father work as a waiter in the food court 12 hours a day, 7 days a week for just $750 a month? That's what the foreigners are getting. Wake up your idea! They are doing the jobs that Singaporeans don;t want to do.</p>
              <p>What about the higher level jobs? If an IT engineer from India is able to do your work for half your salary, why should the boss employ you? If an iPOD made in China looks as good and works as well as one made in Singapore, but costs half as much, will you buy Singapore only?  </p>

              <p>Guess what? If the govt were to ban all foreigners from working
              in Singapore, it will be Singaporeans that will raise a hue and
              cry. Will you work as laborers at the construction sites? Will your
              daughters work as live-in maids, 12 hours a day, 7 days a week
              for less than $600 a month? Will your father work as a
              waiter in the food court 12 hours a day, 7 days a week
              for just $750 a month? That's what the foreigners are
              getting. Wake up your idea! They are doing the jobs that
              Singaporeans don;t want to do.</p>
              <p>What about the higher level jobs? If an IT engineer from India
              is able to do your work for half your salary, why should the
              boss employ you? If an iPOD made in China looks as good
              and works as well as one made in Singapore, but costs half
              as much, will you buy Singapore only?  </p>

              <p>ANY IT skills, whatever the f it is,</p>

              <p>f'T's  CAN and are allowed to come right in.</p>
              <p>There is a distinct difference between a real FT who is a rare talent able to 'leap towers in a single bound' compared to cheaper laborers who are just asking their uncles and classmates over the internet how to do something step by step , things they told their interviewers they have done many times before.</p>
              <p>In IT, its easy to learn all and any skill there is.</p>
              <p>But with influx, where any of these foreign laborers can just ask their classmates and brothers and sisters to also come and work here easily, and IT qualification does not strictly require high academic certifications, there is now an overcrowding of FTs of IT.</p>
              <p>Again, FT is required only if its skills locals cannot learn.</p>
              <p>But if it is at the expense of local's jobs, I will expect that all doctors be replaced by cheaper foreign labor doctors.</p>
              <p>Likewise, I would expect all lawyers, accountants, financial controllers, engineers, managers, CEOs be replaced by foreigners.</p>

              <p>False. FT is required if there is nobody able to do the job at the price offered. Plenty of Singaporeans willing to carry coffee at hawker centres for $3000 a month...but that means my coffee will cost more. The PRC worker is willing to do the job at $1200 a month and so he is hired, and keep the price of my coffee low. Can you understand this simple concept?</p>

              <p>Anyone knows that whatever job you are doing, whatever qualification you have, there are talents out there that can more than replace you entirely, completely, undoubtedly, absolutely. in your subconscious, you will admit to this.</p>
              <p>Then, this gets interesting, WHY ARE YOU STILL HOLDING ON to a JOB that a FT can do and replace YOU ?  YOU MUST BE CAPABLE of WALKING THE TALK? NO ?  NO ?  NOOOOOOO ????? </p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>Because my job is much higher value and the person with my qualifications and can replace me is earning twice my salary in Europe and the US. So they are the ones worrying that I might take their jobs, because I can 'more than replace him entirely, completely, undoubtedly, absolutely'. It's all about how competitive you are and realistic pricing.</p>
              <p>Doctors whose pay is higher than foreign doctors with equivalent skills and qualifications will and should lose their jobs to cheaper foreign doctors. But if you have higher qualifications and better skills than your foreign counterpart, your job is secure. If your pay is lower than that of a foreign doctor with equivalent qualifications and skills, it is the foreigner who fears for his job and you can just go ahead and demand higher pay.</p>
              <p>But if as I suspect, your pay is higher than a foreign worker who is able to do your job and willing to do it for less, too bad....you are destined to be left behind. To amount of whining will keep your job.</p>
