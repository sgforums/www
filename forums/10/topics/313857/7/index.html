              <p><br>thus you saying the Pore should continuously allow influx and replace all citizens? like this, no citizen will agree except fishes . ufish, ifck.</p>
              <p>Your brain was washed completely.</p>
              <p>when building a new nation where there was only a handful of  people, you need people. This came from overseas.</p>
              <p>When a nation is established, real rare talents are welcomed. The definition of talent has to be understood and not wrongly used for convenience.</p>
              <p>A real talent is someone like a scientist who has moral ethics and many renowned works published.</p>
              <p>A real talent is the future David Beckham, F1 champion,  olympia champion, world record champion, geniuses and future politicians, etc etc.</p>
              <p>According to your understanding of FT, your job need to be replaced by foreigners. This you will never accept. If you do, RESIGN now. let the cheaper alternative replace you and you return all excess earned unjustifiably to the society and do community work for the rest of your limited life for free. And never whine about it. </p>

              <p>No, obviously my job is not internet related or it will be under threat. Indian IT professionals are just as good as the locals and far cheaper. How much I earn is none of your business, unless you are with the IRAS. Third, there isn't a billion people in the world who can do my job...or I would not be commanding my salary. Fourth, any PRC or Indonesian is free to compete for my job. Fact is, I have the qualifications for this job and they don't. Fifth, do come up with some arguments...mindless ranting will not get you anywhere. Perhaps that is one reason why you will lose out to foreign workers.  </p>

              <p>Once again your post reflects your lack of insight. Practically every job can and will be under threat by a FT unless you demonstrate that you are better value for money. Sometimes the entire industry is under threat by foreign workers, which is why we no longer manufacture garments...China can make them far more cheaply and just as well. Instead of whining, you should think about how you add value to your work to persuade your boss to keep you. If your entire industry is under threat because foreigners have now acquired the skills to do it far more cheaply, you have to move into a higher end industry. </p>

              <p><br>I disagree about better value for money you described.</p>
              <p>Job advertisements, for IT, no longer ask for fresh grads. This has been on going for more than a decade. Many with potential never make it past the interview or even resume filtering stage. but many from overseas are not that talented also but still get the job, denying a local with potential and same resume. So, when a person is not given the chance to even demonstrate his value for money, you cannot say he has no value.</p>
              <p>Why industry not advertising for freshies? Because FTs can come anytime and take a job. Many young foreigners from poorer countries long to come here having heard the wonderful news painted for them about a tiny island. If ask them to go europe , they know its too tough to enter. And the expectation there is extremely high. To the USA, its culture shock. Most of these foreigners are not into pop culture or us culture. And then there is the Pore. Just nice. They come bringing their cousins, and then the whole family tree. They can recommend anyone they know to apply for job here.</p>
              <p>Given this oversupply of minimally 2-year-experienced labor, there is no need to advertise for fresh locals.</p>
              <p>but there are some fresh locals who get the job as fresh people but this is rare. They get it sometimes because their friends recommend them or they go for same price as foreigners. European IT freshies no need like this. they are still more higher paid.</p>

              <p>False. FT is required if there is nobody able to do the job at
                  the price offered. Plenty of Singaporeans willing to carry coffee
                  at hawker centres for $3000 a month...but that means my coffee will
                  cost more. The PRC worker is willing to do the job at $1200 a month
                  and so he is hired, and keep the price of my coffee low. Can you
                  understand this simple concept?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Because my job is much higher value and the person with my
                  qualifications and can replace me is earning twice my salary in
                  Europe and the US. So they are the ones worrying that I might take
                  their jobs, because I can 'more than replace him entirely,
                  completely, undoubtedly, absolutely'. It's all about how
                  competitive you are and realistic pricing.</p>
              <p>Doctors whose pay is higher than foreign doctors with equivalent
                  skills and qualifications will and should lose their jobs to
                  cheaper foreign doctors. But if you have higher qualifications and
                  better skills than your foreign counterpart, your job is secure. If
                  your pay is lower than that of a foreign doctor with equivalent
                  qualifications and skills, it is the foreigner who fears for his
                  job and you can just go ahead and demand higher pay.</p>
              <p>But if as I suspect, your pay is higher than a foreign worker
                  who is able to do your job and willing to do it for less, too
                  bad....you are destined to be left behind. To amount of whining

              <p>Guess what? If the govt were to ban all foreigners from working in Singapore, it will be Singaporeans that will raise a hue and cry.

              <p>maybe we should ban all FT. since there are no labourers, we can stop building casino. since there are no maids, we can finally build a pro family business environment. since there are no workers in foodcourt earning $750/mth, we should eat home more and build more family cohesion. or the food court can finally consider giving their multi million profits back to the workers and pay them decently 2k/mth. not sustainable, dont open coffeeshop everywhere and make singapore a noisy, messy place filll up with coffeeshop that dish out lousy foods, drinks.</p>

              <p>If the PAP government can outsource its propoganda arm to India, it will too. Maybe it already has. The same reasoning applies to Singapore Inc. - if someone can provide a cheaper and better port, companies will move.
