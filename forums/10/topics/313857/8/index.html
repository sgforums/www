              <p>I am totally "FOR" the foreigners, as they will bring more colours and add more cultures in Singapore. The only problem i have is the govt is so "fixated" into bringing china "talent" only. For that I am against it. 1) They can't be like Singaporeans as they can only speak 1 language, "mandarin". 2) Singapore will soon turn from uniquely Singapore into "unique China".</p>
              <p>Just step outside your house now, try eating out or go shopping, 50% of the chances you will find "china" ppl serving you. And what's worst, they assume everyone in Singapore speaks Chinese, whether you understand them or not, they still rely you in chinese. They seem to forget this is Singapore, not China. If the govt dont control these increasingly high volume of china ppl coming in and without knowing MIMIMUM ENGLISH, I can ensure everyone that Singapore will sooner or later become China. By then it's not Uniquely Singapore anymore since its no longer multicultural society.</p>
              <p>I' m getting more and more worried about this disturbing situation, as Singapore is feeling less and less like a home to me. It doesn't seem to be a charming place meant for multi culture/ multi race to enjoy anymore, it's becoming more like a place suitable for chinese speaking china ppl only.The other races and  foreigners in Singapore are probably feeling the stress or struggle to communicate with them.  </p>
              <p> I think those shops or restaurants who want to save $$ and hired china workers should have a big sign hanging outside the door--"We speak Chinese only". At least it saves my time or trouble from stepping in and then experiencing the agony of understanding chinese only.</p>
              <p>Oh ,and then next you will hear foreigners complaining how Singapore language has dropped OR laughing how we cant even understand English...I wondered why...duh, can the foreigners (those who dont understand chinese language) able to tell if these servers in retail shops or waiters in restaurants are not Singaporeans??

              <p>Precisely why I said practically every industry (except some jobs in the army etc.) are subject to global competition. I have no problem with opening the floodgates to foreign doctors. That won't affect me, cos' the ones with my qualifications and skills are earning more in Europe, US and Australia. They should be worried that I compete with them for their jobs.</p>
              <p>As Sun Tzi said, you must know yourself and your adversary. My job is secure because I am better value for money in the global market. Singaporeans who cannot compete will lopse their jobs. Those who compete on price will lose their pay.</p>

              <p>Better thank your lucky stars that these PRC waiters/shop assistants speak only Mandarin at the moment. When they pick up English as well, the local receptionists will lose their job. When these PRC workers pick up paper qualifications with distance learning whilst working in Singapore, local clerks and secretaries will lose their job. When these PRC workers pick up IT certificates, our IT workers will see their pay slashed further.</p>

              <p>Sour grapes...how do you know foreign workers 'are not that talented'? Employers are not daft. No reason why they will not employ a local when he is asking for the same salary and has the same qualifications and experience as the foreign worker. Fact is: local fresh grads demand more pay than a foreign worker with experience in the job. If you are a fresh grad without previous experience, you must accept lower pay.</p>

              <p><br>Why industry not advertising for freshies? Because FTs can come anytime and take a job. Many young foreigners from poorer countries long to come here having heard the wonderful news painted for them about a tiny island. If ask them to go europe , they know its too tough to enter. And the expectation there is extremely high. To the USA, its culture shock. Most of these foreigners are not into pop culture or us culture. And then there is the Pore. Just nice. They come bringing their cousins, and then the whole family tree. They can recommend anyone they know to apply for job here.</p>

              <p>Nothing to back your claims. Main reason employers (and they are Singaporean employers) prefer foreign workers for some jobs is because the FT can do the job and willing to do it for less. If the local fresh grad is prepared to accept the same pay as the FT, employers will take the local as they would not have to pay the government foreign workers levy. In any case, there is a cap on the number of FT a comapny can employ.</p>

              <p>but there are some fresh locals who get the job as fresh people but this is rare. They get it sometimes because their friends recommend them or <strong>they go for same price as foreigners</strong>. European IT freshies no need like this. they are still more higher paid.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Exactly so (bold emphasis by me). If fresh local grads are willing to go for the same salary, employers will hire them. No reason to hire a more expensive worker when a cheaper FT can do the job. That is the key: you have to ask yourself whether a FT can do your job for less pay. If so, you will lose that job. This is the real world.</p>

              <p>Why bringing in? As I have already mentioned in another thread to some thick skulled forumer, they are brought in because they can contribute taxes and expenditure to the Sg economy. So the money, instead of being outsourced to India, is spent within the Sg economy.</p>
              <p>And that's why they are cheap; to compete with other data centres in India. Only sad thing is, they reduce wages here. Then again, I have also mentioned in another thread that there's no necessity to compete with FWs or FTs head on in areas which you do not have an advantage on; plain dumb to do that.</p>

              <p>I am thinking from the perspective of a company, not Singapore. Surely if rent and electricity is (so much) more expensive in Singapore, and you are using the same labour base from India, ceterius paribus, wouldnt you outsource to India instead of bringing in workers instead.</p>
