              <p>It is just obvious you are nitpicking at the usage of the phrase of "all the time". Similarly, allow me to nitpick at you.</p>
              <p>1) You could call it evasive if you wish, but truth is, I need to read your italics about 5 times before I finally understood your point. Seems like you have a tendency to come to conclusions pretty quickly without being clear-headed.</p>
              <p>2) The word usage of (again) doesn't hold true. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Just because you asked a question the previous time arising from a wrong and illogical point</span>, and thus there is no necessity to answer since your question's base doesn't hold, doesn't mean there had been an evasion of question. Surely you would understand this simple logic.</p>
              <p>Also, you should reflect on how you have phrased your question and choices the previous time. Let me ask you this question, and show me that you do not evade. Do you think you are a pet or pest to qlqq9?</p>
              <p>3) It seems you like to change your question, then tell me I evaded your question. You asked in your post, "honestly, does the above fucking makes sense to you?". The method in which you post strongly suggests that you are asking me whether I understood your <span style="text-decoration: underline;">whole paragraph of italics.</span></p>

              <p>It is just obvious you are nitpicking at the usage of the phrase of "all the time". Similarly, allow me to nitpick at you.</p>
              <p>1) You could call it evasive if you wish, but truth is, I need to read your italics about 5 times before I finally understood your point. Seems like you have a tendency to come to conclusions pretty quickly without being clear-headed.</p>
              <p>2) The word usage of (again) doesn't hold true. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Just because you asked a question the previous time arising from a wrong and illogical point</span>, and thus there is no necessity to answer since your question's base doesn't hold, doesn't mean there had been an evasion of question. Surely you would understand this simple logic.</p>
              <p>Also, you should reflect on how you have phrased your question and choices the previous time. Let me ask you this question, and show me that you do not evade. Do you think you are a pet or pest to qlqq9?</p>
              <p>3) It seems you like to change your question, then tell me I evaded your question. You asked in your post, "honestly, does the above fucking makes sense to you?". The method in which you post strongly suggests that you are asking me whether I understood your <span style="text-decoration: underline;">whole paragraph of italics.</span></p>
              <p>Your usage of "the above" without stating a noun after that could easily mean that you were referring to the whole paragraph of explanations by you simply because you highlighted the whole paragraph in italics.</p>
              <p>Thus, my answer that you do not make sense to me. Please explain to me how this can be considered evasive.</p>

              <p>jesus, i have no bloody time to talk semantics with you. if you read it 10x instead of 5x, i am just asking you to explain fai's sentence, which you grudgingly admit it makes no sense earlier. i have stopped at that and there you go (again).....who's nitpicking?</p>
              <p>i have moved on already. don't worry, you have the last word.</p>

              <p>btw, just so we are clean on this, the `evasive' remark stemmed from my `pet' or `pest' question to you, which took you a while to answer. i know you sibeh logical one.</p>
              <p>on the qlqq9 question, it is not logical. coming from you who took time/effort to pen all you did on word definition, logic, semantics all these while is disappointing. it is not what i think of myself to him, it is what he thinks of me that matters. who the hell cares what LHL think of himself to the world, it is what the world think of him that matters. you can't stopped warp thoughts from anyone, but it serve no purpose. at least do me the courtesy of asking something of value to me. othwise we will discuss why there is only 1 moon on planet earth. you are side-stepping so many things here. </p>
              <p>if you ask if that chap is a pet or pest to me, PET. </p>
