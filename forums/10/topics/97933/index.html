            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by goh meng seng:<br>Dear Laurence82,<br><br>Yes, it is not easy to detect. But Barracuda gives himself away. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> First he claims he does not work for SPH, but in his profile, he says he is an editor. This is a kind of skimming and playing with words. He is not wrong in saying that if he is working for MediaCorp as news editor or editor of Today. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> I was referring to "local mass media" or "news agent", I didn't specify SPH. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br><strong>And it is true that only people in the mass media line, intelligence services, Public Relations etc would be able to access information providers' archives and such. They pay heavy subsription fees for them to utilize the search engines there. Don't you find it strange that he could pull out any ST articles so fast? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> PR companies or mass media people use a special search engine created by organizations like wiser or Factiva that could give them quick access to news articles and information. </strong><br><br>Thus, when he tries to set up the trap for me, to ask me whether HK newspapers report on the Malaysian MAS' plane being sobatage, I already he knew he has hidden agenda. If he could search through news archives so fast, most probably he already knew the answer and hope that I would fall into the trap by being "egoistic". <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> Only agent would want to do that. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Agents would always pretend to be "normal" people; "concerned citizen".  As I have mentioned, they will wait quietly to bite hard but at the same time, trying to hide their intent and agenda. But in this instances, Barracuda has his boat overturn in a small longkang. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> Although he tried to diffuse the attack and do some damage control by bringing in differentiation of Mr. Chiam and Mr. Low, his cover has already been blown off.<br><br>Concerned citizens don't go around setting traps; Concerned citizens don't go around labelling people together to give generalized bad publicity to opposition parties. Concerned citizens don't play with words deliberately to mislead you. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Goh Meng Seng<br><br></blockquote>The new articles I used were taken from : <a href="http://straitstimes.asia1.com/" rel="nofollow">http://straitstimes.asia1.com/</a><br>No "special access" is needed.

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Barracuda,<br><br>You are really a born politician.... giving answers that answer no question. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>I am not asking even your name or address or IC number! Not even which company you are working for! Simply asking you, what type of editor are you? As you have mentioned, there are many kinds of editor, magazine, newspaper, books....etc etc. My guess is, you are the news editor. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> As for whatever organization, I am not interested to know. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>PM Lee puts up a disclaimer that he was on a PRIVATE VISIT to Taiwan. What's your stand? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>The disclaimer simply says that whatever I say here, has nothing to do with Workers' Party; it doesn't mean I could anyhow say things. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>I have cast enough reasonable doubts on you and it is for you to clarify. Instead of doing so, you think you could get back at him by going through my party? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> You see, first, you try to set a trap on me, now, you are trying to discredit me through my party? This has further confirmed your hidden agenda here! You are not interested in any debates, clarify anything, but out to "do me in". <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Thus, don't keep pretending you are the "middle ground moderate" out here, obviously you are not. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> Be proud of your position, your political inclination, nothing wrong with that. So far, this is pretty lacking in YPAP forum too. PAP members are not open enough to come up and say, hey, I am from PAP, I could take on you... or that I could debate and defend my party's policies.... Nah, I don't see that.<br><br>Goh Meng Seng<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by The Barracuda:</div><div class="quote_body">Do I have to give you my name, address and IC number if you request ?
