However, what i can see now in local context is that the strict rules that no dialects is to be allowed on tv/radio programmes still applies.<br><br>And yes, recently, we can see that some of these rules are relaxed.

By doing these, do they they think they can expect the younger generations to speak dialects?

            <div class='col-md body'>I think part of the rationale behind restricting the use of dialects is to make us more homogenous as a society. Remember all the history lessons about riots and conflicts between Chinese of different dialect groups?<br><br>Also, Mandarin and English are the most practical languages to know as they are the most widely used languages in the world. A small country like ours cannot really afford to preserve 'culture' excessively because whatever little human resources we have, we have to develop them to their full working potential and that usually includes being able to communicate effectively in a useful working language. There is simply no practical use for dialects anymore in today's global society.</div>
