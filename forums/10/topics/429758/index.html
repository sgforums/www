              <p><a href="http://sg.news.yahoo.com/singapore-president-s-annual-salary-tops-s-4-2-million-.html">http://sg.news.yahoo.com/singapore-president-s-annual-salary-tops-s-4-2-million-.html</a></p>
              <p>The Singapore Parliament has approved a 26 per cent increase in the President’s
              salary as well as higher salaries for his personal staff for the fiscal
              year of 2010.</p>
              <p>The President’s salary, also known as the Privy Purse, is now set at S$4,267,500, up from $3,376,800.</p>
              <p>The amount for staff salaries is increased to $4,532,400 or $473,600 higher than that of the year before.</p>
              <p>The President’s entertainment allowance remains at $73,000.</p>
              <p>The revision is part of an overall increase in the manpower
              expenditure for the Office of the Istana, which is staffed by 62
              personnel.</p>
              <p>On Thursday, Finance Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam, who proposed
              that the House support the change, said this caters for the
              “recruitment of an additional staff officer to support the work of the
              Council of Presidential Advisers and a butler manager to meet increased
              demand for butler services at the Istana, and to meet the higher
              variable payments on account of a strong economic growth”.</p>
              <p>The President’s salary rises in tandem with that of political, judicial and civil service appointment holders.</p>
              <p>However, the expenditure for Istana expenses was cut by $25,300 to
              $2,068,300 to “reflect savings” on these and other ad hoc spending,
              said Mr Tharman. The total sum allocated for the Civil List is $11.6
              million.</p>
              <p>For the next financial year, Mr Tharman said this overall sum will
              remain unchanged, but the allocation for the President’s salary and
              allowances will drop to $3,782,000 due to lower variable payments
              anticipated.</p>
              <p>An extra $610,000 will be set aside for the Presidential
              Swearing-in Ceremony which is likely to be in late August.</p>

              <p>Up till now, i still do not know why Singaporeans vote for a President? What is the use, time has changed, please change with time, President of Singapore is damn unproductive, not only his high salary, his house, expenses, travel, and even shopping are fully paid for by taxpayers.</p>
              <p>My suggestion is that scrap all those donation shows, remove the president, takes all his allowances and paid to contribution into charity, should be more than enuf to cover at least half of the total donation per year.</p>
              <p>Now I am 22yo, next five years, i will be 27yo, hmmmm....can stand for election liao,...Citizens of Singapore, please bear with me, in five years time, you will see a far greater girl than Nicole or Kate Tin on her way. Remember Angel Lin.</p>

              <p>Up till now, i still do not know why Singaporeans vote for a President? What is the use, time has changed, please change with time, President of Singapore is damn unproductive, not only his high salary, his house, expenses, travel, and even shopping are fully paid for by taxpayers.</p>
              <p>My suggestion is that scrap all those donation shows, remove the president, takes all his allowances and paid to contribution into charity, should be more than enuf to cover at least half of the total donation per year.</p>
              <p>Now I am 22yo, next five years, i will be 27yo, hmmmm....can stand for election liao,...Citizens of Singapore, please bear with me, in five years time, you will see a far greater girl than Nicole or Kate Tin on her way. Remember Angel Lin.</p>
