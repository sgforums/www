            <div class='col-md body'>Maximise their budget allocation for the financial year...<br><br>I was pondering this topic after taking part in a recent event organized by the Ministry of Environment and Water Resources at Suntec Convention Centre..<br><br>The event took place just over the Friday and Saturday 8th and 9th April..<br><br>The event took up one exhibition hall.. over a Friday and Saturday.. peak periods i would suppose for the rentals<br><br>As a participating exhibitor, i was shocked to know that we did not need to pay a single cent for the booth.. so this means that MEWR, NEA and PUB must have footed this bill on their own.<br><br>There was a lot of wasted space.. not the entire hall was filled with booths compared to the normal high turnout exhibitions..<br><br>Being from the private sector, i wont think it helped in any bit cos there wasn any pre-event information telling people abt this.. so the private sector who participated hardly gained anything cos the public turned up and really i felt its a lost cause..<br><br>Public moneys... spent like this.. is a real terrible way.. I am speculating that its probably to spend the remaining cent they have for the financial year..<br><br>I wonder if they did it to spend the remaining cents of the last financial year in order to get a bigger amt this year for the ministry..<br><br>Wonder how many more examples are there?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>is like dat one....die die u have to spend finish the $ b4 FY finish...else the thing will snowball UPWARDS and alot of thing have to be done. If u spend finish or close to 0 then less things to explain. Can overspend abit but cannot underspend just like u can overbuild a support but not underbuild it. same logic.<br><br>so if by late Feb still got alot of $ then will buy some boliao things for whole company and say its welfare. then will bodai boji have massive BBQ and the food is enough for u to pack home and eat for a few days. another way is suddenly buy thumbdrives (excuse is better work efficiency as employees can bring ard data efficiently, no need burn cds or wat fark nonsense) for employees. how to put up paperwork is easy cos its the boss who wants to spend the $, he definitely will chop and sign and submit upwards.<br><br>all the tricks i know one lah....how to 'Hide flower in leaf', 'Borrow flower give to buddha' etc i also learned b4... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

There was also clear  instructions on how to do the exercises and the sequence the various exercises should be done in. But alas, one fine day they decided to replace the still new fitness corner with a miserly one. The new benches, esp the sit-up and leg-raise benches, are so shorter that I can't stretch or do the exercises properly. There are of course no rubber mats and clear instructions.<br><br>This could either be an example of clearing the excess funds or poor assessment  skills of the ministries!</div>
