In other words declare a loss for the year.<br><br>Then they will use the condo facilities for company gathering/bbq lah .. company out of town visitiors lah .. so on and so forth.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

The freaking Gov is holding high on HDB Flats value!!!  The gov have been artificially jacked up the land cost as well; and refuse to bring down the land prices which that would affect  on many other things significantly.  Our land costs have been over valued by as comparing to the demand which do not exist at the moment.  The cost of building an average condo is between 250K to 300K per unit including land cost.  For HDB, cost of the average for 4rms and 5rms on materials, labourer, infrastructures, water, gas and elect installations, design and engineering is between 120K to 150K.  Just look at how much are the Gov selling to us!!!!!    <strong>  We are born Singaporeans; if we don't live here, then where on earth we should be living in???  after 99 years leased, your children and grand children go back to ZZZZero again. Start all over and struggle to pay (the freaking loans with ridiculous interests rates that double by the time if you managed to pay all) their whole life through again. That's all the gov said ""subsidy housing "" to ''Singaporeans"" <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"> </strong></div>
