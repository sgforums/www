              <p>Yup!</p>
              <p>But the trick is to get them to use Singapore as a springboard for bigger things, next year, and the year after that, and the year after that year, and the year after that year. If Singapore can't do that, then F1 will spring else where, not necessarily to China, it could be just across the causeway.</p>

              <p>Gambling is an evil. It lures one into the belief that luck will come, Some becomes obsessed with such beliefs and will do anything and everything to win, with no hard work necessary, at times, even the cost of his own life as well as others.</p>
              <p><br>Since the dawn of civilisation with Sumerians as the firsts recorded ones, gambling had already been ingrained in all cultures. Gambling is not and never a necessary evil, but a habit and a flaw of humanity that has become natural in every known civilisation throughout the course of human history.</p>
              <p><br>No matter how enlightenment is attempted by mankind, gambling persisted thru the ages. Kings, tyrants, depots, rulers and elected govts had tried to eradicate it, but to no avail. It goes instead underground, from the purview of authorities.</p>

              <p>If anyone has a doubt of it being financed or failing, then think again. Many investors had pulled out of investments. Their money is sitting idle while they source for better returns. What better returns than human needs?</p>
              <p>All it needs is for our govt and banks not to panic. Thousands of investors are salivating at the opportunity to own a piece of our IR, even if Sands goes belly up, but then there's still his personal fortune and his group's fortune set aside.</p>
