However, GRCs in the past parliamentary election consisted of divisions of five or six individuals, as opposed to 1988, when there were a large number of three-member divisions and zero five- to six-member divisions.<br><br>Legislation also allows for a minimum of eight single-member constituencies, but the last election had only nine such zones, as opposed to around 40 in 1988.<br>Overall the GRC scheme suggests gerrymandering, as prominent ministers may help weaker party candidates contest a constituency. Every single MP must be admitted to Parliament based on personal merit, and not on the merit of more established party peers.<br>One argument in support of GRCs was that of minority representation, but the first opposition member to enter Parliament in the 1980s was from a racial minority prior to the creation of GRCs.<br>Some also suggest that the Government has no responsibility to create a level playing field, but fail to see that legislation is crafted to undermine opposition members and deter them from participating in elections. Increasing election deposits and laws banning party-political films do not do justice to society.<br><br>If the Government is serious about allowing only the best people to enter Parliament, it should learn to listen to the voice of the people.<br>It does not need to implement laws that prevent people from contesting elections, especially as Singaporeans are becoming increasingly mobile and better educated.<br>Christopher Ledesma Choo Weisen<br>Pennsylvania, USA<br><br>-----------------------------------------------------------<br>Once a government is committed to the principle of silencing the voice of opposition, it has only one way to go, and that is down the path of increasingly repressive measures, until it becomes a source of terror to all its citizens and creates a country where everyone lives in fear<br>--Harry S. Truman - August 8, 1950/ 33rd president of US.<br><br></div>
