              <p>Majority of those students have the same thinking that is to study overseas, work there and stay there permanently.   They don't have faith in the current ruling party of Singapore.   The govt has failed to earn the respect, trust from the people.   </p>
              <p>They don't see any future in Singapore.   To them PAP is doing very badly and they do not agree with the way PAP is managing Singapore.  These students who want to study, work, and stay overseas permanently cited PAP as why they want to leave Singapore.    There have been so much unhappiness that the current ruling party is bringing to the people, it is imperative to do something about it.</p>

              <p>Hong kong is thriving without this system, australia is thriving without this system, and so are many other nations.</p>
              <p>i think the biggest mistake this nation did was to hamper freedom of thought and the spirit of  free will. It resulted in massive brain drain and loss of potential entreprueners who can bring forward  the country.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have not heard of any other country opeing up its workforce doors to cheap and sometimes unskilled labour so freely and worst still these temporary emigrants dont have to pay much of a tax or anything like that.</p>

              <p>last i know that this scenario is for 3rd world countries like Sri Lanka, Africa where they come to Australia to escape their hopeless fate in their homelands. These people could not go back due to various reasons like civil war, poverty ect. and they stay in australia to get an education and a job.</p>

              <p>But Singapore, a first world country?! . Thats really strange that 1000 ppl every year migrate.</p>

              <p>technically speaking, singapore has little locals already since all chinese are migrants, and singapore is predominantly chinese.</p>
              <p>however, in 200 years, all those migrants who came to singapore and decided to sink their roots here will be considered local from their 2nd generation onwards.</p>
              <p>but if you are speaking about having more foreigners than locals, i am not too sure, but maybe 50/50.</p>

              <p>I
                  have had friends leaving Singapore over the years but last week was the
                  first time I had to say farewell to 2 friends who are going off in the
                  same week. They are leaving for good, one for New Zealand, the other
                  for Australia. I tried to persuade them to stay for another month so
                  that they can watch the National Day parade of wonderful things in
                  Singapore that might change their minds but they were all ready to go.
                  When I asked they why they are leaving, among other things, they said
                  they don't want their children to go through what have have gone
                  through in life - high stress in our society, NS, lack of a social
                  safety net, etc. These 2 friends in their forties who fairly successful
                  at what they do, have chosen to leave because they were worried the
                  doors will close for them as they get older - many countries have an
                  age limit of 45 yrs old for immigrants.<br><br>About 10 years ago SM
                  Goh coined the term "quitters" to describe those emigrating and when I
                  first heard it, I thought it was strange to use the term "quit" as if
                  people have resigned from a job. People "quit" when they hate their
                  jobs. The question to ask now is whether the people who listened to SM
                  Goh and became stayers are better off than the quitters who rejected
                  his wisdom. Those who left 10 years ago emigrating to countries without
                  the benefit of PAP leadership must be living in utter misery - after 10
                  years of poor leadership, their lives must be a total disaster. Now you
                  can see the importance of having a 1st world govt that deserves its top
                  salary.<br><span style="color: #ffffff;">.</span><br>If you
                  look at the pattern of emigration, you can tell that these Singaporeans
                  are not so smart. Their first mistake is to leave Singapore and their
                  2nd mistakes is to go to countries with societies that our leaders have
                  been warning us about. It was reported by the Canadian govt that about
                  26,000 Singaporeans have applied for economic visa for PRs (+ family
                  visa the number should be about 40,000) including applications to
                  Australia, NZ, Britain, USA etc we are talking about more than a
                  hundred thousand who have applied to leave, and every other person is
                  thinking of leaving the country. ...and they like to go to countries
                  where there is welfare, democracy, freedom, human rights and all the
                  things that is not good for Singapore. Not only that, they are willing
                  to pay the 20-30% income tax in those countries to support the system.
                  It is obvious the people emigrating from Singapore are really not the
                  smartest citizens, they seem unable to appreciate what our outstanding
                  govt has done for them so they are heading for trouble.<br><br>Looks
                  like the PAP isn't going to do much about people leaving. I guess they
                  have done their utmost to explain why people should stay put and have
                  more children- but if people still want to leave, there is little the
                  govt can do. What the PAP has done to solve the problem of Singaporeans
                  not willing to have children and leaving Singapore is to import people
                  from Vietnam, China and India to make up for the loss. It is not too
                  hard to convince someone from Vietnam where the people earn less than
                  half the wages in China that coming here will improve their economy
                  well being tremendously. Ready made citizens from Vietnam will save the
                  govt a lot in terms of incentives they have to give to highly stressed
                  Singaporeans to have more children</p>

              <p><br>... well I understand your viewpoints, but seriously, has anyone noted HOW MANY foreigners have so far opted to become Citizens of SG? Do we have a figure? Is there a VALID and HONEST figure on the take-up rates of becoming Citizens?</p>
              <p>... I am pretty sure Singapore can last 200 years... question is, what form will it become by then? Just look at the general state of affairs and sentiments to date after only about 50 years...</p>
              <p>... I say that foreigners will always prefer to REMAIN foreign in status judging from their prevailing views &amp; opinions of SIngapore and its government...</p>
              <p>... foreigners are largely NOT mindless, and certainly came here with eyes wide open, and their ears still working ...</p>
