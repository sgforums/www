              <p>Whether you leave or stay shouldn't be about the government, but the country. Heard something like that while watching harold and kumar.</p>
              <p><br>In a sense, people leaving are quitters. They either didn't strive to change the country, or was waiting for someone else to do it. . If you tried, and it didn't work, than no point forcing the issue like banging your head on the wall. You can go around the wall, by migrating. Don't see anything wrong with that.</p>
              <p>But for the youngster, they haven't even tried changing the country, and they are just giving up by migrating. Or they expecting someone else to do something about it.</p>
              <p>Don't give up so easily, do something about it.</p>

              <p>in my experience, those who are serious in quitting, never give their employer a chance, got a job, or even without a job, they threw in their letters. those who talked a lot, complained here and there, how good are the competitors, blah blah blah...after 5 years, the same guys are still talking. Those who could quit actually quited and moved to the third companies already.</p>
              <p>We may not have the power to change the company, we better have the power to quit.</p>

              <p>Frankly,  I'm one of those "quitters" that Kilua is talking about, I'm in my mid 20s I served 10 years in the military. When my contract ended my OC did not even gave me enough days to find a job. Even though I spent days and night and lots of overtime, organizing NDP. All I asked for was some time off to be included in my leave to find jobs even that was impossible. Imagine my job hunt...</p>
              <p>I shifted to Canada, in less than I year I landed a job in a bank with no prior training in financing, my earnings is almost equal to $35/hr. I work 35hrs a week, any overtime is 1.5times my pay.</p>
              <p>I bought a cheap "old" car well less than 10 years for 5k, I pay no road tax, planning to get a Nissan Fairlady 350z for 25k. Singapore price with COE ($270k at least) I pay lower GST 5%. My fuel cost is $1.29/litre.</p>
              <p>I'm getting a house that would be 2000 sq ft about the same price of a flat in Singapore like $350k. Have adouble garage, own little garden, two stories with basement. In Singpaore something similar would cost probably  3.5 million what about property tax?</p>
              <p>Hmmm all this may seem superficial to many but you take a good look at that, if you have to spend the same amount of time, sweat and blood not saying your youth which would you prefer? I'm not sure... Canada... Yes everywhere may have its benefits and disadvantages, but after all that quarrel and backstabbing wouldn't you want more for the same amount of effort you put in?</p>
              <p>Well I'm a quitter but I paid my dues to my country for 10 year so I think I'm entitled to live the best quality life I deserve and not slave for my whole life and get nothing out from it.</p>
              <p>Well you decide for yourself for your own life and your offspring</p>
