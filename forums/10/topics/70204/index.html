            <div class='col-md body'>after reading the thread about Singapore's elitist education system, i decided to start thread because i want to voice out my comments, on something else about the education system, which would have been off topic in that thead (hence this disscussion)<br><br>im sure most of you would have heard about the CCA (known formerly as ECA) points system applied in JCs, polytechnics (not sure) and secondary schools<br><br>in the tertiary education system, they have the PEARLS points<br>PEARLS stands for:<br><br>Participation<br>Enrichment<br>Achievement<br>Representation<br>Leadership<br>Service<br><br>technically, when you take part in a cca, you get more points for the more you do<br>i suppose this is to award those who are more active in their CCAs, and give them a "chance" to compete with the more academically inclined peers<br><br>however, i feel that this system is flawed, and is doing more harm then good<br><br>e.g.<br>i have a friend who is a tennis player<br>for the school's first team or not, that remains undetermined for now (he's still JC1)<br>the tennis team trains (very hard, i would add) at least 3-4 times a week until 7-8 pm<br>he complains that even though he puts in a lot of effort for his cca, he does not feel that the school acknowledges his sweat and toil<br>according to the PEARLS system, he will only get 2 points overall if he continues his efforts in tennis, but fail to get into the first team.<br><br>the main thing that im trying to say is not that the PEARLS system should award more points or whatnot, but rather the bigger picture, of whether it is doing its job appropriately<br><br>right now, such a CCA system awards students who achieve top places in national or international competitions<br>also, under the "leadership" category, it awards points to those who hold titles in leadership positions such as chairman or captain<br><br>how about those who constantly put in effort, but do not have the ability to be one of the best?<br>in an average sized cca, only one or two will be selected to become the "heads"<br>how about the rest of the team who put in effort as well?<br>maybe this is not "convincing" enough, i shall elaborate later<br><br>i believe the CCA points system was set up to "level the playing field" among the students, some of whom do not have the same academic (the 3Rs: read, remember, regurgitate) talents of their fellow students<br>this was supposedly to let those students "catch up" with the other students, and promote the idea of being "all-rounded" students<br><br>what it did however, was just add obstacles to the already challenging rat race<br>instead of helping those caught behind, this system raises the standards for those on top<br>for them to even more differentiate themselves among the rest of the "scholars", CCA was nothing more then just to make themselves appear more "brilliant" then other hopefuls<br><br>originally, national placings were put in place to encourage participation<br>of course the schools responded well, they felt that it was a pretty good idea to introduce competition<br>however, it worked too well<br>schools with commemorable records in the CCA department used that as an advertisement, to encourage budding sportsmen to join them<br>this does not seem to work both ways<br>in institutions where the a particular CCA is well known for winning countless medals, only the best are allowed to remain in the CCA<br>in other words, they have trials for all the players, and only the better ones are allowed to remain<br>it would seem, that the drive for students to continue now comes from how many medals they can win, not their desire to acheive<br>where is the passion?<br><br>note: i have decided to end this post here, as incoherent as it seems, as i am having difficulty organising my thoughts<br>it would be much easier to reply to posts...<br>so please comment<br>ty</div>

In an average JC, of about at least 1000 teenagers forming the student body.. this PEARLS system applies to each and everyone of them. This PEARLS system is flawed because it is designed to encourage this 6 traits.. but only in a hand few of chosen proud students.<br><br>Let me ask you.. how possible is it for 1000 students to "participate" in events, even though we do admittedly have many CCAs, there is enough places for all students to merely participate.. even an "energy saving rep" is participating.<br><br>Next, this is subjective, some people are more "enriched" than others, but NOT everyone will be enriched.<br><br>Now here comes the moment of truth. How possible is it for all students, or majority of students to be able to have "achievement" in their CCAs, via awards. Think about it, you always see a few people being awarded for doing CCA stuff in school.<br><br>How possible is it for all students to "represent" their CCAs in important s-h-i-t? Impossible, only a few chosen Ones will be able to represent their CCAs.<br><br>How possible is it for all students to be in "Leadership" positions in any CCA???<br><br>The PEARLS system is flawed because it only helps a handful of people. But then again out of the 6 characteristics, only 3 characteristics are VERY FLAWED, these are Leadership, Participation and Achievment. Thus it is quite a balanced flawed system heh.<br><br><blockquote><strong>Can the ENTIRE approach to educating our young truly achieve the final objective of having our young becoming EDUCATED, KNOWLEDGEABLE, and (most important of all) CREATIVE ?<br><br>The policies implemented to help in a ROUNDED EDUCATION - that not only places emphasis on SUBJECTS but also on SPORTS, are well intended.<br><br>Unfortunately, either the methods or approaches to achieve the objective were not well THOUGHT THROUGH, or the implementation or the executors of the methods had got it all wrong. </strong></blockquote>One of your ministers himself said this... maybe it was LKY, dunno... "Creativity can only flourish in a DISCIPLINED environment". THis is wrong, creativity flourishes in a borderless world, which is not in Singapore sad to say.<br>E.g. "Can I have my clouds green?"<br>Art teacher will say "NO!"<br>"Hey mr TCS director, what say you to having Wheel Of Fortune Singapore?"<br>TCS director: "No your crazylah" (Based on a true telephone call made me ME when i was 12 years old).<br><br>And recently one comment I made to a school teacher, in my old secondary school:<br>ME: HEy wtf? We could be earning more $$$ via patenships, instead of this CIP bullshit, begging for coins int he street in exchange for stickers.<br>Teacher: Do you have any patentships, dun talk big<br>Me: Yes, our D&amp;T department in school has many new impressive gadgets, (e.g. Mechanical Spiders which cling onto glass surfaces and crawls on tall buildings, cleaning windows, saving $ on bangla window cleaners). We could have patentships<br><br>Teacher: SEow Lar! Go back into the streets and beg, take some more stickers with you.<br><br>Months later, the D&amp;T project prototype for the spider was thrown away, because the new batch of Sec4s came in, and more space was needed for their projects. What a waste (ALL BASED ON TRUE STORIES OF STUNTING CREATIVITY IN SINGAPORE)<br><br>Back to the quote: Your PE programme is pathetic.. it should be called PT, not PE. Since nowadays, PE is just another form of NS preparation. No emphasis on sports.<br><br>But, we must not diss the pursuit of knowledge. It is very important. because without knowledge, you cannot use the knowledge if you dont have it, even if you are creative. However. what is wrong with this system is the stress and hectic schedules of life. People don't have time to go on dates, much less be creative about what they have learned.<br><br>Teachers try to drill Creativity by not "spoon-feeding" students in class, forcing them to look up their own materials. Yes it is a way, but given the limited time that students have to study, plus the mindless CIP routines, plus the PEARLS bull-s-h-i-t. There is not enough time... 2 years is not enough time. 2 years does not even take into account the severe Ego issues possessed by local teachers... where local teachers cancel lectures if even 1 student insults their superiority by "taking"/"whispering", resulting in less curriculum time.<br><br>This is not the way to go.<br><br>When i look at your system, i would cry if I were one of you. Something is seriously wrong, if a foreign infidel without any knowledge of mandarin, can master the language in 3 years in Britain or Australia, while a local student is still struggling after being in school for 16 years. Something is seriously wrong.<br><br></div>
