            <div class='col-md body'>just accept who they are and what they are.No point arguing.<br>As describe in the sunday times 27/10/2002.<br><br>SINGAPORE and Malaysia's dismal failure to sort out water supply and other outstanding issues that have dogged the two sides in the past decade must have many asking: Why?<br><br>The most obvious reason for the protracted to-ing and fro-ing that has yielded little than a lot of sound and some fury is, of course, money, as evidenced by the haggling over water price.<br><br>But the chasm appears to be more than one of dollars and cents.<br><br>Malaysian leaders and opinion makers have given the clearest signals of this in the sport they make of lobbing accusations at Singapore's approach and attitude.<br><br>The epithets that have been hurled south include 'legalistic', 'unreasonable' and 'insensitive'.<br><br>Singapore says its lack of response to the barrage is the wish to just 'quietly and politely state the facts and let them stand'.<br><br>Another reason for the reticence is the knowledge that politics play a greater role in Malaysian life.<br><br>Hence much of what emanates from across the Causeway can be discounted as being aimed at voters from Johor to Kelantan rather than at Singapore.<br><br>This may explain why Singapore has been calm - until now.<br><br>The turning point came last week when it unleashed an unprecedented broadside against Malaysia.<br><br>On the day that talks in Johor Baru between officials ended yet again without any breakthrough, it charged Kuala Lumpur for being not sincere, serious or realistic.<br><br>The departure from 'stating the facts' indicates that mere logic no longer serves.<br><br>Perhaps Singapore leaders and officials are coming to the conclusion that Malaysia perceives Singapore in a peculiar way.<br><br>How?<br><br>One theory goes like this: There is an irreconcilable difference between the two countries that not only began with but was the very reason for their separation.<br><br>Malaysia wanted a 'Malay Malaysia' and threw Singapore out for its vision of a 'Malaysian Malaysia'.<br><br>This is a fundamental divergence in political philosophy between a system that gives special rights to the people of the soil over the other races and one that is meritocratic and colour-blind.<br><br>So, on top of the economic competition, there is a contest between two social and political systems that are the antithesis of each other.<br><br>A Malaysian who follows bilateral relations told me: 'The rivalry stems from Malaysia wanting to show that, despite its bumiputra policy, it can be better than Singapore's 'so-called' system of meritocracy.'<br><br>Another observer, a KL-based Singaporean, explains the 'so-called': 'Malays there question Singapore's success because they see Malay Singaporeans as 'oppressed' '.<br><br>But others believe the rivalry goes further. In this view, the success, perhaps even the very existence, of one system becomes an indictment of the other.<br><br>During Separation, Malaysia in particular thought it would always better Singapore in three areas: military, economy and water.<br><br>These asymmetries give Malaysia sway over Singapore.<br><br>New Straits Times reader M. Ghazali Osman said in a letter to the Malaysian daily last month: 'We don't depend on Singapore for anything. Singapore does, very much, depend on us for its existence.'<br><br>Nobody expected that the leverage in all three areas would disappear. First, Singapore prospered, which allowed it to gain military parity or more with Malaysia.<br><br>Then this year with Newater opening the prospect of self-sufficiency, the last of Singapore's dependence on Malaysia has vanished.<br><br>But Malaysia cannot quite believe that if it comes to the crunch Singapore can do without its water. So it still treats the smaller neighbour as a younger brother.<br><br>And those who feel the balance shifting regret letting Singapore go 37 years ago. They include Mr Noor Azam who wrote in Malaysia's Berita Minggu in August that former Malaysian Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman okayed Singapore's 'amputation' in the midst of weathering a bad case of shingles in London.<br><br>This kind of thinking, the theory concludes, is the reason that Singapore and Malaysian leaders - at least among the older generation who lived through Separation - approach bilateral issues differently.<br><br>But it is clear that Singapore doesn't see ties that way. It sees no special, much less a dependent, relationship.<br><br>The question is whether it is beginning to think that Malaysia holds the view that Singapore's success is a critique of its own system - and whether Malaysia in fact does.<br><br>On the first question, Singapore leaders have not given any indication publicly how it sees Malaysia see Singapore.<br><br>If they believe that Malaysia will not be happy as long as Singapore does well, then it will mean many years of turbulent ties ahead until the new generation without the emotional baggage takes over.<br><br>And it will of course colour Singapore's own response to Malaysia's words and actions.<br><br>As for the second question, some Malaysians such as Mr Noor Azam evidently consider Singapore's existence as an affront to Malaysia.<br><br>But is it the majority view or even the prevailing view among the leaders there?<br><br>Both the Singaporean and Malaysian analysts I quote above don't think so.<br><br>It is a rivalry, one said, but not a 'I-want-to-kill-ya' kind.<br><br>Let's hope that this is really the case.<br></div>
