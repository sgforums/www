            <div class='col-md body'>In a Straits Times article yesterday, it was mentioned that although many devout and educated Muslims seek to reform Muslim society through positive social action as a result of the desire to translate common religious values into positive nation building (which many muslim societies in the world are in need of) there are a small minority who fall prey to terrorist ideology.<br><br>The article discusses why this is so and concludes that devout educated Muslims should be considered political opponents and not potential terrorists.<br><br>Should educated and devout Muslims be considered political opponents simply on the basis that they are devout and educated?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>islam is the 2nd largest religion in the world with an adherrant of 1.4 billion people. arabs only constitute 10% of the entire muslim population. sad to say, mot all musli,s here understand their religion basically<br><br>seriously speaking, muslims here are either ignorant or they arent in the spirit of learning islam as much as muslims who live in europe and america. alot of the muslims here have mix cultre and religion. born muslims tend to see religion only as a cultural thing passed on from their parents. how many muslims here actually go to religious schools btw? muslims here only know that islam is all about praying, dont eat pork, halal, haram, recite quran etc..theyre not aware that islam is not just a religion but a way of life, culture &amp; civilization that governs every aspect of life be it politics, finance, knowledge, islamic arts.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>^agreed. before muslim can even wana talk about all this teror and politicalised radicalised islam, lets fix the problem with the muslim community first. in a way, i was like wondering wether islam in SEA has evolved into a racial religion identified with the malays, where if ure a malay, u must be a muslim and not being a muslim will loose ur priviledge as a malay race. one of my frens from brunei told me non muslims there arent allowed to touch the quran because non muslims are impure..i mean WTH..then how did the arabs came to do da'wah to the malays during the pre islamic times in SEA?<br><br>How will you teach a Arab non-muslims?? You see here, they think all ARABS are MUSLIMS!! there RE such things as arab jews, arab agnostics and arab christians!!<br><br>i think thats why the non practising muslims here tend to be bigoted because sm non-muslims will say "oh theyre peaceful muslims because they dont practise their religion and are ignorant of their rleigion..if they are religous i bet they will be extremists..its better to keep them in the dark form learning their religion"<br><br>You see throughout the history, including in these times, Malaysia has always emphasized on 'ibadah instead of 'aqeedah.<br><br>And so what you learn in primary, secondary, etc. is mostly about 'ibadah. If 'aqeedah was learnt, one can never feel the fuzzyness of iman entering into the heart. I dont get my iman boosted when I read my Islamic textbook.<br><br>And so your average Malay mostly knows how to pray, go to the mosque, and read the Qur'an. The average Malay would not know nor thought about looking up on the meaning of the Qur'an.<br><br>Malays aren't in the spirit of the knowledge in Islam like Muslims in the West do. I would totally consider Muslims in the West (including America and Europe)  to be better than Malays over here.<br><br></div>
