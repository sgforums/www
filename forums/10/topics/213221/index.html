            <div class='col-md body'>Oct 2, 2006<br><strong>Traffic Police outsourcing is 'fair and transparent'</strong><br><br>I REFER to the recent letters on outsourcing of Traffic Police functions, including 'Old hands at driving booked 5 times in month' by Ms Koh Bee Kwang (ST, Sept 23), 'Cops, not wardens, should nab offenders' by Mr Tan Lam Siong (ST, Sept 26), 'Unsuspecting motorist gets ticket in 'ambush' by Mr James Yap Chong Ann (ST, Sept 2<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">, 'Too many motorists get booked in overkill' by Mr Phillip Lee Fook Seng (ST, Sept 2<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> and 'Can Traffic Police shed light on outsourcing?' by Mr Roger Tan Chee Beng (ST, Sept 30).<br><br><span style="color: red;">Excellent, they already have a reply on hand and they wait for all similar letters to be published before they do this "non-reply" reply. Reminds me of the "ahhhh yu gen!" in Streetfighter.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> </span><br><br>Parking regulations on public roads must be effectively enforced to enhance road safety and minimise congestion problems. After careful consideration, Traffic Police outsourced enforcement of illegal parking to Cisco in 1999 so its resources can be better focused on enforcement of serious moving offences such as speeding, running red lights and drink driving.<br><br><span style="color: red;">This I agree. Outsourcing allows more manpower to be effectively deployed at the field level. This will save TP a lot of hassle.</span><br><br>Cisco traffic wardens undergo appropriate training before they are deployed at designated areas with high complaints of illegal parking on the road. They are visible in their white uniforms when on duty. A system of checks and balances has been put in place to ensure these traffic wardens conduct their duties in a fair and transparent manner.<br><br><span style="color: red;">Fair. </span><br><br>Cisco and its traffic wardens are not paid according to the number of summonses issued. Cisco is paid according to the value of the contract awarded. Nor is there any requirement for it to meet any quota of summonses. The fines collected go directly into the Government's Consolidated Funds.<br><br><span style="color: red;">I don't think there's a commission sysytem like sales but there is definitely an individual quota. (Otherwise what are they hired for? To eat snake under HDB blocks and occupy the benches with their fat arses?) Contract renewal, imo, is also subjected to the amount of fines colleced. Why would the govt want to renew the contract if insufficient revenue is coming in?</span><br><br>Enforcement of bus lane offences comes under LTA's purview. To <span style="color: blue;">facilitate </span>smooth traffic flow in bus lanes during peak hours, LTA has outsourced enforcement to United Premas, whose wardens undergo necessary training for their duties. Bus lane enforcement is required to ensure that buses can better keep to their schedules for the benefit of the many commuters who rely on public transport.<br><br><span style="color: red;">What they mean by facilitate, imo, means more wardens employed by United Premas and therefore making the flow of bus lanes smoother. Which means more fines (and more revenue)? We can't complain right? Cos they make bus lanes smoother what</span><br><br>In the case of Ms Koh and her husband, we urge them to follow the traffic rules when driving.<br><br><span style="color: red;">HAHA poor things.</span>  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>We would also like to remind motorists they should abide by all traffic rules and regulations at all times. This will enable all members the motoring public to have a smoother ride on our roads.<br><br><span style="color: red;">Moral of the story is, complain all u want as this LHL govt implores genuine feedback but pls forget about any serious reactions to them.</span><br><br>Audrey Ang<br>Assistant Director (Media Relations)<br>Singapore Police Force<br><br><span style="color: red;">Oh this personnel here is a standard reply machine.</span></div>
