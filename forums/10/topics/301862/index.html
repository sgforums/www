            <div class='col-md body'>Everything in life has its pros and cons. There are good as well as bad in policies that I can agree with you too.<br><br>There will be no end to such kind of reasoning. It is the government and its civil servants who will have to take detailed actions in implementing policies and changes to overcome negative impacts and constraints inevitable in any decisions.<br><br>Nail the key issues and problems facing us like rising costs of living and unnecessary and unwarranted taking and profiteering despite every department making so much monies from hidden gains of all sorts not disclosed to the citizens.<br><br>Why must we keep speaking for them with so many details "ifs" and "buts" which the civil servants should look into in taking any direction.<br><br>All we the citizens (or chaw mins as one forummer here put it) have the tendency to split our views on important issues and problems affecting us by going prematurely into unessential nitty gritty sometimes.<br><br>All that we need to do will be to point out with logics and facts what go wrong and what need to be done among alternatives available and go into disagreeing with detailed aspects of change which no doubt may include some negatives to be overcome which can be overcome given our many scholars. We the citizens have every right to expect them to be capable to overcome problems at site at the detailed level.<br><br>So please do not kill the good idea with so many premature detailed points to stuff out the main issues.<br><br>It is enough for us citizens to point out the big issues and analyse them sufficiently to get the right solutions or alternatives.<br><br>Let the ministers who pay themselves millions do all the worrying how to overcome certain inevitable constraints and "ifs" and "buts".<br><br>Sadly often citizens try to talk too much of details and tend to disagree among themselves over such matter and cloud out problems and slow down change.<br><br>I am afraid if we adopt such a mode of discussion among citizens all the time we will end up having a NATO government without direction because they are full of hypocrisy and people are adding more confusions about our direction.<br><br>When we want our government to be more caring about our rising costs we do not have to keep saying the same thing that there are so many costs beyond their control. Just point out the main issues why and where they go wrong and let their scholars work on such suggestions.<br><br>If they are not up to the mark then let them feel the heat and do not have to excuse them with so many views why they cannot do it.<br><br>If we want to be competitive, creative, entrepreneurial and vibrant, we as people also should have clear thinking what we want to say and what we need now is to be united so as to give very clear direction where we want to go.<br><br>The ministers are having too much hypes and hypocrisy. Let them see this sort of thing as unhelpful and get them to recognize the problem with their talent - lack of implementation ability.<br><br>The ministers are caring too much for themselves and their power and monies, let them see that this is immoral and let them understand and feel the heat to change so as to serve the people with morality and not just use of legal or political power alone to ram everything down our throats.<br><br>The direction we now need may include finding heavy weight ministers who know full well how to provide clear direction to overcome a lot of problems in implementation.<br><br>So what we need is not a lot of hair splitting. Support good and creative ideas wherever they come and unite our views with one voice and get government to change for the good of all.</div>
