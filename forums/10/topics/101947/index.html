            <div class='col-md body'>I feel that people from poor families are treated unfairly in Singapore. Especially for us guys. We have to go through army and serve NS. Since the market is bad, finding a perm good job is hard! Imagine that on top of all the trouble of being jobless, the army bothers you by calling you up for reservist.<br>Thats where all the rich kids got themselves covered.<br><br>Being rich their parents  can afford them a better environment to nuture them. Most of them go through army halfway as they defer to go study University. The army cannot touch them and their parents pay for their education. After that, they go back to army and do nothing and when they ORD can get a better job because of their degree. For poor people, with only a diploma or less, they have to start at the bottom or even worse. Our pay sucks and even after working many years we might not be able to reach the level of the degree holder. If we study private U, we have to pay ourselves and cannot use our CPF money to do so.<br><br>On top of all this grief, we still have all the crap about local ladies being judgemental of us guys. Give me a break and just admit that if  the person is poor and lowly educated, he's not worth the time. Spare me the excuses.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Rich not equal can go university<br>Poor not equal only can get diploma<br><br>Education gives you advantage is a fact of life<br>Born in rich family means great advantage is also a fact of life<br><br>If you are born in an average family, that means you belong to the majority.<br>If you are born rich, you are lucky and belongs to the minority.<br><br>So, if you always compare to the luckiest people, you always feel being deprived.<br><br>If you compare to everyone around, you may realized that you are really in quite a good shape. There are many who do not even have a proper family (I got a friend who's mother is the mistress, and a few who's father left them), some who are born with deformities, some who are born ugly (with birthmark on their face), some who are born poorer than you are (already working since primary school to help supplement family income), some are born with irresponsible dad (Drunk, owes loan shark $$ for gambling) etc etc.... I have many friends who are in each of the above conditions.<br><br>So, if you start looking around you, at the less fortunate people, you may realized you are very lucky already. At least you are born without liabilities. As for your future, it is how you want to make it out to be for yourself.<br></div>

The local girls have the right to choose who they love , who can support them better. In singapore, no education and no money = no hope and no future, sorry but this is how the country is runned.  Would a girl want to support a good for nothing husband? I won't and I doubt my fellow compatriots will.<br><br>Either you try to succeed at breaking out of the mould or you can continue whining about how miserable your life is .<br><br>You can always attempt to break out of the class divide. Even hawkers are very rich from selling or lak or char kuay teow. The thing that is influence your life is money qualification - no use if you have education qualification .<br><br></div>
