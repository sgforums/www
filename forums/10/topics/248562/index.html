"I call you a liar and unless you sue me, you are a liar".<br><br>(2) Police in possession of evidences beneficial to accused refuse to tender or surrender such evidences to the defendant for the purpose of establishing justice.<br><br>(3) Abolition of jury to hear evidences of facts.<br><br>(4) Control of the media causing restrictions in reporting facts and problems affecting the people.<br><br>(5) Use of defamation suits to sue and disable potential election candidates from standing for election for the greatest good of the greatest number.<br><br>(6) Use of GRC to interfere with or prevent the best individual candidates from standing for election under the one-man-one-vote parliamentary democracy.<br><br>(7) Corporatization of essential government services into privatised GLCs which double charge and triple charge people again on assets and land costs which were already owned by the people.<br><br>Where the leaders only govern for their own benefits and convenience or expediency, the country becomes a police state or worse than a police state and the country no longer belongs to the people but the leaders - not even the ruling party which merely become the instrument for nkf wrong doings.</div>
