            <div class='col-md body'>At the moment, i believe the manufacturing and electronics sectors are slowing down despite recent analysts reports and will dry up as soon as regional hubs in Malysia and China start to match our quality assurance. Taiwan has already  entrenched themselves in informatics and IT assembly so it will come as no surprise if China follows.<br><br>Singapore has come a long way though and newer ideas like entrepreneurship are likely to be the in-thing come the 22nd century.<br><br>However, a note of caution. In the case of entrepreneurship, we cannot be sure how and in what direction it will take flight as entrepreneurship itself is too general a term. It might involve food outlets, innovations, electronic products etc etc, all of which will not be able to project a firm result in our overall profit markets.<br><br>For now, we should continue to look at emerging markets and new ideas with a teaspoon of salt and not see too much into these alternatives as yet.</div>
