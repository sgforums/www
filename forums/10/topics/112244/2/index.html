            <div class='col-md body'>Can everybody just stop flaming??? It's gettin' outta hand... Pls, altho I am an ex-Rafflesian, I must say that some of the responses here are getting outta hand. Pls, I noe that everyone has in-born bias against other schs. When such a letter appear, the disapproval plus the bias would make them want to post something against the sch that is currently under attack. For example, if ACS(I) were to have any scandals now (not tt I'm saying there is and pls do not take offense, it's just an example), some RI boys will jump at the chance to flame them.<br><br>What can we do then? First, handle this issue from a rational and mature point of view. There's not use bickering over one's upbringing and we must be sensitive to other's viewpoints. For example, the title of the thread is quite un-aptly named. Even if it's other JCs, I would say that such titles do not merit a place in this forums. Throw away all biasness and look at this issue with rational thoughts. After all, such rituals are just part and parcel of sch life and there is no need to link it to the future of Singapore and how our future leaders will be ill-bred etc. Yes, indeed, we have seen leaders who were atrociously notorious in their sch or they are sch droupouts and they have gone on to great careers and successes in their respective arenas.<br><br>Therefore, everyone pls cool down and give this issue a serious and rational thought. There's no use expressing irrational and emotional replies that will not serve any constructive purposes to the issue.<br><br>Thanks for reading. Pls PM me if you have any flaming towards me. I can take it and will try to convince you to give it a cool thought.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Its true, its not the game that is the joke, its how RI is in the limelight because of this event. Bluntly put, its a disgrace to the school. The boy may leave, or you can blame the kid, you can flame the parent, but it is already a solid fact that RI allowed such stupid games to be played and above all, the whole Singapore knows of it because it is in the news.<br><br>So it is a disgrace to the school, simple as that. I can't think of any better word.</div>
