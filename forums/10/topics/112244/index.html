            <div class='col-md body'>Wat's wrong wif taupoking? Everyone sure had his fun time in school... Dun tell my our ministers never played catching in sch? Taupoking is just a way for ppl to relax. In my sch, even the prefects taupok each other but they are actually good leaders. If S'poreans cannot even tahan such things, let their children go thru a hassle-free life which is like a bed of roses, I think we might as well say that we cancel NS.<br><br>When that day comes, I WILL migrate, no becos our future leaders taupok each other in JC or watsoever. It's becos parents and others cannot even accept taupoking in JC or sch and want their child/nephew or niece/sibling to go thru life without these things. How can we expect THIS type of leaders to lead us? Malaysia just say "I dun sell water to you anymore" and THESE type of leaders will do anything just to retain their own comfort zone, even to the extent of betraying our contries.<br><br>Just like an Italian guy said in the COMPASS Partners ceremony, let the children play. Let them play and stop burdening them with books. Let them live their childhood to the fullest.</div>
