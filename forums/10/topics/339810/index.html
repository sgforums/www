              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;"><img src="http://www.yawningbread.org/images/flicred.gif" border="0" alt="" width="20" height="10"> Wanting to press for a resolution of his dispute with his employer, Xue
                    Hanming, a construction worker originally from Jiangsu, China, called the
                    Ministry of Manpower on 3 December 2008. "Ms Foo [Kim Hui] told me to
                    go down to the ministry the next day," he told me.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">On the 4th, he arrived and asked the
                    reception clerk to inform Ms Foo of his presence. He was asked to sit in
                    the waiting area.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">After a long while with no sign of Foo,
                    Xue began to wonder if something else was up. Fresh in his mind was the
                    case of a fellow worker, Xue Chengming (no relation), who had been seized
                    by security agents hired by their employer on 2 Dec. More
                    on Xue Chengming's seizure below.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">Fearing a similar fate, Xue decided to
                    leave. Moments after stepping out, he saw his manager and a couple of
                    security guards enter the Manpower ministry building. It was a near miss.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">The coincidences scream at you. Who would have alerted the employer that Xue Hanming was in the
                    ministry building? Why did Foo never come down to meet someone with
                    whom she herself had asked to come to the ministry, giving the impression
                    that she was prepared to discuss the matter with the complainant? Are
                    government offices meant to be places for resolving problems in good faith
                    and according to the law, or locations for entrapment?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">But let's start from the beginning.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">* * * * *</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;"> <br> The two Xue were members of a larger group of workers -– a figure of 32
                    was mentioned at some point in the interview -– who were in dispute with
                    their employer, Xuyi Building Engineering Co, a "foreign company
                    registered in Singapore" according to the records at the Accounting and
                    Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA). Its registration number is F 065765
                    K.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">Xuyi is a subcontractor at both the
                    Marina Bay and Sentosa casino projects. I am told that Xuyi is a
                    subcontractor for multinational construction company Ssangyong at these
                    sites.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">This was not the first time that Xuyi
                    faced unhappy workers. There was at least one earlier batch who had lodged
                    complaints against the company -- a fact that the Ministry of Manpower
                    acknowledged to Xue and his colleagues. More on that batch's story in the
                    box at right.</span></p>

                    to Singapore in late 2007, one in February 2008 and two, including Xue
                    Hanming, in June 2008.</span></p>
              <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Before coming here, they had signed
                    employment contracts with a labour agency in China -– whom they later discovered
                    was set up by the spouse of the boss of Singapore Xuyi -– which contained a paragraph
                    on expected remuneration. It is not an altogether clear clause, but it may
                    be common in China. Essentially, it says that the monthly salary will be
                    in the range of "S$1,250 to S$1,500 (subject to satisfactory
                    diligence)". It also specified that if they worked every day of a
                    month, they would get an extra S$1 per day, i.e. S$30 for a 30-day month.</span></p>
              <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><img src="http://www.yawningbread.org/arch_2008/pic-962b.jpg" border="0" alt="" width="480" height="150"><br> <em>The clause in their
                    employment contract</em></span></p>
              <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"> <br> By end October, Xue Hanming and others
                    were seriously unhappy about not receiving their wages, formally lodging
                    their complaints with their company's management. Xue himself, following
                    the company's procedure, signed a form recording his grievance.</span></p>
              <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">They even had difficulty at that stage.
                    Xue wanted the complaint form to say that he wanted three months of salary
                    arrears to be paid, but the supervisor or manager insisted on rewriting it
                    to say "Salary too little, not in keeping with contract
                    obligation". As you can imagine, the rewrite would conceal the fact
                    that the company had broken Singapore law by not paying its workers on
                    time; the rewrite cast5 it as a dispute about interpretation of contractual
                    terms.</span></p>
              <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">In response, the company produced a
                    schedule listing what the men were owed. In Xue's case, the schedule showed
                    that his gross salary in June and July was over S$1,400 monthly, but for
                    August, September and October, his gross decreased to S$1,300 and S$1,200.</span></p>
              <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">It was similar for the others in the
                    batch.</span></p>
              <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Xue asked his management: "Is the
                    gross salary for the last three months lowered because I filed a complaint
                    and indicated I wanted to go back?"</span></p>
              <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">He was not given much of an answer.
                    "It's like that," was what the company representative told him.</span></p>
              <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Xue was prepared to accept the slightly
                    reduced amounts, but then the company produced a list of deductions that
                    whittled the gross salaries of August, September and October down to a
                    nett S$1,400 or so. For all three months.</span></p>
              <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Others had it worse,</span></p>
              <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">"In my case," said Liu Xiaoping,
                    "my nett after deductions was just about S$500 for those three
                    months!" As was the case for Chen Yuguang -– one of two guys
                    currently in ICA detention.</span></p>
              <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><img src="http://www.yawningbread.org/arch_2008/pic-962c.jpg" border="0" alt="" width="480" height="446"><br> <em>The Zaobao article
                    (undated) they saw (and photocopied)</em></span></p>
              <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"> <br> Now feeling cheated and quite irate, they
                    also chanced upon a story in the Chinese-language newspaper Lianhe Zaobao
                    which told of another company being found in the wrong for holding back
                    salaries time-wise and through deductions. They further learnt that it was
                    illegal for companies not to pay overtime for working hours in
                    excess of 44 hours a week.</span></p>
              <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">In their case, they had been working
                    every day, seven days a week. They often worked more than 80 hours a week.
                    This only fueled their anger.</span></p>
              <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"> <br> <strong>Ministry of Manpower – first meeting</strong></span></p>
              <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">On 6 November 2008, they filed a complaint
                    with the Ministry of Manpower, meeting the above-mentioned Ms Foo and an
                    officer whose surname in hanyu pinyin was Chen.</span></p>
              <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Xue recounted that Chen waxed lyrical
                    with three allegorical tales.</span></p>
              <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">"His first story was from Lu Xun,
                    about a patriot and revolutionary named Ah Q, who ended up being executed,
                    because he was illiterate. He signed a confession without understanding
                    it.</span></p>
              <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">"I told him in response, 'The era of
                    Ah Q is over'." Refusing to be compared to an illiterate, Xue pointed
                    to the Zaobao article that had informed him of his rights. The article had
                    said that it is illegal for an employer to make deductions from workers'
                    pay. Even if an agreement had been signed, the agreement would not be
                    valid, Xue summarised the news story.</span></p>
              <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Chen then spoke of the Yellow
                    River, saying that at its source the water is clear, but in the lower
                    reaches, it is yellow and muddy. "Frankly," noted Xue, "I don't understand what he was
                    trying to say. Was he saying that Singapore is muddy?"</span></p>
              <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The Manpower official then launched into
                    his third allegory. "Rub two stones and you get a spark," Xue
                    recalled Chen saying. "But if you have an egg and a stone.... You
                    workers are the eggs."</span></p>
              <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">"He said this in front of more than
                    20 workers as well as company representative Tang Xuan," reported Xue.
                    "And the meeting ended like that with no conclusion."</span></p>
              <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Along the way, the workers learnt that
                    the same company had had a similar case just weeks before. Twelve workers,
                    originally from Henan, had meetings with the Manpower ministry in October
                    and were eventually sent home to China in early November. Workers in that
                    batch were upset about the same things, and demanded to be released from
                    their contracts and repatriated. To close that case, the company deducted
                    S$100 for each month in the contract not worked. There were also
                    deductions for rent and utilities.</span></p>
              <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The current batch said that if the
                    company would use the same formula, they would accept the settlement. But
                    this time, the company refused, while the ministry officials said,
                    "We can't tell your employer what to pay you."</span></p>
              <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"> <br> <strong>Ministry of Manpower – second and third
                    meetings</strong></span></p>
              <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The mediation session of 19 November was
                    likewise fruitless. The employer stood firm, saying something to this effect: These projects (the casinos)
                    are important projects, and if we let
                    you quit whenever you want, we cannot complete them in time.</span></p>
              <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The third meeting was not held at the
                    ministry, but at the worksite. Inside information told Yawning Bread that
                    the ministry was seeing more and more workers showing up and making
                    complaints, and they did not want the public to see how many unhappy
                    workers were descending on their premises.</span></p>
              <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Held on 26 November, the officer Chen
                    circumlocuted again. He spoke of a wolf, goat and grass wanting a
                    boatman's services to cross a river. The problem was that if the boatman
                    did so, with the three of them ending up on the same bank, they would devour
                    each other.
                    According to Xue, the ministry saw itself as the boatman. The wolf
                    represented what he called third parties, (which could be the NGOs and
                    outsiders getting involved), the goat the company, and the workers the
                    lowly grass.</span></p>
              <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Soon after making this nebulous
                    comparison, Chen told the company's
                    representative, Tang Xuan, something to this effect: "Go and settle
                    this properly. I have to go now because I have an exam to take tomorrow."</span></p>
              <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">And with that, the meeting broke up.</span></p>
              <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Facing total intransigence on the
                    employer's part, the workers thought about hiring a lawyer, but they had
                    no money. Eventually they turned to an NGO, TWC2 (Transient Workers Count
                    Too), who are now trying to help them though they too have very limited
                    influence and resources.</span></p>

                              back to China remained dissatisfied about the terms they got

              <p>Along the way, some of the workers in the group gave up and accepted
                    the company's unfair and miserly terms, and were repatriated –- or at
                    least that was the impression that Yawning Bread got. Six held on. But for
                    these six, things got nastier.</p>
              <p><strong>Tuesday, 2 December:</strong> Four or five
                    security agents hired by the employer, and led by the company
                    representative Tang Xuan, went to Xue
                    Chengming's dormitory between 10 and 11 in the morning and took him away under coercion.
                    One co-worker witnessed it and informed Xue Hanming. Shortly after, agents from another security company
                    took Chen Yuguang away from his dormitory, which was at a different
                    location. To Yawning Bread, the two instances sound awfully like
                    kidnapping.</p>
              <p>Friends tried to call Xue Chengming on his two
                    mobile phone numbers, but these were switched off. Nor could friends reach
                    Chen Yuguang.</p>
              <p>In the latter's case, the security agency which snatched him was
                    identified as a company with a name like "UTR". It was traced,
                    and TWC2 rang them to enquire if Chen was there. It was established that
                    he was. Yang Zhiqiang, Xue Hanming, Sha Najak from TWC2, together with Stephanie Chok -– a
                    Singaporean who helps workers in her personal capacity -– went there and
                    had a chance to speak with him.</p>
              <p>Chen told them that his handphone had been taken from him by the
                    security agents. One could assume that Xue Chengming too had been relieved
                    of his two phones by the security agents who seized him.</p>
              <p>Yawning Bread asked the men at the interview: Who owned the phones?
                    They said the men did. They were the personal property of Xue and Chen.
                    Well, dear readers, doesn't that amount to robbery? And wouldn't keeping
                    people incommunicado reinforce the justification for calling this kidnap?</p>
              <p><strong>Wednesday</strong><strong>,
                    3 December:</strong> Around midnight Tuesday/Wednesday, police arrived at UTR
                    -- almost surely a result of a phone call from the employer Xuyi to the
                    police -- and took Chen Yuguang to Central Police
                    Station. </p>
              <p> When Stephanie went there
                    Wednesday afternoon, she also enquired with the police about Xue Chengming.
                    She told them that no one had been able to contact him since the day
                    before and people needed to know his whereabouts and if he was safe. After
                    some pleading, the police checked their database and found him as being in
                    custody at Bedok Police Station. His status was that he had been
                    "arrested" for overstaying. </p>
              </span>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">Were they overstayers? This could not be so, because Xue Chengming, for one, had a
                    letter from the Ministry of Manpower setting an appointment date of 4
                    December, and it was only 2 or 3 December when the police took him in.</span></p>
              <span style="font-size: x-small;">
              <p>The way things are supposed to work in Singapore is that when employees
                    are in a dispute with en employer, the Ministry of Manpower issues them
                    with special passes so that they can remain in Singapore until the issues
                    have been resolved. Having a letter from the Ministry of Manpower setting
                    up an appointment is a good sign that these people had been put on
                    special passes.</p>
              <p>Moreover, a certain Nigel, an officer with the Ministry of Manpower,
                    would later confirm to TWC2 that these men had been issued with special passes,
                    but he also said that these passes were handed over to the employer at the
                    time of issuance. However, Nigel added that the "passes had expired
                    because the employer neglected to renew them" according to an email
                    Stephanie received from TWC2.</p>
              <p>This does not make any sense, so the
                    above information may be wrong. How can Manpower entrust the special passes to
                    the employer when the employer and workers are locked in a dispute? How
                    can the employer have the discretion to "renew" or not, the special
                    passes, when the employer would have an interest in throwing the workers
                    out of the country?</p>
              <p>Whatever it is, it's quite evident that the men are not overstayers
                    -–
                    and based on usual procedure, they would not be -– but the police seemed
                    to think he was. It is believed that like Chen Yuguang's case, Xuyi called
                    the police after their security agents had seized Xue Chengming, with Xuyi
                    telling the police that Xue was an overstayer. The police appeared to be
                    uninterested in checking their information.  Effectively, therefore, the police
                    were holding people unlawfully.</p>
              <p><strong>Thursday, 4 December:</strong> Xue Hanming had his near miss with security agents
                    in the lobby of the Ministry of Manpower, as described at the start of
                    this story.</p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Halfway through Yawning Bread's interview, Xue Hanming received a call from Chen
                    Yuguang on his handphone. Chen and Xue Chengming had by then been dumped
                    by the police onto the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA). Chen was calling from an ICA
                    landline (his cellphone having been seized). He was
                    under pressure from the ICA to find the money to buy his air ticket home,
                    and was appealing to his friends for help.</span></p>
              <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Why was
                    Chen Yuguang and Xue Chengming looking to buy their own air tickets home? you should ask.
                    After all, the rule is that employers are responsible for paying for that.
                    All workers in Singapore know that.</span></p>
              <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">My guess is that the ICA were threatening
                    them with imprisonment and
                    caning -– these being the penalties for illegal overstaying -– and
                    pressuring him to accept an injustice.</span></p>
              <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">* * * * *</span></p>
              <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"> <br> This story started with an abusive employer, but what got me interested
                    was the role played by the government departments. From this, you can see
                    that they were not at all interested in helping workers. Mediation became
                    story-telling in the hope of discouraging the workers from pressing their
                    claims. No mention is made of the company being prosecuted for violating
                    our Employment Act.</span></p>
              <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The police held people for overstaying without a shred of evidence that
                    they were overstayers.</span></p>
              <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The ICA held people in an armlock, getting them to fund their own
                    flight home, with or without being paid their wages.</span></p>
              <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">They all just want to get rid of the problem with
                    no regard for justice, law or rights. The source of the problem is the
                    employer, but by action or inaction, our government is abetting all these
                    abuses, ranging from cheating people of their wages, to robbery of their
                    handphones, to kidnap.</span></p>
              <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">It's not just bad officers. It is the
                    system. There are many things wrong
                    with the foreign worker work permit system, as illustrated by this case,
                    which I will point out in a follow-up article.</span></p>
              <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">But meanwhile, I hope you feel as angry as I do.
