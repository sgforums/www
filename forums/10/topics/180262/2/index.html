What we have been doing is to provide hot drinks and biscuits to the pupils. And what we have been educating the children about is the importance of a balanced meal."<br><br></div></blockquote>I thought schools are allocated funds yearly provided by MOE. These funds beside to offset the school buildings/miscellanous fees, can also be use by the school management to implement program on what is best for their students.<br><br>I understand that there are already other help scheme in place by some schools before this. Hence, my question is. Are the funds not enough to implement such breakfast program till MOE have to step in or is such a gesture by MOE providing for the needy students independent and out of goodwill.<br><br>p/s: If my memory serve me correctly, that time my school did ask for our opinion whether we wanted to opt for breakfast in school. Tho' that was nice, but the funny thing was that students have to be in school super early for breakfast which turn me off.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>
