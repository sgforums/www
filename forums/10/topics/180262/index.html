A whole range of international studies now show that it's very important for kids to have something in their stomachs at the start of the day. Helps them pay attention, concentrate, helps them do well."<br><br>Speaking at the awards ceremony for the Taman Jurong school children's assistance scheme, Mr Tharman said schools had provided feedback that they wanted to do more for their needy students.<br><br>Most already have help schemes in place.<br><br>Chew Chong Theng, Principal, Lakeside Primary School, said: "We've been starting our breakfast scheme since 2004. What we have been doing is to provide hot drinks and biscuits to the pupils. And what we have been educating the children about is the importance of a balanced meal."<br><br></div>

Are we really that well off or are we just putting a false front???<br>Day in Day out.. I see expenses being spent on redundant projects... Renaming of Marina Bay, Coastal guard residence ..etc etc...<br><br>And the DARN ARMY takes up so much $$ and bunk of the $$ goes to weapons or things people can hardly see or question about.... and of cos...bulk of it goes to paying useless people in the top management...<br><br>What about education??? NSFs enlisting into army with debts from education from POLYTECHNICS!!! Charging interests for non-payment during ARMY!! And the money paid to polytechnic is actually from Parent's CPF!!! their OWN HARD EARNED MONEY!! and people from Poly gets charged for using their parent's money and the charges dun even go back to the parents!!!????<br><br>The Transport system another joke... not user friendly... no ramps... no seats for parents with babies... no space for prams. yet prices keep going up. . .<br>The comparison they always make of Sg transport to other countries is not justified.!!<br>In terms of currency exchange rate, the transport in other countries like europe may seem much higher compared to Sg... but They are earning wages in their currencies relative to the rates...<br><br>Where is the world class living that they promised? HIGH COST LIVING does not equals to HIGH standard of LIVING!!!!...<br><br>In terms of IT Sg is still lagging way way behind other countries even...</div>
