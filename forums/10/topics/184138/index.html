Both had lost in GE before, and were subsequently nominated to other GRC and entered into the government. Mr Mah and Mr Heng had performed well indeed and everyone of us can see their achievements.<br><br>Hence, PM and SM should considered sending Mr Eric Low and Mr Situ to GRC so that singaporean have chance to gain from their performance.<br><br>On the other hands, PM and SM may considered seriously to send 2 ministers to contest with Mr Low TK and Chiam ST since they are no doing anything great for singaporean.<br><br>Let us have the chance to see Mr Eric and Mr Situ's contribution and treasure their talent. Hence, seriously send them to GRC so that singaporean got more chance to have their performance.<br></div>

Who's to say that by nudging the campaign towards a certain direction and capitalizing on several weaknesses, you cannot pull off a coup?<br><br>Take AMK for example. The promised new air-conditioned bus terminus has been taking ages to complete. The road system in the area around AMK central is consistently full of road works and LTA / URA seem to be digging forever in random spots, making a mess of the HDB areas and to top it all, the Ruling party's GRC members (besides LHL) hardly emerge from their tortoise shell to conduct walkabouts.<br><br>Is this a one-man GRC team? Have we mistaken GRC teams with ministers for MINISTER-only GRC teams?<br><br>With the right campaign and displaying of facts, there is every chance such <strong>GRC 'fortresses' </strong>can be turned into <strong>'fair game' </strong>for potential challengers. Even Low Thia Khiang mentioned that the WP may contest AMK to 'give PM LHL a strong mandate'.<br><br>That should be the right approach to derail an arrogant ruling party.</div>
