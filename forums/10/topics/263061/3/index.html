Their parents speak Hokkian, Baba Malay, wear kebaya, cook very very nice peranakan food, and lots of emphasis on tightly knitted family bond. Today, how many of the young peranankans do that anymore? The problem is the same with the traditional Chinese families, hokkian, hainanese...all the same. The cantonese tend to hold firmer to their tradition, most of the younger generation still speak cantonese.<br><br>Some how none of my Malay friends even talk about emmigrating, may be they prefer Singapore and Malaysia where islam is much more respected. I don't really know. During the colonial days, many Chinese, Indian migrated to UK, australia, never saw any Malay migrate. May be the Malays are more contented with whatever they have, more comfortable with tropical environment...is that generic.</div>
