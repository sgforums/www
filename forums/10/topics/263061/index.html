With the 'Overseas Chinese' kicked out of Vietnam and other 'Overseas Chinese' in the respective South East Asia societies in the region having to either assimilate or leave, the Chinese-dominant Singapore Government has created a 'Sino environment' on Singapore to attract ethnic-Chinese from abroad to settle in his island-home, while Eurasians like him are made to feel like outcasts.<br><br>He 'witnesses' the transformation of his island into a Sino-society - from place-names, ensuring that ethnic-Chinese hold key-posts in government, playing up the use of Mandarin-Chinese, the switching of dialect-names to Hanyu-Pinyin, to even the attempt to rewrite Singapore's Malay history to intimate that the island has always had a 'Chinese-connection', and the ignoring of Singapore's Malay history and connection.</blockquote>This applies for any minority.Since I'm half-Chinese,I do not face this much difficulty,but I see a submergence of the other cultures and minoroties beneath a tide of Sinicisation.<br><br>Its visible in the people,in the culture,in the fabric.This is not the multiracial Singapore I was taught existed.It's eventually going to become a homogenous monster,if Singapore continues to follow this PAP directive.<br><br></div>

Then he went and asked everybody in line "You wat...badminton ar? And he got only "YES" from everyone but one because when it came to my turn I replied "PING PONG" <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> He then asked for my passport and saw a Japanese one....Scratched his head and said "macam macam lah" (all sorts of people) <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I have to say what Saudakar has posted in his last post is quite true. As a majority, not many Singaporean Chinese really understand the difficulties non Chinese Singaporeans face in everyday Singaporean life. These talk of multi-racial tolerance, living together in harmony etc etc, it is mostly said and advertised by the majority.<br><br>Cos they don't really understand the situation that non-Chinese Singaporeans are in. That's why sometimes you get situations where the Chinese Singaporeans will automatically trail off to speaking in Mandarin / Dialect in a group discussion/conversation, knowing fully well there are non-Chinese individuals in the group.<br><br>In my experience, I have encountered many instances of this inability to understand. During my poly days, I used to meet up with an old secondary school friend, a Chinese gal, and we would walk to the polytechnic together. And while walking, vehicles used to whiz by us, with people shouting out, and whistling and wolf whistling. Of course, naturally, all by Chinese men. I guess they must have thought we were one of those "mixed couples".<br><br>During my NS days, it was even more interesting. Me and some close buddies, all non-Chinese of course, used to march to the cookhouse together as a small squad. And many a times, we were either pulled over by some staff sergeant complaining about us not having any Chinese in the group or hanging out together and isolating ourselves from the Chinese. Our company sergeant major once mentioned, that "it is very obvious when we march together."<br><br>I wonder why the same was not said when a group of all-Chinese march together....<br><br>Oh yeah by the way, I'm an Indian, who took Mandarin during my school days as my second language/mother tongue.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

Once we have different cultures, it's human tendency to mix with those whom we feel at home with.<br><br>A Chinese would feel out of place at a Indian wedding and vice versa. Malays cannot attend Chinese weddings due to it's non-halal food preparation.<br><br>Do not be too offended if all start speaking Chinese when they obviously know you don't understand. What do you expect them to do? Speak English just for one's sake? Then it breaks their chemistry. </div></blockquote>To tell you the truth, I don't care about whether a person is malay , indian or chinese. Wasn't because PAP instill that in me. Probably because my dad had friends who were indian, malay and chinese, so I was brought up seeing them as people than as separate races.<br><br>I enjoy mixing with everyone. Learn a culture.  I learnt a few tamil words ( my indian friend used to knock her head on the wall and told me I canned her language)  from old poly classmates , go to my malay classmate's house ( her granny would make alot of sambal balachan for me because I loved it).<br><br>In Australia , I mix with the caucasians and I can't give a damn if they are a majority, even within them there are croatians, greeks , italians and anglos.  I have friends who are indigenous australians , Australian born chinese, cambodian, vietnamese , mixed as well as my Malaysian and Singaporean friends.<br><br></div>
