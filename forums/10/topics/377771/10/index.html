              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span>Andrew Loh / Deborah Choo</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><img class="alignleft" style="margin: 13px; float: left; border: black 3px solid;" src="http://i140.photobucket.com/albums/r19/theonlinecitizen/Pictures%20Posted%20on%20TOC/redtape.jpg" alt="" width="220" height="300"><span>Mr Wong Tai Phong <span> </span>was a secret society member in his younger days. <span> </span>“I was one of the Bugis Street terrors”, he tells us in his home. I can see why. He is burly, and speaks in a rather brusque manner. As a gang member, he involved himself in gang fights, rioting, selling illegal goods on the black market and worked in gambling dens. His activities landed him in jail once and he was put on probation for three years. He was only about 18.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span>Having had enough of life in the gangs, he packed up his bags and became a seaman. “It’s an easy life,” he says in English. “I was a marine engineer.” He would be at sea for a few months at a time and found that it suited him. It paid him anything between $350 to $1,200, depending on the length of his voyages. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span>Mr Wong, who is 64, is finding life a little tougher now. <span> </span>He retired in 1996, and is living alone in a two-room flat in Aljunied Crescent. Since 2001, he spends a few hours each day collecting used clothings to sell to make ends meet.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span>“I only go out after midnight to collect clothes,” he explains in a softer tone. <span> </span>It brings him a measley $2 or $3 a week, he says. This is because Mr Wong has various ailments and cannot afford to exert himself more. <span> </span>He broke his arm some time ago when his kneecap gave way and he fell, he suffers from a corn infection, has diabetes and consults his doctor for his irregular heartbeats. In November last year, as he was getting up from his chair to fetch a drink, he toppled over and broke his right leg. He was also hospitalized in the Intensive Care Unit in 2007 for five days because of a stomach ulcer. “They had to give me six packets of blood,” he told TOC. “I thought I was gone case already”.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span>He seeks medical treatment from </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span>the polyclinic and Tan Tock Seng Hospital for his ailments. He used to visit the National University Hospital for his irregular heartbeat condition but has, since 2007, cancelled all his appointments. When asked why, he said it is because he can’t pay for the treatments. “Each visit cost $28.50 and I have to go four times a month,” he explains. “How to pay?”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span>To get by, he moonlights as a security guard once in a while – on the sly. He has a friend who works as one and Mr Wong would stand-in for him whenever his friend couldn’t be on duty. But such instances are not many. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span>Mr Wong is the eldest among seven siblings. One of his younger sisters died from diabetes in 2006. “It was the fourth day of Chinese New Year,” he says. He has lived alone for 20 years in his Aljunied Crescent flat. His younger brother used to help him with his medical, utilities and phone bill but has since stopped.<span>  </span>When TOC visited him, a nephew of his had just brought him a packet of rice. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span><strong>Bureaucratic wall</strong></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span>Running out of options and barely able to survive on his own, he turned to the Community Development Council (CDC) for help. The front desk officer there asked for records of his income, bank account and bank book. When he told them he had no income and no money, they took down his particulars and told him they would get back to him. Hearing nothing from the CDC for weeks, he paid them a second visit shortly before Chinese New Year this year. Again, they asked him for the same records. Upset with the situation, he left the office.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span>He chanced upon an event in his constituency and approached the Mayor, Mr Matthias Yao Chi, who is also the MP for MacPherson, the area where Mr Wong lives. He was referred to a clerk who registered his particulars. He has yet to hear from them.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span>He visits the polyclinic and receives his medication once every three months. His ECG test, which he used to undergo at NUH, is now free at the polyclinic. His Medisave deposits have all been used up and<span>  </span>he has exhausted his CPF savings paying for his house.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span>I mentioned that the HDB now has a new scheme called the Lease Buy-back Scheme (LBS) which is targeted at the elderly who are not able to fend for themselves financially. “<span><span>LBS is a special scheme that provides an additional option for low-income elderly Singaporeans in 3-room and smaller flats to cash out part of the money locked up in their HDB flats, for their old age,” the <a href="http://www.hdb.gov.sg/fi10/fi10207p.nsf/WPDis/Monetisation%20OptionsLease%20Buyback%20Scheme?OpenDocument"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">HDB website</span></span></a> says. It allows elderly home owners to sell the remaining lease on their flats to the HDB. The owner of the flat can continue living in his flat while receiving “a lifelong stream of payout to supplement their retirement income.”</span></span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span>Mr Wong replies that he is aware of such a scheme and that he would gladly sell his lease to the HDB for some monthly income – if only he could. But he too faces some problems here.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span>The two-room flat he lives in was jointly-owned by Mr Wong and his uncle. However, his uncle had returned to China when he discovered he had liver cancer. His uncle died in China. The problem Mr Wong faces presently is that the Chinese authorities did not issue a death certificate for his uncle.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span>Because ownership of the house remains in both their names, Mr Wong is unable to sell his lease back to the HDB. He will need to obtain his uncle’s death certificate in order to do so. He is thus caught in a catch-22 – the Chinese authorities did not issue a death cert, and without it he cannot encash his flat. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span>This also presents problems for him in other areas.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span><strong>Inflexible officers</strong></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span>Mr Wong’s brother had been helping him pay for the service and conservancy charges previously. His brother over-paid on one occasion and the town council sent Mr Wong a cheque for $40 for the excess. However, because the house was jointly-owned by Mr Wong and his uncle, the cheque was in both their names. <span> </span>It means he is not able to cash it. He informed the town council that his uncle has since passed away. They too asked for his uncle’s death certificate. Mr Wong told them that he does not have it as the authorities in China did not issue a death cert for his uncle’s death. In that case, they told him, they could not issue him a cheque in just his name and asked him to get the cert from the Chinese authorities. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span>“How do you expect me to do that?” he asked them. “Fly to China and get the cert and fly back here? If I can do that, I wouldn’t need the CDC’s help already,” he said. The cheque for $40 remains un-cashed. It may be a small amount, but to Mr Wong, it represents several daily meals. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span>“Did you apply for public assistance?” I asked. “What for?” came Mr Wong’s reply. “The more you bother them, the more trouble you get into.” He related how the grassroots people now shun him, treating him with apparent disdain.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span>Mr Wong now spends his time at home. “My place is here,” he tells me as he points to his sofa set. He spends most of his time reading, a far cry from his street gang adventures of his younger days. He reads anything he can get his hands on, from detective stories by James Patterson to educational booklets he gets from garang gunis.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span>“Sorry but I have an appointment,” he says apologetically. “Where are you going?” I ask. “I have to go see the doctor.” “You should eat the food first,” I urge, referring to the hamburger and drinks Deborah and I had bought him. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span>“It is ok. I will eat later,” he says as he picks up his bag of documents. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span>At the void deck, he bids us goodbye, as he carefully maneuvers himself down a slippery slope dampened by the rain. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span>—- </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span>Opinion:</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span>In a <a href="http://www.asiaone.com/News/AsiaOne%2BNews/Singapore/Story/A1Story20080228-51948.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Straits Times report on 28 Feb 2008</span></span></a>, on the Lease Buyback Scheme, it said:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="padding-left: 30px;"><span><em>First announced by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong during last year’s National Day Rally, the scheme aims to help low-income, elderly households monetise their HDB flats to meet their retirement needs.</em></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="padding-left: 30px;"><span><em>The LBS scheme will benefit such households that live in smaller flats need help, as they are unable to take advantage of existing schemes to monetise their HDB flats, such as downgrading to a smaller flat, buying a Studio Apartment or subletting a room.</em><em></em></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="padding-left: 30px;"><span><em>Under the LBS, HDB will purchase the tail end of the flat lease from the elderly household.</em></span><span><em></em></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="padding-left: 30px;"><span><em>On top of the housing equity unlocked, HDB will provide an additional $10,000 subsidy.</em></span><span><em></em></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="padding-left: 30px;"><span><em>Out of the total amount, $5,000 will be given to the household as an upfront lump sum, while the remainder will be used to purchase a CPF LIFE Plan to provide the owner with a monthly stream of income for life.</em><em></em></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="padding-left: 30px;"><span><em>The household continues to stay in their flat, which will be left with a 30-year lease.</em></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span>Perhaps what is needed in the scheme is also a flexible policy and some common sense – as in the case of Mr Wong. Sticking resolutely to the letter of the policy means the elderly, who are in various and different situations, may not benefit from the scheme.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span>HDB – and for that matter, the CDC as well – should inform its officers to be more sensible and allow them some flexibility in decision-making.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span><strong><em>TOC would like to thank the reader who alerted us to Mr Wong’s plight.</em></strong></span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal"><img class="alignleft" style="margin: 13px; float: left; border: black 3px solid;" src="http://i140.photobucket.com/albums/r19/theonlinecitizen/Pictures%20Posted%20on%20TOC/Healthcare/dwd220.jpg" alt="" width="220" height="160"><strong><span>“W<span><span>e need to overcome taboos about death and communicate better — both among ourselves as well as between doctors and their patients</span>,” said Health Minister Khaw Boon Wan last month. (<span style="font-weight: normal;">See <a href="http://sg.news.yahoo.com/cna/20081015/tap-729-spore-expand-palliative-care-sys-231650b.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">here</span></span></a></span><a href="http://sg.news.yahoo.com/cna/20081015/tap-729-spore-expand-palliative-care-sys-231650b.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">)</span></span></a>.</span></span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span><span>I agree with the minister.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span><span>More often than not, we would rather not talk about death, or the possibility of our dying. It is indeed still quite a taboo subject. It is a cultural thing, some say. Couple this with our religious beliefs and it gets very personal, emotional and spiritual as well.<br></span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span><span>Yet, looking at what the minister has said over the last few years on the issue, I do believe that he is not just looking, simply, to letting Singaporeans choose to die – whether it is through the Advance Medical Directive or legalised mercy-killing, to put it another way. Rather, Mr Khaw has obviously adopted more of a holistic approach than just a simplistic one of whether one should take one’s own life or allow another to do so on one’s behalf. </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span><span>The main point I believe he is trying to get across, perhaps not very well so far, is one of dying with dignity.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span><span>In this, there can be little argument or disagreement with the principle. It is in the definition of the word “dignity” itself, however, which is the bone of contention. Some say that taking one’s own life is not dignified no matter how it is achieved. That the act of suicide or assisted-suicide, whether legal or illegal, through the AMD or legalised euthanasia, is just plain wrong.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span><span>“We will go down a slippery slope”, is a phrase used.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span><span>While I do agree that there are many – many – issues involved, I am in agreement with Mr Khaw that we should be allowed to “die with dignity”. And that, in my opinion, should be one of the main points of this debate. In this respect, I am glad that the minister is looking into palliative care and palliative medicine and making these more easily-available. A pilot scheme to bring such care to nursing homes will be implemented next year.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span><span>More needs to be done, of course. Besides getting doctors themselves to understand the AMD better, the bigger challenge, I feel, is getting the average Singaporean (especially the less-educated and literate) to know what the issues are. </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span><span>The one thing which we should not fail to address is the notion, already in some people’s minds, that assisted-suicide is directed at the “less-able” or that it is the less-literate and less-educated who will be targeted for “elimination”.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span><span>My hope is that the minister will not rush through any changes in legislation but allow as much time as possible for discussion, debate and feedback to take place.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span><span>Every life is precious. When the time arrives, and each of us will face this, we will have to decide (if we are able to) how we will die. Personally, to have the choice to decide how I would die is a gift as not everyone gets to have this choice.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span><span>Thus, if there were legislation in place which would allow me to do this, to make this choice, and it gives me dignity in my death, I welcome it.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span><span>But first, lets address the many issues involved for the concerns are real and important.</span></span></p>

              <p><strong>Pritam Singh / Founder of </strong><a href="http://opinionasia.com/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #810081;"><strong>OpinionAsia.com</strong></span></span></a><em><strong> </strong></em></p>
              <p><em><strong><em>The overall perception is of a poorly articulated, poorly communicated and poorly understood FT policy that incites questions of loyalty, nationhood and national unity for native Singaporeans.</em> </strong></em></p>
              <p><img class="alignleft" style="margin: 13px; float: left; border: black 3px solid;" src="http://i140.photobucket.com/albums/r19/theonlinecitizen/sg.png" alt="" width="300" height="220">The Straits Times’ report on 14 Aug 2009, “MM: Foreign talent is vital” of MM Lee’s Tanjong Pagar GRC National Day 2009 dinner speech did not reveal anything substantively new about the Singapore government’s foreign talent (FT) policy.</p>
              <p>Its flavour was slightly different from usual reportage on the issue insofar as it buttressed the importance of foreigners in supplementing the country’s low birth rates – an argument which could potentially resonate more deeply than one which portends the decline of the Singapore economy in the absence of foreign talent.</p>
              <p>The lacunae in the latter argument has been variously exposed over the last few years with a broad, data-backed consensus indicating that Singapore’s low-income workers did not see a rise in their median income in line with the rest of the economy. While various government ministers have over the years accrued this to the impact of globalisation, for a significant minority of Singaporeans, the perception continues to dominate that the FT policy does not benefit them, but instead squeezes prospective job opportunities and drives their real wages down.</p>
              <p>More recently, the government argued along the lines of worker retraining and e2i, but preceding these reactionary initiatives has been a lack of information, debate and communication concerning the ramifications of what the FT policy entails for Singapore society and our low-wage earners; evidently, the most vulnerable group of Singaporeans affected by the FT policy.</p>
              <p>Compounding the less than enthusiastic public response to the FT policy is the term ‘foreign-talent’ itself, which has hitherto been loosely and sometimes interchangeably employed with the word ‘foreigner’ in the public domain and media. The word ‘talent’ also obfuscates, especially when MM Lee was quoted as saying, “We accept only immigrants who increase the average level of competence of Singaporeans” only for ST to report immediately thereafter, “(t)hey [immigrants] must have skills and at least, secondary, preferably tertiary education.” Clearly, in the context of the MM’s words and the subsequent reportage of the ST, ‘talent’ is a very loosely defined word, not necessarily synonymous with conventional definitions found in a dictionary.</p>
              <p><img class="alignright" style="margin: 13px; float: right; border: black 3px solid;" src="http://i140.photobucket.com/albums/r19/theonlinecitizen/Pictures%20Posted%20on%20TOC/Population/MMB.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="220">But more importantly, the ST article’s focus on MM Lee’s remarks covering population regeneration as a goal of the FT policy, involve two separate prongs to it. One element deals with population regeneration, a goal which many Singaporeans can appreciate, until the question is posed – what is the optimum population level for Singapore?</p>
              <p>If the goal is to maintain the population of Singapore, which for a long time stood between 3-4 million, it is rather likely that the public vitriol against the FT policy would be more subdued. It would take either a brave man or a soothsayer to conclude economic decline would as a result ensue, if Singapore’s population stabilizes around the circa 4 million figure. Even the example used by MM Lee in his speech on Japan’s falling population and the future impact on its economy was instructive – it was based on a dire economic situation in Japan contingent on a declining population, not a stable one.</p>
              <p>It is precisely this second element of the FT policy, the very prospects of economic decline and the necessary pre-emptive measures to meet this alleged challenge, which compounds the discomfort among Singaporeans. For some, the FT policy underwrites a population surge on a very small island to a population figure Singaporeans have little clarity about. As a result, the FT policy has given birth to the very real heartland reality of a more crowded Singapore, where infrastructure, on the surface of things, does not seem to have grown in parallel with the volume of foreigners allowed entry from 1998, when the effects of the FT policy began to be felt in earnest, particularly from 2002-2007. This sense of overcrowding has subsided somewhat, thanks to the latest recession. But even today, the unusually large number of linen and work wear hung out to dry on bamboo poles from some, ostensibly let-out HDB flats and even condominiums, offer leading conclusions to the number of occupants in each apartment. The perception of stresses on public facilities like the police force and separately, on the transport system by way of jam-packed trains and buses, have been but some of the more tangible and direct repercussions of the FT policy on heartlanders so far.</p>
              <p><img class="alignleft" style="margin: 13px; float: left; border: black 3px solid;" src="http://i140.photobucket.com/albums/r19/theonlinecitizen/Pictures%20Posted%20on%20TOC/serangoon%20gardens/DSC06995.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="220">On a tangential, albeit worrisome note, class distinctions have taken root under the cloud of the FT policy, since the vast majority of policymakers and ruling politicians are likely to reside in districts and estates that do not deal with the day-to-day realities of the FT policy faced by heartlanders. Even relatively well-off Singaporeans are likely to host at best, mixed feelings about foreigners living in their immediate environment with the Serangoon Gardens episode of 2008 a primer of this deep emotive.</p>
              <p>Arguments concerning class distinctions are brought into sharpest focus when some laymen opine that the real beneficiaries of a larger population in future are big business and corporate interests, with the bulk of Singaporeans having to readjust to smaller homes, congested roads, crowded public spaces, unintelligible service staff, and the worry of a real drop in living standards as a function of the preceding compromises.</p>
              <p>The effect of these optical and cognitive realities creates a genuine feeling of unease and insecurity among a potentially large number of Singaporeans, who viscerally cannot make sense of a ST headline which reads, “MM: Foreign talent is vital”, especially when it is they who are perceived to be paying for it. Compounded by occasional government feelers suggesting the relocation of old-folk homes to Johor Bahru, the overall perception is of a poorly articulated, poorly communicated and poorly understood FT policy that incites questions of loyalty, nationhood and national unity for native Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>While MM Lee sounded as if he was at pains to reinforce the importance of foreign talent to Singapore, the debate and concerns of many Singaporeans have arguably moved beyond those covered by the ST report’s ambit. In fact, MM Lee hinted at this himself, although these were not expatiated upon in the aforementioned ST article. After reporting that the total fertility rate (TFR) was 1.91, 1.19 and 1.14 for the Malay, Indian and Chinese communities respectively, MM Lee was quoted as saying, “If we continue this way without the new immigrants and PRs and their children doing national service, the composition of the Singapore Armed Forces [SAF] will change. So please remember that.”</p>
              <p><img class="alignright" style="margin: 13px; float: right; border: black 3px solid;" src="http://i140.photobucket.com/albums/r19/theonlinecitizen/Pictures%20Posted%20on%20TOC/Population/tfr.gif" alt="" width="300" height="220">Without prejudicing other interpretations to the TFR figures juxtaposed against MM Lee’s remark, one interpretation conveys the prospect of the Chinese community’s demographic percentage dropping below the current 76%, as the community hosts the lowest TFR rate of all the racial groups in Singapore. The curious lack of rigorous public debate in the mainstream media over this prospect and the FT policy in general is noteworthy. Would the essential character of Singapore society be so fundamentally altered if the envisaged percentage for the Chinese population existed within a band say from 65-80%? <strong><em></em></strong></p>
              <p>Superficially, the preceding point comes into distinct relief especially when Singapore’s population is anticipated to rise to between to 5.5 to 7.5 million, or whichever figure is eventually pursued by the Ministry of National Development. One would have thought that any change in the character of Singapore society ought to hold greater relevance for Singapore’s racial minorities, rather than for the majority community.</p>
              <p>Separately, what the ST report did not mention was that even for the Malay community, TFR rates have been steadily dropping from 2.48 in 1998 to 2.1 in 2003. Clearly, the problem of population replacement is affecting all Singaporeans, regardless of race, since all three major racial communities are below the magic 2.1-population replacement figure.</p>
              <p><img class="alignleft" style="margin: 13px; float: left; border: black 3px solid;" src="http://i140.photobucket.com/albums/r19/theonlinecitizen/Pictures%20Posted%20on%20TOC/Security%20Forces/php0PXO5EPM.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="220">An arguably more significant take-away from MM Lee’s remark was the reference to the SAF and the projected prospects of more Malays in uniform, because of the TFR figures in question. Speaking on a similar subject in 1999, MM Lee (then SM) opined “(i)f, for instance, you put in a Malay officer who’s very religious and who has family ties in Malaysia in charge of a machine gun unit, that’s a very tricky business. We’ve got to know his background… I’m saying these things because they are real….” While those remarks proved controversial then, on balance, at least they contained caveats in that they identified potential religious overzealousness and family ties as determining factors for military deployment, not that of being Malay in itself.</p>
              <p>But MM Lee’s more oblique and open-ended references this time need to be unpacked, something the ST article did not do, for whatever reason. Critically, the crutch-like reliance on race-based arguments throws a wet blanket on the progress of Singapore’s nation-building efforts since independence. Should such thinking continue, the FT policy will raise even more uncomfortable questions akin to those which question the loyalty of a Malay (or any other race for that matter) soldier whose family has stayed in Singapore for generations, against that of a newly-arrived Chinese or Indian who may claim to be as loyal as a Pavlovian dog but who cannot sing the <em>Majulah Singapore</em> without looking or sounding like an oddball. That the insinuation of a Malay soldier’s loyalty may even be raised, is testimony to the deep, intense and unsettling emotions engendered by the FT policy. This is not to say that the racial factor is irrelevant and that MM Lee’s latest remarks were totally disingenuous. But it is hard to imagine Singaporeans enthusiastically playing their part integrating new foreigners when elements of the political leadership appear to intuitively speak the language of race as the argument of last resort.</p>
              <p><img class="alignright" style="margin: 13px; float: right; border: black 3px solid;" src="http://i140.photobucket.com/albums/r19/theonlinecitizen/Pictures%20Posted%20on%20TOC/Population/nc.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="220">More broadly, framing the FT policy solely through the lenses of race also threatens to roll back progress made by Singaporeans since independence in the national unity and political maturity arenas in particular. Feedback in the ST Forum over the last few months recommending the induction of English tests and other qualifying criteria for new immigrants are indicative of a public attempt at determining a minimum set of hoops future citizens ought to pass through before succeeding in their application for citizenship.</p>
              <p>Taken further, one wonders what sort of values new citizens would bring to our shores should they come from corruption-ridden, authoritarian countries and host nary a spark of talent and with no experience of living in a multi-racial society. Singaporeans ought to welcome these immigrants if they display a desire to cast away or replace the narrow and self-serving values picked up in their former countries of domicile and commit for example, to absorb the values defined by our pledge, crafted by our first foreign minister, S. Rajaratnam.</p>
              <p>It is for this very reason that some qualifying criteria – beyond educational standards – for citizenship based on Singapore’s shared values and a reasonable competency in English, amongst others, stand out as more nuanced and realistic requirements for citizenship, rather than an overly rigid adherence to the racial balance.</p>
              <p><img class="alignleft" style="margin: 13px; float: left; border: black 3px solid;" src="http://i140.photobucket.com/albums/r19/theonlinecitizen/Pictures%20Posted%20on%20TOC/Elderly/1808644862_055b1ae732_o.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="220">In a final message to Singaporeans, MM Lee rightfully observed that the speed at which foreigners integrated into Singapore society depended on how Singaporeans treated them. But the question remains of how far the government is willing to go to alleviate the very real concerns, repeatedly made in a variety of fora, in addressing the immediate and future social costs of the FT policy on native Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>According to the same ST article, MM Lee asserted that the government safeguards the interest of native Singaporeans, highlighting education, housing and hospitalization policies favouring citizens over PRs. If this defence is employed to justify the government’s FT policy, it must be a highly specious one, as Singaporeans do not benefit from education, housing and hospitalization policies because of the FT policy. Therein lies the principle reason accounting for the largely insipid reaction of many Singaporeans to the FT policy – a lack of acknowledgement by the government of the very real sacrifices Singaporeans of all strata, but especially the nation’s lower and middle-classes, have to make and will likely need to make in future, to accommodate more foreigners into Singapore.</p>
              <p>The very deep and all-encompassing changes to Singapore society as a result of the FT policy call for not only fresh approaches in dealing with concerns of the Singapore public but the slaughter of some sacred cows as a result. Significantly, a relationship based on transparency and openness with the public vis-à-vis the FT policy must represent the central pillar of the government’s efforts rather than one that sees the intermittent release of government data providing selective details on the FT policy, with no interest in revealing the guidelines that has and will shape that very policy. In the circumstances, it is unsurprising that Singaporeans continue to exhibit indifference to the FT policy. In this regard, it may serve the longer-term interests of government to appoint an ombudsman for the National Population Secretariat and National Integration Council, the two central bureaucratic organizations that oversee the government’s FT policy.</p>
              <p><img class="alignright" style="margin: 13px; float: right; border: black 3px solid;" src="http://i140.photobucket.com/albums/r19/theonlinecitizen/Pictures%20Posted%20on%20TOC/Employment/st1vh6.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="220">In addition, it would be in the government’s interest to develop a more inclusive policy formulation mechanism specific to the FT policy and even invite and encourage opposition parties, civil society groups and NGOs to form committees to provide regular feedback. Not only would this attract the focus and attention of Singaporeans to a policy that is likely to have a profound impact on their lives and those of their fellow citizens, it would expose Singaporeans to the realities of policy formulation in a larger way and promote the building of cooperative bonds between the executive and the populace at large. Both the government and Singaporeans at large stand to gain from such inclusiveness with the larger objective of citizen participation in the national integration project more likely to succeed.</p>
              <p>In the final analysis, the fact that the government, through MM Lee no less, sees a need to repeat the ‘foreign talent is vital’ mantra every so often, is indicative of the mixed results of the FT policy so far. While it must be regarded as a success from the perspective of sheer numbers, the overt public skepticism against the policy for a variety of reasons alluded to earlier and other reasons this writer is uninformed about, seem to resonate more than any desire to help new immigrants integrate into Singapore society. If left unchecked, such a reality could force new immigrants to constitute one half of a bifurcated Singapore polity in future, a state of affairs that bodes ill not just for Singapore society and national unity, but also for the same SAF MM Lee frets about.</p>

              <h1>Prices of HDB flats – press censorship?</h1>

              <p><em>Mr See Leong Kit had sent a letter to the Today newspaper on the pricing of HDB flats (16 Sept). The HDB responded to his letter on 25th Sept. (See links to both letters below). The Today newspaper, however, has declined to publish the follow-up letter by Mr See in response to the HDB’s letter.</em></p>
              <p><strong>See Leong Kit</strong></p>
              <p><img class="alignleft" style="margin: 13px; float: left; border: black 3px solid;" src="http://i140.photobucket.com/albums/r19/theonlinecitizen/Pictures%20Posted%20on%20TOC/Housing/tp.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="220">HDB’s response <strong>“Why we peg to market rates: HDB”</strong> ( TODAY Sept 25) to my earlier letter has necessitated my right of reply.</p>
              <p>Instead of merely accusing me of being “misleading and illogical”, HDB is expected to be transparent in disclosing fully the actual breakeven cost of new flats in all its projects.  After all, these are public housing developed with public funds.</p>
              <p>These exasperating remarks of a  couple wanting to start a family sums up the genuine frustrations of young Singaporeans at the sky-high prices of public housing:  “How to live in cheaper Woodlands when work is in Shenton Way and parents are in Tanah Merah?  The Government must come up with more practical solutions!”</p>
              <p>Let me now summarise these two main issues:</p>
              <p><strong>Root cause behind high prices of new and resale flats.</strong></p>
              <p>In the 1970s, at HDB Marine Parade Estate, prices of 3-room, 4-room and 5-room new flats were  $17,000,  $20,000 and $35,000 respectively.</p>
              <p>In 1990,  5-room new flats cost around $70,000. Such prices then reflected a “cost-based” pricing approach.</p>
              <p>But, following the 1994 property bull run, HDB switched to a ”market-based” pricing approach.  It confirmed that ”the prices of new HDB flats are based on the market prices of resale HDB flats, and not their costs of construction”.</p>
              <p>In 2000, the total breakeven cost (comprising construction cost, land cost and other related costs) of a 5-room new flat was an estimated $120,000.</p>
              <p>However, under the market-based pricing approach, HDB will first look at the prevailing market price of, say $260,000 of a 5-room resale flat.   It will then pick a slightly lower figure of, say $200,000 as the selling price of the new flat – regardless of its actual breakeven cost of $120,000.</p>
              <p>HDB will then proclaim the new flat buyer is getting a so-called ”<em>market </em>subsidy” of $60,000, the difference between resale flat market price and new flat selling price.  There is really no  “<em>cash</em> subsidy” given to the buyer, and HDB is actually making a profit of $80,000 for each flat sold.</p>
              <p>The losses reported in HDB financial statements could well come from ”transfer pricing” accounting between HDB, Singapore Land Authority and Ministry of Finance.</p>
              <p>HDB’s “market-based” pricing approach is the <strong>root cause</strong> of prices of new flats and resale flats chasing each other in a never-ending upward trend.</p>
              <p>A plate of chicken rice cost $3 in HDB coffeeshops and $20 at hotel coffeehouses.  It is both illogical and ridiculous for HDB to proclaim that every person eating chicken rice in HDB coffeeshops is getting a  “market subsidy” of $17 per plate!</p>
              <p><strong>Are HDB new and resale flats really affordable?</strong></p>
              <p>It is misleading for HDB to merely state that “first-time flat buyers use 17 to 29 per cent of household income for their loans, below the international benchmark of 30 per cent” without disclosing the assumptions used.</p>
              <p>HDB has since confirmed to me that a 30-year loan period was assumed.</p>
              <p>Of course, if you stretch a home loan to as long as 30 years, even private property will become ”instantly affordable”.</p>
              <p>For a couple with a combined $8,000 monthly income, a HDB loan of $500,000 at 2.6 per cent interest and a monthly loan instalment of $2,000 may appear affordable.  But at the end of the 30 year loan period,  they would have coughed up some <strong>$800,000</strong> in total capital and interest repayments.</p>
              <p>A sensible home loan period would be around 15 to 20 years.</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: black; font-size: 10pt;">Dr. Esaki stated that most of the great discoveries and innovations by the Nobel Laureates occurred at the average age of 32 – the period of peak creativity of most scientists. “It is, therefore, very important to stimulate, encourage and cultivate many young people to get interested in science and engineering at their young age and to provide them the optimal R&amp;D environment.”</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: black; font-size: 10pt;">Here is something noteworthy for Singapore’s Central Provident Fund contributors and CPF administrators: the pension funds, says Dr Sing Lin, in many large corporations, e.g. Boeing, Lockheed Martin, AT&amp;T, Lucent Technologies, have been “over funded” because many “late retirees” who work into their old age and retire after age 65 tend to die within two years of retirement. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: black; font-size: 10pt;">“Many of these late retirees do not live long enough to collect their fair share of pension money such that they leave a lot of extra unused money in the pension funds.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: black; font-size: 10pt;">See Table 1 and the associated chart (provided by Dr. Ephrem Siao Chung Cheng, another academic) from an actuarial study of life span vs. age at retirement, based on the number of pension cheques sent to retirees of Boeing Aerospace. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>

              <p style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://i140.photobucket.com/albums/r19/theonlinecitizen/Pictures%20Posted%20on%20TOC/Retire%20Later%20Die%20Earlier/retirement_agechart.gif" border="5" alt="" width="489" height="302"></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: 0.5in;"><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 10pt;">An important conclusion: for every year worked beyond 55, one loses on average 2 years of life span. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: 0.5in;"><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 10pt;">In the study, Dr Sing Lin says:</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 10pt;">“In the Boeing experience employees who retired at age 65 received pension cheques for only 18 months, on average, prior to death. Similarly, Lockheed’s employees who retired at 65 received pension cheques and survived for only 17 months on average. Another researcher, Dr. David T. Chai, indicated that the </span></strong><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 10pt;">Bell</span></strong><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 10pt;"> Labs experience was similar. And so was Ford Motor’s.” </span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 10pt;">Why they died so soon?</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 10pt;">Dr Sing Lin reports that the hard working late retirees probably put too much stress on their aging body and mind and are so stressed out that they develop various serious health problems that force them to retire – and die within two years after that.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 10pt;">But people who take early retirement at age 55 tend to live long and well into their 80s and beyond. “These earlier retirees probably are either wealthier or more able to plan and manage well their life, health and career such that they can afford to retire early and comfortably.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 10pt;">“These early retirees are not really idling after retirement.<span> </span>They still continue doing some work – but on a part-time basis at a more leisure pace so that they do not get too stressed out. Furthermore, they have the luxury to pick and chose the types of part-time work of real interest to them so that they can enjoy and love doing that ‘fun’ work at a more leisurely pace.” </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 10pt;">Conclusion</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 10pt;">- The most precious, creative and innovative period in your life is the 10-year period around the age of 32. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 10pt;">- With the work place becoming a pressure-cooker and high-speed battleground for highly creative and dynamic young people, you and I should plan our career path and finances so that we can retire comfortably at age 55 or earlier.<span> </span>This way we can enjoy a long, happy and leisurely retirement life, and do some fun part-time work of value to society. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 10pt;">- If you “have” to keep on working very hard until 65 or older, then you probably will die within 18 months of retirement. If you remain in the pressure cooker for 10 more years beyond 55, you give up at least 20 years of your life span. </span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 10pt;">1. </span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 10pt;">A friend disputed the findings of Dr Sing Lin’s article by citing the case of her ex-boss, a wealthy banker, who worked well beyond his 60s and lived up to 98.<span> </span>Actually he never retired and worked almost to his last breath. You don’t want that, do you?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 10pt;">2. The earlier study I had read in the late 1960s that seemed to contradict Dr Sing Lin’s report had shown that many people, particularly ex-bosses, retired and died shortly after, some within a year.<span> </span>One reason postulated was that some died of a broken heart: they had nobody to boss around or shout at anymore, or had lost their significance or reason for living.<span> </span>That study did not state what age they retired (probably after 60). The trouble with many people, Singaporeans are fast becoming noted for it, is that they instead of working for a living, they work to live, or live to work…and die without work!</span></p>

              <p><strong>From our Correspondent</strong></p>
              <p>For the second time within a week, NTUC Secretary-General Lim Swee Say had spoken up on the plight of low-income workers in Singapore. Mr Lim had earlier urged companies to restore pay cuts imposed during the economic downturn.</p>
              <p>At a seminar held a few days ago, Mr Lim recounted the sorry state of an office cleaner who quit last month after she had enough of pay cuts, longer working hours and loss of benefits in four of the five times a new cleaning firm took over the contract.</p>
              <p>The 58-year-old’s monthly pay did increase over her more than 10 years of service – but only from $370 to $400. Her experience is common among cleaners, security guards and other low-wage workers.</p>
              <p>There is no minimum wage in Singapore and employers are given a free rein to determine the wages and working hours of their workers.</p>
              <p>The median wages of low-income workers have not increased by much over the last decade due to the relentless influx of cheap foreign labor who help depress their wages.</p>
              <p>Singapore workers at forever at the losing end because there are no independent trade unions to represent their interests.</p>
              <p>Under the unique “tripartite” system promulgated by the ruling party, the rights of ordinary workers are subsumed under NTUC which is always headed by a PAP minister.</p>
              <p>Under the country’s repressive laws which make even a solo protest anywhere on the island (except Hong Lim Park) illegal, Singapore workers are not even allowed to voice out their unhappiness publicly let alone exert pressure on their companies to increase their wages.</p>
              <p>Mr Lim Swee Say can afford to “sway” here and there without ever achieving a better deal for the workers as the big businesses and companies are not obliged to restore the pay cuts.</p>
              <p>Besides the low pay, the CPF contribution rates of employers are reduced from 14.5 to 10.5 per cent when workers reach 50 years of age. They are also entitled to reduce their pay after they exceed 60 years old.</p>
              <p>MM Lee Kuan Yew said during a ministerial forum lately that he is not too concerned with Singapore’s widening income gap so long the government continues to create jobs for Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>It is not known if MM Lee is aware of the fact that a monthly salary of $850 is hardly sufficient to support oneself in Singapore let alone $400.</p>
              <p>With the continued rise in the cost of living, Singapore workers are struggling to keep themselves afloat. As such, some of them turned to loansharks for financial assistance leading to the proliferation of illegal money-lenders.</p>
              <p>Not only are unskilled workers poorly paid, young graduates are also finding it hard to start a family of their own with their meager wages.</p>
              <p>The starting pay of an engineer is only between $2,400 and $2,800 a month. Arts graduates have to contend with administrative jobs which sometimes pay less than $2,000. Young lawyers and doctors seldom take home more than $5,000 a month in their first few years of practice.</p>
              <p>Though Singapore has one of the lowest income tax in the world, the lack of adequate social welfare benefits coupled with the failure of CPF as a retirement fund discourage Singapore couples from having more children.</p>
              <p>The declining birth rate necessitates the government to boost Singapore’s population via mass immigration which contributes to the sky-rocketing prices of HDB flats thereby exacerbating the problem.</p>
              <p>Perhaps it is time for Singaporeans to have a rethink of the ruling party’s “growth-at-all” cost policy instead of a “citizen-first” policy to ensure the rights of Singapore citizens.</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal"><em><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">The following is a letter to the ST Forum by See Leong Kit which was rejected for publication:</span></em></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><img class="alignleft" style="margin: 13px; float: left; border: black 3px solid;" src="http://i140.photobucket.com/albums/r19/theonlinecitizen/Pictures%20Posted%20on%20TOC/Housing/pinnacle250.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="187"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">I refer to your report, <strong><span style="font-family: Arial;">“<a href="http://www.asiaone.com/Business/My+Money/Property/Story/A1Story20081119-101855.html"><span style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Market-based pricing fairest for new HDB flats: Mah</span></span></span></a>” </span></strong>(ST Nov 19). </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">The HDB has yet to rebut forum writer Tan Kim Chuan’s contention that it is “either over-pricing its flats or is profiteering from the property boom”.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;"><span style="color: black;">Our private property market is now in a downturn. But the HDB resale flat market is still firm due to Permanent Resident buyers pushing up prices.</span><span style="color: #c00000;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">Thus, HDB’s pegging its new flat prices to similar resale flat market prices had resulted <span style="color: black;">in prices of new flats and resale flats chasing each other in an upward spiral that is detrimental to buyers of both new and resale flats.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">The Total Breakeven Cost of a new flat comprise Construction Cost(CC), Land Cost(LC) and Other Related Cost(ORC).</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">Its <a rel="nofollow" href="http://sg.mc761.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=Pinnacle@Duxton"><span style="color: #003399;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Pinnacle@Duxton</span></span></a> project has 1,848 units cramped into 50-storey blocks occupying a small plot of land.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">From available public tender information, the actual CC component is $150,000 per unit. The onus is now on HDB to publicly disclose the remaining LC and ORC components.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">A quick estimate of LC plus ORC is around $80,000, leading to an estimated Total Breakeven Cost of $230,000 per flat.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">When launched in 2004, average Selling Price was $370,000 (actual range: $288,000 to $450,000), which translates to an average profit to HDB of $140,000 per unit sold.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">428 unsold units were recently relaunched at average Selling Price of $550,000 (actual range: $450,000 to $645,000), which is $180,000 higher than initial launch prices. This arose from the HDB market-based pricing approach as market prices of similar resale flats in the vicinity were between $593,000 to $670,000.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">Applicants of HDB new flats are mostly young Singaporeans wanting to get married, move into their own homes and produce babies, which will alleviate our declining birth rate. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; font-size: 10pt;">Why then is the HDB not doing the right thing as a not-for-profit low-cost public housing developer by passing on to such citizens the economy-of-scale cost savings in its huge developments through pricing new flats on a cost-based break-even basis?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">A recent Ministry of Trade and Industry Forum reply on the huge electricity price hike had stated that “the Government’s approach is to price goods and services at their full cost”. <span style="color: black;">Why then the double standards in the HDB statement that “the prices of new HDB flats are based on the market prices of resale HDB flats, and not their costs of construction”?</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">For the average Singaporean, his HDB flat is the single most expensive purchase item in his lifetime. Thus, it is important for HDB to clear the air once-and-for-all by providing transparent replies to the above two simple questions, and disclosing detailed cost figures for its Pinnacle project.</span></p>

(See below)</p>
              <p>I also refer to media reports (“<a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporebusinessnews/view/449326/1/.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">SGX mainboard-listed BBR secures S$104.2m HDB contract</span></span></a>”, ChannelNewsAsia, Aug 17) Channelnewsasiaarticlehdbcontract_com.mht that Singapore Exchange’s mainboard-listed BBR Holdings has secured a S$104.2-million contract from the Housing &amp; Development Board (HDB) to build seven blocks of flats in Yishun Neighbourhood 4.</p>
              <p>The work comprises 864 homes, a Child Care Centre, a roof garden, communal amenities and site works, as well as contingency works.</p>
              <p>Since there will be 864 HDB flats, the average cost per flat, inclusive of communal amenities, site works and contingency works, is about $120,602 ($104.2 million divided by 864 flats).</p>
              <p>With the latest HDB new 4-room flats at Punggol (Punggol Residences BTO) selling at an average price of $293,000 (price range of $264,000 to $322,000 divided by 2), does it mean that the HDB stands to make a profit of about $172,398 per flat, or a profit margin of about 143 per cent?</p>
              <p>According to the report “Application for Additional Housing Grant doubled since HDB  enhanced scheme (CNA, Sep 1), it said:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><em>“Since the additional housing grant scheme was introduced in 2006, the government has disbursed $251 million to more than 16,000 households”.</em></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>So, does it mean that the estimated profits from just one BTO project (about $149 million) as discussed above, may be enough to cover about 59 per cent of the total disbursement from 2006 to now, for the additional housing grant scheme?</p>

              <h1>Making sense of HDB rejections</h1>

              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;"><a href="http://leongszehian.com/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Leong Sze Hian</span></span></a></span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong></strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><img class="alignleft" style="margin: 13px; float: left; border: black 3px solid;" src="http://i140.photobucket.com/albums/r19/theonlinecitizen/Pictures%20Posted%20on%20TOC/TOC%20Team/US150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150"></span></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">I refer to HDB’s latest BTO, Straits Vista@Marsiling launched on 10 June. (”HDB’s challenge: low-cost housing, condo-like flats” (ST, Jun 11)) (”Marsiling goes BTO :Straits Vista project launched as HDB wins UN award” (Today, Jun 11)).</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">Why is it that the problem of all applicants rejecting BTO HDB flats offered, resulting in leftover flats, is only a recent phenomena over the last year or so ?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">Is it because not only has HDB 4-room flat prices increased by an average of 40 to more than 100 per cent from about two years ago, and the price range has also widened ?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">For example, the price range for BTOs at Straits@Marsiling is from $116,000 to $164,000 (3-room) and $184,000 to $257,000 (4-room), and $ 234,000 to $ 305,000 (4-room) for Punggol Sapphire.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">This is a difference of $ 73,000 or 40 per cent between the lowest and highest price at Straits@Marsiling (4-room), and 41 per cent between the lowest and highest price for a 3-room flat.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">If an applicant can only afford a cheaper-range flat, but is offered one with a much higher price, is it fair to penalise the applicant after two rejections ?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">If one is offered only second floor flats, which nobody wants because of the noise level, the difficulty to sell in future, and generally much slower appreciation in value relative to higher floors, is it fair to penalise applicants too ?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">As a flat may probably be the biggest asset that one may own in one’s lifetime, wouldn’t it be natural for applicants to decline accepting flats beyond their affordability, or almost certain relative depreciation in market price and marketability in the future ?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">Instead of offering more land sites for private developers to tender and build HDB flats, I would like to suggest that the HDB continue to focus on its historic role to build affordable housing to meet Singaporeans’ needs, as the price of private-development HDB flats tend to be higher than HDB- developed flats.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">Is it any wonder that as at end March, 250 of the 714 flats available at City View @ Boon Keng under HDB’s Design, Build and Sell Scheme (DBSS), were still unsold, with prices up to $ 727,000 for a 5-room flat?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><img class="alignright" style="margin: 13px; float: right; border: black 3px solid;" src="http://i140.photobucket.com/albums/r19/theonlinecitizen/Pictures%20Posted%20on%20TOC/Housing/toapayoh.jpg" alt="" width="230" height="170"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">In view of the current shortage in the supply of HDB flats to meet rising demand, private developers may tender at higher prices, which may translate into even higher priced flats.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">I can understand the rationale to allow private property owners to own a HDB flat as well, when there used to be as many as 16,000 surplus HDB flats that could not be sold.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">Now that surplus flats available have dwindled, and demand is arguably at record highs, with the problem of many home buyers being unable to meet the “cash above valuation”, I would like to suggest that the policy of owning both a HDB flat and private property be reviewed.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">In this connection, I understand that in other countries, citizens are generally not allowed to own both public and private housing. </span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal"><img class="alignleft" style="margin: 13px; float: left; border: black 3px solid;" src="http://i140.photobucket.com/albums/r19/theonlinecitizen/Pictures%20Posted%20on%20TOC/Housing/amk3.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="220"><span>One out of every seven HDB flat owners have problems paying their mortgage loans. This seems to be what the statistics have revealed. <span>Last year, the HDB visited 60,000 flats which had problems paying their loans and gave financial counseling to 35,000 households.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span>This is <span>14 per cent of the estimated 420,000 HDB loan mortgages – or one in seven.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span><span>As of October last year, 33,000 HDB loans were in arrears over three months. This is about eight per cent of the total number who took HDB loans.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span><span>In both instances, the numbers are a cause for concern, especially at this time when Singaporeans are facing job insecurity and spiraling costs.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span>The number of flats which have been repossessed or surrendered to the HDB because of non-payment of mortgage loans is another worry.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span><span>According to a Berita Harian report, 1,350 HDB flats were surrendered to the HDB in the last four years.<br></span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span><span>In February 2007, Parliament heard that 360 flat owners had voluntarily surrendered their flats from 2002 to 2006.</span></span></p>
              <p><span>This means that the average number of flats surrendered per annum has increased from 72 (2002 to 2006) to 318 (2005 to March 2009).</span></p>
              <p><span>This is an increase of about <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>342 per cent</strong></span></em>, or about one flat a day now.</span></p>
              <p><span>This figure, however, does not include HDB flats on bank loans which are reportedly being foreclosed at about 60 a month. It also does not include those in arrears who have sold their flats in the open market.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span>HDB profiteering from flat owners’ misery?</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span><span>When the HDB sends a notice of Compulsory Acquisition to flat owners, they are only given one month to vacate their flats, and only 90 per cent of the flat’s valuation is used to offset the loan arrears.</span></span></p>
              <p><span>It is hard enough to lose one’s home. Why does the HDB still want to make a profit of 10 per cent of the valuation?</span></p>
              <p><span>Why not give them a bit more time to find alternative accommodation?</span></p>
              <p><span>As a public housing authority with the mission to provide affordable housing for Singaporeans, is the HDB not in a sense, in breach of its fiduciary duty, in this arbitrary practice of eating up 10 per cent of the valuation?</span></p>
              <p><span>Are there any public housing authorities in the world that takes an additional 10 per cent profit on foreclosure?</span></p>
              <p><span>Parliamentarians may like to raise this issue with a view to refunding the “eaten up” valuation to all past foreclosed flat owners.</span></p>
              <p><span>What is the view of bodies like the Law Society of Singapore in this regard?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span><span>In view of the above statistics, and with unemployment at a 5-year high of 4.8 per cent, 95,600 unemployed locals, and the record GDP contraction of 19.7 per cent in the first quarter, I would like to suggest that the HDB temporarily freeze asking those in arrears to surrender their flats.</span></span></p>
              <p><span>After all, as long as HDB flats appreciate at an average annual rate of more than the HDB concessionary loan rate of 2.6 per cent, every HDB flat may eventually be worth more than the outstanding loan and arrears, particularly when the current 13-year property bear market turns around.</span><br>—–</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 10pt;">I REFER to the article, ‘HDB launches sixth build-to-order project in Fernvale.’ (ST, Sept 21).</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 10pt;">The HDB’s pricing policy recently has increased the prices of new flats, and may lead to Singaporeans having to incur higher mortgage liabilities.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 10pt;">This may result in lesser CPF funds for retirement, more mortgages in arrears, defaults, etc.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 10pt;">For example, the prices of four-room flats in the HDB’s latest build-to-order project (Coral Spring) in Fernvale are between $188,000 and $252,000, compared to Fernvale Vista Phase 2 ($145,000 to $200,000) in May, and <span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 10pt;">Fernvale Court</span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 10pt;"> ($138,000 to $177,000) two years ago.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 10pt;">Based on the average prices of the three projects, which are in the same location, the increase is about <strong><em>40 per cent</em></strong> from two years ago, and <strong><em>28 per cent </em></strong>from just four months ago.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 10pt;">On an annual basis, the increase is <strong><em>18 per cent</em></strong> per annum over the last two years, and <strong><em>75 per cent</em></strong> per annum over just the last four months.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 10pt;">Why does the HDB have to increase its prices by so much so rapidly?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 10pt;">Below is the reply from HDB to Sze Hian’s letter (as published in the Straits Times, Oct 2, 2007):</span></strong></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 10pt;"></span></span></strong><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 10pt;">Fernvale flat prices: Comparisons inapt</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 10pt;">I REFER to the letter, ‘HDB flat prices in Fernvale rose too rapidly’ (ST, Sept 26), by Mr Leong Sze Hian. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 10pt;">Mr Leong compared the selling prices of HDB’s latest build-to-order project, Coral Spring, with the selling prices of Fernvale Vista and </span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 10pt;">Fernvale Court</span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 10pt;"> launched in May this year and September 2005 respectively. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 10pt;">The comparisons are inappropriate, as they did not take into account prevailing market values and the different design features of the flats. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 10pt;">Coral Spring is a Premium project while the two earlier projects cited by Mr Leong are Standard projects. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 10pt;">HDB’s Premium projects come with enhanced architectural designs, landscaping and better-quality finishes, compared to Standard projects. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 10pt;">In addition, the flats at Coral Spring also come with many improved design features, such as bay windows and planters, as well as a larger floor area. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 10pt;">The Fernvale area has also undergone significant development since the launch of </span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 10pt;">Fernvale Court</span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 10pt;"> two years ago. With the LRT system in operation, improved road network, as well as more amenities and established facilities, the flats in the Fernvale area have appreciated in market value. This can be seen from recent resale transactions in the area, where four-room flats were transacted at between $275,000 and $287,000. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 10pt;">We would like to reiterate that HDB has continued to price its flats such that they are affordable to the vast majority of flat buyers. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 10pt;">New HDB flats are priced below their equivalent market values so that buyers can enjoy a substantial subsidy from the Government. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 10pt;">In addition, the Government has recently revised the Additional CPF Housing Grant Scheme for first-timers to allow households earning up to $4,000 in income to qualify, with the highest-tier grant increased from $20,000 to $30,000. </span></p>

              <p>According to the article, “<a href="http://www.todayonline.com/Business/EDC090725-0000094/HDB-prices-hit-record-high"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">HDB prices hit record high</span></span></a>” (Today, Jul 24), prices of HDB flats rose 1.4 per cent in the second quarter. Sales of HDB resale flats also surged 58 per cent, reflecting improved market sentiment, the report said.</p>
              <p>Resale transactions were 10,184 in the second quarter, compared to 6,446 in the first quarter.</p>
              <p>In contrast, “private home prices fell 4.7 per cent in the second quarter. It’s the 4th straight quarter decline but it is less than the 14.1 per cent sharp drop in the first quarter. (”<a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/Breaking+News/Singapore/Story/STIStory_407442.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Home prices dip 4.7%”</span></span></a>, ST, Jul 24).</p>
              <p>Historically, HDB and private property prices have more or less moved in close tandem with each other, most of the time. So, why are they moving in opposite direction now?</p>
              <p>Well, the answer may lie in an altogether seemingly unrelated statistic – the number of graduates.</p>
              <p>This year’s graduating cohort from the Nanyang Technological University – 8,000 students – is the largest ever (”<a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/444285/1/.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">8,000 students graduate from NTU this year</span></span></a>“, CNA, Jul 23).</p>
              <p>I estimate the total number of under-graduate and post-graduate students graduating in a year from all the universities and polytechnics to be about 40,000.</p>
              <p>The admissions policy of the tertiary institutions reserves 20 per cent of first year admissions for foreigners. The balance 80 per cent goes to Singaporeans and PRs. I estimate that about 15 per cent go to PRs. So, the percentage for Singaporeans is probably about 65 per cent.</p>
              <p>For graduate students, I estimate about 50 per cent are foreigners, and 15 per cent PRs. So, Singaporean graduate students make up probably about 35 per cent.</p>
              <p>Some Singaporeans will leave the universities in their second year or later years for foreign universities, whereas probably very few foreigners leave for the basic reason that most foreigners are here on a tuition grant scheme, whereby they have to be bonded to work in Singapore for three years after graduation, and thus are financially less in a position to transfer to foreign universities compared to Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>What this means in totality is that about 40 per cent of the entire student population are probably non-Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>Since a foreign student on a tuition grant scheme is bonded to work for three years after graduation, he or she may soon become a PR, and eventually a citizen.</p>
              <p>For housing, perhaps it makes more economic sense for him or her to buy a HDB flat instead of renting.</p>
              <p>For example, renting just a room is about $450 to $650 per month, compared to a monthly repayment of only $400 for every $100,000 of a HDB concessionary loan for 30 years at 2.6 per cent.</p>
              <p>So, PRs may try to marry a Singaporean quickly so that they can qualify for a new HDB flat with a HDB loan, or convert their bank loan to a HDB loan when they become citizens.</p>
              <p>Of course, PRs with PR siblings, as well as married PRs, can also buy HDB resale flats with bank loans.</p>
              <p>What all these mean may be that the demand for HDB flats and thus prices may go up.</p>
              <p>Since HDB uses its “market subsidy” pricing policy to peg new HDB flat prices to resale prices, although nobody knows exactly what pricing formula is used, new HDB flat prices may consequently rise as well.</p>
              <p>When the decision was made many years ago to have the “20% foreign students” policy, was any comprehensive study done on its implications on the demand and affordability of HDB flats?</p>
              <p>Now let’s examine the question of demand and supply of HDB flats. After all, prices are a reflection of market supply and demand.</p>
              <p>The HDB over-built about 16,000 5-room and larger flats which I understand took more than a decade to sell off.</p>
              <p>Although the HDB is increasing its building of smaller flats, the fact that every BTO(Build-to-order) launch has been heavily over-subscribed is an indication that demand exceeds supply.</p>
              <p>There is also the trend of more people down-grading to smaller flats to monetise their hone equity, which may also have fueled the demand for smaller flats.</p>
              <p>With the record increase in the number of new PRs to 79,000 and new citizens to 21,000 last year, is it any wonder that HDB prices keep going up!</p>
              <p>All these speculation could have been put to rest by making the relevant statistics available.</p>
              <p>Is it not rather surprising that over the years, no MP has been able to ask a question in Parliament in such a way as to extract from the Government a simple answer as to the breakdown of the entire university population into foreigners, PRs and Singaporeans?</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>“I had no choice”, says Mr Muthu (not his real name), “I had to rent out my 3-room flat because I lost my job and could not pay even the minimum monthly payments to the bank”. He has got to pay the bank about $750 every month for the mortgage he still owes.</p>
              <p>“I only have a room-rental agreement with my tenants”, says Mr Muthu. He says that if he makes a contractual agreement to rent out the whole flat, then he would have to pay higher 10% property tax (as compared to <a href="http://www.iras.gov.sg/irasHome/page04.aspx?id=2378"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">4% for owner-occupied residences</span></span></a>) which will eat into his real income from renting his flat.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Mr Muthu resorted to renting out his flat when the restaurant he was working at as an Assistant Manager decided to retrench him in May last year. He was unable to find another job which paid him close to his last earned salary while his wife who works as a sales assistant brings home less than a thousand dollars a month. The couple has to support three school-going children too.</p>
              <p>Their circumstances led to Mr Muthu and his family to become part of <a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/1016866/1/.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">the statistics of people sub-letting their HDB flats.</span></span></a> Fortunately, his brother took them in. They now squeeze into a common room in his brother’s 5-room flat.</p>
              <p>However, Mr Muthu laments, “In my brother’s house, my wife, children and I are second-class”. He pays his brother $600 as compensation, but claims that his brother often chides him and his children for running up the utilities costs. Tension among family members is quite evident. According to him, his children and his brother’s children (who used to be very close) do not even play together now.</p>
              <p>“Now, we cannot even watch television together as a family. When there is no school and when we are not working, we go out and only come back home when it is time to sleep”, says Mr Muthu. What’s worse is, his brother has been threatening recently to put Mr Muthu’s family out due to a misunderstanding. “If that happens, I don’t know what I will do or where I will go”, he said.</p>
              <p>Mr Muthu now works part-time as a security guard. He looks forward to the day he can go back to his own flat with his family. “If I can find a better paying job, I will go back. But I am almost 50 and the hospitality industry is looking for younger workers to be in management. I even tried the Integrated Resort but they were only recruiting housekeepers, waiters and cleaners. Looks like I have to live like this for some time”, grieves Mr Muthu.</p>

              <p><strong>Ian Choo</strong></p>
              <p><img class="alignleft" style="margin: 13px; float: left; border: black 3px solid;" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/220/456053720_bb479ff002.jpg" alt="" width="403" height="299"></p>
              <p>AS AN exchange student many years ago, I was surprised to find that many of my Danish counterparts already owned the houses that they lived in – despite being single and all of 21 years young.</p>
              <p>I later found out that the reason was really one due simply to taxation and welfare spending.</p>
              <p>Danish parents were more inclined to let their kids have their “inheritance” upfront due to large savings in inheritance taxes (which are shockingly high in Scandinavia to the Singaporean mind) in the form of owning the house they would live in, by selling it to them at a low price.</p>
              <p>The welfare system of unemployment insurance, student grants and free tertiary education would make banks more willing to lend the principal to mere university students.</p>
              <p>In addition, the Danish property market is highly regulated to prevent large fluctuations in prices year to year from hurting the small guy. So there is quite a lot of perceived predictability in the system, which greases the wheels and gives more people the right to play.</p>
              <p>It led me to wonder – what are the implications of being single, 21, in university and owning your own home? After all, the two largest ticket items one will ever purchase in this lifetime would be a property, and a mortgage to finance it. It seems like the whole view on the world changes when one takes on that kind of responsibility that early.</p>
              <p>The incentive to finish school to service the mortgage, securing gainful employment, being “vested” with the country you live in, as well as the freedom and  responsibility that comes with living on your own. What freedom! – and what responsibility this early – I thought to myself.</p>
              <p>Some of the luckiest of my friends had their houses given to them by their parents, and it was only until I did the back of the envelope calculations that I realised what a headstart in life they had.</p>
              <p>Technically, if you already owned your own place – you could do anything you wanted with your life. What a breath of choices! If they rented out their homes and moved abroad (which many do), they could get a world education living just off the rental income alone. Or start a business. Or get a little more educated for just a while longer, even if just to prolong adolescence.</p>
              <p>Yet, many of them I knew actually got savvier with money when the burdens of ownership were thrust upon them early. It was like getting the best capitalist education one could hope for – ironically enabled by the very mechanics of a region renowned for the beating heart of socialism. It was not envy that I felt. Just the refreshing scent of a different view on the world.</p>
              <p>It also caused me to reflect on Singapore life as a young person. Many trying to get on the first rung of the property ladder are looking at 25-30 year mortgages with their starting salaries, and you’re only in the game when talking about two incomes. Singles cannot own their own pads until 35, at least not in the public market.</p>
              <p>In the private market, ¬the grapes hang pretty high up on this vine for young foxes to reach whilst at the bottom of the economic food chain. Can’t say it’s not tempting for some to walk away declaring that the grapes are sour? More poetically, this little island has also over the years been credited with adding “Would you like to take a flat together?” to the collective romantic vocabulary of the world as the subtlest of marriage proposals.</p>
              <p>Perhaps we’ve figured out why an increasing number of singles don’t feel ready to take the plunge. Does it really boil down to (not so common) dollars and (common) sense? After all, pairing a volatile job market with a steady stream of mortgage payments isn’t exactly the best idea by any measure.</p>
              <p><img class="alignright" style="margin: 13px; float: right; border: black 3px solid;" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2674/3915382955_9f9a7e41c7.jpg" alt="" width="319" height="317"></p>
              <p>Now here’s the real pickle. Let property prices drift higher and price many singles (and couples) out of the market of their Singapore dream. Let them fall and watch carnage ensue on those who are already property owners who have much of their personal assets, as well as retirement funds in CPF, tied up in Singapore property.</p>
              <p>Even odder still, high property prices alone (Singapore has one of the highest per square foot prices in the world) alone creates the perverse incentive for those in-between generations or with an agnostic view of the market to cash out whilst their equity is still intact, and ask what better (and cheaper) life the remainder of their assets can afford elsewhere.</p>
              <p>How many Singaporeans have not at least entertained the possibility? Taking stock – can we realistically expect the spectacular property Bull Run we’ve seen independence to continue, ensuring all ownership and mortgage decisions turn to gold over time?</p>
              <p>It does seems that now that prices drift up in the stratosphere– movements up, down or sideways are all going to be tough for somebody, somewhere. Not particularly surprising, considering that having a roof over our heads is the biggest but most basic of all economic decisions in one lifetime.</p>
              <p>As a friend of mine once commented rather matter-of-factly, “let’s get used to the fact that this generation will be one that can only afford to rent. The only way we’re going to own anything is if we inherit it or win the lottery.”</p>
              <p>Schooled from young to live the creed of self-reliance, pragmatism and meritocracy, my Singaporean sensibilities instinctively protest suggestion that my fate really sits squarely with the past successes of mom and dad. But its same sensibilities that remind me to brace for a world that she might actually be right.</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span>Leong Sze Hian</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><img class="alignleft" style="margin: 13px; float: left; border: black 3px solid;" src="http://i140.photobucket.com/albums/r19/theonlinecitizen/Pictures%20Posted%20on%20TOC/TOC%20Team/US150.jpg" alt="" width="160" height="160"><span>I refer to the article, “<a href="http://luxuryasiahome.wordpress.com/2009/02/07/measures-to-help-new-hdb-flat-buyers-existing-owners/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Measures to help new HDB flat buyers, existing owners</span></span></a>” (Business Times, Feb 6).</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span>I would like to applaud the HDB for its pro-active measures to help Singaporeans during the recession, such as freezing the alignment of rents to income for one year. This second round of increase was originally scheduled for November 2008.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span>However, some of the policy changes could not have come at a worse time, and may cause financial stress for some Singaporeans.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span>For example, the new additional eligibility criteria for rental flats, to permanently exclude those who have purchased two new HDB flats before, or ex-private property owners, may be too harsh as some of those in these categories may have lost their homes because of financial difficulties.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span>Just because one has owned two new HDB flats or private property previously does not mean that one will never be in financial difficulties in the future.<br></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span>This is perhaps underscored by the statistic that 6,500 households are in arrears for more than two years, and HDB concessionary loans in arrears over three months has grown from 25,000 in 2003 to 33,000 as of October last year. If HDB bank loans in arrears are included, what is the total number of HDB mortgages in arrears?<span>  </span>Does this indicate that the pricing of HDB flats may be an affordability issue for many Singaporeans.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span>Another example is to exclude rentals to parents whose children have private property or HDB flats with spare room to take-in their parents. This may cause some hardship to parents who do not stay with their children, unless the powers of the Parents Maintenance Tribunal are extended to force children to take-in their parents. We should not forget that parents too, can lose their homes due to foreclosure or inability to afford existing open market rentals due to retrenchment or business failure.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span>The second HDB concessionary loan entitlement for those who have to downgrade, should be given as a matter of course, instead of on a case-by-case basis as has been the HDB’s practice.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span>What is the rationale for granting a second HDB loan only to those who upgrade to a bigger HDB flat?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span>This policy may cause the number in arrears to continue to rise, as people may be compelled to buy larger flats.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span>How many of such case-by-case appeals for a second loan by down-graders were approved last year?<span>     </span>Instead of harping year after year that the rental queue and waiting period are getting longer because there are too many non-needy applicants, I would like to suggest that we consider another plausible explanation – that the prices of HDB flats may not be affordable for some Singaporeans.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span>One needs only to look at the household income data from the Department of Statistics’s Key Household Income Trends 2008 report, which says that the bottom 10 per cent of employed households, which I estimate to be about 100,000 households, have an average per capita household income of only $340 monthly. If we include unemployed households (73,100 residents were unemployed in December 2008) and retiree households who may be in financial difficulties, how many needy households are there in total?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span>Instead of policies to try to dampen demand for rental or smaller flats, like the new additional eligibility criteria or the second loan for upgraders only, the HDB should re-focus on its mission to provide affordable housing for Singaporeans, especially now that Singapore is in its worse recession.</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">Ash Tong / Guest Writer</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><img class="alignright" style="margin: 13px; float: right; border: black 3px solid;" src="http://i140.photobucket.com/albums/r19/theonlinecitizen/Pictures%20Posted%20on%20TOC/Housing/amk3.jpg" alt="" width="230" height="155"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">I have always taken great discomfort, when MSM and biased marketing talk always refer to the pricing of new flats as “Discount to the market” or “Cheaper than comparative condominiums in the area’.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">The Ang Mo Kio and Bishan projects are priced at above $400,000 for a new 4 room flat, applicant for these projects are subjected to the $8,000-income cap. A simple break down of the math.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">Gross Income: $8000</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">CPF: $1600</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">CPF into OA for housing needs:<span> </span>$1082.56</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">Nett Cash: $6400</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">4 room Natura Loft project in Bishan: 465k</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">Monthly installment based on 30 years 2.6% calculation: $1861.38</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">Hence each family would have to top up $778.82 into their CPF for their housing each month, which makes up to 12 per cent of their disposable income. If you change the calculations for a 20-year repayment, the percentage of their disposable income used to top their CPF moves into the 20 per cent range.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">Ideally, all applicants for these projects would have a perfect gross income of 8k, and the flats would be affordable. However, often couples with incomes below 8k, might be unsuitably stretched, by buying such flats.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><em><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">As a side note, it should be no surprise that this project was awarded to the highest tender.</span></em></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">CPF housing grant for family living within 2km are only eligible for DBSS projects, and additional housing grants are only eligible for families who earn below a $4,000 gross income. Given the number of DBSS projects that have been released in the past year, it defeats the purpose of encouraging families to stay at close proximity as it comes with a huge price because these projects cost 400k and upwards. I do not recall any Non-DBSS projects in mature estates released in the past year.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">The additional housing grants equates to lip service as no sane couple could afford a DBSS project with a 4k gross income. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">All other new flats are not eligible for any grants as they are sold, “at a great discount”. The argument would not hold, when we look deeper into the figures; <strong>e.g.</strong> a new Toa Payoh Central Horizon flat cost up to 550k for a new 5 room flat, using the PSM or PSF to compare with resale flats will show that these flats are not priced at discount at all.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">Now lets not be choosy as Singaporeans, HDB is trying their best to give us a home. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">So we turn to non-mature estates like Punggol. Yet again, we’re subjected to manipulated pricing.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">I refer to the latest BTO project, Punggol<span><strong><span style="color: #333333;"> Arcadia</span></strong></span> offered by HDB.</span></p>
              <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://i140.photobucket.com/albums/r19/theonlinecitizen/Pictures%20Posted%20on%20TOC/Housing/hdb1.png" alt="" width="450" height="150"></div>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">In a similar location just across the street, <a href="mailto:Coralinus/Treelodge@ponggol"><span style="color: #990000;">Coralinus/Treelodge@ponggol</span></a> BTO project, indicative prices taken from October Half yearly Sale</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">:</span></p>
              <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://i140.photobucket.com/albums/r19/theonlinecitizen/Pictures%20Posted%20on%20TOC/Housing/hdb2.png" alt="" width="450" height="100"></div>
              <div style="text-align: left;">
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">In another location with similar proximity to Ponggol MRT, released May2008:</span></p>
              </div>
              <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://i140.photobucket.com/albums/r19/theonlinecitizen/Pictures%20Posted%20on%20TOC/Housing/hdb3.png" alt="" width="450" height="150"></div>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">These 3 projects all hold the same proximity to Ponggol MRT station, and are all touted as premium projects. However we should question why the indicative price range has risen from between 7 per cent to 14 per cent? The internal floor area has all but gone up by less than 2 per cent comparatively. I have only drawn the comparison for 4 room flats, but similar directional trend can be noticed in 3 and 5 room offerings as well.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">According to news reports, commodities have gone down, demand for construction might slowdown hence might require government reversal in placing some infrastructure projects on hold; <span>so why<strong> </strong></span>the increase in prices for such flats?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">Minister for National Development, Mr Mah Bow Tan, once said something along these lines. “Instead of building in sync with population growth, which resulted in several excess of flats, we shall now build in sync with demand, hence the BTO model.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">Doesn’t that mean demand will always exceed supply; hence the price floors/equilibrium prices for new flats will be artificial?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">Can these directives by HDB be considered duress?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">Quoted from their <a href="http://www.hdb.gov.sg/fi10/fi10296p.nsf/0/6CA297DBA8F4CC6548257451001037F7?OpenDocument"><span style="color: #990000;">press release</span></a>:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;"><span style="color: #383838;">”<span>The above measures will encourage applicants to consider their options carefully before participating in a HDB sale exercise. They will also help to minimize non-selection of HDB flats by applicants who <strong>repeatedly participate in sales exercises and thus divert HDB’s time and resources from those with urgent housing needs</strong>.” </span></span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">This press release was in reference, to the change of rules for balloting of flats. However in the latest October half yearly sale, a 20-year old Bedok flat was also offered in the ballot. Half yearly sales do not allow applicants to choose the indicative area they prefer, nor do they allocate married child priority since applicants are unable to indicate the areas they prefer.<br>&lt;!--[endif]--&gt;</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">So one does wonder, if the applicant whose family nucleus is in the west, is invited to select a flat and this particular Bedok flat is the last choice available, does one fault him for non-selection?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">We are made to pay even for the basic automated electronic process of balloting, yet HDB’s stand seems to infer that if we need a house we should take what they offer. As mentioned, we do not pay a discount, and HDB does make a profit from selling the flats, so why should we be penalized for being selective when we buy our flats? </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">A home to an ordinary Singaporean like me should be a nest of warmth where I return to my family every night, yet it seems to have been turned into a monopolistic business model, with minimal sense of ownership given.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">I do also wonder what HDB’s urgent housing needs refer to, as all I see is an unnecessary spate of DBSS and overpriced projects.</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span><em>Update</em></span></span><em>: In view of the comments posted here by readers, please allow me to clarify a few issues which readers have brought up. Please see below.</em></strong></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;"><strong>Andrew Loh / Deputy Editor</strong></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">A couple with 4 children and an elderly mother appeals to the HDB for a concessionary loan to purchase a flat. The appeal process has lasted almost a year – with no success.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><img class="alignleft" style="margin: 13px; float: left; border: black 3px solid;" src="http://i140.photobucket.com/albums/r19/theonlinecitizen/Pictures%20Posted%20on%20TOC/Housing/tp230.jpg" alt="" width="220" height="160"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">What happens if you are unable to service your HDB mortgage loans and are forced to sell your flat? Will you be able to apply for a new HDB loan to purchase a new one? </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">More importantly, is means-testing being quietly implemented by the HDB?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">Mr and Mrs Yap (not their real names) are in such a situation. Having owed the HDB arrears of more than $25,000, including $4,000 in late payment charges, they were forced to sell their 4-room flat in Bukit Merah in September this year.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">The couple had hoped that they would be able to successfully apply for a HDB concessionary loan and purchase a new flat after they had settled the arrears.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">As it turned out, however, their loan application has been a frustrating affair and they do not understand why the HDB is refusing to grant them one which is sufficient enough for a new house.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">The Online Citizen met up with Mrs Yap over coffee.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">When the couple had their second child in 2002, Mrs Yap, 33 and who was working as an operations manager in a pub, quit her job in order to care for the infant.<span> </span>Her husband was then working in dispatch. Their 4-room flat in Bukit Merah then was home to six persons – including their two children and Mr Yap’s parents, who had moved in with them in 1999. (They later had two more children – in 2005 and 2008).</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">Their woes started in 2007, when they defaulted on the monthly mortgage loans. It eventually accumulated to $25,611 and they were forced to sell their flat in September this year (2008) in order to settle the arrears. But even before the completion of the sale, the couple had already started to apply to the HDB to grant them a loan to buy a resale 4-room flat. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">Application rejected</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">In December last year, HDB rejected the application, saying that Mr Yap’s salary of $1,200 was not enough to service the loan which they would need to purchase a resale flat. HDB advised them to “use the CPF refund and cash proceeds from the sale of your current 4-room flat to buy a smaller flat, without taking a loan.” </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">“I can’t buy a smaller flat,” Mrs Yap told TOC. “Where will my children sleep? What about my mother-in-law?” More importantly, the couple feels that since this would be their second HDB loan and hence the last one they would be granted, they want to purchase a 4-room flat to live in for the long term.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">Disappointed with HDB’s rejection, the couple approached their Member of Parliament, Mr Baey Yam Keng, who appealed to the HDB on their behalf.<span> </span>In his letter in May 2008, Mr Baey informed the HDB that Mr Yap’s income had recently increased to $1,450. He also noted that they are unable to obtain any loans from the banks as they had a record of owing some credit card debts. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">Appeal</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">In its reply on the 6<sup>th</sup> of June, HDB again rejected the application, citing the couple’s difficulty to service the loan based on Mr Yap’s income. “I need a flat so that my mother-in-law can live with us. She is being abused by her husband.<span> </span>Also, she is not allowed to rent a flat either,” Mrs Yap told us. The HDB said her mother will have to either find someone to jointly it with or to pick a name from HDB’s rental flat waiting list and live with that person, a prospect which Mrs Yap frowns upon. “If she lives with us, she can help me look after my children and I can go to work to supplement the family’s income,” says Mrs Yap. She feels that even if she worked part-time, she would be able to add another $500 to $600 to her husband’s $1,450 salary and thus be able to help service the HDB loan.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">In July, after Mr Baey made a second appeal on their behalf, the HDB finally relented and agreed to grant them a loan which is “100 per cent of the selling price or market, whichever is lower”, according to Mrs Yap. The HDB later offered them $67,000 to purchase a 4-room flat – provided the new flat was below $250,000. However, the loan amount<span> </span>was not enough for the couple to buy a 4-room flat in Teck Whye, which is one of the cheapest areas in </span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">Singapore</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">, Mrs Yap told TOC. She said they are asking for a loan of “about $90,000<span> </span>to $100,000” from the HDB. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">“Our proceeds from the sale of our previous 4-room flat is $126,000, which is put back into our CPF,” she told TOC.<span> </span>The cash portion from the sale was $57,200. “But we only get $49,604 after deducting the $5,000 of deposit &amp; appears to HDB &amp; TC,” she explained. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">HDB insisted that a loan of $67,000 would be enough for the new flat. But Mrs Yap disputes the figure. “Our CPF refund was $120,000 but $6,000 was credited into our special account,” she said. More was used to pay their S&amp;C charges to the town council and their housing agent. They would also need to do some simple works on their new home – such as painting, re-wiring and pay the “cash over valuation” on the resale flat purchase.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">“That means we can only buy a 3-room flat if we’re very lucky because the prices of flats keep increasing,” she said in her email reply to HDB. She checked the HDB website several times for the latest resale prices of 3-room flats in Teck Whye and they ranged from $201,000 to $230,000.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">Frustration</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">After more than 6 months of appealing to the HDB, she feels frustrated as during the period, prices of flats have escalated and has made it harder for them to purchase a new home. Prices of 4-room flats in Teck Whye have risen to as high as $240,000 and $305,000 – figures which Mrs Yap took from the HDB website and included in her email to the HDB.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">In September, after numerous appeals spanning almost one year, a glimmer of hope surfaced. HDB informed them that it is “reviewing [their] re-appeal for a higher HDB loan”. That glimmer turned to frustration again one week later when the HDB informed them that it is “unable to accede” to their request for a higher loan.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">In her desperation, she fired off an email to the Prime Minister, Mr Lee Hsien Loong, last month.<span> </span>In it, she told the PM that “it is not that we do not work hard for our future [but even when we do] we can’t even secure a … home for our children.” She went on, “We’ve been writing in for a year, fighting for a loan to purchase a flat and not asking for [a free ride].”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">On 25<sup>th</sup> September, having had enough of the frustration of not being able to secure the loan, she told the HDB to “cancel the approved loan of $67,000 for now”, as there’s no point for them to buy a 3-room flat. “I’ll still be unable to work as nobody can look after my children,” she said. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">Mrs Yap is extremely disappointed that HDB would consider her husband’s salary too low to service a mortgage loan. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">“[The} Government encouraged us to have more children. But after having more children, we can’t provide them a proper home, my husband can’t provide his mother a place to stay, because his salary was [considered] too low to service a HDB loan.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><em><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">Read Leong Sze Hian’s article, “<a href="http://theonlinecitizen.com/2008/10/hdb-means-testing/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #810081;">HDB means-testing?</span></span></a>”</span></em></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0pt;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Update: Andrew Loh’s comment on certain issues brought up by readers.</strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong>The Yaps are not asking for a free handout.</strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">What they are asking for is to be given a loan (an additional $33,000 to the $67,000 which HDB has already offered) in order to buy a 4-room flat.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Why a 4-room flat?</strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">In a word, space. The four kids which they have (the youngest is just two months old) will grow up and the couple’s intention is to have a flat big enough for them. It’s a long-term thing. Also, a 4-room will enable Mr Yap’s mother to live with them, which in turn will allow Mrs Yap to go out to work, which will enable her to supplement her husband’s income and help service the $100,000 loan.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Second and last loan.</strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">HDB only allows Singaporeans to apply for two concessionary loans. As they have already received one such loan, this second loan will be their last from the HDB. Thus, they hope to secure a loan which will be enough to buy a 4-room so that they can live in it for the long term, without having to loan from the banks, which for the time being they cannot as they owe credit card bills.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Means-testing</strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">The bigger issue here is why HDB is implementing, effectively, means-testing for public housing without any official announcement or statements from the National Development Minister? Are there many cases of people defaulting on their mortgage loans? Further, what are the criterias or salary ceilings for applying for loans to buy a 3-room, 4-room or 5-room flat? What are the cut-off points for these?</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Why have 4 kids?</strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">I think this is a personal issue which the family decides. Financial ability to provide for the children is of course important but not all couples put that as the main consideration. Some have religious beliefs (I’m not saying the Yaps do). But whatever it is, however many kids the couple has, the point is that they are not asking for a handout. Mrs Yap wants to go back to work so that she can help supplement her husband’s income in order to help service the loan and be able to purchase a 4-room flat in order to give her children better living conditions and also to provide security – and safety – for Mr Yap;s mother who’s been abused.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Living within one’s means</strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">It is said by some that the couple should live within their means. While this would be generally encouraged, situations are not all the same. The difference here is that Mr and Mrs Yap are working hard to provide for their children. Mrs Yap wants to go out to work.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Providing public housing</strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">HDB’s policy, inadvertently, is discouraging the average Singaporean from having more children, it would seem, which is contrary to what the Government is trying to do. HDB is supposed to be an agency or Government department which provides public housing at affordable rates for the average Singaporean. Has HDB lost sight of its original purpose?</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Again, the biggest question is: Why is HDB in the business of means-testing and what are the criterias? Why no public announcements about this?</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Perhaps the HDB should provide Singaporeans with the statistic of those who have defaulted on their loans, who are unable to purchase flats because of their income level and give us the reasons why.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">In a word, transparency.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Why is Mr Yap’s $1,450 salary not enough to qualify for a sufficient loan? Should Mr Yap work a second job?</p>

              <h1>The right to love, marry and procreate?</h1>
              <div class="date">

              </div>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;"><strong>Leong Sze Hian / Columnist</strong></span></p>
              <p><img class="alignleft" style="margin: 13px; float: left; border: black 3px solid;" src="http://i140.photobucket.com/albums/r19/theonlinecitizen/Pictures%20Posted%20on%20TOC/TOC%20Team/us150-1.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">I refer to media reports about Singaporeans who have been unable to get permission to marry foreigners, despite repeated appeals to the relevant authorities and their members of parliament (MPs).</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">Singaporeans with lower-income, lower education, or lower-skilled jobs, find it harder to get permission to marry foreigners.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">For example, a Singaporean male sales manager in an electronics shop, age 44, earning $1,700 a month, was denied permission, with the reason that his income was deemed too low to support a family. Now, after more than 20 appeals to the Ministry of Manpower (MOM), more than four years, a few MPs, the answer is still no despite his salary having gone up to $2,500 now.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">I find it somewhat ironic that a Singaporean can go to a neighbouring country like Vietnam, pay a few thousand dollars, and marry a bride whom he has met only a few days before.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">In contrast, if he wants to marry a foreigner who has ever been to Singapore on a work permit or S-employment pass, he has to apply for permission.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">Surely, a relationship of many years with a foreigner in Singapore, may be a more lasting and lovely one, than a “few days” bride transaction.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">Will such policies contribute to more marriage strife and increasing divorce rates? At the end of the day, it may be the children of such failed marriages, who may bear the brunt of the consequences.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">There are also cases of Singaporeans who have to travel to foreign countries periodically to meet their foreign wives and children, because permission to marry was denied.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">Some of these Singaporeans may decide to migrate eventually.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">I find it somewhat contradictory that whilst we are encouraging procreation, and are aware of the increasing trend of Singaporeans marrying non-Singaporeans, which I understand is now at an all-time high of about 4 out of 10 marriages, that we continue to deny permission to marry in genuine cases.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">As our constitution and national pledge say equality for citizens, why do we discriminate against citizens on the basis of their income, education and occupation?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">If the theory that intelligence is due more to genes than to the environment is correct, are we not in a sense, making the lives of the genetically disadvantaged even harder, by denying their basic human right to love, to marry, and to have children?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">I understand that those who have ever worked in Singapore have to apply to the MOM for permission to marry, whilst others have to apply to the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA).</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">Do they use the criteria of assessment? Why not have just one authority so that the process and criteria may be more consistent?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">I would also like to suggest that the criteria be made public, so that Singaporeans don’t fall in love with the wrong people.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">With the foreigner population growing at double digits to more than one million now, this problem may continue to grow.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">If we are worried about “sham” marriages to get residency in Singapore, we can perhaps learn from other countries like the United States, which has severe penalties for “sham” marriages, whilst maintaining the right of every U.S citizen to marry anyone they truly love.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">I also understand that for Singaporean women, getting permission to marry a foreigner is even harder than for our men, as even higher standards of income, education and occupation are required.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">Is this a breach of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women(CEDAW), of which Singapore is a signatory?</span></p>

              <p><em>The following is a comment by one of our readers in response to an earlier post on TOC, “</em><a href="http://theonlinecitizen.com/2009/09/hdb-flats-affordability-will-always-be-there-says-mah/"><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">HDB flats – “affordability will always be there”, says Mah.</span></span></em></a><em>” We publish it here without edits.</em></p>
              <p><strong>Disillusion</strong></p>
              <p><img class="alignleft" style="margin: 13px; float: left; border: black 3px solid;" src="http://i140.photobucket.com/albums/r19/theonlinecitizen/Pictures%20Posted%20on%20TOC/Housing/amk3.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="220">A few years ago, just 4 month shy of my 35th birthday which marks my eligibility to purchase a 3 room HDB unit under the single scheme, I had viewed a 3 room flat at Marine Parade with a full sea view for an offered price of $200,000.</p>
              <p>Just when I hit my birthday, the en bloc frenzy started and ever since the asking price for a 3 room in Marine Parade is at least $280,000 and above going for as high as $380,000 for a corner sea view unit.</p>
              <p>It has been 3 years and the seller asking prices had not let up, a sign that free market is ever propelling the valuation upwards. The agents told me this is caused by PR buyers and rich investors who had cashed out on their en bloc sales hence are buying the HDB for rental income purposes. This had led the market valuation to be irregular and unfairly spiked by this small group of investors.</p>
              <p>The social ramification is that sincere and frustrated buyers had been unfairly priced out. To add to the woe, singles are not eligible to buy direct from HDB and those earning above $3000 are not eligible for singles grant and the cheaper HDB loans. I wrote to an MP years ago expressing the singles plight. I was willing to take a bank loan and forfeit the singles grant but I sought to have my purchase made direct from HDB which is much cheaper than in the open market since I was financing under a single income.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately I was told the government policies are pro family and to allow singles to buy subsidize housing may result in social ills. I was shell shocked and till this date I still do not understand how increased home ownership by singles is a societal problem. It is ironic that young couples are now highlighting their same plight as well.</p>
              <p>Isn’t it telling that the ‘’reason’’ told to be years back can no longer hold water since the pro family couples themselves are getting the same hit albeit them financing the unit with a dual income. For whatever HDB policies and their rationales in place, they certainly isn’t functioning at least for these two classes of people, the singles as well the young middle income couples, given the ever increasing HDB prices.</p>
              <p>I cite these real cases I know :</p>
              <p>Two families who lived in a 4 room unit that both families co-owned (they are relatives) had decided to split for space and privacy reasons. One of the childless couple in their 60s had balloted 6 times for a studio unit unsuccessfully and finally gave up. (This is another problem which is a separate topic of discussion altogether.)</p>
              <p>They recently bought a 30 over year old 3 room unit in a very original condition for $255,000 including COV. After paying the agent fees on both transactions, stamp duties, legal fees, renovation fees etc the whole unit came up to a whopping $300,000! So even if one was not to select a unit from the matured estate (Marine Parade, Queenstown etc), the average cost of a 3 room unit is still not considered affordable for the majority middle income class.</p>
              <p>For a single to take say $150,000 loan at age 35 would mean they are tied to a mortgage till their 50s or 60s, a lifestyle choice many certainly do not want to have. One often misses this other critical point , that is the value that one pay for a flat now say $300,000 will effectively cost an estimated $350,000 to $400,000 after serving say 20 to 30 years of interest. For this couple, they are left with almost nothing in their CPF except for the minimum sum of which half is pledged to the property I think.</p>
              <p>I cite another friend situation whose parents are married but not leaving together. She is a single and staying with one parent. Both parents are co-owners of the house. One parent is renting a room at $500 a month and my friend had been paying the rental for the last 8 years so she would have spent close to $50,000 by now.</p>
              <p>She does not have an option because she was not at an eligible age to buy in the earlier years and whilst she is now she feels that the current spiked price does not warrant the hefty loan she has to lock herself in for many years. She wants so badly to buy a unit for her other parent and is bearing the guilt that she is not able to provide a haven for her other parent in their golden years. At the same time she knows it does not make financial sense to keep forking the rental cost. These are the citizens out there who are in real conundrums and dire straits.</p>
              <p>I hear so very often in newspapers reports of investors snapping up condos and then profiting from the sales. The recent one I heard was someone who bought a high end condo in the east at over $700,000 before it was officially launch. We speculated that he has connections hence had received exclusive prelaunch invites. He later sold the condo for 2 million. It makes me cringed each time I hear rich people out there getting richer through property speculation whilst the commoners are struggling so hard to have a small piece of a haven from a land they call their home.</p>
              <p>I have no qualms of people getting rich but what frustrates me is that HDB pricing tails behind the private pricing hence all these speculation has a spill over ill effect on the general public housing pricing. Short of being disillusioned by this free market ballooning which never seem to burst, the alternative lifestyle choice that had crossed many minds is migration. I’ve known friends who had left the country and I still often hear this as an escape route whenever lamentations of high mortgage loans and education stress surfaced. It may just be a matter of time before more will take the plunge and find a new haven somewhere else.</p>
              <p>I know a reversal will create negative equity for many but for the sake of our generation the prices cannot keep going up. The government is the only authority figure who can intervene in the free market and bring to par what is irregular by renewed public policies. The US government has done it to save their corporations. Perhaps it’s time the Singapore do so to save their citizens.</p>

              <p><span style="line-height: 115%; font-family: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'; color: black; font-size: 10pt;">I refer to media reports about the Ministry of Manpower’s <a href="http://www.mom.gov.sg/publish/momportal/en/press_room/press_releases/2008/20081215-LM.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Labour Market Third Quarter 2008 Report</span></span></a>. </span><span style="font-family: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'; font-size: 10pt; ">I have analysed the report, and would like to point out the following negative aspects of the statistics:</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 115%; font-family: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'; color: black; font-size: 10pt;">…. Average (mean) Monthly Nominal Earnings Per Employee fell by 15 per cent, from $4,316 in the first quarter to $3,674 in the third quarter.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 115%; font-family: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'; color: black; font-size: 10pt;">…. Real Earnings fell even more by 17 per cent for the same period, from $3,982 to $3,307.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 115%; font-family: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'; color: black; font-size: 10pt;">…. 45.1% of unemployed residents were age 40 and over. This category had the highest proportion of the unemployed, with those age below 30, and 30-39, at 31.0 and 23.9% respectively.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 115%; font-family: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'; color: black; font-size: 10pt;">…. Change In Labour Productivity has fallen in the last four consecutive quarters to a record low of –9.6 per cent.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 115%; font-family: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'; color: black; font-size: 10pt;">…. On an annualised quarter-on-quarter basis, GDP growth declined by 6.8 per cent, continuing the contraction experienced in the second quarter (-5.3).</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 115%; font-family: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'; color: black; font-size: 10pt;">….. Resident unemployment rate (seasonally adjusted) rose to 3.3% in Sep 08 from 3.1% in Jun 08.</span></p>

              <p><span style="line-height: 115%; font-family: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'; color: black; font-size: 10pt;">….. Overall unit labour cost (ULC) rose for the tenth straight quarter, with the increase accelerating to 13% in Q3 08 from 10% in Q2 08. Unit business cost (ULC) went up by 12% in Q3 08.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 115%; font-family: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'; color: black; font-size: 10pt;">In the light of the above statistics, I would like to suggest that we consider other measures in addition to the $600 million SPUR package, to address the rapidly deteriorating employment situation.</span></p>

              <p><span style="line-height: 115%; font-family: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'; color: black; font-size: 10pt;">Since there is a 30-month waiting period for those who downgrade to a smaller new HDB flat, how does this revival of building new smaller flats help “more people who will need to downgrade”?</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 115%; font-family: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'; color: black; font-size: 10pt;">As the household income ceiling of $2,000 and $3,000 for those purchasing 2 and 3-room flats respectively have not changed for many years despite rising prices of new HDB flats, some Singaporeans may be forced to buy larger flats than they can afford.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 115%; font-family: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'; color: black; font-size: 10pt;">So, how can “families who would also like to start with smaller flats be financially prudent”?</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 115%; font-family: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'; color: black; font-size: 10pt;">Therefore, I would like to suggest that these policies be reviewed.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 115%; font-family: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'; color: black; font-size: 10pt;">With the recession just starting, since the market-pricing policy links new HDB flat prices to re-sale prices which are at a record high now, will these new BTO flats’ prices be adjusted if resale prices are much lower when the flats are actually built in a few years’ time?</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 10pt;">After watching the Cancer Charity Show, my friend’s sister, a 50 plus housewife, was so depressed, that she jumped from the 10th floor of her HDB flat, the day after the show.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 10pt;">As I watched elderly sick Singaporeans pleading during the show, that they have no money for medical treatment, medicine, and one lady who said that she did not even have 10 cents, the first thought that came into my mind, was isn’t there Medifund to help those who cannot pay for medical fees and Comcare to help the poor ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 10pt;">Since the reason given for raising the GST, was to help the poor, and the hike has already been implemented on 1 July, why do we keep hearing of pleas for help from the sick and the needy ?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 10pt;">I would like to suggest that a detailed breakdown be given of what and how the estimated $ 1.5 billion from the GST hike will be used to help the poor.</span></p>
              <p><strong>Too much resources for fund raising?</strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><img src="http://i140.photobucket.com/albums/r19/theonlinecitizen/Pictures%20Posted%20on%20TOC/PAP/aljunied.jpg" border="5" alt="" width="200" height="160" align="left"><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 10pt;">According to a ChannelNewsAsia <a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/312410/1/.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">report</span></span></a>:<br><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 10pt;">“Fifteen groups sharing different religious faiths came together as one on Sunday to raise funds in a big way for community projects in Aljunied GRC.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 10pt;">At the community bonding carnival in Hougang, each of the groups, including the Singapore Buddhist Lodge and Jamiyah <span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 10pt;">Singapore</span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 10pt;">, set up a stall either selling food or organising games for residents.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 10pt;">A maximum of S$350,000 in tickets was sold and the proceeds will go towards new facilities for the GRC’s Bedok Reservoir-Punggol division. The carnival is the first in a series of fund-raisers involving the religious groups in the constituency.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 10pt;">Beneficiaries include the 19-year-old Punggol Community Club – expected to cost millions to refurbish – a Dragon Boat House at <span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 10pt;">Bedok</span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 10pt;"> </span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 10pt;">Reservoir</span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 10pt;"> </span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 10pt;">Park</span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 10pt;"> and a kidney dialysis centre.”</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 10pt;">Are we directing too much resouces in our fund raisng activities for “new facilities for the GRC”, refurbishing a Community Club, Dragon Boat House, etc, at the expense of funds for the needy?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 10pt;">All of the above manifestations may be attributed to the root cause of the problem, which is the widening income gap.</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 10pt;">It states that “Manual workers, again at the bottom of the payout scale, are likely to get a merit raise of 3.7 per cent in 2008, compared to 3 per cent in 2007”.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 10pt;">With increasing inflation expected to hit 4.5 per cent by 2008, the median wage increase for manual workers may in effect be a negative increase in wages in real items. This may further contribute to the widening income gap, which was one of three major challenges facing </span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 10pt;">Singapore</span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 10pt;"> as highlighted by Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong recently.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 10pt;">In this connection, according to the Reuters news report “Singapore’s economic boom widens income gap” of 9 November, “the proportion of Singapore residents earning less than S$1,000 (US$690) a month rose to 18 percent last year, from 16 percent in 2002, central bank data released late last month show… and Singapore’s Gini coefficient, a measure of income inequality, has worsened from 42.5 in 1998 to 47.2 in 2006, and is now in league with the Philippines (46.1) and Guatemala (48.3), and worse than China (44.7), data from Singapore’s Household Survey and the World Bank show”.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 10pt;">I refer also to media reports that <span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 10pt;">Taiwan</span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 10pt;"> is becoming an M-shaped society because of the widening income gap, and that the number of </span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 10pt;">Singapore</span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 10pt;"> millionaires could soar to 29,000 by 2011.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 10pt;">Last year, the top 20 per cent of Taiwanese households earned six times more than the bottom 20 per cent.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 10pt;">In contrast, using data from the Department of Statistics’ Key Household Income Trends 2006, the top 20 per cent of households in <span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 10pt;">Singapore</span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 10pt;">, earned about 12 times more than the bottom 20 per cent, based on the “Average Monthly Income from Work Per Household Member Among Employed Households by Decile”.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 10pt;">Does the above mean that the income gap is about 6 times more than the Taiwanese ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 10pt;">In Taiwan, the average household at the top earned $ 82,300 (NT $ 1.82 million), whereas it was $ 13,700 (NT $ 304,000) for the average household at the bottom.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 10pt;">In comparison, Singapore’s top decile by average monthly per household member was $ 83,880, versus $ 3,600 for the bottom decile.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 10pt;">From the above, if we assume three members per household, the top earned $ 251,640 and the bottom $ 10,800.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 10pt;">So does it mean that we earn about 205 per cent more at the top, and about 21 per cent less at the bottom, when compared to the Taiwanese, on this basis ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 10pt;">(Note : As the household income data is not given in decile format, I have used the per capita household income data in the above analysis. This analysis has been quite difficult because of the selective availability of data for different time periods.)</span></p>
              <p><strong>Helping the poor?</strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><img src="http://i140.photobucket.com/albums/r19/theonlinecitizen/Pictures%20Posted%20on%20TOC/Housing/oneroom350.jpg" border="5" alt="" width="150" height="210" align="left"><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 10pt;">In </span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 10pt;">Taiwan</span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 10pt;">, some $ 11.3 billion (NT $ 250 billion) was handed out to the poor in assistance schemes that included monthly subsidies of up to $ 270 (NT $ 6,000) for the elderly.</span></p>
              <p>In <span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 10pt;">Singapore</span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 10pt;">, about 3,000 destitutes get $ 290 a month in welfare. How much do the elderly poor in </span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 10pt;">Singapore</span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 10pt;"> get a month ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 10pt;">Since the reason given for raising GST was to help the poor, how much was spent last year helping the poor, and how much will be spent this year following the GST increase ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 10pt;">As a point of comparison, <span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 10pt;">Singapore</span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 10pt;">’s per capita Gross National Income was $ 45,353 in 2006, compared to </span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 10pt;">Taiwan</span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 10pt;">’s, estimated to be about $ 42,000.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 10pt;">The poor in <span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 10pt;">Taiwan</span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 10pt;"> pay $ 18 (NT $ 400) a month for a 36-sq-m rental flat.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 10pt;">In Singapore, a 1-room HDB rental flat starts at $ 44.50 ($ 26 rental plus $ 18.50 Service and Conservancy Charges) for households earning not more that $ 800 a month. Those earning more pay higher rentals.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 10pt;">In view of the above comparative statistics, I would like to suggest that we review some of our policies like the extra 1 per cent interest on the first $ 60,000 of CPF, because the poor may stand to gain less relative to the rich, as they may have lower CPF balances. The $ 700 million that the extra 1 per cent will cost, may be better directed to the poor instead.</span></p>

              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Introduction</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">National Service, or army conscription in Singapore, was first introduced in 1967 due to pressing issues such as national security after Singapore’s “forced” independence in 1965. In 1971, the British completely pulled out of Singapore. It has been 41 years since the introduction of NS.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Since then the world and Asia has changed significantly in terms of security and economic arrangements. But has Singapore’s conscription policy kept up with these changes to reflect and cope with the new geopolitical landscape?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">First let us review the service that all able-bodied 18-year-old male Singaporeans have to undergo. Basic Military Training, or BMT, is the “boot camp” for all new recruits. This lasts for three months whereupon the soldier then gets posted out to other units for further specialised training.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The conscripts then serve the remainder of their two-year stint polishing up their combat skills. Following the two years of full-time service, NSmen are required (for up to 40 days a year) to serve in a part-tme capacity until they are 50 years old for commissioned officers and 40 for others.</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Reduce the two-year full-time service</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">In an age where warfare has turned to “smart” technology, is it still logical and necessary for Singapore to insist that its National Servicemen undergo 24 months months of active, full-time service? Such a policy is rare among countries that maintain a conscription policy. Below is a list of countries with periods of full-time conscript service:</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">1.Austria (6 months)<br>2.Bolivia (12 months)<br>3.Brazil (9-12 months)<br>4.Denmark (4-12 months)<br>5.Estonia (8-11 months)<br>6.Finland (6-12 months)<br>7.Germany (9 months)<br>8.Greece (12 months)<br>9.Guatemala (12-24 months)<br>10.Moldavia (12 months)<br>11.Mongolia (12 months)<br>12.Paraguay (12-24 months)<br>13.Poland (9-12 months)<br>14.Serbia (6 months)<br>15.Switzerland (18-21 weeks)<br>16.Taiwan (12 months)<br>17.Tunisia (12 months)<br>18.Turkey (12 months)<br>19.Ukraine (12 months_<br>20.Uzbekistan (12 months)</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">From the above data, it can be seen that for all intents and purposes a conscript army training programme need not be as long as the one we have in Singapore. The more advance countries like Austria, Denmark, Germany, Greece, and Switzerland all have full-time services limited to one year and less.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Even Taiwan, which has an identifiable enemy in the form of China, limits its active service to 12 months. Only countries like South Korea and Israel have conscription periods that are longer than Singapore’s. These countries are, however, in a state of war.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Given the situation in Singapore there is no reason why we cannot employ more efficient training methods and reduce full-time NS from the present two-years to twelve months or less.</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Reservist training</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The current period of reserve training for NS men of up to 40 years old is also a burden on the servicemen and, by extension, the economy. Not only does the serviceman have to contend with the influx of foreigners, they are disadvantaged in terms of employment, remuneration and promotion when employers compare local men who have to be away for weeks in anyone year with foreign workers who have no such obligation.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The span of a serviceman’s reservist training should not go beyond 30 years of age. Men tend to settle down and start families around this age and job stability and carreer prospects are essential during this period. Unfair competition from foreign nationals would handicap local males and add to their already stressful lifestyles.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">In addition, the human body goes into a physical decline after the age of 30. To keep our military personnel in top condition, it makes little sense in keeping men over the age of 30 in the frontline if military conflict does indeed breakout.</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Increase volunteer, professional army</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">To compensate for the decrease in the number of active and reservist NSmen, the Singapore Armed Forces should expand volunteer army recruitment to complement the reduction in the number of conscripts.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">In fact, the number of countries that have scrapped conscription are on the rise: Argentina (1994), Belgium (1994), Czech Republic (2004), France (1996), Hungary (2004), Italy (2004), Netherlands (1996), New Zealand (1972), Portugal (2004), and Spain (2001).</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">While Singapore may not be ready to follow suit, it would be prudent for us to reduce NSmen in favour of a professional military outfit</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">At the moment, NSmen are exploited for their services to glorify the PAP during National Day parades. The energy and time of these men can be put to more productive use than as entertainment for the PAP regime.</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Conscientious objectors</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">What about people who do not believe that it is right for them to do military service due to moral, religious or ethical grounds? At the moment such conscientious objectors are charged and imprisoned for the length of their service.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">In some of the countries that have compulsory military service, there is also a provision for conscientious objectors to serve in non-combat roles. There is an argument that this would open the flood gates for men to opt for non-combat positions. Such a loophole can be plugged by increasing the length of active service by, say, six months. The experiences of other countries like Germany and Sweden have not been negative in this aspect where males try to avoid combat service by claiming to be conscientious objectors.</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Tranparency and openness</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Obligation in Singapore seems to be a one-way street. While the Government holds the people accountable for their NS liabilities, the Ministry of Defence remains non-transparent and non-accountable in their dealings with the public.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The recent deaths of National Servicemen have opened a can of worms on training safety. In addition, the number of training fatalities and injuries are not made known to the public as a matter-of-course. The Government which compels the people to give their lives for the country are obliged to be absolutely transparent with information pertaining to safety issues. Compensation for deaths and injuries must also be reviewed and revised upwards.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The Government must also not exploit NSmen as cheap labour during major events such as the WB-IMF meeting or, possibly, the upcoming Youth Olympics. In must be remembered that the Enlistment Act was enacted for a specific purpose and any detraction from that purpose must be shunned.</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Conclusion</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">When citizens are forced to serve in the military with the possibility of being killed if called to war, it is imperative that the government is a democratic one where citizens can hold the government accountable for its decisions and actions. Otherwise we may end up in a situation where wars are waged for the ruling elite rather than for the security and sovereignty of the nation.</span></p>
