              <p>For one who had always demanded others for proof, what proof has the X-rated Kid to offer that  <em><span style="color: #0000ff;">"Thousands of others had stayed and contributed to our country for years ?"</span></em></p>
              <p>Did they stay to contribute to our country, or did they stay to find new economic opportunities for themselves ?</p>
              <p>Did their stay benefitted Singaporeans in particular, or did their stay benefitted the PAP fiscal schemes ?</p>
              <p>An abstract of a report on <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.pecc.org/labor/papers/SEA-Singapore-Chew-Soon-Beng-and-Rosalind-Chew.pdf">"Demographic change and emigration in Singapore - Pg 7" (*1) </a> had reported that -</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><em><span style="color: #0000ff;">“During the period from 1977 to October 1988, 144 Singaporeans renounced their citizenship, and 2,772 others had their citizenship terminated because they became citizens of other countries. </span></em></p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #0000ff;">Since 1989, about 5000 Singaporeans emigrated annually. </span></em></p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #0000ff;">According to another source, the number of Singapore’s emigrants was about 6000 to 7000 annually. </span></em></p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #0000ff;">MM LKY said that Singapore loses about 1000 capable people every year – which is about 4% to 5% of the top 30% of the population.”</span></em></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>No statistics have dared been published to show the number of <em>new Singaporeans </em>renounce their new Citizenship - after using it as a stepping stone to gain entry to the final country of its real - but carefully hidden - choice.</p>

              <p>Did the riot involved pitch battle between local Malays battling the Chinese ?</p>
              <p>Or was the truth not deliberately said that - <a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Hertogh_riots">“The mob (largely consisted of Malay or Indonesian Muslims but local Chinese gangs were also reported to have joined in) moved out to attack any Europeans and even Eurasians in sight.” (*2) </a>?</p>
              <p>Was the riots not about the political awakening of Asians to the seeming continuous abuse of the European Colonialists towards Asians ?</p>
              <p>If the X-rated kid will be more careful in its research before shooting off its mindless path, perhaps the dignity of truth will not have been ravished, and perhaps he would have been able to salvage some for whatever it is worth.</p>

              <p>It's like being invited to someone's house, the owner offer you
              tea, you accepted the tea, but decide not to drink, giving reason
              that you are not thirsty. Then you walked over to your
              neighbour's house, you see the lady drinking tea and chatting
              happily with the other owner.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The moral of the story is, don't offer citizenship to anybody.
              This is in congruence with the main argument that we don't really
              like them here. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              It's true. I went to a party last weekend and there's this person who worked for ICA.  With nothing better to talk, we asked her why there are so many foreigners in Sinkapore and what it takes to become to a PR.
              
              Guess what she says? 
              
              She candidly told us that if any of our foreign friends interested to live and work in Sinkapore.  They just need to do 3 painstaking things : 
              
              1.  Pack their bag. 
              2.  Buy a one-way ticket.
              3.  Kiss their families goodbye. 
              
              We were stunned!
