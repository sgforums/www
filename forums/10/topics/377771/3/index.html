              <h4>The Goatherd and the Wild Goats</h4>
              <p>A GOATHERD, driving his flock from their pasture at eventide,
              found some Wild Goats mingled among them, and shut them up
              together with his own for the night.</p>
              <p>The next day it snowed very
              hard, so that he could not take the herd to their usual feeding
              places, but was obliged to keep them in the fold.</p>
              <p>He gave his
              own goats just sufficient food to keep them alive, but fed the
              strangers more abundantly in the hope of enticing them to stay
              with him and of making them his own.</p>
              <p>When the thaw set in, he
              led them all out to feed, and the Wild Goats scampered away as
              fast as they could to the mountains.</p>
              <p>The Goatherd scolded them
              for their ingratitude in leaving him, when during the storm he had taken more care of them than of his own herd.  One of them,
              turning about, said to him:  <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>"That is the very reason why we are
              so cautious; for if you yesterday treated us better than the

              <p><strong>MPs speak up<br><br></strong>Shin Min Daily interviewed a few MPs and this is what they have to say:<br><br><strong>Sembawang GRC's Dr Lim Wee Kiak</strong><br><br>"Netizens should not overreact because Zhang is a PR and still retains her Chinese passport. Hence, China is still her home.<br><br>"In fact, there are a number of Singaporeans who are PRs in another country and they visit Singapore on a frequent basis. Should we then turn them away?"<br><br><strong>Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC's Ms Josephine Teo</strong><br><br>Ms Teo said she understands the perspectives of the netizens and knows that they are worried that foreigners are merely using Singapore as a springboard to other countries.<br><br>However, in Zhang's case, she had 'hopped' back to her own country and did not use her permanent residency to hop to another country.<br><br>She also reasoned that Zhang's duration in Singapore was probably not enough for her to feel she wanted to settle here.<br><br>"As a globalized nation, such situations will occur frequently and we must learn to accept that this is the case."<br><br><strong>Tanjong Pagar GRC's Mr Baey Yam Keng</strong><br><br>Mr Baey reckons that such situations depend on the person's emotional attachment to the country.<br><br>"Zhang grew up in China and her entire family is there. Perhaps family ties are more important to her now than before."<br><br>He also told Shin Min Daily that Singaporeans living overseas still regard Singapore as their home and most of them end up returning here.<br><br><a href="http://www.asiaone.com/News/AsiaOne%2BNews/Singapore/Story/A1Story20091005-171881.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #417e15;">http://www.asiaone.com/News/AsiaOne%...05-171881.html</span></span></a> <br style="clear: both;"></p>

They also feel that there are higher expectations placed on them because they are new citizens and PRs and so these needs to be addressed. <br><br>“You need a variety of ways. Education is important, you need to foster a sense of inclusiveness and for new citizens it is important to get them to realise Singapore's historical heritage and the importance of multiculturalism as well.” <br><br>The workplace is also the subject of another work group on economic issues. <br><br>It is urging the government to go easy on withdrawing the fiscal stimulus measures announced in the government's Budget. <br><br>Dr Chua Hak Bin, REACH Workgroup on Economic and Employment Opportunities, said: "With the recent property measures, there is fear that there would be a double blow if you withdraw a lot of stimulus measures introduced in February and there are already hints that the Jobs Credit scheme would be withdrawn and that's quite a big component - nearly four billion. <br><br>"We have to bear in mind that could have a negative impact on the economy, perhaps a gradual withdrawal is in order." <br><br>On Tuesday, the government had said that it will announce whether to extend the Jobs Credit scheme next month. <br><br>Moving forward, REACH has decided to form three new policy work groups to address the dynamic changes in Singapore society. <br><br>They will gather feedback on healthcare, manpower and national integration and present the findings in a year. <br><br>Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports, Dr Vivian Balakrishnan, said: “We owe it to you to respond equally conscientiously to your proposals. We will ask the relevant ministries to say "Yes", "No" or "Maybe" and to give your reasons for the responses. <br><br>“REACH has evolved beyond merely being a channel for feedback although feedback remains important. Today, REACH is part of the concept of deliberative democracy - a platform for responsible citizens to come together, identify the key issues, analyse data, formulate innovative policy options and ultimately co-create solutions to the many fundamental challenges we face.” - CNA/vm</div>

This would be the case if Singapore did not bring in foreign talent.”<br><br>Dr Vivian then proceed to placate the audience with the standard (official) reassurance that the government will continue to safeguard the interests of citizens:<br><br>“You have a birthright. Everything we do is for your long-term benefit. Foreigners are here to help make Singapore more viable and competitive and to help us create more job and opportunities but it’s all about Singaporeans.”<br><br>Dr Vivian did not elaborate more about the “long-term” benefits that Singaporeans have acquired from the government other than the mandatory 2 year National Service for Singapore males.<br><br>During the dialogue which lasted for more than one hour, Dr Vivian also answered questions on political apathy put by a group of students who proposed that a political education program, along with the continued cultivation of a media landscape would help address the problem.<br><br>Dr Vivian dismissed the students’ proposal altogether by claiming that there was no political apathy among the youths without substantiating them. He also warned against labeling youths as apathetic, saying it was “trendy” to do so.<br><br>[A classic PAP way of addressing genuine concerns of Singaporeans - by ignoring the existence of the problem in the first place!]<br><br>As the dialogue drew to a close, Dr Vivian would not fail to notice the restless and dismayed looks on the faces of some students.<br><br>The PAP government is feeling the heat from the electorate especially on some of its important long-term policies such as the massive influx of foreign talent, rising costs of HDB flats and the non-transparent nature of the way the country’s reserves are being managed.<br><br>It will only be a matter of time before Singaporeans start questioning the inherent deficiencies in the one-party system promulgated by the PAP.</div>

But many Asian countries are dependant on exports to the US and when the US economy weakens, many Asian economies do too. However, Mr Lee said that there are exceptions. <br><br>He said: "One (exception) is China, another is India. Both have huge domestic populations. They need a lot of infrastructure - in China, particularly in western provinces, and in India, throughout the country. <br><br>"Their need for consumer durables, refrigerators, microwave ovens, air conditioners is enormous." <br><br>He said infrastructure development can boost China's economy by eight per cent and improve India's economy by six per cent. <br><br>In the first three months of this year, Japan - the world's second largest economy - recorded its worst ever annualised GDP fall. The country also faces a fast aging population and declining birthrate - similar to the problems faced by Singapore. <br><br>Mr Lee said: "Unless you change man's attitudes, this declining birthrate will be a disaster for Japan and for Singapore. And it is happening all over Europe. So they are getting migrants from North Africa, Turkey, black Africa, Muslims, pagans, all sorts of new entrants. <br><br>"Japan doesn't want these immigrants. It is part of the culture of the country. In Singapore, if we have not taken immigrants, the economy would have become slothful." <br><br>Japan has only recently begun to hire foreign workers from Indonesia and the Philippines for jobs such as nurses and day-care workers. But Mr Lee said this will not solve the problem, and believes that immigration is a more viable, long-term solution. <br><br>- CNA/yt</div>

But its founder lives in a three-bedroom house and drives a 1.5-litre Opel Astra. Mr Murthy does not watch TV nor party. <br><br>He said the reason he started business is because as a young man, entrepreneurship was the best way he could serve his community. <br><br>And he said Minister Mentor Lee is his hero. <br><br>"Singapore is a real example of a country that has transformed herself from a third world country to a first world country in my own lifetime. All in, an environment of peace and harmony in a multicultural world, thanks of course to a cadre of aspirational and value-based leadership which has indeed led by example," said Mr Murthy. <br><br>"Singapore serves as a great example for all countries, both developing and developed. I'm so happy that my hero, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, is releasing the book here in Singapore," he added. <br><br>Mr Murthy believes the transparency and accountability of India's political system must be improved for the country to move forward. <br><br>And these are some of the views detailed in his book titled "A Better India: A Better World", which was launched by Minister Mentor Lee on Monday. <br><br>Mr Lee said: "There are limitations in the Indian constitutional system and the Indian political system that prevents it from going at high speed. <br><br>"I did not realise it until we engaged India closely. Since then we have realised that whatever the political leadership may want to do, it must go through a very complex system at the centre, and then even a more complex system in the various states. <br><br>"And the amount of work that is on the shoulders of these Ministers makes it necessary for each man, each Minister to be like Mr Murthy but Mr Murthy is a rare individual. <br><br>"So Indians will go at a tempo which is decided by their constitution, by their ethnic mix, by their voting patterns and the resulting coalition governments, which makes for very difficult decision making." <br><br>Mr Lee had told Mr Murthy previously that India needed political leaders like him. But Mr Murthy said he has no political ambition. <br><br>Source: <a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/428494/1/.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/428494/1/.html</span></span></a></div>

Russian Federation, the Soviet Union, the Russian Empire before that were famous for their classical universities but we have never had business education." <br><br>The school's MBA programme is designed to cater to 240 students a year. <br><br>This year, there were less than 40 students, perhaps because the Russian economy is still recovering from the effects of the global financial crisis. <br><br>Wilfried Vanhonacker, the Dean of the school, however, remains optimistic. "Our focus has always been the emerging markets and if anything, the crisis has brought out the importance of emerging markets and the economic development in Russia and in China as locomotives to maybe pull the rest of the world out of recession. I think we picked the right objective and focus and the crisis is helping us." <br><br>Mr Vanhonacker also praised the advice and support the business school has been receiving from Singapore and from Minister Mentor Lee in particular. He said: "It's a very open economy, it's an economy in which the government has played a very important role, which is totally new in development markets now. So, we can learn a lot and we will bring it into pedagogical model. You know, we are very happy with our link and our support and the insight that Minister Mentor gives." <br><br>Minister Mentor Lee, who has been a member of the school's advisory board since its foundation in 2006, received a warm welcome from President Medvedev. <br><br>"Dear and respected Minister Mentor, it is a great pleasure to see you and to thank you for the personal input you made in our school, that you agreed to become a member of its advisory board and for performing your responsibilities in good faith," said Mr Medvedev. <br><br>Minister Mentor Lee said the Skolkovo business school project is important as Russia needs a generation of people who would be able to better connect Russia with the world. <br><br>He said: "You have now entered into the world economy, no longer isolated, and you must produce a generation of young people who are able to connect with the world and maximize the advantages that the world offers you," said Minister Mentor Lee. <br><br>"Without the world, Singapore would not be able to develop. It was because of the advanced countries around the world and our links with them - in trade, education, investments, connections in tourism - that we were able to ramp up our society in less than 40 years." <br><br>Mr Lee also urged students to seize the opportunity to create more connections with the world so as to further develop Russia. <br><br>The meeting between President Medvedev and Minister Mentor Lee was not only to talk about the school. <br><br>The Russian president also said he plans to visit Singapore in November with his first official visit. <br><br>He said he is looking forward to see Singapore and to learn from the economic experience of Minister Mentor Lee. <br><br><br>- CNA/ir</div>

First by making people understand that unless we are exceptional, we will not survive. We have no oil, no gas, but we have (the) biggest petrol refining and petrol chemical complex in the whole of the region. <br><br>"All the major companies are there - why? (It is because of) stability, security of their investments, efficiency and certainty." <br><br>Minister Mentor Lee was also asked whether he played a role in helping his son Lee Hsien Loong to become Singapore's prime minister. <br><br>He replied: "I did not appoint my son, I appointed somebody else (as) prime minister, who was my successor, and he stayed in the job for 14 years, and he chose my son to be his deputy. I did not arrange that." <br><br>Minister Mentor Lee also talked about the tactics he used to achieve success. <br><br>He said: "I always take a decision where if it fails, I got an exit route - that is a first principle I have. Take an option which is not a dead end; if it is a dead end, then you are in trouble. If that option fails, you must have plan B." <br><br>Meanwhile, Minister Mentor Lee has met with Oleg Deripaska, CEO of top Russian investment company Basic Element, in Moscow. <br><br>At their meeting, both men discussed developments in Russia, and the impact of the financial crisis. <br><br>The two are expected to meet again in Singapore next week, when Mr Deripaska attends the Russia-Singapore Business Forum. <br><br>Mr Lee is in Moscow as part of a week-long trip to Europe. <br><br>During his last day in Moscow, Minister Mentor Lee will also meet with Russian journalists before departing for Singapore on Wednesday. - CNA/ms</div>
