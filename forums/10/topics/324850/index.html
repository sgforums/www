                                    exports in a big way - with worse to come. Comment. Seah 
                                    Chiang Nee<br> Jul 19, 2008</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Singapore is hitting a really bad patch 
                                    and no one can say how bad - or how long - things will fall 
                                    before the sun shines again.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Singapore’s selling point for decades, 
                                    its strong economy – measured by GDP and reserves 
                                    growth – is now looking a little fray as the global 
                                    waves hit its our shores.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Bugged by high oil and food prices all around 
                                    them, middle-class and poor Singaporeans are becoming more 
                                    and more unhappy as their quality drops. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Last week there was is a brief respite to 
                                    the oil crisis as prices fell from a high of $147 to $130 
                                    a barrel, but it’s too early to pronounce it is over. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Meanwhile, 
                                    the value of its foreign investments has dropped by US$15-US$20b 
                                    - so far, led by declines in US and European banks. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">This is could be the worst performance in 
                                    history for both Temasek and the Government Investment Corporation 
                                    (GIC), despite assurances that they are long-term (30 years) 
                                    investments. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">At home, the government's actions against 
                                    its political opponents and the way some were carried out 
                                    in and outside the court have brought heat from some people 
                                    at home and abroad. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Charges of ‘inept’ leadership 
                                    and policies that worsen inflation are sounding out almost 
                                    daily, loosening the bonds that existed between the governed 
                                    and the governing.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Amidst all these, the centerpiece - the 
                                    economy - on which the government uses to justify its crackdowns 
                                    and controls, is beginning to show trouble as a result of 
                                    the global woes.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">(Leaders have often said that as long as 
                                    the economy is strong, all other problems can be solved.)</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">In the latest report, Singapore’s 
                                    non-oil domestic exports in June fell 10.5% to $12.8b, far 
                                    worse than the 2.8% drop economists had been predicting. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">It was due to sharp declines in shipments 
                                    to key markets such as the United States, Europe and China. 
                                    The rate of decline was the same as the previous month. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Seven of its 10 major markets registered 
                                    drops in shipments, led by the 24% fall in exports to the 
                                    USA, while exports to Europe declined 16% and were down 
                                    12% to China. That spells trouble ahead.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Economists are predicting more gloom in 
                                    the immediate future - even a possible technical recession.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Song Seng Wun, regional economist at CIMB-GK 
                                    Research said "We should be prepared for even more 
                                    ugly export numbers in the coming months."</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">The city's gross domestic product (GDP) 
                                    grew at a much slower annual pace of 1.9% percent in the 
                                    second quarter from 6.9%. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">According to the Straits Times, a senior 
                                    executive from the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation 
                                    (GIC) said that the global downturn will last longer than 
                                    the tech bubble burst eight years ago.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Mr. Ng Kok Song told a gathering of top 
                                    private bankers and senior fund managers that policy-makers 
                                    here face more uncertainties, including inflation and the 
                                    US presidential race. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Any 
                                    recession, even a technical one, could affect jobs and business 
                                    in Singapore. Citizens are worried about mass retrenchment, 
                                    low salaries and low bonuses. Meanwhile, inflation continues 
                                    at record high</span></p>

              <td class="bodytext" colspan="3">SINGAPORE is not heading for a recession, said Finance Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam, although fuel price increases in Malaysia would lead to discomfort.
              <p>'From all indications we have at this point, I don't think we're heading for a recession.</p>
              <p>'But there will be discomfort on the ground,' he said, speaking to Channel NewsAsia at the Entrepreneur-in-You Carnival at Republic Polytechnic.</p>
              <p>At the event, about 7,000 people turned up to pick up tips on starting their own business.</p>
              <p>
              
              'Unfortunately, the fuel price increase in Malaysia does mean that vegetable, poultry and some other prices will go up. We can't avoid that,' he said.</p>
              <p>Malaysia's decision to trim subsidies for petrol and diesel and raise pump prices has meant that overnight, there has been a 41 per cent increase in petrol prices, from 80 Singapore cents to $1.13 per litre, while diesel prices rose 63 per cent, from 66 cents to $1.08 per litre.</p>
              <p>Prices of a range of goods are set to go up as the cost of trucking them in rises, and fresh food tops the list.</p>
              <p>But practically everything imported from Malaysia, including building materials, will also cost more soon.</p>
              <p>He added that it was fortunate that rice prices globally were going down.</p>
              <p>'But overall, we're in a situation which isn't temporary - this will be with us for a while.</p>
              <p>'Commodity prices are much higher than what they used to be,' he said.</p>
              <p>This was being tackled through government measures such as Growth Dividends, goods and services tax (GST) credits, as well community initiatives on the ground, he said.</p>
