              <p></p>
              <div class="entry">
              <p><strong>Shelley Thio</strong> -</p>
              <p><a href="http://theonlinecitizen.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/js320240.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-25851" title="js320240" src="http://theonlinecitizen.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/js320240.jpg" alt="" width="320" height="240"></a>Sally’s and Jacob’s only wish was to have their own home to raise their family.  When we met up with Sally, she told us they were facing eviction from their temporary home at a block of HDB flats managed by EM Services (HDB owns 75 per cent of the company).</p>
              <p>EM Services had given the family of 5 up to 4 June to settle their outstanding arrears of S$1,891.41 or Sally, Jacob and their children will be forced out of their home.</p>
              <p>Both Sally and Jacob are in ill health.  We noticed that Jacob’s ankles were swollen.  Jacob told us that he had an operation last year because he was suffering from slipped disc, a degenerative disease of the spine. Sally has difficulty swallowing and digesting her food.  She cannot stand for too long and suffers from fainting spells and has difficulty breathing.  Sally is unemployed and does not think she would be able to hold down a full-time job because of her health problems.  Jacob does not want her to work as she is too ill. The family is now living on Jacob’s salary, which is approximately $600 per month (net salary).</p>
              <p>On her doctor’s advice, Sally underwent an MRI scan that about S$300, which was subsequently deducted from Jacob’s salary.  For that particular month, Jacob’s take home pay was S$165.  Sally stopped going to the hospital because they could not afford the expensive medical tests and her medical bills.</p>
              <p>Their son was recently enlisted into National Service and will be receiving approximately $400 per month. They have a 22-year old daughter who has been unemployed for six months.  Their daughter, when employed, would be assigned to a part-time job or contract work.  The lack of job security and the benefits that come with full time employment – no CPF, no paid sick leave and annual leave, no medical benefits, to name just a few.  As Sally put it to me, “How can our young Singaporeans with low qualifications, like my daughter, going to ever afford a HDB flat when the jobs out there for them are only part-time jobs and also on contract?  No CPF, how to buy a flat?”  And when the CDC sent her daughter for an interview with Certis Cisco, the HR officer told her daughter to “lose some weight and then come back to us.”</p>
              <p>HDB had rejected Sally and Jacob’s appeals to be eligible for the HDB Public Rental Scheme and also, to make a direct purchase from HDB because both Sally and Jacob had $110,000 in their CPF and so they applied for a loan of $60,000 from HDB.   After several months, HDB finally replied only to approve a loan to them for the amount of $45,000 which by that time was insufficient for them to purchase a flat in the open market because of the recent price hike in COVs in recent years.</p>
              <p>When they were newly married, Sally and Jacob bought a resale 3 room flat from a direct loan from HDB.  They sold the flat and made S$70,000 from the sale.  With their new family, both Sally and Jacob purchased a 4 room HDB flat.</p>
              <p>In 2005, Sally lost her job at MOE.  MOE did not renew her contract.  At that time, her kids were still in secondary school.  Sally and Jacob met with their MP at Woodlands to write an appeal letter to HDB to approve their request to downgrade from a 4 room flat to a 3 room flat.  As they did not hear from their MP, they went to see him again only to be told that “he was not in Singapore”.  So, they went to HDB to request for the downgrade and as they received no reply from HDB, Sally and Jacob sold their 4 room flat.  They made $29,000 from the sale of their 4 room flat.</p>
              <p>Subsequently, they made several appeals to HDB to purchase a 3 room flat. They were informed by HDB that they had to pay a levy of $40,000 before they could purchase a flat directly from HDB. They could not afford to pay the levy and ended up renting from the open market, which consequently exhausted their savings.</p>
              <p>Eventually they were referred to EM Services and were given temporary housing.</p>
              <p>On 14 May 2010, EM Services locked the main door to their rental flat.  A notice was pasted on the door and they were given a letter informing them that their tenancy was up.  Sally went to speak to EM Services to let them into their flat.  EM Services agreed but gave them 2 days after which they would have to move out of the flat.</p>
              <p>When they were told by EM Services that they had to move out, Sally refused to budge and would stay in the house for fear that they would be locked out if they went out.  A maintenance man came by the flat and asked her when they were going to leave the flat.  Sally simply replied that they had no place and nowhere else to go and she won’t be leaving the flat.</p>
              <p>Jacob and Sally went to see EM Services and asked to be allowed to stay on.  EM Services finally agreed only on the basis that they paid their outstanding rent of $1,891.41 (3 months rental, outstanding utilities and penalties) by 4 June and their lease will be extended until August 2010.  After which there will be no further extensions to their lease and they will have to leave the flat.  They were told “to move out and stay with your relatives.”</p>
              <p>Subsequently EM Services sent them a letter informing them that their rent will be increased to $480.</p>
              <p>Jacob and Sally felt it was also unfair of EM Services to charge them $50 for late payment when Jacob informed EM Services that his salary was only paid to him on the 12th day of each month.  This meant that they could only pay their rent to EM Services thereafter.  The rental payment date is from the 1st to the 9th of each month.  After which there will be a late payment charge of $50 (even if the payment was paid one day late).</p>
              <p>Sally continues to tell us about the frustrations she is facing when she approaches the officers of HDB and CDC for assistance and guidance.  An officer at HDB had told Sally that both Sally and her daughter “should go out to work”.  Sally said, “These people don’t seem to care that we are sick and that my daughter has been trying to look for work for six months.  The HDB officer even asked me to borrow money from our Church!”.  We told him, “We go to Church for worship. Our problem we keep in prayers.”</p>
              <p>There seems to be too much focus on leaving families to being self-reliant and the Government’s inflexible and stringent policies do not go far enough to address the problems and obstacles that families in similar predicament as Sally and Jacob are facing.  The Government does not take into consideration that these families require more time to get back on their feet again.</p>

              <div class="entry">
              <p><strong>Andrew Loh -</strong></p>
              <p><img class="alignleft" title="lee kuan yew" src="http://i140.photobucket.com/albums/r19/theonlinecitizen/Pictures%20Posted%20on%20TOC/Ministers%20Pictures/lky-3.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="200">I remember in the ’80s when I would look forward to each National Day Rally on television. Lee Kuan Yew was gonna speak and I’d always found him to be a great orator, someone who enthralls me each time. I would be glued to the screen listening to every one of his words, even to the point where if I needed to use the toilet, I would run there and be back as soon as I can, so that I wouldn’t miss a word he says.</p>
              <p>But to be clear, i was never a fan of his. I just loved listening to him speak.</p>
              <p>Fast forward to 2010 and I can’t even bare to read what he says anymore.</p>
              <p>Most of what he says nowadays is irritating, shallow and most significantly, condescending. I’ve lost count of the number of times he has put Singaporeans down with degrading remarks, using words and analogies including dogs, maids, daft, lazy, ignorant and more.</p>
              <p>While some of his supporters may try and explain that he is just trying to inspire or urge Singaporeans to be more productive, competitive and hardworking, I feel it actually is the contrary. Lee Kuan Yew’s words are borne out of hubris and arrogance. And with such overwhelming power and authority, he is fast nursing a society which is fast becoming dysfunctional – just as any father with such attitudes would.</p>
              <p>It breeds deference where there should not be, where even when he is wrong, no one dares speak up against him. Or when he makes a declaration, no one – least of all the media – dares question or challenge his claims.</p>
              <p>This is where the danger lies for Singapore.</p>
              <p>That after 50 years, we are still under the thumb of one man who, as with all who stays in power for so long, has become a world unto himself. And we live in this world of his, warts and all.</p>
              <p>Nah, Mr Lee, I do not and will not subscribe to your view that one should not retire and that one should never stop working. Instead, I believe, unlike you, that there is more to life than just feeding the economy beast, or being a cog in your economic wheel.</p>
              <p>Lee Kuan Yew is no sage and if we continue to live and believe as he does we will all soon find that our lives have become meaningless. That all we do is this relentless and endless pursuit of thhis thing called “a brighter future” – a utopian future which we never seem to be able to reach or arrive at.</p>
              <p>This is because there is no such future.</p>
              <p>It is the job of politicians like Lee Kuan Yew to make us believe that there is.</p>
              <p>Happinness and satisfaction and contentment is now. It is not in the future. There is no need to be running after this “brighter future” because we will never reach it.</p>
              <p>It does not exist.</p>
              <p>When we are able to see this, we are content with the here and now. We realise that life is so much more. That at the end of the day, it is the simple things which makes us happy – family, friends, helping others, spending time with loved ones.</p>
              <p>And we do not need “economic success” in order to be these or to do these things.</p>
              <p>I am happy where I am – and I am no big-time businessman, or a top civil servant, or a great scholar, or am earning millions.</p>
              <p>In fact, I am on the brink of being broke most of the time.</p>
              <p>Yet, I am contented. I am happy.</p>
              <p>I am most happy when I see my mom. When I speak to my sisters and see them happy. When I see my nieces and nephews. Or when I chit chat with my friends.</p>
              <p>I am consciously aware of not being a part of this dysfunctional family of Lee Kuan Yew. Dysfunctional to the point where we become arrogant, self-centred, back-stabbing, competitive to the point where we feel it is right and proper to house our foreign workers in a cemetery, where we pay our maids such a pathetic salary, where we even reject their request for a single day off per month, where we hang young boys, where our suicide rates are so high, where we cut the pay of older workers for no other reason than that they are old.</p>
              <p>And so on and so on.</p>
              <p>Singapore is a sad place now. It has become a hotel. Our home hijacked by one man who sees himself as our “father”. Indeed some have called him so.</p>
              <p>It is pathetic.</p>
              <p>I hope Lee Kuan Yew would leave the stage soon.</p>
              <p>I no longer admire him or the way he speaks or what he says.</p>
              <p>In fact, I am convinced that he is the biggest stumbling block to Singapore and Singaporeans achieving their full potential.</p>
              <p>Lee Kuan Yew to me is no sage.</p>
              <p>Indeed, he has become something of a joke to me. A sad relic of an old man trying to feed his ego by claiming the limelight almost on a daily basis now.</p>
              <p>It is a sad sight indeed.</p>
              <p>And now, whenever he comes on the telly, I would turn the telly off or walk away.</p>
              <p>The man is nothing but an ego trip.</p>
