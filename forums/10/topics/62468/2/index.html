There is no policy too sensitive to question, nothing which is taboo and must not be raised</strong>. The government may defend the policy vigorously, especially if it is an important one, and the government thinks the criticismis not justified. But the matter will be decided entirely on its merits, and <strong>we hold nothing against anyone simply for holding a different opinion from the government</strong>.</span> </span><br><br>In another keynote address at a dinner of the Economics Society of Singapore, on 8 April 2003, DPM LHL said:<br><br><span style="color: darkred;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Singapore being so small and open, we need the highest quality leadership that we can muster. Indeed, <strong>we must place our hopes not in a few key leaders, but in a broad leadership group at many levels across all segments of society</strong> - in government, in the business sector, [color=red]<strong>in the labor movement</strong></span>, and in academic and civic groups.... <strong>But while strong and visionary leadership is necessary, it is not enough. <span style="color: red;">To be effective, the leadership must evoke a response, a resonance from the society as a whole</span></strong>. <strong>The society must rise to the challenge of changing itself and <span style="color: blue;">establishing a new order</span></strong>.</span> [/color]<br><br>Are these sincere words for diversity of opinions and widening the scope for civic participation from the CITIZENS ?<br><br>Or are these words spoken to gain political acceptance from a larger group of better educated citizens that remained skeptical ?<br><br>So far it has been pure lip service.<br><br>"<span style="font-style: italic;">The society must rise to the challenge of changing itself and <span style="color: blue;">establishing a new order</span></span>" - from the old order established by the Father ?<br><br>It is still the rule of knee jerk reactions with the iron fist to any perceived social or labor unrests, with the standards of perception based on the benchmarks of the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s.<br><br>It is now the 21st Century, and the age of Virtual Reality is becoming real, hopefully the speeches from DPM LHL does not remain in the Political World of Virtual Reality.<br><br>The previous union leadership DID NOT "evoke a response, a resonance from the" members of ALPA-S - the union representing the Pilots; and the members passed a vote of no confidence.<br><br>The pilots are highly educated and discerning individuals, surely the harsh knee jerk response by the government, is hardly the manner to treat such a group.<br><br>Quotes taken from the labor of the author of the book:<br>'proudly singaporean - a passport to a challenging future'.<br>- ALAIN VANDENBORRE<br></div>
