            <div class='col-md body'>Since medieval times government have been inventing new ways to cheat the peasants. If you watch some medieval movies, you will notice some of the actors biting the gold coin, this is because whenever the King issues new coin, he adds some other non-precious metals into the coin. Pure gold is very soft, that's why if it yields when you bite, means it's pure gold, if it's very hard, means it has been mixed with other non-precious metals.<br><br></div>

I am working on the knowledge that bonds are far less volatile than stocks or any other derivatives or financial instruments. Perhaps, you'd need the educated to figure out how much they have really been shortchanged as apparently, for all the first world education dished out by this regime, not many are equipped with fundamental common sense and acumen to call their bluff. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>I'm not so much trying to speculate on the merits of which financial instrument being the most viable vehicle around - as a matter of fact, I do that for a living but that's irrelevant to this thread and that's pretty much a story for another day.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by maurizio13:</div><div class="quote_body">The government has the capacity to pay out 8% (say 10% less 2% admin fees) returns if it chooses to.
