            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="color: darkblue;">More S'pore couples divorcing earlier</span><br>But despite more calling it quits, local rates still relatively low</strong><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Straits Times, The (Singapore)<br>Prime News<br>November 12, 2007<br>Author: Lee Hui Chieh</span><br><br>NOT only are more marriages here ending in divorce, more married couples are calling it quits sooner too.<br><br>But Singapore still has one of the lowest divorce rates compared with Hong Kong, Japan and Britain.<br><br>The latest Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports (MCYS) figures showed that 3.8 per cent of couples who were hitched in 2002 divorced after being married for fewer than five years. This is a slight increase compared with 1987, when 2.6 per cent of couples married that year dissolved their union before five years.<br><br>As for marriages that did not make it past 15 years, the figure was 12 per cent for those who walked down the aisle in 1992. It was 10 per cent for the 1987 cohort.<br><br>Revealing the figures yesterday, Minister of State for Community Development, Youth and Sports Yu-Foo Yee Shoon noted: 'Our generation has more divorces than our parents' generation.'<br><br>The absolute numbers also showed an uptrend. Divorces and annulments hit a record high last year of 7,061, up from 6,909 in 2005.<br><br>Two decades ago, this figure was just 2,608.<br><br>The silver lining was Singapore's comparatively low divorce rate. Two in 1,000 of all residents here were divorced or separated, fewer than Hong Kong's three, Japan's four and Britain's eight.<br><br>The update is part of an ongoing MCYS effort to deepen research on the subject so as to find better ways to curb the divorce rate. The exact reasons why more people are divorcing sooner are not clear and will need to be studied further, Mrs Yu-Foo said.<br><br>One strategy the Government plans to employ: Encouraging more couples to go for pre-marriage counselling.<br><br>To help them get help more easily, not just before tying the knot, but also during matrimony, a one-stop marriage resource centre will be set up in the first quarter of next year.<br><br>The National Family Council is now working on this project, said Mrs Joni Ong, its deputy chairman.<br><br>Mrs Ong, who was married in 1987 and has five children, sees the rise in the divorce rate as being due to more stresses on the family unit now, where both parents often work long hours.<br><br>Fewer people are also having children, which makes it easier for them to end marriages earlier, she said.<br><br>Mrs Yu-Foo gave the update in a speech to 800 people at a seminar on strengthening relationships by the renowned author of the Seven Habits Of Highly Effective Families and the Seven Habits Of Highly Effective People, Dr Stephen Covey.<br><br>huichieh@sph.com.sg<br><br>Copyright, 2007, Singapore Press Holdings Limited<br><br>-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><strong><span style="color: darkblue;">Faster endings</span></strong><br><br><strong>Divorcing before five years of marriage:</strong><br>1987: 2.6%<br>2002: 3.8%<br><br><strong>Divorcing before 15 years of marriage:</strong><br>1987 cohort: 10%<br>1992 cohort: 12%</div>
