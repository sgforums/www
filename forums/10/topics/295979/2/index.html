            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by kilua:</div><div class="quote_body">Dont tell me if you are the PM of Malaysia, you want to let Chinese dominate the entire economy. When that happens, I doubt the Chinese can walk safely in the streets. We would see riots everyday.</div></blockquote>I have the book "The Malay Dilemma" right now (which I didn't know was in the possession of my father for more than 30 years already until I ransacked our house store just some months ago <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> ), a social theory of the malay plight by Dr.M.<br><br>On page 75-76,<br><blockquote>To answer the questions one has to go back to the basic reason for the preferential treatment of the Malays. The motive behind preferential treatment is not to put the Malays in a superior position, but to bring them up to the level of the non-Malays....... The malays are not proud of this treatment. They are not proud of the "privilege" of being protected by law like cripples. They would like to get rid of these privileges if they can, but they have to let pride take second place to the facts of life.</blockquote>Sometime, somewhere, their nation-building project had gone wrong, as Farish A. Noor said, <blockquote>This is Malaysia, remember: the same multi-culti country that has been run and governed by the same tired and worn-out coalition of ideologically bankrupt right-wing communitarian race and religious-based parties for half a century. Those fellow Malaysians who marched on Sunday are the children of a nation-building project that has failed utterly and miserably, and they merely reflect the racialised mindset of so many Malaysian politicians today who are no better.</blockquote>A quote from Erich Fromm may give a part of a hint to why the Bumiputra policy turns racist, (exchange the nationalism with race/religion bcoz there are parallels)<br><blockquote>Nationalism is our form of incest, is our idolatry, is our insanity. Patriotism is its cult. It should hardly be necessary to say, that by Â“patriotismÂ” <span style="font-style: italic;">I mean that attitude which puts the nation above humanity</span>, above the principles of truth and justice; not the loving interest in oneÂ‘s own nation, which is the concern with the nationÂ‘s spiritual as much as with its material welfare - never with its power over other nations.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Just as love for one individual which excludes the love for others is not love, love for oneÂ‘s country which is not part of oneÂ‘s love for humanity is not love, but idolatrous worship.</span></blockquote></div>
