            <div class='col-md body'><br>The Workers' Party has come out with its manisfesto. Even before the press has a chance to publish it the Government is coming down hard on it. As expected, the headlines - loud and alarming - are slanted in a manner to favour the Government.<br><br>Language, Religion and Money issues  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  - all these will be unabashedly stirred hard and fast; ostensibly to educate, remind, advise and even warn the people of the consequence of a bad choice of leadership. But there is another dimension that those in command will not say and that is, POLITICS. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>Housing, transport, daily commodities, medical, education, law.........and the list goes on. Are we happy with them all ? Of course the Government always have a reason for what they implement. Ultimately, they said, "it is for the good of the people".<br><br>Some of the policies by the Government are indeed good and beneficial to the masses, even at the expense of the opposition parties. However there are some that not only hurt their opposites but the bulk of the citizens. Some sweeteners during the election times are welcome but as they are few and far between, let us ask ourselves "What happens after election ?".<br><br>Any high handed attempts by the Government or the civil service to coerce or cow people into believing a few persons at the top are always right is an insult to Singaporeans and a disservice to democracy and civlisation as a whole.<br><br>Not every citizen can be depended upon to make a right choice but then not everything the Government of today do or say is right. If an individual chooses to elect a clown than a scholar that is HIS freedom to choose. Given the prevalent condition we are now in, we should trust the majority to vote wisely.<br><br>LET THE PEOPLE DECIDE and let the people live with their decisions. For the sake of Singapore, I hope the coming GE will be a free and fair election. <span style="color: red;">If there are mud slingings then be gentleman enough to receive as ghastly as you may give. </span><br></div>

In all of his 4 rebuttal points, his issue on the use of the president as a check on corruption and to hold the 2nd keys to the national reserves seemed to directly contrast the bureaucratic foot-dragging encountered by the late president Ong Teng Cheong.<br><br>Even <span style="color: red;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">one of their own </span></strong></span>could not perform this said task, try as he might.
