              <p>During a recent parliamentary session, PAP MP Ong Ah Heng from Yishun Central admitted quite frankly that he had sacked Singapore elderly workers and replaced them with foreigners in his constituency in his impassioned defence of foreigner workers:</p>
              </div>
              </div>
              <p><em>“I know of one family who complain the cleaners in their precinct are lazy and too old. They don’t want local workers who are old, they want young foreign workers. To satisfy the demand, I changed the local workers to foreign workers. Foreign workers are not a burden to us. Their presence here is not negative. Without foreign workers, things will be worse,”</em> he said.

              <p>Let us recall two elderly Singaporeans who are forced to work well into their twilight years because they cannot afford to retire.</p>
              <p>We leave readers to judge for themselves if they are really as “lazy and too old” as described by MP Ong Ah Heng:</p>

              <p><strong>Case #2: Struggles of a 76 year old Singapore street scavenger</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Prologue:</strong></p>
              <p>Zheng Jie Wo struggles to load another empty box onto her trolley. At 76, she is besieged by joint pain brought on by a life of hard work. She can barely push the trolley that she uses to collect Singapore’s discarded cardboard, cans and paper.</p>
              <p>“I still have to work even if it is painful. It hurts here in my joints and here to. I have got chronic arthritis.” Zheng has been living on the streets for about seven years.</p>

              <p>Then in the first place, why employ them, give them a golden life lah, i mean dun just go around once a year in CNY giving them NTUC left over foods and a small angpao and that's it. I think the hidden agenda here is to show people, look we give you job, but you cannot do it, so we employ foreigners, isn't it lame??? I got a 72yo ah soh do cleaning glasses and plates job for me and still going strong, we all encouraged her, help her, get her to join us in many gathering, and in return, she had never fail to turn up a single day unitil i told her that her leaves is too much, we can only accommodate 2 years of Annual leaves, so she went for 3 days leave, but on the 2nd days, she return, said that she dun mind work free...end up i paid her all her leaves just to get it clear, but i do it secretly just in case other employees know it.</p>
              <p>Now why enjoy her works here, because the environment create for her, old people like loyalty, trust and recognise, tho they may chat chat some nonsense like me, but they are good and experience peoples, just set the environment right, redesign their jobs to suit them, and they can really contribute to me, the society, the country and certainly, Productivity.</p>

              <p>Sure, the east absorbed the confucian theory of self and family first, and we are filial piety to our older generation. To us it is a sin not to do so. And because of our filial piety nature to old peoples, government are not worry about our older peoples, it is a political advantage to them that the citizens can take care of the older citizen by themsleves, unlike the west, where olds need lots of social welfare caring, which is a burden to the govt. Be it if you are Chinese, Malay, Indian or Bangala, the essence of filial piety exist not only in the society but also in religion. And that why PAP allow free religion in this country, because religion taught people to be discipline and care for the old, and that is good for the govt.</p>

              <p>PRC has a farm, a village to go back to, eat corn or farm the land with chickens and ducks to eat, what we got here is concrete here and there, if no money in Singapore, u are doom. Same to Malaysia and many other countries people, ours is very different, we got no kampong to balek to, so our old will dwell within us.</p>
              <p>Governing is an issue, the way govt educate the people, the way govt leviate the cost here, the way govt controlled the wages, the way govt stressed the population out also control the birthrate. The way govt promote the high standard of living also play a part in birthrate issue. Old age is not an issue if the production of youngs is there, but it is decreasing that is the issue.</p>
              <p>From the govt stand, simple, if the youngs are not there, and more old get retired, they will hve less revenue or so called TAX. And to cater to these increasing old, they will hv to put out more than the tax collected, leading to tax deficit.</p>

              <p>In Germany and many Western Countries, pension scheme helps majority of old folks to a good retirement. (actually, if one take up a pension scheme early in their career he/she will receive app 4K SGD per month plus 2 free airtickets for retirement. This is partly make possible from early company contribution, state welfare and self payment. Pension scheme in many countries, including PRC separate housing fund and retirement pension. In PRC as long as contribution are make monthly to an govern owned insurance company, they will receive app 600RMB monthly after age 55, Farmers are part of the scheme. The pension is significant considering most ppl live in countryside and do not need spending money. Even Japan has a payment and welfare system that pay from early saving of individual.</p>
              <p>We Singapore should not be deceived by our CPF schemethinking it will give us  sufficient money for retirement  as most of the money has gone to high HDB contribution and whatever left in the  special a/c etc will not be enought.</p>
              <p>Having the chance of working oversea mean that we are able to save a greater part of our salary as cost of living is low in PRC. (actually the saving is significant with the extremely low transportation, food , housing and medical cost). PRC standard of living is not lower than Spore although cost is low. Actually the quality of life is must better (although we miss the beautiful gardens and clean environment). We can buy BM car at 50K SGD, company paid housing,maid not more than SGD 100 month. PRC has 2--3 long public holidays that stretched for week  allowing us regular returns to Sg. Some companies give home leave bte 20-45 days a year. No matter more and more Sg will leave Spore for elsewhere. </p>

              <p>I think basically, in term of old age fund system, it goes by differently from Country to Country, comparing is alway an envy that will turn hatre in no time. One way or the other, someone have to put money into the fund, saving or insurance just to get the return. As said, there is no free lunch in this world, and certainly not in Singapore. 4k in sing dollars is nothing in Germany with regard to their cost of living there, and yet all these countries personal taxation are much much higher than in Singapore, we have the see the whole picture, gather the right information and do proper study on it. I not saying you are wrong in comparing, but you got to compare an apple to an apple, not an apple with a water melon.</p>
              <p>Like or not, our CPF had alway been the envy of many countries, and alot of countries from Africa to China are sending study mission here to learn from us, MPF in Malaysia fail miserably, so is IRF, indonesia retiring funds, it cannot function at all, but both these countries can talk big about their aging funds, and if you across those sea and straits to talk to their old folks, you can the true story. Many learned our framework of CPF, went back and can do nothing in their own countries, because their companies are not willing to contribute, their govt are not willing to adminstrate a system like this, all they want is fast cash and quick hit and run. Corruption is another issue in these countries that make their retiring funds system a total diseaster. Yes, i would said that in Europe or the West, where they got welfare funds and retirement funds more or less in place, but their taxation is so high that lead to most didn't want to work, and rather take welfare funds, some people said to me Aussies are lazy people, i said no, because the tax is so high, they rather take the welfare funds  than work. And if you think the West government are in flavor of scrapping the welfare funds, yes they are, but whoever govt did it must be get ready to get bombarded by it citizens.</p>
              <p>Life is not about going another place and enjoy the life there, life is about home, your birthplace, giving a chance everyone will love to be back in their homeland, a foreigner working here will love to go back home too, but because of earning a living, he/she sacrificed his/her home. With no doubt, every singaporeans working outside of singapore, tho may hv garden or cheaper BM, they will miss Singapore greatly. As a taiwanese, i also miss my village up in the mountain of taichong Mei Shan.</p>
              <p>And finally, there is a huge different btw having a garden in Singapore and in PRC, or even owning a BM. When I drove our BM into malaysia, that car plate with  SJ.....command more respect.</p>
