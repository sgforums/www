            <div class='col-md body'>Hey people, I'd love to hear your opinions on this matter.<br>I feel that the harmful effects of Marijuana are not fully known, in the sense that doctors cannot find any problems caused by marijuana except for obvious ones such as lung problems cancer and such which is commonplace for all plant ingested by smoking this can mean it can be potentially beneficial in capsule form. I am aware that HIV and cancer patients or terminally ill people take marijuana as an anti-depressant. It helps HIV patients to regain some of their appetite, as loss of appetite is the most common catalyst of AIDS related death. Another point to note is that some people believe marijuana keeps people complacent and encourages people to slack at home, increase crime rate etc. However i do not see the problem of this even if marijuana is legalised this is because currently more addictive drugs are sold over the counter and you do not see the abuse and increase in crime rates. And perhaps legalising it will discourage people from a life of crime.I am not a Marijuana advocate and i do not smoke i just want serious views on this matter. i want to educate myself on this controversial subject. Cheers!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The UK government considered it and actually downgraded it to a Class C drug, all but legalizing it. However, they have a re-think now based on scientific data linking it to psychiatric disease and addiction.<br><br>'An appreciable proportion of cannabis users report short-lived adverse effects, including psychotic states following heavy consumption, and regular users are at risk of dependence. People with major mental illnesses such as schizophrenia are especially vulnerable in that cannabis generally provokes relapse and aggravates existing symptoms. Health workers need to recognise, and respond to, the adverse effects of cannabis on mental health.'The British Journal of Psychiatry (2001) 178: 116-122<br><br>Research by J Van Os et al. at the University of Maastricht in the Netherlands, Cannabis use and psychosis: a longitudinal population-based study (2002), confirmed that cannabis is associated with later schizophrenia and that this is not explained by predromal symptoms. It was estimated that lack of exposure to cannabis would have reduced the incidence of psychosis requiring treatment by as much as 50%.<br><br>I think there are more pertinent issues with the government than legalizing a drug which may lead to more psychiatric patients on the streets.<br><br></div>

There is a maximum penalty of up to 2 years' imprisonment for illegal possession of a class C drug but in practice very few are actually jailed. It is said that nearly 3/4 of fines are Â£50 or less. In comparison, the maximum penalty for possesion of a controlled drug in Singapore is 10 years' imprisonment.<br><br>Alcohol, on the other hand, is a legal product.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>NO WAY.<br><br>Even if marijuana is a 'low-risk' drug in terms of side-effects, most marijuana addicts go on to try 'hard' drugs like cocaine and heroin when they realise that they're not getting the required 'high' after prolonged use.<br><br>I didn't make this up - studies have shown that this is the case. I don't have the exact study right here right now, but I do remember reading about them.<br><br>And don't tell me that the marijuana addicts have the right to do what they want with their lives - try telling that to the broken families of such addicts. Try telling that to the poor woman who was stabbed after she refused to give her son money for some pot. Try telling that to the little kid who was brutally maimed when his drug-crazed daddy got home and became enraged at the withdrawal symptoms after his last fix.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>there are also many cases of abuse to innocents due to the alcohol problem. why then is alcohol still legal. granted the fact that the severity of the subject varies. however marijuana has the exact same effect on people. that is the impairment of senses and judgment. this poses a threat no more than alcohol. marijuana should be legalised to destroy the black market and at the same time it provides tax revenue for the country instead of wasting money on policing drug abuse heavily. with legalisation of marijuana the prices will go down and people will not see the need to get them illegally and the crime rates will go down as people do not have to rob/kill/steal or commit crimes to obtain these substances. i feel that due to the heavy stigma on marijuana the government has only made known the bad effects of marijuana and not the medical benefits. marijuana is psychoactive because it stimulates certain brain receptors, but it does not produce toxins that kill them (like alcohol), and it does not wear them out as other drugs may. There is no evidence that marijuana use causes brain damage. Studies performed on actual human populations will confirm these results, even for chronic marijuana users (up to 18 joints per day) after many years of use. In reality, marijuana has the effect of slightly increasing alpha-wave activity in your brain. Alpha waves are generally associated with meditative and relaxed states, which are, in turn, often associated with human creativity. long term marijuana use can cause dependency but that is the same with cigarettes isn't it?
