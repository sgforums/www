I actually met a fillipina lady who've worked as a maid in Singapore before, she told me the conditions were terrible, like she was in a prison, that Singaporeans were rude and seemed to have this disdain for fillipinos, she now works as an au pair in Canada, with an employer given vehicle to drive her charges around, wages more than 7 times her pay in Singapore, and she gets treated with dignity (that's fodder for another thread there too) ...<br><br>yes, they'll keep coming, but what you'll get are not talents, but "talents" ... the truly wretched from third world shitholes that have nothing to lose ... do you think that's a good situation ? ...<br><br>as for your salaries observation, that's a shrewd one .... perhaps that's what happening right now, but hey, you know what, it's something that's happening all over the world too ... I just rejected a job offer in Canada, cos I got to know that I was being offered C$12000 a year less than a Canadian classmate of mine who got hired by the same company ... why would they take away jobs from Canadians in the first place ? ... cos they can get someone to do it cheaper of course ...<br><br>The Halcyon days of our boom years are over, no employer is going to pay some chap without much qualifications 5K a month in Singapore when they can hire 10 Master degree holders at the same price in China or India ... there are millions and millions of people who are hungry enough, who have never tasted the good life that we have, who are willing to accept a lot less ...<br><br>China graduated 25million people from her universities last year, and her economy had the capacity to only absorb 10% of them (statistic courtesy of the new york times, pay for the archive and search for it) ... that's several times more than the population of Singapore ! ... I sometimes wonder why companies would still invest in Singapore at all, given the abundance of cheap, skilled, and talented labour elsewhere ... perhaps the Singaporean worker still gives good value compared to many parts of the world ... salary levels are not set by the goverment, but dictated by market economics, you can bitch and whine and hold out for a higher salary, while watching jobs sail away to the yellow sea (or the indian ocean) ... or you can ride the wave ....<br><br>but say it's not about FTs but about FWs, fine ... maids and construction workers and road sweepers aside, FWs have traditionally been a part of our economy anyways ... look at our electronics industry, our manufacturing industry ... if not for the legions of Johoreans crossing the causeway every single day, where would we be ? ... would you rather a factory relocate to malaysia all together, or up the FW cap and let half the factory be staffed by FWs, but we Singaporeans would still get 50% of the jobs ? ... the cynics have been saying that, hey ! ... it's the goverment that benefits in taxes of course ... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> ...  but think of my example again ....<br><br></div>
