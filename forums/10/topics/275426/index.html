            <div class='col-md body'>Eight US troops charged with murder of Iraqi man<br><br>For the second time in a week, murder charges are filed against US troops.<br>By Tom Regan  | csmonitor.com<br><br>The US Marine Corps has charged seven marines and a Navy medic with the murder of a disabled Iraqi man, Hashim Awad, in Hamandiya, a Sunni village about 50 miles west of Baghdad near the Abu Ghraib prison.<br><br>The BBC reports that the men have also been charged with kidnapping and conspiracy, according to a Marine spokesman at Camp Pendleton, California, where the men are being held.<br><br>The Hamandiya investigation has been examining claims a man was deliberately killed on 26 April in the town in central Iraq.<br><br>The accused are alleged to have taken the 52-year-old victim from his house, shot him and then left a rifle and shovel by his body to make it appear as if he were an insurgent planting a roadside bomb.<br><br>The spokesman said all men were presumed innocent, and it would be up to military officials to decide what punishment they would face if convicted in a court martial. The men could face the death penalty if they are found guilty.<br><br>In an interview with Knight Ridder published earlier this month, Mr. Awad's family and friends said he had told them that marines stationed in the area had asked him several times to be an informant and to find out who was planting explosives in the village. Each time, they say, he refused.<br><br>On the morning of April 3, Awad's family says marines arrived at the door and pulled him outside. Less than an hour later, gunshots were heard and when the family went outside next morning, they found a freshly dug hole about 500 yards from their home, splattered with blood and littered with plastic gloves. Earlier, the marines had taken Awad's body to the local police and said they had found him digging a hole for explosives, and killed him.<br><br>The Associated Press reports that four other men were also initially brought back to Pendleton as part of the investigation into the Hamandiya incident, but they have been returned to duty at the camp pending further investigation.<br><br>The Boston Globe reports that Wednesday's announcement was the second time this week that murder charges have been filed against US troops in Iraq.<br><br>On Monday, the Army brought charges of premeditated murder against three soldiers for allegedly killing three Iraqi civilians who had been rounded up during a sweep of a suspected insurgent hide-out on May 9 north of Baghdad. The defendants were also accused of threatening to kill a fellow soldier if he revealed details to investigators.<br><br>Separately yesterday, the military in Iraq announced that murder charges had been filed against a fourth Army soldier in connection to the May 9 killings. The Army charged Specialist Juston R. Graber, 20, of the 101st Airborne Division, with premeditated murder and several lesser charges.<br><br>The Los Angeles Times reports that since the war in Iraq started in March of 2003, 30 US troops have been charged with "wrongfully killing Iraqis" with at least nine being convicted. The Hamandiya shooting is the first time charges have been filed against marines in Iraq. Officials also say that more marines "have apparently been charged in this case than in any previous wartime killing in the service's history."<br><br>The charges now go to the military equivalent of a civilian grand jury or preliminary hearing. Based on what happens at the so-called Article 32 hearing, [Lt. Gen. John F. Sattler, commanding general of US Marine Corps Forces Central Command], or his successor, will decide whether the case should go to a court-martial. Defense attorneys plan to challenge the tactics used by Naval Criminal Investigative Service investigators, said Maj. Haytham Faraj, who represents Thomas. Some of the defendants were threatened that they might face the death penalty at trial unless they talked to investigators, defense attorneys said.<br><br>"Our position is that there was a lot of information that was coerced," said Faraj, who added that his client, who was on his third tour in Iraq, was "an outstanding Marine, doing his job, leading his men."<br><br>Defense attorneys will also argue that Awad's family members "concocted the story" in an attempt to get more money from US authorities for his death.<br><br>The North County Times, which serves the area in California near Camp Pendleton, reported Wednesday that money and messages of support for the eight US troops have been coming from around the nation. But some long-established support groups are staying away from the case because it is "so politically charged."<br><br>The Globe and Mail of Toronto reports that the two incidents mentioned above, and a third one in Haditha where charges may also be filed soon against US troops in the deaths of 24 Iraqi civilians, come at a "tumultuous moment" for the new government in Iraq and the US, and could undermine gains in other areas.<br><br>This month's killing of Al Qaeda in Iraq leader Abu Musab al-Zarqawi has been hailed by some as a turning point in defeating the insurgency. But the crucial battle for Iraqi "hearts and minds," by both the new government and the 130,000-plus U.S. troops in the country, could be severely set back by three sets of courts-martial involving elite units accused of murdering civilians. The "few bad apples" assertion applied to the handful of reservists who abused Iraqis in Abu Ghraib prison was unpersuasive to many in the Arab world. Premeditated murder by front-line troops or the killing of battlefield detainees will be regarded as war crimes.<br><br></div>
