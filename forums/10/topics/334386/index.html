              <p>Last 3 days, i was in India with a friend. To my amazement, its much more cosmopolitan and develeoped than 10 years ago.the women especially have progressed nicely and evenly with their western counterparts. More fashionable, tech savy and mordernistic dressing.To me a society can be judged by the progress of their women. This hold true especially in India, ironically a country known for its discriminatory treatment of females.</p>
              <p>During our conversation ( my friend who is indian too) says that these days there are lot of graduate women in india who are crossing country boundaries to marry indian men overseas in countries like US, Australia, Europe and Singapore.</p>
              <p>He says they are much more willing to marry  a sg indian males, take care of a family but yet still remain modern and cosmopolitan in outlook.</p>
              <p>Compare this with our own local women, though not only in India but in other asian countries, ours have degenerated to sour grapes and left on the shelves to their expiry date. Imo, it reflects on our society as well, our progress and everything else tied in. Women in a country which was supposedly backwards 10 years ago, has far surpassed singapore in terms of aethestics in the same time period.</p>
              <p>Although singapore is a comparatively richer nation, my friend agrees that it not conducive to start a family nor have a love life due to the social mechanisms in place by the government. Is there a need to review this issue of social outlook in singapore?</p>

              <p>Actually the reason's pretty simple, Singapore's a service industry.</p>
              <p>In a service industry, women would find it much easier to land jobs as they are deemed less threatening than man and they are more empathic(more thoughful in other words) compared to males.</p>
              <p>It includes</p>
              <ul>
              <li><a title="Real estate" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate">Real estate</a></li>

              <li><a title="Hospitality industry" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospitality_industry">Hospitality industry</a> (e.g. <a title="Restaurant" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restaurant">restaurants</a>, <a title="Hotel" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel">hotels</a>, <a title="Casino" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casino">casinos</a>)</li>

              </ul>
              <p>Such jobs also have a much better pay scale, compared to production and R&amp;D type of jobs which tend to be male dominated.</p>
              <p>Thus local women on the average have access to a better salary as compared to local men. This in turn makes them much more picky, especially when they want a man who has a comparable or better pay than them. </p>
              <p>It doesn't help that that local women wants a man that can treat them both as a woman and as an equal. Plus he needs to look good, dress nice and have access to car and private property.</p>
              <p>Men, well. All we want is a nice body and a submissive character. Heh.</p>

              <p>India-born Indians are the most egoistic, judgemental, snobbish and selfish people you'll ever meet.</p>
              <p>India women marry sg Indian men? Are you kidding me? That's only caste-crazy families that want brides of the same caste. These people will hire brokers aka pimps to fix an arranged marriage. Connect the dots...</p>
              <p>Last time the gahmen promote the indian male expats to marry the sg indian women due to lack of grooms. Since many indian guys were marrying outside.</p>
              <p>And their accent is a bloody turn off.</p>

              <p>Last 3 days, i was in India with a friend. To my amazement, its much more cosmopolitan and develeoped than 10 years ago.the women especially have progressed nicely and evenly with their western counterparts. More fashionable, tech savy and mordernistic dressing.To me a society can be judged by the progress of their women. This hold true especially in India, ironically a country known for its discriminatory treatment of females.</p>

              <p><br>Of course if you're going to a metropolitan city like Delhi, Bombay, Calcutta in the Northern area then obviously you're going to witness a pulpable difference in terms of modernity. Since these places are the epitome of India's development. But that does'nt reflect on the entire population. You're just seeing one side of it. Its a mask, all the tight jeans wearing and well carried women are mostly from well to do families who have relatives that live abroad and help them keep up with the times.</p>
              <p>Theres more to India then that. And the other side is very ugly...</p>
              <p>You obviously expected people with oil dripping off their heads and wearing very ethnic clothing. But got a shock when you landed and saw how contradicting the reality was to your imagination.</p>
              <p>Its misleading to judge an entire nation thats a billion strong, based on urbanised cities that houses the cream of the crop who hail from aristrocratic families.</p>

              <p>Very Odd indeed, local guys here like to talk among themselves about local gals, eventually, they start to talk about Foreign gals in comparing with local gals, but they failed to know that the local gals they are talking about are their mothers, aunties, sisters and even gal friends/colleagues.</p>
              <p>In my Opinon, if local guys feel that foreign gals are better in term of shape, submissive, sexy etc etc, by all means, please go ahead and marry foreign gals. But please stop critising us, it's unfair to give critics  about your Mom, sisters, aunties and friends when we as gals also dun bother if you married a foreign gals or gays.</p>
              <p>Yes, we are much highly paid and educated, is that wrong??? And if you guys feel that you cannot match us, so be it, you guys like to look down on yourself, we can't do much. But please dun use this failure in your of looking yourself down as a tool to blame us.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Go ahead, go marry Foreign gals, give babies..We wish u all the best.</p>
