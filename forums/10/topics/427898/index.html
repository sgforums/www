              <p>Personally, I don't trust any SAF general to lead our country. This guy 
              spend 24 years in Guards and Army. What does he know about economics, 
              foreign relation, education, etc? He probably is better suited to 
              'chiong sua' and dig holes in the ground.<br> <br> I am not comfortable at the close links between SAF and PAP. But then, 
              this guy seems like the best out of the new candidates. TPL definitely 
              should not be PM.</p>
              <p><br>Just my personal opinion as a small fry. I'm just a PTE (first class).</p>

              <p><strong><span style="font-size: large;">COULD TAN CHUAN-JIN BE OUR NEXT PRIME MINISTER?</span></strong><br> <br> By Cheryl Chan<br> <br> Political Correspondent<br> <br> <br> Brigadier-General (NS) Tan Chuan-Jin is what some might call a 
              ‘blue-eyed boy’ – he was a recipient of the prestigious SAF Overseas 
              Scholarship, has two Master’s Degrees (one from King’s College London 
              and another from the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy) and enjoyed a
               stellar career in the Singapore Armed Forces before retiring to don the
               white of the PAP.<br> <br> During his 24 years of military service, BG Tan led the SAF’s relief 
              efforts in Meulaboh, Aceh after the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, an 
              experience he has described in vivid detail in numerous interviews with 
              the press. He was also the Chairman of the NDP Exco in 2009, where he 
              pioneered the unique ‘Pledge Moment’ concept (where all Singaporeans 
              said the pledge in unison at 8.22 pm no matter where they were). He 
              recalls the Pledge Moment as one of the most poignant memories of his 
              long and decorated military career.<br> <br> <br> More than that, however, BG Tan has a track record of earning the 
              respect of those serving under him, as many of his former subordinates 
              in the SAF will readily attest.<br> <br> Indeed, BG Tan has been practising what he preaches. He has been 
              pounding the campaign trail in Marine Parade GRC, where he has been 
              introduced as a new PAP candidate. He has been sharing his reflections 
              and thoughts following his conversations with residents during block 
              visits on his blog.<br> <br> So far, he has been received well by the public, with many people 
              praising his humility, civic-mindedness and passion for public service.<br> <br> “He looks like he is a good man, a good candidate, very intelligent but 
              also very warm,” shared Mdm Lim Gim Hua, a 69-year-old housewife who 
              lives in Kaki Bukit, which falls under Marine Parade GRC.<br> <br> Even voters who have reservations about some of BG Tan’s potential GRC 
              team mates have come out to voice their support. Mr Gerald Heng, a 
              Marine Parade resident, posted the following message on BG Tan’s 
              Facebook wall:<br> <br> “Assuming that there is a contest in the GRC, and there is an upset, I 
              will be very unhappy for the GRC to lose a fine man like you because of 
              her (Ms Tin Pei Ling).”<br> <br> It is understood that BG Tan is already rated very highly by the PAP 
              leadership. He is one of five new PAP candidates who are thought to be 
              of “minister calibre” by the party. The other candidates are 
              Major-General (NS) Chan Chun Sing, Heng Swee Keat, Ong Ye Kung and 
              Lawrence Wong. However, it would appear that of the five names 
              mentioned, BG Tan has proven to be most popular with the general public.<br> <br> If BG Tan manages to build on his high approval rating thus far, he 
              could potentially inject fresh impetus into the PAP and help to win over
               some of the party’s detractors. He could be the candidate to 
              reinvigorate the party’s image and help it connect with a younger 
              generation of voters which has been variously described as apathetic, 
              cynical and spoilt.<br> <br> And if he can succeed in doing this, he will be able to command the 
              respect of the public – which would stand him in very good stead to 
              become Singapore’s next Prime Minister.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>2) Shammugam - given more and more responsibilities. promoted direct from backbencher to minister. now in charge of Home Affairs (formerly under WKS). But can Singaporeans accept minority PM?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3) BG Tan Chuan Jin - see above article</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>4) MG Chan Chun Sing - same profile, former COA, ex-RI boy, people seem to like him</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>5) Heng Swee Keat - LHL said that he was 'minister calibre'</p>

              <p>i feel that we should have a clear separation between politics and uniformed organisation.</p>
              <p>the operation of the army should be dictated by the politicians, instead of converting army men into politicians.</p>
              <p>they should stay and focus on their main career, which is what they have been groomed for all their in their entire career: to defend the country against military threats, and nothing more.</p>
              <p>holding high ranks in the armed forces (even when "retired", they still retain their NS rank), and at the same time serving term as a key appointment holder. e.g. minister of defence, home affairs etc, who is to stop them if they abuse their powers?</p>

              <p>They are already abusing their powers. I have heard that before the gold coast became popular in the 70s....the Lees were already given wind of developments there. And they made such windfalls from property investments there.</p>
              <p>What else...what about the white horse shit? LKY created it to protect his freaking children.</p>
