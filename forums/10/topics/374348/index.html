              <p><strong>This brings a new meaning to "coffee money". <br> Is MAS aware of this? <br> Has this got anything to do with the current surge in property investment from South Asian buyers?</strong></p>
              <p>http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/news/city/lucknow/Now-counterfeit-dollars-flood-Indian-market/articleshow/4969502.cms</p>
              <p><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>The Times Of India, 4 Sep 2009</strong></span><br> <br> BAHRAICH: <span style="color: red;"><strong>Pakistan government printing press print counterfeit Indian currency (CFIC) besides US, Singaporean and Australian dollars and sell them at half the face value in Indian and Nepalese markets and other countries. </strong></span><br> <br> This sensitive disclosure has been made by Pakistani agent Vikki
              Manihar, son of Majid Manihar, to police. Vikki, who is on police
              remand after his arrest on Sunday, also said that Indian customs and
              police officers deployed along the Indo-Nepal border are involved in
              the counterfeit dollar racket.<br> <br> Counterfeit Indian currency is sold using codes like `chappal' (sleeper), while<span style="font-size: medium;"><strong> Singaporean dollar goes as `kafi' (coffee)</strong></span>, Australian dollar as `machchli' (fish) and American dollar as `achar' (pickle), Vikki reportedly told his interrogators.<br> <br> "There is a big demand for counterfeit dollars in Mumbai, Kolkata,
              Chennai, Banglore and New Delhi besides Chandigarh, which is met by
              Pakistani agents operating from Nepal. The demand in fake currency has
              also overtaken the illegal weapons trade which has seen a slump
              following decline in Maoist activities,'' a senior police officer told
              TOI preferring anonymity.<br> <br> Moreover, due to strict measures initiated by the Indian government and
              increase in awareness among the public, the demand for Indian
              counterfeit currency (ICFC) too has shown a decline. However,
              counterfeit dollar is selling like hot cake with markets flourishing in
              places like Shrawasti, Agra and Varanasi of Uttar Pradesh. <br> <br> Influential persons operating from Nepal are behind the entire trade in
              counterfeit currency, Vikki reportedly told his interrogators. Security
              agencies deployed on the porous Indo-Nepal border say that though these
              persons have direct link with the ISI-backed Dawood Ibrahim cartel,
              there is no concrete proof about their involvement. This, despite the
              fact that 90 percent of the CFIC printed in Pakistani government
              presses reaches India via Nepal.<br> <br> Indian security agencies maintain that they have details of the routes
              used for channelling the CFIC and the operators, but any effective
              action could only be taken after their backers in Nepal are neutralised.<br> <br> The greatest problem Indian security agencies are facing is the
              involvement of petty smugglers and couriers operating along the
              Indo-Nepal border. "Though we have been able to apprehend a number of
              small-time smugglers, not much could be achieved as big operators and
              their backers are sitting pretty across the border,'' a senior police
              official told TOI.<br> <br> Uttar Pradesh additional director general (ADG) Anti-Terrorist Squad
              (ATS) A K Jain told TOI that Vikki has confessed that his father Majid
              Manihar was involved in smuggling of fake currency since long. He was a
              trusted lieutenant of Dawood and used to get CFIC consignments from him
              directly. <br> <br> ----------------------<br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>Latest update @ Singaporenewsalternative.blogspot.com<br> <br> 1.

              <p>If you read mainstream media news without ever questioning, all of the above is true. Don't even get me started on terrorism, go do some research and try digging for the truth on 9/11 and the "war on terror". </p>
              <p>You can start here http://911truth.org/article.php?story=20041221155307646</p>
              <p>Many events point to some kind of government involvement and makes one wonder "war on terror" is legit.</p>

              <p>Should a clueless Indian villager or Nepalese be caught at Changi Airport with the counterfeit money, what are the implications?</p>
