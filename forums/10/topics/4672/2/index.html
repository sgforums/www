            <div class='col-md body'>This suggestion from the Malaysian Colonel has long already been thought of by the Singaporean govt. Why do you think SM Lee started buying water from Indonesia when he was the PM, and now GCT wants to build desalination plants to obtain water from the sea rather than relying solely on the neighbouring countries to do the right thing.<br><br>SAF battle doctrines also ensure that in the event of unthinkable, eg. war against Malaysia (God forbid), SAF is to strike very quickly deep into Johor to secure the water source.

And majority of singaporeans are chinese. end of story. I don't ever experience or hear malays or indians saying bad things about malaysia or malaysians, it is always the chinese ppl, including LKY himself, remember somewhere in 96/97 when LKY said some bad things abt Malaysia which made PM Mahathir to mad?<br><br>So chinese ppl, please, do not insult our neighbours, just because you are not malays. The whole of singapore is not like u ppl. And please remember, that Singaporeans=chinese, malays, indians, etc, NOT SINGAPOREANS=CHINESE ONLY! Wake up ur idea.<br><br>And for all these yrs, chinese ppl have always harbour thoughts that they are the superior race than the rest, looking down on banglas working singapore (i always notice these despisable chinese folks who close their notrils each time the bus they take go thru little india, and many many more).<br><br>one day, u guys will fall on ur knees begging for ur own lives from these ppl who u look down so much.<br><br>I am not a racist. I am stating facts which i have observed and gathered over the yrs about chinese behaviour in Singapore. I am mixed, not malay, not indian, not chinese. I have 90% chinese frens, and yes, even my bestfren is a chinese. I speak mandarin, and that's why it is so easy to pick up the true thinking of the chinese ppl in singapore. it is very sickening. sometimes, i just wish these chinese ppl would just go back to where they come from: China! (does not apply to those chinese who do not look down on other races)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sorry that I'd MISSED my part of the say. In my opinion, it doesn't really directly matter now as to which of the country is holding a more SUPERIOR military position... Perhaps not even in terms of 'water poisoning' issue.... The BASIC ideas are there.... When a bullet fly across the sky, rest assure the other party won't just sit down there and do nothing about it.... Same with water supply... For now it's a BILATERAL flow.... No saying who can poison who.....<br><br>But the MAIN POINT I would like to make here is the BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP between Singapore and Malaysia.... Some Malaysians may have this anti-Singaporean mentality... So do some Singaporeans in reverse OR respond.... But as much as we are a COMPETITOR to Malaysia, we're NO tumour to them..... And WISE men have this SIMPLE CONCEPT.... CONSERVE and RESERVE.... Why would Malaysia wanna hit on us if they're NOT gonna have anything to gain out of it...? Wasting their resources and energy..? RISK having someone to strike back at them...? Though Singapore MAY not be so big as a threat to Malaysia... BUT our relationship is DEFINITELY CLOSE.... Having us DESTROYED at the end of the day NOT ONLY would waste their resources... It may also mean some unimaginable 'side-effects' to them indirectly... And imagine having an ENEMY to get back at them at this kinda time...? BAD MOVE....<br><br>I THINK... PERHAPS when the two men sat down to talk about our water-treaty, they were enjoying their cup of hot coffee or tea.... Very RELAXED form... (In a sense..?) At least at that moment.... One party might have reminded the other party that, IF a negotiation cannot be struck.... Or WORSE STILL, a WAR is to break out..... They won't be enjoying their coffee there.... IN FACT, both of them would be VERY much MORE TENSE and BUSY... And at times like this... One would always wish to move FOWARD.... NOT BACKWARD....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I doubt Singaporeans are really anti-malaysian in heart.  Face it, lots of us have relatives in M'sia, and we really do enjoy taking holiday trips to M'sia.  Malaysians probably enjoy visiting Singapore during their vacations too.  Sure there have been troubled times.  Times when bilateral relations were at an all time low.  Disagreements and quarrels are part and parcel of neighbourly relations, and should not be inflated into conflict.  Accusations only make the matters worse.  And I feel that sure_or_not should really refrain from accusing your Chinese countrymen of "Racism."  The Singapore government has made everything equal for us.  Equal job opportunities, equal education chances and equal standards of living.  The government really doesnt favour anybody due to their skin color.  It only favours people who have the ability to do things, to get the job done.  What this foolish colonel in the MAF said, is now just another forgotten page in history.  I don't feel it should be brought up anymore.  We do not advance by dwelling on the past.</div>
