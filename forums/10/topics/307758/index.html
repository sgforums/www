              <p>The PAP's Internet Counter-Insurgents Squad led by Ng Eng Yen and Baey
              Yam Keng has fast become a pest, not just a nuisance to the cyber
              community. Judging from the strong reactions given to the recent events
              involving theonlinecitizen.com (TOC), the whole effort of the PAP's
              Counter-Insurgents Squad has back-fired on them very badly.<br> <br> The Wayang King, so self-named as wayangkingsg at the Sammyboy.com's
              Alfresco Coffee Shop (SBF), is at the centre of storm involving TOC.
              For those who have dealt with him before, he comes across as a member
              of the PAP's Counter-Insurgents Squad, operating out of the National
              Health Group.</p>
              <p>He has assumed a variety of online anonymous identities
              at SBF, such as thinknothing, thinkpeople, Mihailov75, mehailov75,
              samster005, samstor005, razari, kevansg, Firdaus77, jacy_, jacys_,

              MaryKwan, etc., most of them have been banned.<br> <br> For the regular forummers of SBF, they would remember that this Wayang
              King has been notorious in impersonating other opposition parties'
              figures, such as Perry Tong, Low Thia Khiang, and Sebastian Teo at SBF,
              causing a stir in the local newspapers in Singapore. When he was caught
              red-handed for impersonating Perry Tong, he cunningly assumed another
              identity in the name of Bernard Soh (using a login name hongrui1982) to
              post a letter of apology.<br> <br> With a history like this, it is not difficult to digest the recent events and who is behind them.<br> <br> From all the evidences available, it is without a shadow of doubt that
              this Wayang King signed off as Jasper to post the first message on
              05/02/2008 at singabloodypore (singabloodypore.rsfblog.org):<br> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://singabloodypore.rsfblog.org/archive/2008/02/04/singapore-s-shame.html">http://singabloodypore.rsfblog.org/archive/2008/02/04/singapore-s-shame.html</a><br> <br> He was caught subsequently by soci to impersonate Andrew Loh to post a
              message on 06/02/2008 challenging Jasper at singabloodypore.rsfblog.org:<br> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://singabloodypore.rsfblog.org/archive/2008/02/12/baseless-malicious-hogwash-no-more.html">http://singabloodypore.rsfblog.org/archive/2008/02/12/baseless-malicious-hogwash-no-more.html</a><br> <br> So the netizens have been taken a free ride by the Wayang King without
              knowing that they have been watching a wayang show conducted by
              wayangparty (wayangparty.wordpress.com).<br> <br> With this in mind, there is a possibility that the second Jasper is
              also a clone of wayangparty used to further discredit TOC by posting a
              message on 07/02/2008 at singabloodypore.<br> <br> It becomes clear that why an anonymous Jasper would bother to set up a
              blog (jasperwee.wordpress.com) for the sole purpose of attacking TOC if
              he is not a member of the PAP's Internet Counter-Insurgents Squad.<br> <br> Once we know that Jasper and wayangparty are the same person belonging
              to the PAP's Internet Counter-Insurgents Squad, his malicious act of
              disinformation and attacks on TOC and Workers' Party can be easily seen!<br> <br> What the Wayang King did not expect is that his whole self-conducted
              wayang show has back-fired on the PAP's Internet Counter-Insurgents
              Squad very badly and discredited himself completely!</p>

              (singabloodypore.rsfblog.org):<br> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://singabloodypore.rsfblog.org/archive/2008/02/04/singapore-s-shame.html">http://singabloodypore.rsfblog.org/archive/2008/02/04/singapore-s-shame.html</a><br> <br> He was caught subsequently by soci to impersonate Andrew Loh to
              post a message on 06/02/2008 challenging Jasper at
              singabloodypore.rsfblog.org:<br> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://singabloodypore.rsfblog.org/archive/2008/02/12/baseless-malicious-hogwash-no-more.html">http://singabloodypore.rsfblog.org/archive/2008/02/12/baseless-malicious-hogwash-no-more.html</a><br> <br> So the netizens have been taken a free ride by the Wayang King
              without knowing that they have been watching a wayang show
              conducted by wayangparty (wayangparty.wordpress.com).<br> <br> With this in mind, there is a possibility that the second Jasper is
              also a clone of wayangparty used to further discredit TOC by
              posting a message on 07/02/2008 at singabloodypore.<br> <br> It becomes clear that why an anonymous Jasper would bother to set
              up a blog (jasperwee.wordpress.com) for the sole purpose of
              attacking TOC if he is not a member of the PAP's Internet
              Counter-Insurgents Squad.<br> <br> Once we know that Jasper and wayangparty are the same person
              belonging to the PAP's Internet Counter-Insurgents Squad, his
              malicious act of disinformation and attacks on TOC and Workers'
              Party can be easily seen!<br> <br> What the Wayang King did not expect is that his whole
              self-conducted wayang show has back-fired on the PAP's Internet
              Counter-Insurgents Squad very badly and discredited himself
              completely!</p>

              <p>i do not support people impersonating others with motive to give others a bad name. it is the most cowardly act beyond description.</p>
              <p>to protect myself, i must say, what is said is 'in-general' and i am not saying who is impersonating who. in fact, if a person repeatedly impersonates, its so easy to plant a trap and wait for him to login and talk rots in an internet forum and capture him!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i hope using net tracking technologies or employ skilled people to capture such crooks red-handed and present all evidence to court in an international court. u know i meaning righted? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>

              <p>2... he is anti PAP, and is doing a reverse psychology by impersonating as a PAP dog.</p>
              <p>the 1st possibilities is low.. given that PAP does not accept sub genius level members... and lets not even mention those that belong to the sub normal IQ.</p>
              <p>2nd possibilities is higher... but then again... we might end up finding a 12 year old kid behind the keyboard...</p>
