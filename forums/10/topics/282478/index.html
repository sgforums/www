The retirement age was constantly changed from Age 55 to Age 60, then moved to Age 65.<br><br>The present Annuity Scheme is a master stroke that do not require any payout, but take from every Singaporean a sum of $10,000 that will not be returned.<br><br>With an estimated population of 2,000,000 Singapore Citizen workers, and 1,000,000 foreigners - the government will pocket $30,000,000,000 at a single stroke of the pen to sign this scheme into legislation.<br><br>This is enough to cover all the holes that this MIW government has created from Shin Corp to Suzhou.<br><br>If this scheme is not another obvious act of breaking a promise given to Singaporeans since 1957 - what other acts is more obvious ?<br></span><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>1)   They claimed that out of 200 persons, 1 will live beyond 85. That means 200 is going to contribute into the pool. If each person contribute $5000 (which LHL said) into the pool, you have $1,00,000. So how much is this lucky 1 person who out live 85, going to receive from the pool? Is he going to live till 100? Even if he lives to 100, how much is he going to collect from the pool on a monthly basis? Assuming he receives $500 per month for 15 years, he collected $90,000. The surplus will be $910,000.<br><br>2)   Since this money goes into the pool, there is no owner. Who then will manage it?<br><br>This is like a saving banks for the gahmen...
