              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Why KKH COO has failed in his response.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">From reading the b/m letter and
                      response, I sense persistent discord and unanswered issues.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">This seems to be Ms Phoon's main
                      contention: “... but she refused to answer.... ...We felt like
                      'balls' being kicked from place to place. Furthermore, it was already
                      past 1am and my children were tired. We adults gave up asking for
                      treatment and went home”....</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">However, instead of mentioning an
                      investigation and then considering how KKH could improve it's service
                      response, the  COO simply chose expediency by just 'explaining' his
                      way out and not offering any detailed investigation nor further
                      contact.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">My faults with his reply.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">1.No mention of any effort to contact
                      Ms Phoon privately for further investigations despite having had
                      prior notice from TODAYnews about the complaint (since both complaint
                      and reply has been published together, as well as fact that Ms
                      Phoon's children, involved in the same accident, were 'same visit'
                      patients at KKH).</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">2. The further absence in the written
                      response of any attempt at further service recovery (via access
                      numbers for the aggrieved to seek further clarifications, only
                      closing the response with “We hope this clarifies the matter … ”)
                      betrays the writer's  presumptuous sense that one has satisfactorily
                      settled the complaint in one response .</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">3.Ms Phoon: “but she (the nurse)
                      refused to answer.”,</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">COO: “As it is not an A&amp;E
                      department, the nurse on duty tried to explain the difference in
                      terms of charges”</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">- The COO is obviously trying to cover
                      up for the service lapse, parochially insisting that Ms Phoon (a
                      caregiver and accident victim) MUST understand the nurse's
                      instructions based on cost comparisons.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">- Also: there was no response by the
                      COO if an Xray or scan was necessary so we all don't know whether the
                      nurse's advice relevant at all. Instead of refusing to answer, why
                      didn't the nurse seek the advice of a superior to explain?</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">4.COO: “at the clinic, patients may
                      be referred to other hospitals with the relevant specialisation which
                      may not be available at the KKH Women's 24-hour Clinic...</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">...We apologise if Ms Phoon was given
                      the impression that she was being directed to Tan Tock Seng
                      Hospital.”.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">- So where/ what was Ms Phoon advised
                      to go/ do?</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">5.COO: “like to assure Ms Phoon that
                      patients with serious conditions are given immediate medical
                      attention”. Unfortunately, I think the COO's response is not
                      reassuring despite his claims, he has definitely glossed over many
                      service lapses identified by the complainant implying that the
                      financial advice to Ms Phoon was the right thing to do and further
                      presumptuously not offering any contact nor service ambassador
                      clarification, the fact remains that a mother with 2 children (1
                      visibly injured), all of whom were involved in the same road accident
                      victim left KKH upset, confused, misunderstood and unassured.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">6.There is no mention of regret that Ms
                      Phoon's experience at KKH was less then favorable, no review of 
                      procedures to ensure that such misunderstandings do not recur, no
                      single advice in the response about what Ms Phoon or anyone in such
                      similar circumstance should do. The physical brevity of the COO's
                      response is an added insult.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">7.Is COO concerned about expedience or
                      service? Is his purpose that of defending the hospital at all costs?
                      His response seems as vague as the service he so represents.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">8.Does he represent the service ethics
                      of KKH? Are all COOs trained lawyers too?</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">9.I don't know; I don't think I want to
                      know.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">We had a tough time seeking treatment</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Letter from Phoon Lai Fong.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Sep 18, 2009</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">MY TWO children, a friend and I met
                      with a car accident along the Central Expressway last Saturday, and
                      sought treatment at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH).</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">At the A&amp;E Department, we were told
                      to send my two children (my son had a cut and bruise on his forehead)
                      to KK Women's and Children's Hospital (KKH).</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">After the kids had their check up, my
                      friend and I went to the 24-hour outpatient clinic for our check-up.
                      A staff nurse there redirected us back to TTSH. She told us the fees
                      at KKH are "expensive". I asked her how expensive they were
                      - my friend and I had just been in a car accident and I was not
                      concerned about how much I had to pay. But the nurse just kept
                      repeating that an X-ray would be costly as a scan.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">I was upset because it implied we could
                      not afford to pay. I asked her if the fees would be 50 per cent more
                      than usual, but she refused to answer.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">We felt like "balls" being
                      kicked from place to place. Furthermore, it was already past 1am and
                      my children were tired. We adults gave up asking for treatment and
                      went home.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">In such accident cases, there should be
                      just the one hospital where all members of a family can get treatment
                      as soon as possible. What if either my friend and I had internal
                      bleeding and did not know it at that time, and treatment was thus
                      delayed?</p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Letter from Tan Jack Thian Chief
                      Operating Officer KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Sep 18, 2009</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">WE REFER to the letter by Ms Phoon Lai
                      Fong on A&amp;E services.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">At KK Women's and Children's Hospital,
                      A&amp;E services are available for children. For women, we have the
                      KKH Women's 24-hour Clinic for urgent obstetric and gynaecological
                      conditions. As it is not an A&amp;E department, the nurse on duty
                      tried to explain the difference in terms of charges to help Ms Phoon
                      make an informed choice.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Also, at the clinic, patients may be
                      referred to other hospitals with the relevant specialisation which
                      may not be available at the KKH Women's 24-hour Clinic. We would also
                      like to assure Ms Phoon that patients with serious conditions are
                      given immediate medical attention.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">We apologise if Ms Phoon was given the
                      impression that she was being directed to Tan Tock Seng Hospital.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">We hope this clarifies the matter and
                      we wish Ms Phoon and her family good health.</p>
