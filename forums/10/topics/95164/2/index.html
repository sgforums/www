            <div class='col-md body'>To: Sibeisuaykia,<br><br>There are possibly two ways of awarding talents (generalisation) assuming that there are such a thing as talents:-<br><br>(1) Recognize that people are different and some have more talents than others. President or an independent panel be advised to appoint specific person of calibre to be ministers or senior civil servants (salaries may be higher than ministers') needed by Singapore based on his past track records and qualifications.<br><br>Singapore can have all the talents it wants on a case-by-case basis and there should be no objection from anyone to pay such people higher pays on substantiated ground. By adopting such balanced or objective approach, Singapore can still attract many talents it wants or needs without opening the floodgates to award everyone higher pay based on positions. (Democracy at work) or;<br><br>(2) Make general statements or all kinds of policies based on talents or meritocracy, pay everyone equal based on positions, (assuming all are talents) and uplift all salary scales to retain that one or two talent, create promotions and increase pays of all positions across the board.<br><br>Singapore might be following the (2) approach for too many years resulting in everyone being presumed to be talents.<br><br>At the end, we are over-doing things. In the Asian Financial Crisis and last two recessions, our so-called talents were too helpless to do anything and could not come up with plans to overcome high costs affecting our competitiveness.<br><br>All non-talents too are regarded as talents and awarded promotions or higher salaries presumed or premised on such talent or meritocracy policies to retain or attract talents resulting in our high costs.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

Despite the countless letters from concerned groups of parents calling for the government to abolish the system of streaming over the years, the furthest the government has gone is to band the EM1 and EM2 stream together, which apparently still doesn't remove the demoralizing labels placed on those in the EM3 stream.<br>we are not brave enough to stand up to the minister's insults towards us? read the newspapers again and i'm sure you will find fresh critics abt the education system written by our very own "softies".<br>many ministers have sent their children overseas... if our so called wholistic  education system would suffice... why the need to sent their children overseas?</div>

I am not trying to put down anybody here but dun u think that most of the issues put up are higher issues compared to what some ppl in other countries might never even encounter? E.g. we are all talking about how taxing and heavy our workload are on our students but dun u know that many dun even have the rights to education elsewhere? i am not talking abt some poor old 3rd world country here. Ask your friends from up north, many fail to make it to uni just because of the colour of their skin. Its easy to take for granted the many comforts that we enjoy. We complain abt how costly it is to drive but have u ever been caught in 24-hour jams? or that u were waiting in a bus stop for a bus only to find out that the bus companies are all on a 3-day strike? Do u feel as safe when walking down a street here than elsewhere? Someone  lament that our ministers are sending their children abroad, it could just be because that they feel their children are getting too comfortable here? They need them to see that there is still a world out there. I do agree with u that we can still improve in many areas but sometimes the govt have to do what they have to do in order for us to survive. Like i said before i had to go away to realise how fortunate we are. Funnily what i couldnt agree more with u is the fact that u said that we are to weak to stand up to the MOE. A good pakistani friend ever told me that he finds the guys here are like having their balls cut off when they are young albiet tongue in cheek. I am 30, how abt u?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>simply said, you can't expect the PM's salary to be that of a hawker. being someone who is leading our country, i would generally expect him to be commanding a higher salary than most of us. in anycase, you can't expect LHL to go on TV everymonth and highlight his montly wages can you? it's dumb. salary is meant to be for personal information only. and even though he's in the govt, i'm sure he is limited to his very own personal information.<br><br>and btw, i'm sure giving me articles that begins with "http://www.sdp.org" is very much appreciated. i would be damn if any article in it even highlights the pros of the govt. as such, i would deem most articles as this defamatory to the govt, and have a serious reliability question.</div>

If you don't, then you are not being objective at all.<br><br>Actually, I think it would be good if politicians' salary could be pegged to the median salary of the workforce. That way they can really understand the impact of their own reforms monetarily; if they want more money, they had better make sure the people earn more!

            <div class='col-md body'>To: Pikamaster,<br><br>Truly loyal Singaporeans (not just pro-government) are those who will help all Singaporeans to realize better governance, fairplay, equity, accountability and transparency.<br><br>If people and leaders are liable to mistakes in over-paying themselves, correct those mistakes fast instead of trying to wait for economic recovery and justify entrenched hyper-pays.<br><br>I fully endorse your view to peg ministers' and civil servants' pays to workers' median pays (or moving averages of each category)<br><br>Why still so many ifs and buts on moderating the high pays of our ministers. Not many are of the top calibres like Bill Gate or Alan Greenspan as shown in the Asian Financial Crisis or last two recessions to enjoy hyer salaries by extrapolation from top earners. If Singapore finally found such hyper leaders, it is not too late to go to parliament and vote to increase that person or persons' pays. Assumptions about talents and leaders can be terribly unrealistic and off the mark.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
