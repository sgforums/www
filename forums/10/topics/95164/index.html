            <div class='col-md body'>wasn't the ministers' salaries published in the papers some time back(last year?) if i am not wrong abt 800-900k per annum, its so much higher than the rest of the world because they dun want them to be tempted into corruption. if u have enough,then won't be so easily tempted. Also they want the ministers salaries to be pegged to CEOs of MNCs as running Singapore is so much more difficult than running a company. CEOs may draw 10-12 million a year so 800-900k not alot.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If US President is to peg his pay to Bill Gate or other chief executives in US corporation, US president should be paid US100 million a year or more.<br><br>CEOs and others in the private sector are not apple-for-apple comparison with that of public sector. Reasons are many such as the following:-<br><br>(1) Corporate skills are much more wider-ranging in nature. Ministers placed in charge of corporations may flop in their jobs and cause corporations to lose monies or collapse.<br><br>(2) Many private sector's CEOs and bosses are entrepreneurs using their own funds (not tax payers' monies) to generate wealths or salaries for themselves. They can pay any amounts to themselves if they want to.<br><br>(3) Ministers and MPs have gone back to private sectors but could not actually justify their capability to earn the same salaries as paid while working as ministers.<br><br>(4) Stock brokers and property developers were subjected to economic downturns and their salaries and earnings have gone down by recent stock crashes. Did their ministers take this fact into account in working out comparisons with private sector's salaries.<br><br>(5) The only rationale for giving higher salaries to ministers and Singapore is to avoid corruptions. Is this working effectively ? What about the correspondingly pay increases across the board for the entire civil service. Such a policy of paying salaries to equate to private sector drove up Singapore costs affecting its economic competitiveness.<br><br>(6) Any business entity whose funds are contributions from members such as clubs, mcst and associations are easier to manage because funds or monies are of no problems as mentioned by senior civil servant Ngiam Tong Down after his retirement and taking up a new position as CEO of HDB Corp. Being easier and not worried about pay cheque, civil servants are not in the same categories as equivalent positions in the private sector. There is no rationale in assuming that civil servants or ministers are doing more difficult jobs.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Paying high salaries to ministers means that we are going to get good ministers who can solve our present problems with lack of economic recovery by local and smaller businesses.<br><br>Here are some real problems that need to be tackled by all ministers to be worth their world's highest pays.<br><br>Business or economic policies or plans currently are not benefitting the local or small businesses. Many measures might have been introduced to help SMEs but as usual they don't help because of conditions and rules.<br><br>Tax-oriented budgets and policies do not help economic recovery of SMEs. What they want and need are real helps in reducing costs and increasing opportunities to tender for works and services. However, there is a general tendency to promote businesses based on size or track record. This means that new entrepreneurs cannot enter the market.<br><br>Pro-foreign investment and pro-foreign employment policies did not work during the Asian Financial Crisis and last two recessions in creating jobs or preventing downturns. Policies that are aimed at 100 % compliance with all regulations without discretionary or flexible open categories will continue to stifle growths.<br><br>What rationale is there for continuing with such pro-foreign policies. Appropriately planned in master business plan or strategy, to spin the economy with deregulations and more openning up of closed doors (to small timers and SMEs), all the local companies and small businesses will do well again and the whole population of 3.5 millions will be motivated to work the economy.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

Also they want the ministers salaries to be pegged to CEOs of MNCs as running Singapore is so much more difficult than running a company. CEOs may draw 10-12 million a year so 800-900k not alot.</div></blockquote>I rather those ministers to corrupt secretly than to take such a high pay as if they corrupt "openly"!And besides,how can u be sure that after getting such a high pay,they wont be corrupted anymore?Dont forget my friends,some men's greeds are no end!!!As for running Singapore is more difficult than running a company,than i think many leaders who are managing countries which are much more larger than this "Singapore island" should get more pay than our PM liao!!!</div>

In the so called "bigger countries" they would probably ask u to take a number and get back to u 10 years later, that is if they get back to u at all.<br><br>And for those who think that running a country is easier than running an MNC, u should get your heads checked! In any corporation, the basic yardstick the CEO is judged on is $$$. They have carte blanche to make any decisions that will bring in money for the company. They will not care how their decisions would affect the workers nor do they want to care. As long as the company is not in the red, nothing else matters.<br><br>The ministers on the other hand are in a no win situation. Any decisions they make are bound to upset somebody, they can NEVER please EVERYONE. The trick is to play the majority. Easier said than done.</div>
