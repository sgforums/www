              <p> If you cannot read what Reyes had posted, try brushing up on your English if you cannot be honest about the political facts that exist in Singapore.</p>
              <p>The PAP has made it difficult for any private contributions to reach the Alternative Political Parties in Singapore, and besides the legislations that make things difficult for the Alternative Political Parties, the PAP has politicised every government agencies to block the growth of the Atlernative Political Parties and prevent any possibility to reach out to the Heartlanders.</p>
              <p>While it is not the duty of the PAP to help the Alternative Political Parties, it is the duty of the PAP to protect and be true to the Singapore Constitution - which was written with the interests of every Singapore Citizens - who have given their lives and energy to do the same through National Service and other forms of services to the Nation.</p>
              <p>Yet, we have the PAP bastardising the Singapore Constitution that make it difficult for Singaporean to participate in the Poltical Life of Singapore, and for other Political Parties to provide the check and balance to the PAP efforts to stay non-accountable to Singaporeans for all their actions.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>as for atobe, i don't know what planet you were from... you go and find out what really happened.. you go ask CST what really happened.. because a whole generation who were there, hoping for a change when the surge of the opposition was abruptly brought to a screeching, stinking halt by CSJ, will never forget it...</p>
              <p>ask yourself.. why the hell is CST out there now, away from a party which he created?</p>
              <p>if you are unable to see further or deeper than that, i suggest you start looking properly...</p>
              <p>your enemy's enemy may be your worst enemy...</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>With friends in our midst that resemble The Bear - do we need any enemies ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thankfully, The Bear is a different species from us Homo Sapiens - and we can only wonder if it can be coming from this Little Red Dot or even from this Planet.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The records stand true in print and on record in Wikipedia about the events that led to CST being thrown out of SDP by his own inconsiderate actions in not supporting his own party executive from being persecuted by the PAP.</p>
              <p>If you want to listen to the groaning of an old CST about being maligned - no one is stopping you from recommending to CST to write to Wikipedia to make changes to what has been posted on their site and taken as facts.</p>
              <p>CST could have taken legal actions against all accusations that claimed to be facts about CST being thrown out by his own actions.</p>
              <p>Afterall, CST has the experience in regaining his reputation before, when he had been the only politician that won a legal case against the PAP Leadership, and there is nothing that will prevent him from doing the same again.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You will only damage your own credibility and reputation with your continued efforts at labelling CSJ as a back-stabber and an ingrate towards CST.</p>
              <p>When CSJ was busy with his hunger strike at his own home, while the SDP was holding the CEC meeting with the General Membership at their Party HQ - could CSJ be a participant to move CST out of the SDP ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In any case, could CST have any ability to groom any successor for his SDP ?</p>
              <p>Without the SDP Chairman Ling Howe Doong, the SDP will have to suffer continued lacklustre performance in Parliament that will continue to drain its reputation.</p>
              <p>It was to stop SDP from backsliding that CSJ was brought into the SDP, and it provided the SDP with a wild card that surprised the PAP leadership - when CSJ had rejected his Faculty's Head Dr Vasoo - a PAP senior cadre member - invitation to join the PAP.</p>
              <p>It was CSJ's doctorate qualification that made the PAP desperate to ensure that CSJ will never succeed in politics, as it would have derailed LKY's master plan of having a smooth transition from GCT to LHL; and that during LHL's tenure as PM, there should not be any robust challenges that will aggravate LHL's cancer condition that was already in remission but open to recurrence when stressed.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This is repeated again - could CST have any ability to groom any successor ?</p>
              <p>Even as CST has recently suffered a mild stroke, the SDA party that he now leads remains without any successor, and his party remains weak when compared to WP.</p>
              <p>Is CST a capable politician ?</p>
              <p>Is he representing his own political interests, or that of his Constituents, or even for Singaporeans ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is amazing that each time when either the SDP or CSJ names appear - you will appear without fail with your persistent and consistent performance at denigrating both in all your posts with skewed facts that are pure lies.</p>
              <p>These are on record in this Speaker's Corner, the Polar Bear should thank you for your effort to blemish its otherwise good reputation as being a non-political animal.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Does the Polar Bear need any enemies with a friend like you ?</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>That I acknowledged in your point. But have you ever gotten the full extracts of arguments made by some of our opposition MPs in parliament?</p>
              <p>I have ever read the full arguments before, and its far more than what our papers like to report (in 1 sentence).</p>
              <p>I have seen those, and I feel that they are worth much more than the PAP MPs whom are sworn in parliament, whom are much more inclined to agree with the ministers, than to really question.</p>

              <p>True, in a battle field or game, where got fair game?? The opposition are the underdogs, they need to put in more than double effort of what a PAP MP does inorder to outrun them and make themselves visible to the public, for most of us, we are the first time voter, it is very essential to not only leaving a good mark but also to constantly engage the youngs, be creative and do the differences.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>PAP strategy is very simple, they wait for you to make a wrong move, and catch you on your words, defame you, totally abolish, so dun fall into their traps, talks out of the box issue, bring in new ideals that appeal the youngs, try not to challenge the ruling party with condemnation words, instead use their policies and find way to improve it so that we can see the better side of it. </p>
