              <p>They don't bother to set a minimum wage for employers to pay employees.   In NZ, the govt set the minimum wage pay of $11.    In sg, you get very low pay your business.  </p>
              <p>The best part is even in their govt sector they practise pay low low and get ppl to do quality job.   the despots are for exploitation of locals.   In the midst, the keep increasing costs of living.     They are making sg hell for locals to live in.</p>

              <p>Despots only care that they pay themselves well and the rest of us can go to hell.</p>
              <p>They don't bother to set a minimum wage for employers to pay employees.   In NZ, the govt set the minimum wage pay of $11.    In sg, you get very low pay your business.  </p>
              <p>The best part is even in their govt sector they practise pay low low and get ppl to do quality job.   the despots are for exploitation of locals.   In the midst, the keep increasing costs of living.     They are making sg hell for locals to live in.</p>
