              <p>now andyboy, if you walk your talk, the first thing to do is to earn the trust of the people.. and the way to earn the trust of the people is by doing the right things... and not barking and bleating the same tired BS which most of the opposition idiots do..</p>

              <p>just like what the Bear said, we seem to trust the opposition less than the MIW which i totally agree... the reason is; the opposition does not seem to address our issues during parliment. they seems to be just snoozing off.</p>

              <p>Wake me up when the opposition has an legitimate issue with the direction of the nation beyond "we need more opposition!".</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In many aspect, the opposition shares the same political stand as the PAP, in regards to how should we run the nation.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The momment they realise that the campaign slogan " We need more opposition" is a freaking stupid idea, and actually try tell the general public in what aspect are they different from the PAP in regards to national policies, they might win some votes. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Right now, the opposition parties is essentially the same as the PAP, except for the fact that they are not called PAP, and has an active interest in gaining more political power.</p>

              <p>Beside Chiam, Chee, my uncle chia, andrew and a few others opposition, most of those who got potential and talents to join opposition will get a private secret visit by LKY personally and be lure into PAP before even they can make a speech on behalf of opposition.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Therefore, PAP has the control within them. The ability to nip the most talented and able ones is the key to their success. And LKY is a good negiotator, when he pays you a private visit, you better show some respect, from then on, life will be better for you. UNDERSTAND.</p>

              <p>Well, it is not the MM Lee dun argue with Chiam, because Chiam make no progress and dun really fight in the parliament, some even said that Chiam is an opposition make by PAP.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Imagine that a ruling party can tell you that they want how many oppositions to be MPs and how many NMPs in the parliament, where in the world can you find a govt saying such thing?? It is totally control.</p>

              <p>now.. think.. CST was grooming CSJ for leadership of the SDP... CSJ could not wait and then threw CST out of the very party which he founded... and then with that masterstroke of stupidity, he destroyed the whole opposition movement and lost all credibility with the people who witnessed the whole sordid and shameless backstabbing...</p>
              <p>we, the people who give a damn, the people who witnessed the treachery and deceit, can never ever bring ourselves to trust CSJ ever again...</p>
              <p>hell! open your eyes! the people in the SDP don't even trust CSJ anymore with people like Ling "Don't Talk Cock!" How Doong and his other cronies who helped him oust CST quietly abandoning him...</p>
              <p>so, CSJ to take over CST's mantle?</p>
