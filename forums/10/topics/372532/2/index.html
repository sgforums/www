              <p><br>As opposition, behave like one, be a gentleman or lady, argue on what is suppose to argue, fight on what is suppose to be unfair, win or loose is not the matter, the public understand that opposition are underdogs, a win for them will be something very special. Therefore the public is not looking at opposition fighting or argueing to win, but we look for the caring part, he/she should at least make an effort to say something that make reasonable news that delight the public sentiment. Swearing and cursing only make matter worst for opposition to operate here.</p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">"thing is, the people seem to trust the opposition less than the MIW.. "</span></strong></p>
              <p>In the last Election 2006, out of a population of 3.5 Million Singaporeans, only 2,147,840 are on the Electoral Roll as registered voters.</p>
              <p>From this 2,147,840 voters, only 1,123,273 had the opportunity to cast their votes while the remaining 1,024,567 Singaporeans were sitting at home without the opportunity to vote.</p>
              <p>From the 1,123,273 that cast their votes, the PAP managed only to obtain 748,130 votes - which is only 34.83% of the registered voters of 2,147,840 Singaporeans; while the Alternative Parties managed 375,143 votes that came to about 17.47% of the registered voters.</p>
              <p>With the other 1,024,567 Singaporeans not participating - can anyone be as certain as you that Singaporeans <em>"trust the oppostion less than the MIW"</em> ?</p>
              <p>With only 17.47% of the total votes, the Alternative Parties were able to get two candidates into Parliament, and considering that even the LHL had a shock when 45% of the AMK GRC had cast their votes to the young new faces offered by WP.</p>
              <p>This seems to be a far cry from the dramatic claim that do not reflect the reality on the ground, which has so many impediments purposefully placed to block the Alternative Parties from a successful outreach to the Singaporean electorate.</p>
              <p>The Drama Queen of this Speaker's Corner needs a reality check with its purposeful myopic line taken to attack the Alternative Parties.</p>

              <h2>What really happened between Chiam and Chee in the 1990s</h2>
              <p><span style="color: #800080;"><strong>(information taken from SDP’s website, with my own personal remarks added in using purple colour)</strong></span></p>
              <p>In 1984, Mr Chiam See Tong was elected in Potong Pasir, a seat he has held till today. That same year, the Singapore Democratic Party (which Chiam was a member of at that time) launched its newsletter <em>Demokrat</em>.</p>
              <p>In 1986, a few of the Party’s leaders, including Mr Soon Kia Seng (Assistant Secretary-General) and Mr Peter Lim Ah Yong (Treasurer), resigned their posts with Mr Soon accusing some of his colleagues as not sincerely believing in democracy: “<strong>This is not a party I once knew. I am willing to serve a cause but <span style="text-decoration: underline;">I don’t want to serve individuals</span>.</strong>”</p>
              <p>Subsequently, the SDP contested the Marine Parade by-elections in December 1992 called for by then-prime minister, Mr Goh Chok Tong, in his own GRC. Dr Chee Soon Juan joined the SDP as part of the contesting team with Mr Low Yong Nguan, Mr Ashleigh Seow (Mr Francis Seow’s son) and Mr Mohd Shariff.</p>
              <p>Following the election in 1993, Dr Chee was sacked by the National University of Singapore where he was a Lecturer. Dr Chee went on a hunger strike as a mark of protest. He was subsequently sued by his department head, Dr S Vasoo, faculty dean, Dr Ernest Chew, and secretary, Ms Janice Chen, when he disputed his sacking.</p>
              <p><strong>Mr Chiam first supported Dr Chee’s action but <span style="text-decoration: underline;">later changed his mind</span> and called for the Party to censure his the assistant secretary-general (Dr Chee was elected to the post in February 1993).</strong> <strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">None of the Central Executive Committee (CEC) members supported Mr Chiam’s motion</span> whereupon the Party leader <span style="text-decoration: underline;">tended his resignation</span>, citing that he had lost the confidence of his colleagues.</strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #800080;">This is in stark contrast to the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>repeated lies and falsehoods</strong></span> perpetrated by the mainstream press that it was Dr Chee who forced Chiam out of the SDP.</span></p>
              <p>A few of the CEC members, including Dr Chee, tried to persuade Mr Chiam to remain as secretary-general. However, Mr Chiam stated that he would do so only if he could be granted the power to appoint and dismiss the Party’s cadre members. He also wanted the removal of Mr Wong Hong Toy as vice-chairman.</p>
              <p>Under the Party’s constitution, a simple majority of the CEC was needed to appoint cadre members, not any one individual leader. The CEC did not have the constitutional power to accede to Mr Chiam’s demands.</p>
              <p>A few weeks later, <strong>Mr Chiam gave a speech at the Singapore Press Club attacking the Party’s leadership in a vicious manner</strong>. Ironically, it was he who previously forbade leaders from criticising the party after they left it by making them sign oaths.</p>
              <p>It was only after his speech at the Singapore Press Club, which is always looking for an opportunity to run down the opposition, that the CEC voted to expel Mr Chiam.</p>
              <p>The Press Club had extended a similar invitation to Dr Chee to counter Mr Chiam. Knowing that the PAP-controlled media had every intention to fan the flames, Dr Chee declined the invitation. But when he subsequently informed the organizers that he would speak but on the Party’s alternative policy ideas instead of the altercation with Mr Chiam, the Press Club withdrew the invitation.</p>
              <p><strong>Mr Chiam sued the CEC for wrongful dismissal and won.</strong> <span style="color: #800080;">His actions dealt a severe financial blow to the SDP.</span></p>
              <p>Despite all this, Dr Chee approached Mr Chiam a few months later to invite him to join an SDP delegation that was going to visit the Australian Parliament in Canberra. Mr Chiam declined.</p>
              <p><strong>The PAP has seized on this matter and deliberately portrayed the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">falsehood</span> that Dr Chee ousted Mr Chiam from the SDP.<span style="color: #800080;"> In actual fact, it was Chiam who brought it upon himself by deliberately attacking his own party in public and playing directly into the hands of the PAP.<br></span></strong></p>
              <p>Mr Chiam remained with the Party until the 1997 general elections when he resigned to form another party.</p>

              <p>The infamous <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-a-drama-queen.htm">‘Drama Queen’(*1) </a>never fail in its efforts to deride the SDP and now it is claiming that even the Chairman of SDP has quietly distance himself from CSJ.</p>
              <p>Does anyone know how old Ling Howe Doong was when he decided to relinquish the post as Chairman of the SDP ?</p>
              <p>If Ling Howe Doong's stepping down from the SDP can be seen as distancing himself from CSJ, should Singaporeans see the resignation of the Old Guards from the PAP as similarly distancing themselves from the unpopular LHL too ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If only CST had been able to groom new blood in his SDA today, perhaps there will be no such reports surfacing that <a rel="nofollow" href="http://temasekreview.com/?tag=chiam-see-tong">Potong Pasir resident expressed ‘disappointment at Chiam’s performance(*3) </a>- dated 5 March 2009.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Should we see the CEC and the General Membership at SDA soon throw CST out of their party soon - this time without any help from CSJ ?</p>
              <p>Who will the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-a-drama-queen.htm">‘Drama Queen’(*1) </a>pick for the drama in stabbing CST again ?</p>

              <p>Can we trust the words of a <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-a-drama-queen.htm">‘Drama Queen’(*1) </a>when all the efforts of the Alternative Parties are derided by the self-serving dramas created by one who yearn for controversial attention ?</p>
              <p>The SDP's struggle is to rebuild the foundation of Singapore Politics that have been hijacked by the PAP in their methods used to bastardised the Singapore Constitution - by removing Singaporean's Basic Rights as enshrined in the Constitution.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans have been lulled to sleep, de-politicized, made politically apathetic, minds dulled with full stomachs over the last 52 years to the point that they do not even stir when their basic rights have been removed.</p>
              <p>With the Law on illegal assembly of 5 changed, it is now unlawful even to conduct a public protest as a single person.</p>
              <p>Has the PAP become so desperately vulnerable as reflected in its actions ?</p>
              <p>CSJ and the SDP have done a great job in exposing the flaws of the PAP that pushed LKY and the PAP into a corner to force them to show Singaporeans their true dark colors that are hidden behind the blinding white.</p>

              <p>The infamous <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-a-drama-queen.htm">‘Drama Queen’(*1) </a>never fail in its efforts to deride the SDP and now it is claiming that even the Chairman of SDP has quietly distance himself from CSJ.</p>
              <p>Does anyone know how old Ling Howe Doong was when he decided to relinquish the post as Chairman of the SDP ?</p>
              <p>If Ling Howe Doong's stepping down from the SDP can be seen as distancing himself from CSJ, should Singaporeans see the resignation of the Old Guards from the PAP as similarly distancing themselves from the unpopular LHL too ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If only CST had been able to groom new blood in his SDA today, perhaps there will be no such reports surfacing that <a rel="nofollow" href="http://temasekreview.com/?tag=chiam-see-tong">Potong Pasir resident expressed ‘disappointment at Chiam’s performance(*3) </a>- dated 5 March 2009.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Should we see the CEC and the General Membership at SDA soon throw CST out of their party soon - this time without any help from CSJ ?</p>
              <p>Who will the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-a-drama-queen.htm">‘Drama Queen’(*1) </a>pick for the drama in stabbing CST again ?</p>

              <p><br>That is a good one...Really appreciate that you bother to share this with all of us here.  If Chee really forced Chiam out of SDP, then Chiam would have already formed his own party outside again.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But why is that after so many years after leaving SDP, Chiam do not have a decent party yet again?  Don't he need a successor?  Is there a shortage of people willing to join opposition?  Did Chiam ever try to form a decent party again? </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I respect and pity Chiam that he really worked very hard for people in Potong Pasir and Singapore.  No wish to put him down in anyway.  History has shown that only a extraordinary person like Chiam can battle PAP for more than 25 years victorious.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Unfortunately, in politics, only the decisive and cruel often survive and emerge victorious.  History is written by winners, not losers.</p>
