            <div class='col-md body'>A study in S'pore says that 6 out of 10 S'poreans don't speak 'standard English'? As usual, the S'pore govt wants to correct this with a 'Speak good English' campaign (like this will work).........<br><br>What in the world is 'standard English'? If you say that people from England speak 'standard English', then what do you call David Beckam's language? He speaks like a butcher with a short tongue and with lots of choclates stuck in his mouth... George Bush speaks like a cowboy whose jeans is too tight.<br><br>If Aussies are proud of their 'Aussie English', if the Americans are proud of their many versions of English, if the people of England are proud of their many versions of English...etc, then why are the S'porean authorities so ashamed of our English? A language is a means of communication and also a sign of our identity. In this case, Singlish is fully understood by S'poreans and it's a distinctive part of being S'porean.<br><br>So, speak Singlish cannot meh? Si-eh-sian-Man...! I suka spiak Singlish leh. You please don't come play-play with my Engrish lah...or else I hantam you one time good-good then you si-kiow-kiow......</div>

Isn't this another one of their U-turns?<br><br>They are even saying that since Singaporeans can't speak standard English, hence the preference for foreighners who can.<br><br>And even when locals are so called fluent in Mandarin, when you listen to a PRC speak, you can hear obvious differences.<br><br></div>

English gets short-formed &amp; abbreviated to oblivion!<br><br>I always tell my wife (who speaks Mandarin with all her friends) to brush up, watch less of Ch8 on TV, and improve general knowledge with Nat Geo &amp; Discovery channels.

Zat is the British prounounciation for Z. I've been taught to prounonce Z as "zat", since we are using British English, not American English. Nowadays, because of our closer ties with US, things are changed, I guess.</div>
