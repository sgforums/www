Singapore cannot support Palestine because Israel helped Singapore when she was a fledgling to set up Singapore's army.<br>2. Israel and Palestine are two problems which the colonial british created : they promised the jews a homeland and they promised the palestinians they will stay independent<br>3. The only solution : Make Britain pay for their double dealings. Carve up england (not scotland not northern ireland not wales because those are not british lands by right )  and give either the israelis or the palestinians a sovereign land equivalent to what they were cheated out of . Maybe the whole of midlands . Who gives a damn about the brits?   I think it is better if israel can move out into that part of UK because she is in alot of conflict with her neighbours.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>
