            <div class='col-md body'>It might be just a co-incidence, places like Acheh and Sri Lanka which have the most rebels fighting the government troops bear the brunt of the deadly tsunami, and to a lesser extent in southern Thailand. Was this a lesson directing them to turn over to a new leaf and live a more meaningful live?Hopefully they have been jolted out of their conscience to realise that all men are brothers and peaceful co-existance is what the almighty wants in all corners of the earth!</div>
