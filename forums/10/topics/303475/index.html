            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The laws that enslave Singaporeans.</strong><br><br>Ladies and Gentlemen,<br><br>Freedom House, the global democracy monitor had said that Singaporeans are unable to change their government through elections. The following is the reason why.<br><br>For 5 or more people to gather in public, even for peaceful protest, a government licence is required. For the last 40 years, the government has routinely denied any permits to opposition political parties.<br><br>Similarly, to make a speech in public one needs a permit. But permits are always denied to the opposition.<br><br>To print and publish newspapers, a government permit is required; which again will be denied to the opposition.<br><br>To own a printing press machine, a permit is required and if the opposition possesses one, the owner is arrested and imprisoned.<br><br>To form a society, a permit is required and if it is for an opposition political purpose, the organisers and officers of the society are kept under police surveillance, harassed, intimated and removed from their jobs.<br><br>Under the House to House and Street Collections Act, it is an offense for anyone to solicit donations from members of the public without a licence. If an opposition political party were to apply for one, it will not get it, thereby making it impossible for opposition political activities to obtain funding.<br><br>It is an offense to obtain funding from abroad which means the government labelling the Singaporean a traitor and imprisoning him under the Internal Security act without trial.<br><br>As if all this were not enough, all organs of state work as extensions of the ruling party.<br><br>All judges use the law to eliminate political opponents. Unions harass and intimidate any worker found to be opposition sympathisers.<br><br>The entire media is owned and controlled by the government, whose duty it is to print government propaganda.<br><br>School teachers are advised not to discuss politics at all and to report to the government any student who shows sympathy to opposition political parties.<br><br>In all walks of life, government and ruling party sympathisers profit from their loyalty. If in government, they are paid millions, if lawyers and professionals given government cases with high fees, and others are made directors and officers of the multitude of government linked companies, given comfortable salaries and perks.<br><br>In other words, being a member of the Baath Party, sorry Peoples Action Party of Lee Kuan Yew has its benefits.<br><br>Loyalty and servitude to one man, Lee Kuan Yew can bring unimaginable riches to you.<br><br>Opposition to him, ruin.<br><br>So the Singaporean has the choice. Riches or rags.<br><br>This is how Singapore enslaves it's people.<br><br>Gopalan Nair<br><br><a href="http://singaporedissident.blogspot.com/2008/01/laws-that-enslave-singaporeans.html" rel="nofollow">http://singaporedissident.blogspot.com/2008/01/laws-that-enslave-singaporeans.html</a></div>

It showed that 82 percent could not take part in peaceful political activities for the same reasons, in comparison to just over 78 percent in 2006.<br><br>Under Jordan's penal code, citizens may be prosecuted and jailed for slandering the king, members of the royal family, the government and the armed forces, or for "fueling national and regional discord and undermining national unity."<br><br>In December, the New York-based Human Rights Watch issued a report accusing the government of using restrictive laws to sharply reduce the freedom of individuals and organizations to meet and demonstrate in public.<br><br>- AFP<br><br><a href="http://www.dailystar.com.lb/article.asp?edition_id=10&amp;categ_id=2&amp;article_id=88065" rel="nofollow">http://www.dailystar.com.lb/article.asp?edition_id=10&amp;categ_id=2&amp;article_id=88065</a></div>
