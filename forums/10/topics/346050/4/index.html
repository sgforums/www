              area, and knew in advance that the Syrians would start to shoot. If
              they didn’t shoot, we would tell the tractor to advance further,

              <p>Israel captured Golan Heights in the six-day war, that's a fact.</p>
              <p>Israel couldn't fight on three fronts simultaneously. After defeating the largest Egyptian army and Jordanian army, Syrian Army was no longer a threat but Golan Heights is a high ground that's a threat to Israel.</p>
              <p>Dayan's 'conversation', published long after his death, is a fake. Of course he can't defend himself now.</p>
              <p>You thought that Dayan was dumb enough to let the reporter take notes on their 'conversation' when it was not meant to be an interview.</p>

              <div class="articleAuthorName">
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">All of the Obama administration's rhetoric about
              "change you can believe in," government transparency and democratic
              ideals went up in smoke Monday morning in a San Francisco federal
              courtroom.</span></strong></p>
              <p>A federal attorney representing President Barack
              Obama and his attorney general, Eric Holder, rose to announce that the
              new administration will be standing pat on the position taken by George
              Bush and his Justice Department in a case involving some of the most
              heinous crimes of the previous administration.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Like his predecessor, Obama is invoking the state
              secrets privilege to quash a case brought on behalf of individuals who
              were abducted by the CIA, held in secrecy and without charges and
              transported to third countries to be interrogated under torture.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">The practice, known as "extraordinary rendition,"
              has come to symbolize for people all over the world everything that was
              lawless, sadistic and reactionary about the Bush administration.
              Contained within this lawless act of the US government were all of the
              most nightmarish features of a police-state dictatorship.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">People were torn from their homes and families by
              jackbooted men dressed in black and wearing masks to become
              "disappeared" persons, their very existence in US custody denied by
              Washington. Denied any protections afforded to either criminal suspects
              or prisoners of war, they were detained in many cases for years without
              charges while subjected to the most barbaric forms of torture.</span></strong></p>
              <p>The case in San Francisco involves five victims of
              this state crime. It was brought against not the CIA and the
              government, but rather one of their corporate accomplices, Jeppesen
              DataPlan, a Boeing subsidiary that organized—and profited from—the
              secret CIA rendition flights in which those abducted were flown in
              supposedly private aircraft, hooded, shackled and often drugged, to
              "black sites," foreign prisons and torture chambers around the world.</p>
              <p>Though not a defendant in this civil case, the Bush
              Justice Department intervened, invoking the state secrets privilege and
              claiming that going forward in any way with the proceedings would
              present a threat to national security. A lower court concurred, and the
              hearing Monday was held before the Ninth US Circuit Court of Appeals,
              where attorneys for the five abducted men sought the lawsuit's
              reinstatement. Obama's representative intervened, once again, to have
              it thrown out on the very same grounds.</p>
              <p>Ben Wizner, an American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU)
              attorney who argued the case for the plaintiffs, condemned the action.
              "We are shocked and deeply disappointed that the Justice Department has
              chosen to continue the Bush administration's practice of dodging
              judicial scrutiny of extraordinary rendition and torture," he said.
              <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">"This was an opportunity for the new administration to act on its
              condemnation of torture and rendition, but instead it has chosen to
              stay the course."</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">The claim that allowing the case to go forward would
              endanger national security is ludicrous on its face. The practice of
              extraordinary rendition has not only been exposed by human rights
              organizations and the media, but has been openly defended by US
              government officials. Rather, the government's aim in suppressing any
              legal challenge is to protect those responsible for war crimes and to
              prevent new evidence of official criminality from surfacing.</span></strong></p>
              <p>The hideous nature of these crimes is spelled out in
              the complaint filed by the lawyers for the five men. One of them was
              Binyam Mohamed, an Ethiopian national who was a British resident for
              seven years before being abducted in Pakistan and then flown by the CIA
              to Morocco. There, according to the legal complaint: "He was routinely
              beaten, suffering broken bones and, on occasion, loss of consciousness
              due to the beatings. His clothes were cut off with a scalpel and the
              same scalpel was then used to make incisions on his body, including his
              penis. A hot stinging liquid was then poured into open wounds on his
              penis where he had been cut. He was frequently threatened with rape,
              electrocution, and death."</p>
              <p>It continues: "He was placed in a damp, moldy room
              with open sewage for a month at a time. He believed his food to be
              drugged, but when he refused to eat he was forcibly hooked up to two
              different IVs. These IVs alternated pumping different substances into
              his body, the combination of which forced him to undergo painful
              withdrawal symptoms."</p>
              <p>After a year and a half of this torture, he was
              transferred to the so-called "Dark Prison" run by the CIA at the Bagram
              air base in Afghanistan, where his "captors repeatedly hit his head
              against the wall until he began to bleed." He was held in a cold cell
              measuring six foot square, chained to the floor and kept in pitch
              darkness 23 hours a day. He was also "hung from a pole" and subjected
              to loud noises piped into the cell. Fed raw rice, beans and bread, over
              the course of four months of this detention he lost between 40 and 60
              pounds.</p>
              <p>Now at Guantanamo, the US government is preparing to
              release Mohamed, having produced not a shred of evidence linking him to
              any terrorist activity.</p>
              <p>Then there is the case of Ahmed Agiza, 45, an
              Egyptian pharmacist who was seized by the CIA in Sweden, where he had
              sought political asylum. The CIA flew him back to Egypt where, the
              document states, he "was severely and repeatedly beaten and routinely
              subjected to electric shock treatment. Mr. Agiza was stripped naked and
              strapped to a wet mattress. Electrodes were then applied to his ear
              lobes, nipples, and genitals, so that an extremely strong electric
              current could be introduced causing his body to rise and fall. A doctor
              was present throughout to ensure he did not die from torture." He was
              subsequently sentenced to 25 years in prison by an Egyptian military
              tribunal for belonging to a proscribed political organization.</p>
              <p>Similar appalling details are provided in the court document [<a href="http://www.aclu.org/pdfs/safefree/mohamed_complaint20070530.pdf">PDF</a>] regarding the treatment of the other plaintiffs in the case.</p>
              <p>In seeking to suppress this case, the Obama administration has taken full ownership of these savage crimes.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">The Bush administration's use of the state secrets
              privilege, which it invoked dozens of times over the course of its
              eight-year tenure, was a hallmark of its increasing assumption of
              extraordinary and at times near-dictatorial powers. The use of this
              same heavy-handed legal tactic by the Obama administration has
              unmistakable and far-reaching implications.</span></strong></p>
              <p>While Washington is attempting to use the departure
              of Bush and the ascension of Obama to refurbish the abysmal image of US
              government both at home and abroad, the action taken in the San
              Francisco federal court is <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">only one of a number of recent developments
              making it clear that the essential contours of US imperialist policy
              and both the criminal and police-state measures that it has engendered
              will not be transformed by the change in personnel in the White House.</span></strong></p>
              <p>Highly revealing in this regard was the Senate testimony last Friday by Obama's nominee for CIA director, Leon Panetta.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Asked specifically about extraordinary rendition,
              Panetta claimed that the administration had forbid by executive order
              "that kind of extraordinary rendition where we send someone for the
              purpose of torture or for actions by another country that violate our
              human values."</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">He added, however, that the CIA could still abduct
              suspects and send them to third countries for interrogation, provided
              it received assurances that they would be treated humanely. Of course,
              the Bush administration routinely claimed that it had just such
              assurances from countries like Egypt and Morocco.</span></strong></p>
              <p>Under sharp questioning from Republican Senator Kit
              Bond of Missouri, Panetta explicitly repudiated his earlier assertion
              that detainees had been tortured. "On that particular quote, that
              people were transferred for the purposes of torture, that was not the
              policy of the United States," he declared. "To that extent, yes, I
              would retract that statement."</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">What is involved here is not merely the formal
              denial of past crimes that are well known to people all over the world,
              but a signal that the CIA will continue to carry out such crimes with
              impunity.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Then there is the report, published in the
              Washington Post Saturday, that the Obama administration is revamping
              the National Security Council (NSC), endowing it with sweeping new
              powers that suggest the formation of something akin to a fourth branch
              of government.</span></strong></p>
              <p>Heading this agency is national security adviser
              James L. Jones, a retired Marine general described by the Post as a
              "proponent of a ‘pro-active military' in noncombat regions," who "has
              advocated military collaboration with the oil and gas industry."</p>
              <p>Directing much of the reconfiguring of the NSC,
              according to the Post, is John O. Brennan, a former senior CIA official
              who is both Obama's adviser for counterterrorism and homeland security
              and Jones's deputy. Obama had reportedly wanted to place him at the
              head of the CIA, but was forced to withdraw his name for consideration
              after it became known that Brennan was a vocal advocate of the
              extraordinary rendition program and a defender of the CIA's "enhanced
              coercive interrogation techniques," i.e., torture.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Less than three weeks after the inauguration, it is
              becoming ever more apparent that the new administration has been
              brought into office to defend the same social and class interests as
              the previous one, is utilizing similar methods and relying on the same
              personnel within the national security apparatus responsible for the
              criminal activities of the past eight years.</span></strong></p>
