              <div class="articleAuthorName">by  James  Cogan</div>
              <p><a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=va&amp;aid=12089">http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=va&amp;aid=12089</a></p>
              <p>Within days of taking power, the Obama administration has made clear
              that it will escalate the war to subjugate the Afghan people, intensify
              US military strikes on targets inside Pakistan and continue the
              occupation of Iraq indefinitely. What is being prepared is a brutal
              escalation of US military violence in Afghanistan and a widening of the
              conflagration in the region.<br><br>Obama left a two-hour meeting with
              the Joint Chiefs of Staff yesterday pledging to ensure that the
              military received the "resources and the support" to wage the wars
              being conducted by the United States. He told journalists he would soon
              be announcing "some difficult decisions that we're going to have to
              make surrounding Iraq and Afghanistan."<br><br>The essence of those
              decisions was indicated on Tuesday in the testimony of Defense
              Secretary Robert Gates before the Senate and House armed services
              committees. Obama's appointment of Gates marked the new president's
              unambiguous repudiation of the campaign rhetoric that appealed to broad
              antiwar sentiment among the American people. Gates served the Bush
              administration in the same post for the past two years and directed the
              escalation of the Iraq war from early 2007 to early 2008.<br><br>Gates
              told the senators: "There is little doubt that our greatest military
              challenge right now is Afghanistan. As you know, the United States has
              focused more on Central Asia in recent months. President Obama has made
              it clear that the Afghanistan theatre should be our top overseas
              military priority." The war in Afghanistan, he added, would be "long
              and difficult." The short-term time frame he placed on the conflict was
              "five years"?at least until 2014. He said an increase in US casualties
              was "likely" as operations are stepped-up against the anti-occupation
              insurgency being waged by loyalists of the former Taliban regime and
              other Afghan Islamist movements.<br><br><strong>Gates stressed that as the new
              administration escalates military action in Central Asia, it has no
              intention of withdrawing from Iraq. Warning that resistance could erupt
              again against US forces in Iraq, he said "there may be hard days ahead
              for our troops." Even if units designated as "combat" are pulled out
              roughly according to the 16-month schedule promised by Obama during the
              election, Gates emphasized that a sizeable force would remain and "we
              should still expect to be involved in Iraq on some level for many years
              to come."</strong><br><br>He told the Senate committee that Obama will send
              30,000 additional American troops to Afghanistan as soon as possible.
              The first of the four combat brigades requested last year by General
              David McKiernan, the commander of US and NATO forces in Afghanistan,
              has already taken up positions in areas to the east of the Afghan
              capital, Kabul. The 3,500 troops, from the 10th Mountain Division, have
              begun operations in the provinces of Wardak and Logar.<br><br>Analysts
              are predicting that Obama will order the 2nd Marine Expeditionary
              Brigade to deploy to Afghanistan by mid-spring. Another Marine brigade
              will follow by mid-summer. The final additional brigade will arrive
              before the end of the year.<br><br>The intensified fighting will not be
              confined to Afghanistan. The predominantly ethnic Pashtun Afghan
              insurgents have safe havens and derive support among the Pashtun
              population of Pakistan's Federally Administrated Tribal Areas (FATA).
              As a result, the US and NATO forces have been unable to prevent the
              Afghan resistance from launching daily attacks across entire swathes of
              southern Afghanistan and replenishing both its ranks and weapons.
              Large-scale US military strikes on the FATA and even more deeply into
              Pakistan are the logical outcome of Obama's determination to place
              Afghanistan under US control. It was "impossible," Gates declared,
              "to disaggregate Afghanistan and Pakistan, given the porous border
              between them." He left no doubt that the US military would continue to
              conduct air strikes inside Pakistan, regardless of the opposition of
              the Pakistani government and Pakistani people, on the pretext that the
              targets were linked to Al Qaeda.<br><br><strong>The primary motive for the 2001
              invasion of Afghanistan was not to fight terrorism, but to create a
              base for the assertion of US influence over the resource-rich former
              Soviet republics in Central Asia. During last year's presidential
              election, Obama served as the mouthpiece for factions of the American
              establishment that had concluded the preoccupation with Iraq had
              resulted in Central Asia coming too much under the political and
              economic sway of Russia and China.</strong><br><br>The re-emphasis on
              Afghanistan is intended to reverse this trend. Under the guise of
              securing supply routes for the increased US military force, intense
              diplomacy is taking place to establish access rights and military bases
              in Central Asian states such as Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. Currently,
              the bulk of US and NATO supplies to Afghanistan move through border
              passes in the FATA, where they are coming under increasing attack by
              insurgents. Following a NATO summit on Monday, the Russian government
              announced that it is prepared to allow its territory and air space to
              be used to transport US and NATO supplies into Afghanistan.<br><br>Gates's
              testimony also indicated a shift in the relations between the US and
              the puppet government it has installed in Kabul under President Hamid
              Karzai. Along with fighting "terrorism," the Bush administration
              justified the occupation of Afghanistan with constant references to
              bringing "democracy," "development" and "human rights" to the Afghan
              people.<br><br>Gates dismissed such claims on Obama's behalf, telling
              senators: "If we set ourselves the objective of establishing some sort
              of a Central Asia Valhalla over there, we will lose... because nobody
              in the world has that much time, patience or money, to be honest...."<br><br>A
              brutal real politik will define the Obama administration's policy in
              Afghanistan. Karzai's government is frequently derided in US foreign
              policy circles for its endemic corruption and its lack of popular
              support among the Afghan people. A more important reason for flagging
              US enthusiasm for its puppet Karzai is the latter's public criticisms
              of US air strikes that target and kill Afghan civilians. The Obama
              administration has every intention of escalating the bloodshed and will
              brook no interference from its client regime.<br><br>The New York Times
              reported on Wednesday that Obama may support a campaign to remove
              Karzai in the presidential election scheduled to be held in the country
              later this year. The alternative to attempts to create a strong central
              government is the Iraq "surge" model. The commander of US forces in
              Iraq, General David Petraeus?who now heads the US Central
              Command?authorized his officers in particular parts of Iraq to bribe
              insurgent leaders to change sides, in exchange for both money and a
              degree of local power.<br><br>In a similar fashion, sources close to
              the Obama administration told the Times that it "would work with
              provincial leaders as an alternative to the central government, and
              that it would leave economic development and nation-building to
              European allies, so that American forces could concentrate on the fight
              against insurgents."<br><br>The result of this policy could be greater
              tensions between the US and the European powers. During his testimony,
              Gates demanded that NATO member-states "step up to the plate" and
              provide more forces and resources for the war in Afghanistan.<br><br>Even
              with 30,000 extra American troops, the occupation force will still be
              severely under-manned. In the midst of the ongoing occupation of Iraq
              and an economic meltdown, however, Gates told the Senate that he was
              "skeptical" the US military could contribute "additional American force
              levels beyond what General McKiernan has already asked for."<br><br>Under
              Bush, NATO states, particularly Germany, France, Italy and Turkey,
              repeatedly rejected US requests that they dramatically increase their
              involvement in the Afghan conflict. They must now decide how to respond
              to the Obama White House.<br><br>A British Broadcasting Corporation
              correspondent commented on Tuesday: "If NATO allies falter now, the
              long-term implications in terms of separating the United States from
              Europe could be severe... The issue is emerging as a potential
              troubling one at the 60th anniversary summit [of NATO] to be held in
              early April."<br><br><strong>Millions of Americans were channelled into voting
              for Obama and the Democratic Party by the illusion that they would
              implement a decisive shift away from the militarism and neo-colonial
              interventions that marked the Bush years. Instead, they face an
              administration that is just as determined as Bush's to use brute
              military force to secure the economic and strategic interests of
              American imperialism.</strong> Countless thousands of Afghan and Pakistani
              lives, and those of hundreds if not thousands more American troops, are
              to be sacrificed in the process.<br><br>This reality underscores not
              only the debased character of "democracy" in the United States, but the
              necessity for a break with the two parties of US imperialism and a
              fundamental political reorientation of the working class toward a
              socialist and internationalist program.</p>

              <p>When the Taliban ruled Afghanistan, poppy production was zero. They reduced it to zero. Now, under the US occupation, Afghanistan again supplies the world with 90% of its heroin. Something smells fishy here.</p>
              <p>Sure close Guantanamo Bay, but lets make sure that ALL of the US's secret bases in Romania, Poland etc are also <em>revealed</em> and shut down as well.</p>

              <p>Good point. But evidently googoomuck isnt the kind of person who is able to process that kind of logic. To him, being a Muslim is probably enough to qualify someone as a terrorist. And what's more, they shouldnt be recognised as humans or treated as such.</p>

              <p>Most of these people were captured on the field of battle in Afghanistan, fighting the Americans. Some of these were actually in the process of conspiracy against the American government in foreign countries. The current legal status of the former are in a state of flux because they are not POWs. As a result, a new law will have to be drafted somehow to either try them or transfer them overseas where they can be tried or kept in more civil conditions.</p>

              <p><strong>Obama’s Torture Loopholes</strong></p>
              <p>by Prof. James  Hill</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/">Global Research</a>, January 26, 2009</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=va&amp;aid=12041">http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=va&amp;aid=12041</a></p>
              <p>On January 22, 2009, President Obama signed a number
              of executive orders purporting to end the Bush administration’s abusive
              practices in dealing with treatment of terrorism suspects.<span>  </span>Before
              Americans get too elated, however, they should look carefully at the
              inhumane interrogation practices these orders may still permit.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">When
              first announced, the new president’s executive orders seemed cause for
              celebration, prompting the American Civil Liberties Union to feature a
              link on its website encouraging visitors to email the president and
              “Send Him Thanks!”<span> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">The ACLU summarized the new orders:</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt 0.5in;">President
              Obama . . . ordered the closure of the prison camp at Guantánamo Bay
              within a year and the halting of its military commissions; the end of
              the use of torture; the shuttering of secret prisons around the world;
              and a review of the detention of the only U.S. resident being held
              indefinitely as a so-called “enemy combatant” on American soil. The
              detainee, Ali al-Marri, is the American Civil Liberties Union’s client
              in a case pending before the Supreme Court.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span>Like many reacting to the president’s orders, ACLU Executive Director Anthony Romero expressed unbridled enthusiasm:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt 0.5in;">These
              executive orders represent a giant step forward. Putting an end to
              Guantanamo, torture and secret prisons is a civil liberties trifecta,
              and President Obama should be highly commended for this bold and
              decisive action so early in his administration on an issue so critical
              to restoring an America we can be proud of again.<a rel="nofollow" name="_ednref1"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference" style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">[1]</span></a></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">Torture
              by US officials has long been illegal, but the president’s executive
              order entitled “Ensuring Lawful Interrogations” seems to clarify, to
              some extent, what activities are proscribed.<span>  </span>Disappointingly, though, this order contains loopholes big enough to drive a FEMA camp train through them.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><strong>Loophole 1: Torture is prohibited only of persons detained in an “armed conflict.”</strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">The executive order applies only to “armed conflicts,” not counterterrorism operations.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">The order states in part:</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt 0.5in;">Consistent
              with the requirements of the Federal torture statute, . . . the
              Detainee Treatment Act of 2005, . . . the [United Nations] Convention
              Against Torture, [the Geneva Conventions] Common Article 3, and other
              laws regulating the treatment and interrogation of individuals detained
              <em>in any armed conflict</em>, such persons shall in all circumstances
              be treated humanely and shall not be subjected to violence to life and
              person (including murder of all kinds, mutilation, cruel treatment, and
              torture), nor to outrages upon personal dignity (including humiliating
              and degrading treatment), whenever such individuals are in the custody
              or under the effective control of an officer, employee, or other agent
              of the United States Government or detained within a facility owned,
              operated, or controlled by a department or agency of the United States
              [emphasis added].</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">This sounds salutary: America should not torture people detained in armed conflicts.<span>  </span>But
              are such conflicts the only situations in which the US military,
              federal agencies, and private security companies can detain people
              today in the name of the war on terror?<span> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">Hardly.<span>  </span>Many US and foreign citizens have been detained in <em>counterterrorism operations</em>, which another of Obama’s January 22 executive orders carefully differentiates from <em>armed conflicts</em>.<span> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">In
              that other executive order, entitled “Review of Detention Policy
              Options,” a special task force is commissioned to review procedures for
              detention suspects.<span>  </span>This order clearly distinguishes between “armed conflicts” and “counterterrorism operations”:</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt 0.5in;">The
              mission of the Special Task Force shall be to conduct a comprehensive
              review of the lawful options available to the Federal Government with
              respect to the apprehension, detention, trial, transfer, release, or
              other disposition of individuals captured or apprehended in connection
              with <em>armed conflicts and counterterrorism operations</em>, and to
              identify such options as are consistent with the national security and
              foreign policy interests of the United States and the interests of
              justice.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">As the president has made this distinction, so should we.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">To
              date, counterterrorism operations have resulted in hundreds of arrests
              of persons in America and abroad, having nothing whatever to do with
              any armed conflict.<span>  </span>Does President Obama wish limits on what is done to these people when detained and interrogated?<span>  </span>His executive order on torture is silent on the issue.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">Moreover,
              we know that many Guantanamo detainees from Pakistan and Afghanistan
              were sold to US officials by bounty hunters paid up to $25,000 per
              detainee, regardless of innocence.<a rel="nofollow" name="_ednref2"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference" style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">[2]</span></a><span>  </span>Are these persons to be considered “individuals detained in [an] armed conflict”?<span>  </span>Or must they be arrested while fighting on the battlefield to fit this qualification?<span>  </span>Put
              differently, are blameless, uneducated goat herders who were sold into
              detention by warlords and mercenaries exempted from the president’s
              clarified prohibition of torture, simply because they never stepped
              foot on a battlefield?</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">Another concern is the US military’s deployment in American cities, which began on October 1, 2008, according to the Army Times.<a rel="nofollow" name="_ednref3"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference" style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">[3]</span></a><span>  </span>Perhaps this deployment is in preparation for social unrest in the event of an economic collapse.<span>  </span>If martial law were declared in America , how would citizens be treated?<span>  </span>What if they were detained in FEMA detention facilities?<span>  </span>Could they be tortured under the umbrella of “counterterrorism operations” because that is different from “armed conflict”?</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">To
              Americans wishing to remain free of torture, a far greater threat than
              detention during armed conflict is that resulting from what the federal
              government labels as counterterrorism operations, conducted both on US
              soil and overseas.<span>  </span>Unfortunately, President Obama has not yet clearly addressed torture in this category.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><strong>Loophole 2: Only the CIA must close detention centers.</strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">President
              Obama has ordered the CIA to close detention centers, except those
              “used only to hold people on a short-term, transitory basis,” which can
              stay open indefinitely.<span>  </span>Exactly how long a duration is “short-term” and “transitory” is unclear.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">The executive order states:</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt 0.5in;">The
              CIA shall close as expeditiously as possible any detention facilities
              that it currently operates and shall not operate any such detention
              facility in the future.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">This sounds wonderful, but what about other federal agencies?<span>  </span>Can
              the FBI, National Security Agency, Department of Homeland Security, and
              Defense Intelligence Agency maintain detention facilities where torture
              may occur?<span>  </span>Can private military contractors like Blackwater do so?<span>  </span>Under
              one interpretation of Obama’s executive order on torture, those
              facilities may still operate and even expand, provided the CIA doesn’t
              control them.<span>  </span>Is it cynical to suspect this could be window dressing?</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><strong>Loophole 3: Officials may still hide some detainees and abusive practices from the Red Cross.</strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">On the Red Cross’s monitoring of detainees, the executive order reads:</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt 0.5in;">All
              departments and agencies of the Federal Government shall provide the
              International Committee of the Red Cross with notification of, and
              timely access to, any individual detained <em>in any armed conflict</em> in the custody or under the effective control of an officer, employee,
              or other agent of the United States Government or detained within a
              facility owned, operated, or controlled by a department or agency of
              the United States Government, consistent with Department of Defense
              regulations and policies.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">Here
              again, if a detainee is not one captured on the battlefield by US
              soldiers in an armed conflict, Obama’s order provides no guidance as to
              his fate.<span>  </span>Government and private thugs may evidently
              still brutalize detainees obtained in counterterrorism operations and
              hide them from the Red Cross, unless and until the president issues a
              further executive order, or Congress passes a law, closing this
              loophole.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><strong>Loophole 4: Abuses not labeled “torture” may continue.</strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">Obama’s
              executive order on torture does not label any particular practice
              “torture,” but instead requires that future interrogation practices
              conform to those outlined in the Army Field Manual. This may be in
              deference to Bush administration officials who authorized procedures
              like waterboarding while simultaneously declaring, “ America does not
              torture.”<span>  </span>Debate in some circles will doubtless continue,
              therefore, over whether waterboarding; deprivation of food, water, and
              sleep; humiliation; and infliction of severe bodily pain and injury
              indeed constitute torture.<span> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">The executive order imparts the following limitations:</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt 0.5in;">Effective
              immediately, an individual in the custody or under the effective
              control of an officer, employee, or other agent of the United States
              Government, or detained within a facility owned, operated, or
              controlled by a department or agency of the United States, <em>in any armed conflict</em>,
              shall not be subjected to any interrogation technique or approach, or
              any treatment related to interrogation, that is not authorized by and
              listed in Army Field Manual 2-22.3 (Manual). Interrogation techniques,
              approaches, and treatments described in the Manual shall be implemented
              strictly in accord with the principles, processes, conditions, and
              limitations the Manual prescribes [emphasis added].</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt 0.5in;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">By
              this language, waterboarding and other harsh interrogation procedures
              are prohibited by implication because they are not authorized by the
              Army Field Manual.<span>  </span>But like other parts of Obama’s order, this prohibition apparently applies only to persons detained in an armed conflict.<span>  </span>As discussed above, we are left to wonder whether detainees grabbed in counterterrorism operations can continue being tortured.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><strong> </strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">The
              loopholes in President Obama’s executive order on torture may permit
              cruel abuses of prisoners to continue, using a legal parlor trick.<span>  </span>Labeling
              detainees the product of counterterrorism operations rather than of
              armed conflict, or holding detainees in detention facilities operated
              by entities other than the CIA, may allow government agents and private
              contractors conforming to the letter of the president’s order to
              continue practices most would consider torture.<span>  </span>The president should close these loopholes or explain to Americans why he won’t.</p>

              <p>WASHINGTON — The <a id="ORGOV000009" class="taxInlineTagLink" title="Central Intelligence Agency" href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/topic/politics/espionage-intelligence/central-intelligence-agency-ORGOV000009.topic">CIA</a>'s
              secret prisons are being shuttered. Harsh interrogation techniques are
              off-limits. And Guantanamo Bay will eventually go back to being a
              wind-swept naval base on the southeastern corner of Cuba.<br><br>But even while dismantling these discredited programs, <a id="PEPLT007408" class="taxInlineTagLink" title="Barack Obama" href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/topic/politics/government/barack-obama-PEPLT007408.topic">President </a><a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/politics/obama/">Barack Obama</a> left an equally controversial counterterrorism tool intact. <br><br>Under
              executive orders issued by Obama last week, <strong>the CIA still has authority
              to carry out what are known as renditions, or the secret abductions and
              transfers of prisoners to countries that cooperate with <a id="ORGOV0000001" class="taxInlineTagLink" title="United States" href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/topic/politics/government/national-government/united-states-ORGOV0000001.topic">the U.S.</a></strong><br><br>Current
              and former U.S. intelligence officials said the rendition program is
              poised to play an expanded role because it is the main remaining
              mechanism—aside from Predator missile strikes—for taking suspected
              terrorists off the street.</p>
              <p>The rendition program became a source of embarrassment for the CIA, and
              a target of international scorn, as details emerged in recent years of
              botched captures, mistaken identities and allegations that prisoners
              were turned over to countries where they were tortured.<br><br><strong>The
              European Parliament condemned renditions as an "illegal instrument used
              by the United States." Prisoners swept up in the program have sued the
              CIA as well as a subsidiary of <a id="ORCRP017215" class="taxInlineTagLink" title="Boeing Co." href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/topic/economy-business-finance/manufacturing-engineering/aerospace-manufacturing/boeing-co.-ORCRP017215.topic">Boeing</a></strong> <strong>Corp., which is accused of working with the agency on dozens of rendition flights.<br></strong><br>But
              the Obama administration appears to have determined that the rendition
              program was one component of the Bush administration's war on terrorism
              that it could not afford to discard.<br><br>The decision underscores
              the fact that the battle with Al Qaeda and other terrorist groups is
              far from over and that even if the U.S. is shutting down the prisons,
              it is not done taking prisoners.<br><br>"Obviously you need to preserve
              some tools, you still have to go after the bad guys," said an Obama
              administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity when
              discussing legal reasoning behind the decision. "The legal advisers
              working on this looked at rendition. It is controversial in some
              circles and kicked up a big storm in Europe. But if done within certain
              parameters, it is an acceptable practice."<br><br><strong>One provision in one
              of Obama's orders appears to preserve the CIA's ability to detain and
              interrogate terrorism suspects as long as they are not held long-term.
              The little-noticed provision states that the instructions to close the
              CIA's secret prison sites "do not refer to facilities used only to hold
              people on a short-term, transitory basis."</strong><br><br>Obama's decision to
              preserve the program did not draw major protests, even among
              human-rights groups. Leaders of such organizations said that reflects a
              sense, even among advocates, that the United States and other nations
              need certain tools to combat terrorism. <br><br>"Under limited
              circumstances, there is a legitimate place" for renditions, said Tom
              Malinowski, the Washington advocacy director for Human Rights Watch.
              "What I heard loud and clear from the president's order was that they
              want to design a system that doesn't result in people being sent to
              foreign dungeons to be tortured."<br><br>In his executive order on
              lawful interrogations, Obama created a task force to re-examine
              renditions to make sure that they "do not result in the transfer of
              individuals to other nations to face torture" or otherwise circumvent
              human-rights laws and treaties.</p>
