              <p><br>For Guantanamo Bay Detention Camp to close, Obama needs the co-operation of the various countries whose citizens have volunteered to join Osama bin Ladin and his Al Qaeda to help the Talibans to subjugate Afghanistan.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, none of the various countries are prepared to receive their citizens who were captured as "non-military combatants".</p>
              <p>With more then 200 over foreign citizens captured as "non-military combatants" during the sweep of the Talibans and Al Qaeda, where do you suggest that these captured foreign citizens be "housed" ?</p>
              <p>They are not US citizens arrested as civil criminals and subjected to US Civil Laws - to be housed in civilian prisons for hardcore US criminals, and neither does the US Civil Laws applicable to those fighting as "non-military combatants".</p>
              <p>This "state of limbo" is a result of the actions taken by Bush in response to the unprovoked attack by Osama bin Laden - on 9/11 - that saw more then 5000 civilian deaths from various nations - as a result of the destruction of the New York World Trade Center Twin Towers.</p>
              <p>For Obama to succeed in closing down Guantanamo Bay Detention Center, the governments from other nations should accept the return of these detainees - and should not treat them any worst than what these detainees had experienced in the hands of the US Guards.</p>
              <p>This is also a major concern for Obama's Government, as well as the US Congress who believed that some of the other Countries have prison systems that are known for prisoner abuses.</p>

              <div><strong>Obama's program of war</strong></div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>by James Cogan</div>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=va&amp;amp;aid=12089">http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=va&amp;aid=12089</a></p>
              <p>Within days of taking power, the Obama administration has made clear that it will escalate the war to subjugate the Afghan people, intensify US military strikes on targets inside Pakistan and continue the occupation of Iraq indefinitely. What is being prepared is a brutal escalation of US military violence in Afghanistan and a widening of the conflagration in the region.<br><br>Obama left a two-hour meeting with the Joint Chiefs of Staff yesterday pledging to ensure that the military received the "resources and the support" to wage the wars being conducted by the United States. He told journalists he would soon be announcing "some difficult decisions that we're going to have to make surrounding Iraq and Afghanistan."<br><br>The essence of those decisions was indicated on Tuesday in the testimony of Defense Secretary Robert Gates before the Senate and House armed services committees. Obama's appointment of Gates marked the new president's unambiguous repudiation of the campaign rhetoric that appealed to broad antiwar sentiment among the American people. Gates served the Bush administration in the same post for the past two years and directed the escalation of the Iraq war from early 2007 to early 2008.<br><br>Gates told the senators: "There is little doubt that our greatest military challenge right now is Afghanistan. As you know, the United States has focused more on Central Asia in recent months. President Obama has made it clear that the Afghanistan theatre should be our top overseas military priority." The war in Afghanistan, he added, would be "long and difficult." The short-term time frame he placed on the conflict was "five years"?at least until 2014. He said an increase in US casualties was "likely" as operations are stepped-up against the anti-occupation insurgency being waged by loyalists of the former Taliban regime and other Afghan Islamist movements.<br><br><strong>Gates stressed that as the new administration escalates military action in Central Asia, it has no intention of withdrawing from Iraq. Warning that resistance could erupt again against US forces in Iraq, he said "there may be hard days ahead for our troops." Even if units designated as "combat" are pulled out roughly according to the 16-month schedule promised by Obama during the election, Gates emphasized that a sizeable force would remain and "we should still expect to be involved in Iraq on some level for many years to come."</strong><br><br>He told the Senate committee that Obama will send 30,000 additional American troops to Afghanistan as soon as possible. The first of the four combat brigades requested last year by General David McKiernan, the commander of US and NATO forces in Afghanistan, has already taken up positions in areas to the east of the Afghan capital, Kabul. The 3,500 troops, from the 10th Mountain Division, have begun operations in the provinces of Wardak and Logar.<br><br>Analysts are predicting that Obama will order the 2nd Marine Expeditionary Brigade to deploy to Afghanistan by mid-spring. Another Marine brigade will follow by mid-summer. The final additional brigade will arrive before the end of the year.<br><br>The intensified fighting will not be confined to Afghanistan. The predominantly ethnic Pashtun Afghan insurgents have safe havens and derive support among the Pashtun population of Pakistan's Federally Administrated Tribal Areas (FATA). As a result, the US and NATO forces have been unable to prevent the Afghan resistance from launching daily attacks across entire swathes of southern Afghanistan and replenishing both its ranks and weapons. Large-scale US military strikes on the FATA and even more deeply into Pakistan are the logical outcome of Obama's determination to place Afghanistan under US control. It was "impossible," Gates declared, "to disaggregate Afghanistan and Pakistan, given the porous border between them." He left no doubt that the US military would continue to conduct air strikes inside Pakistan, regardless of the opposition of the Pakistani government and Pakistani people, on the pretext that the targets were linked to Al Qaeda.<br><br><strong>The primary motive for the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan was not to fight terrorism, but to create a base for the assertion of US influence over the resource-rich former Soviet republics in Central Asia. During last year's presidential election, Obama served as the mouthpiece for factions of the American establishment that had concluded the preoccupation with Iraq had resulted in Central Asia coming too much under the political and economic sway of Russia and China.</strong><br><br>The re-emphasis on Afghanistan is intended to reverse this trend. Under the guise of securing supply routes for the increased US military force, intense diplomacy is taking place to establish access rights and military bases in Central Asian states such as Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. Currently, the bulk of US and NATO supplies to Afghanistan move through border passes in the FATA, where they are coming under increasing attack by insurgents. Following a NATO summit on Monday, the Russian government announced that it is prepared to allow its territory and air space to be used to transport US and NATO supplies into Afghanistan.<br><br>Gates's testimony also indicated a shift in the relations between the US and the puppet government it has installed in Kabul under President Hamid Karzai. Along with fighting "terrorism," the Bush administration justified the occupation of Afghanistan with constant references to bringing "democracy," "development" and "human rights" to the Afghan people.<br><br>Gates dismissed such claims on Obama's behalf, telling senators: "If we set ourselves the objective of establishing some sort of a Central Asia Valhalla over there, we will lose... because nobody in the world has that much time, patience or money, to be honest...."<br><br>A brutal real politik will define the Obama administration's policy in Afghanistan. Karzai's government is frequently derided in US foreign policy circles for its endemic corruption and its lack of popular support among the Afghan people. A more important reason for flagging US enthusiasm for its puppet Karzai is the latter's public criticisms of US air strikes that target and kill Afghan civilians. The Obama administration has every intention of escalating the bloodshed and will brook no interference from its client regime.<br><br>The New York Times reported on Wednesday that Obama may support a campaign to remove Karzai in the presidential election scheduled to be held in the country later this year. The alternative to attempts to create a strong central government is the Iraq "surge" model. The commander of US forces in Iraq, General David Petraeus?who now heads the US Central Command?authorized his officers in particular parts of Iraq to bribe insurgent leaders to change sides, in exchange for both money and a degree of local power.<br><br>In a similar fashion, sources close to the Obama administration told the Times that it "would work with provincial leaders as an alternative to the central government, and that it would leave economic development and nation-building to European allies, so that American forces could concentrate on the fight against insurgents."<br><br>The result of this policy could be greater tensions between the US and the European powers. During his testimony, Gates demanded that NATO member-states "step up to the plate" and provide more forces and resources for the war in Afghanistan.<br><br>Even with 30,000 extra American troops, the occupation force will still be severely under-manned. In the midst of the ongoing occupation of Iraq and an economic meltdown, however, Gates told the Senate that he was "skeptical" the US military could contribute "additional American force levels beyond what General McKiernan has already asked for."<br><br>Under Bush, NATO states, particularly Germany, France, Italy and Turkey, repeatedly rejected US requests that they dramatically increase their involvement in the Afghan conflict. They must now decide how to respond to the Obama White House.<br><br>A British Broadcasting Corporation correspondent commented on Tuesday: "If NATO allies falter now, the long-term implications in terms of separating the United States from Europe could be severe... The issue is emerging as a potential troubling one at the 60th anniversary summit [of NATO] to be held in early April."<br><br><strong>Millions of Americans were channelled into voting for Obama and the Democratic Party by the illusion that they would implement a decisive shift away from the militarism and neo-colonial interventions that marked the Bush years. Instead, they face an administration that is just as determined as Bush's to use brute military force to secure the economic and strategic interests of American imperialism.</strong> Countless thousands of Afghan and Pakistani lives, and those of hundreds if not thousands more American troops, are to be sacrificed in the process.<br><br>This reality underscores not only the debased character of "democracy" in the United States, but the necessity for a break with the two parties of US imperialism and a fundamental political reorientation of the working class toward a socialist and internationalist program.</p>

              <p>Is 8 years so long a time that people actually believe the lie that the Afghan invasion was a response to 9/11? If that was the case, why were the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/1550366.stm">Afghan war plans already prepared even before 9/11 and US troops were already massing, ready to invade Afghanistan</a>?</p>
              <p>Bush may not SEEM to have the intelligence to think that far ahead, but Cheney's PNAC gang already outlined <a href="http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article1665.htm">the American Century of domination over Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, Libya and Lebanon years before 9/11 in order to remodel the Middle-East</a>. And guess what it needed? A "catalysing" event like a "new Pearl Habour", just 1 year before 9/11.</p>

              history of illegal drug markets, not only in scale, but also in the
              fact that it was done domestically, without international assistance</strong>,''
              he said. He added that Europe, where most Afghan heroin was consumed,
              had been ''stunningly dysfunctional'' in helping Afghan farmers who
              have sacrificed livelihoods and in moving to prevent new fields from
              springing up in other poor countries.</p>
              <p>United Nations narcotics officials are looking at three regions that may be tempted -- Myanmar, Pakistan and Central Asia.</p>
              <p>In
              an interview from the drug agency headquarters in Vienna, Mr. Arlacchi
              said he was skeptical about including Myanmar, formerly Burma, because
              Thailand and China have put tremendous pressure on the military junta
              there to control narcotics production. He said the ethnic groups in
              northern Myanmar who once were the largest poppy producers have instead
              turned to making chemical compounds. American experts agree that the
              greater problem now is synthetic drugs like ecstasy, which are becoming
              increasingly popular among young Asians.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">In Pakistan, Mr.
              Arlacchi said, the government, working with the United Nations, has
              completed one of its most successful eradication programs over the last
              two decades. ''Production is down to almost zero in the last few
              years,'' he said. </span></strong></p>
              <p>Central Asia, he said, has the most potential
              for poppy production. The United Nations has been working there with
              limited funds to cut down trafficking in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan,
              Uzbekistan and Tajikistan. In the last four months, more than two tons
              of heroin have been seized on the Tajikistan-Afghanistan border.</p>
              <p>''But
              even if in the long term this reduction of supply is a major success,
              <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>it will be sustainable only with a parallel reduction in the demand in
              the industrial countries</strong></span>,'' Mr. Arlacchi said. Narcotics experts say
              they do not see matching efforts in rich countries to cut use.</p>
              <p>''The
              prices of heroin and cocaine have been declining over 10 years,'' Mr.
              Arlacchi said. ''That trend will now be interrupted. Prices will
              increase without demand reduction, and there will be more powerful
              incentives to cultivators and traders.''</p>
              </div>
              <div class="timestamp">Mr. Starr, of Johns
              Hopkins, said special attention should be paid to Kyrgyzstan, parts of
              Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, as well as Xinjiang, in western China.
              ''Kyrgyzstan was the largest legal producer of opium poppies in the
              world during Soviet times,'' he said. Opium was used to make morphine
              for medicinal use. ''Presumably the people who made it work then are
              still on the ground -- and unemployed.''</div>

              <p><a href="http://www.infowars.com/defense-department-announces-civilian-expeditionary-workforce/">http://www.infowars.com/defense-department-announces-civilian-expeditionary-workforce/</a></p>
              <p>The Defense Department has established a "civilian expeditionary
              workforce" that will <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">see American civilians trained and equipped to
              deploy overseas in support of worldwide military missions. </span></strong></p>
              <p>The move is seen by some as an initial step towards
              fulfilling president Obama’s promise to form <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">a civilian national
              security force as powerful as the U.S. military. </span></strong></p>
              <p>The intent of the program “is to maximize the use of
              the civilian workforce to allow military personnel to be fully utilized
              for operational requirements,” according to a <strong><a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=52840">Defense                     Department report.</a></strong></p>
              <p>The program was officially implemented one week ago, on
              the 23rd January, when Deputy Defense Secretary Gordon England signed <strong> <a href="http://infowars.net/articles/january2009/Defense%20Department%20Directive%201404.10">Defense                     Department Directive 1404.10</a></strong> (PDF), which provides                     a summation of the duties the workforce will undertake.</p>
              <p>The directive, which is effective immediately, states
              that civilian employees of the DoD will be asked to sign agreements
              stating that they will deploy in support of military missions for up to
              two years if needed.</p>
              <p>Workforce members, who are divided into different
              designations under the directive, will serve overseas in support of
              humanitarian, reconstruction and, if necessary, combat-support
              missions.</p>
              <p>"If the employee does not wish to deploy, every effort
              will be made to reassign the employee to a nondeploying position." the
              DoD report states.</p>
              <p>While the directive suggests that the DoD will at first
              seek volunteers to serve in the civilian workforce, section 4,
              subsection (e) paragraph (2) states:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><em><strong>Management retains the authority to direct
              and assign civilian employees, either voluntarily, involuntarily, or on
              an unexpected basis to accomplish the DoD mission.</strong></em></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>In addition, the directive states that all workforce members will be
              subject to physical and psychological testing, both before and after
              deployment.</p>
              <p>The directive refers several times to the civilian workforce as a
              component of the "Total Force", which it describes as "The
              organizations, units, and individuals that compromise the DoD resources
              for implementing the National Security Strategy." This "Total Force"
              includes active, reserve and retired military personnel in addition to
              DoD civilian employees.</p>
              <p>Back in July 2008, Barack Obama, then the presidential front                     runner, <strong><a href="http://www.prisonplanet.com/obama-calls-for-national-civilian-stasi.html">called                     for a "civilian national security force"</a></strong> as powerful as the U.S. military.</p>
              <p>"We cannot continue to rely on our military in order to achieve the
              national security objectives we’ve set. We’ve got to have a civilian
              national security force that’s just as powerful, just as strong, just
              as well-funded," <strong><a href="http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt2yGzHfy7s">Obama                     told a Colorado Springs audience</a></strong>.</p>
              <p>The comments that were ignored by the vast majority of the corporate
              media but were <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">found to be troubling by some independent journalists
              who compared the idea to the formation of the Nazi Hitler Youth.</span></strong></p>
              <p>Fears of "youth brigades" or civilian stasi style units increased
              following Obama’s appointment of Rahm Emanuel to chief-of staff.</p>
              <p>In his book, "The Plan: Big Ideas for America," Emanuel writes:
              "It’s time for a real Patriot Act that brings out the patriot in all of
              us. We propose <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">universal civilian service for every young American.
              Under this plan, all Americans between the ages of 18 and 25 will be
              asked to serve their country by going through three months of basic
              training, civil defense preparation and community service."</span></strong></p>
              <p>The book also notes, "Some Republicans will squeal about individual
              freedom, ruling out any likelihood that they would let people opt out
              of universal citizen service."</p>
              <p>Emanuel is also an enthusiastic supporter of the <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Public_Service_Academy">United                     States Public Service Academy Act</a></strong>,
              a lobbying group founded in 2006 in order to promote the foundation of
              an American public service academy modeled on the military academies -
              a youth corps whose students would be trained in "civilian internship
              in the armed forces".</p>
              <p>Furthermore, in a rediscovered 2006 audio clip of an interview                     with Ben Smith of the New York Daily News, <strong><a href="http://www.prisonplanet.com/obamas-civil-defense-program-resembles-domestic-draft.html">Emanuel                     outlined the agenda</a></strong> for <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">compulsory military-style training</span></strong>, essentially a domestic draft,
              aimed at preparing Americans for a chemical or biological terrorist
              attack.</p>
              <p><strong>When controversy arose over the program last November, the use of
              the word "required" to describe the program <strong> <a href="http://www.prisonplanet.com/obama-website-scrubs-mandatory-community-service-call.html">was                     removed from Obama’s change.gov website</a></strong> and replaced                     with "community service" type terminology.</strong></p>
              <p>Though the civilian expeditionary workforce program is restricted to
              DoD employees, similar programs have already been established for
              public sector workers.</p>
              <p>One such program has seen hundreds of police, firefighters,
              paramedics and utility workers recently trained and dispatched as "<a href="http://www.propagandamatrix.com/articles/july2008/070208_stasi_informants.htm"><strong>Terrorism                     Liaison Officers</strong></a>"
              in Colorado, Arizona and California to <strong>watch for "suspicious activity"
              which is later fed into a secret government database. </strong></p>

              ordered $100,000 to be wired to Atta on September 10 and then have
              lunch the nexy day in D.C?</p>
              <p>Aren't you forgetting the cozy relationship between the CIA and
              the ISI since the 1980s? Even today, the ISI agrees to make noise

Before the war the Afghan opium was thought to have been grown in half the country's provinces, and with prices ranging up to US$1 00 per kilogram, it paid far better than any other cash crop. Production before the outbreak of the war was estimated at about 250 tons annually. Most opium cultivation was in the Pushtun areas of eastern Afghanistan, in Badakhshan, Nangarhar, and Paktia provinces</strong>. Every spring, poppy fields bloomed in profusion throughout the region, destined for markets in the United States, Europe, and the Middle East. Drug trafficking was thought to be worth between US$20 and US$100 million annually before the war. The other important items smuggled into Pakistan were lapis lazuli and lumber. Livestock was sold at a much higher price in Iran than in Afghanistan, and animals, therefore, constituted a major item smuggled into Iran, as was opium.</span> </span></span></p>

              <p>"Insider accounts published in the British, French and Indian media
                  have revealed that US officials threatened war against Afghanistan
                  during the summer of 2001. These reports include the prediction, made
                  in July, that “if the military action went ahead, it would take place
                  before the snows started falling in Afghanistan, by the middle of
                  October at the latest.” <strong>The Bush administration began its bombing
                  strikes on the hapless, poverty-stricken country October 7, and ground
                  attacks by US Special Forces began October 19.</strong></p>
              <p>It is not an
                  accident that these revelations have appeared overseas, rather than in
                  the US. The ruling classes in these countries have their own economic
                  and political interests to look after, which do not coincide, and in
                  some cases directly clash, with the drive by the American ruling elite
                  <strong>to seize control of oil-rich territory in Central Asia.</strong></p>
              <p>....</p>
              <p>The
                  pundits for the American television networks and major daily newspapers
                  celebrate the rapid military defeat of the Taliban regime as an
                  unexpected stroke of good fortune. They distract public attention from
                  the conclusion that any serious observer would be compelled to draw
                  from the events of the past two weeks: that the speedy victory of the
                  US-backed forces reveals<strong> careful planning and preparation by the
                  American military, which must have begun well before the attacks on the
                  World Trade Center and the Pentagon.</strong></p>
              <p>...</p>
              <p>This is only one of
                  countless lies emanating from the Pentagon and White House about the
                  war against Afghanistan. The truth is that the US intervention was
                  planned in detail and carefully prepared long before the terrorist
                  attacks provided the pretext for setting it in motion. If history had
                  skipped over September 11, and the events of that day had never
                  happened, it is very likely that the United States would have gone to
                  war in Afghanistan anyway, and on much the same schedule.</p>
              <p>....</p>
              <p>“Mr. Naik was told that Washington would launch its operation from
                  bases in Tajikistan, where American advisers were already in place.</p>
              <p>“He was told that Uzbekistan would also participate in the operation and that 17,000 Russian troops were on standby.</p>
              <p>“Mr.
                  Naik was told that if the military action went ahead it would take
                  place before the snows started falling in Afghanistan, by the middle of
                  October at the latest.”</p>
              <p>Four days later, on September 22, the <em>Guardian</em> newspaper confirmed this account. The warnings to Afghanistan came out
                  of a four-day meeting of senior US, Russian, Iranian and Pakistani
                  officials at a hotel in Berlin in mid-July, the third in a series of
                  back-channel conferences dubbed “brainstorming on Afghanistan.”</p>

              <p>Further light on secret contacts between the Bush administration and
                  the Taliban regime is shed by a book released November 15 in France,
                  entitled <em>Bin Laden, the Forbidden Truth</em>, written by
                  Jean-Charles Brisard and Guillaume Dasquie. Brisard is a former French
                  secret service agent, author of a previous report on bin Laden’s Al
                  Qaeda network, and former director of strategy for the French
                  corporation Vivendi, while Dasquie is an investigative journalist.</p>
              <p>The
                  two French authors write that the Bush administration was willing to
                  accept the Taliban regime, despite the charges of sponsoring terrorism,
                  if it cooperated with plans for the development of the oil resources of
                  Central Asia.</p>
              <p><strong>Until August, they claim, the US government
                  saw the Taliban “as a source of stability in Central Asia that would
                  enable the construction of an oil pipeline across Central Asia.” It was
                  only when the Taliban refused to accept US conditions that “this
                  rationale of energy security changed into a military one.”</strong></p>
              <p>By
                  way of corroboration, one should note the curious fact that neither the
                  Clinton administration nor the Bush administration ever placed
                  Afghanistan on the official State Department list of states charged
                  with sponsoring terrorism, despite the acknowledged presence of Osama
                  bin Laden as a guest of the Taliban regime. <strong>Such a designation would
                  have made it impossible for an American oil or construction company to
                  sign a deal with Kabul for a pipeline to the Central Asian oil and gas
                  fields.</strong></p>
              <p>Talks between the Bush administration and the
                  Taliban began in February 2001, shortly after Bush’s inauguration. A
                  Taliban emissary arrived in Washington in March with presents for the
                  new chief executive, including an expensive Afghan carpet. But the
                  talks themselves were less than cordial. <strong>Brisard said, “At one moment
                  during the negotiations, the US representatives told the Taliban,
                  ‘either you accept our offer of a carpet of gold, or we bury you under
                  a carpet of bombs’.”</strong></p>
              <p>...</p>
              <p>This account of the preparations for war against Afghanistan brings us
                  to September 11 itself. The terrorist attack that destroyed the World
                  Trade Center and damaged the Pentagon was an important link in the
                  chain of causality that produced the US attack on Afghanistan. The US
                  government had planned the war well in advance, but the shock of
                  September 11 made it politically feasible, <strong>by stupefying public opinion
                  at home and giving Washington essential leverage on reluctant allies
                  abroad.</strong></p>
              <p>...</p>
              <p>In the immediate aftermath of September 11, <strong>there were press
                  reports—again, largely overseas—that US intelligence agencies had
                  received specific warnings about large-scale terrorist attacks,
                  including the use of hijacked airplanes.</strong> It is quite possible that a
                  decision was made at the highest levels of the American state to allow
                  such an attack to proceed, perhaps without imagining the actual scale
                  of the damage, in order to provide the necessary spark for war in
                  Afghanistan.</p>
              <p>...</p>
              <p>This is not to say that the American government deliberately planned
                  every detail of the terrorist attacks or anticipated that nearly 5,000
                  people would be killed. <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">But the least likely explanation of September
                  11 is the official one: that dozens of Islamic fundamentalists, many
                  with known ties to Osama bin Laden, were able to carry out a
                  wide-ranging conspiracy on three continents, targeting the most
                  prominent symbols of American power, without any US intelligence agency
                  having the slightest idea of what they were doing."</span></strong></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>"We now know that a blueprint for the creation of a global Pax
                  Americana was drawn up for Dick Cheney (now vice-president), Donald
                  Rumsfeld (defence secretary), Paul Wolfowitz (Rumsfeld's deputy), Jeb
                  Bush (George Bush's younger brother) and Lewis Libby (Cheney's chief of
                  staff). The document, entitled Rebuilding America's Defences, was
                  written in September 2000 by the neoconservative think tank, Project
                  for the New American Century (PNAC).</p>
              <p><strong>The plan shows Bush's
                  cabinet intended to take military control of the Gulf region whether or
                  not Saddam Hussein was in power. It says "while the unresolved conflict
                  with Iraq provides the immediate justification, the need for a
                  substantial American force presence in the Gulf transcends the issue of
                  the regime of Saddam Hussein."</strong></p>
              <p>...</p>
              <p><strong>Fifteen of the 9/11 hijackers obtained their visas in Saudi Arabia. </strong>Michael Springman, the former head of the American visa bureau in
                  Jeddah, has stated that since 1987 the CIA had been illicitly issuing
                  visas to unqualified applicants from the Middle East and bringing them
                  to the US for training in terrorism for the Afghan war in collaboration
                  with Bin Laden (BBC, November 6 2001). It seems this operation
                  continued after the Afghan war for other purposes. It is also reported
                  that <strong>five of the hijackers received training at secure US military
                  installations in the 1990s</strong> (Newsweek, September 15 2001).</p>
              <p>...</p>
              <p>The catalogue of evidence does, however, fall into place when set
                  against the PNAC blueprint. From this it seems that the so-called "war
                  on terrorism" is being used largely as <strong>bogus cover for achieving wider
                  US strategic geopolitical objectives. </strong>Indeed Tony Blair himself hinted
                  at this when he said to the Commons liaison committee: <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">"To be truthful
                  about it, there was no way we could have got the public consent to have
                  suddenly launched a campaign on Afghanistan but for what happened on
                  September 11" (Times, July 17 2002). Similarly Rumsfeld was so
                  determined to obtain a rationale for an attack on Iraq that on 10
                  separate occasions he asked the CIA to find evidence linking Iraq to
                  9/11; the CIA repeatedly came back empty-handed</span></strong> (Time Magazine, May 13
                  2002).</p>
              <p>In fact, 9/11 offered an extremely convenient pretext to
                  put the PNAC plan into action. <strong>The evidence again is quite clear that
                  plans for military action against Afghanistan and Iraq were in hand
                  well before 9/11. </strong>A report prepared for the US government from the
                  Baker Institute of Public Policy stated in April 2001 that "the US
                  remains a prisoner of its energy dilemma. Iraq remains a destabilising
                  influence to... the flow of oil to international markets from the
                  Middle East". Submitted to Vice-President Cheney's energy task group,
                  the report recommended that because this was an unacceptable risk to
                  the US, "military intervention" was necessary (Sunday Herald, October 6
                  2002).</p>
              <p>...</p>
              <p>The conclusion of all this analysis must surely be that the "global war
                  on terrorism" has the hallmarks of a political myth propagated to pave
                  the way for a wholly different agenda - <strong>the US goal of world hegemony,
                  built around securing by force command over the oil supplies required
                  to drive the whole project.</strong> Is collusion in this myth and junior
                  participation in this project really a proper aspiration for British
                  foreign policy? If there was ever need to justify a more objective
                  British stance, driven by our own independent goals, this whole
                  depressing saga surely provides all the evidence needed for a radical
                  change of course."</p>

                          Western consumer goods were illegally brought into Afghanistan from
                          Pakistan, and they kept the bazaars of Kabul well supplied.
                          <strong>The most important item smuggled out of Afghanistan into
                          Pakistan was opium</strong>. <strong>The importance of the Afghan
                          opium crop increased in the 1970s. Before the war the Afghan opium
                          was thought to have been grown in half the country's provinces, and
                          with prices ranging up to US$1 00 per kilogram, it paid far better
                          than any other cash crop. Production before the outbreak of the war
                          was estimated at about 250 tons annually. Most opium cultivation
                          was in the Pushtun areas of eastern Afghanistan, in Badakhshan,
                          Nangarhar, and Paktia provinces</strong>. Every spring, poppy
                          fields bloomed in profusion throughout the region, destined for
                          markets in the United States, Europe, and the Middle East. Drug
                          trafficking was thought to be worth between US$20 and US$100
                          million annually before the war. The other important items smuggled
                          into Pakistan were lapis lazuli and lumber. Livestock was sold at a
                          much higher price in Iran than in Afghanistan, and animals,
                          therefore, constituted a major item smuggled into Iran, as was

              <p>"Insider accounts published in the British, French and Indian media have revealed that US officials threatened war against Afghanistan during the summer of 2001. These reports include the prediction, made in July, that “if the military action went ahead, it would take place before the snows started falling in Afghanistan, by the middle of October at the latest.” <strong>The Bush administration began its bombing strikes on the hapless, poverty-stricken country October 7, and ground attacks by US Special Forces began October 19.</strong></p>
              <p>It is not an accident that these revelations have appeared overseas, rather than in the US. The ruling classes in these countries have their own economic and political interests to look after, which do not coincide, and in some cases directly clash, with the drive by the American ruling elite <strong>to seize control of oil-rich territory in Central Asia.</strong></p>

              <p>Which insider account are you alluding to ?</p>
              <p>How reliable is the insider account and where is their sources of information, when you claim - (further paragraphs down) - that even the Bush Administration is not aware of the going on within the Government ?</p>
              <p>It will not be surprising if some smaller retaliatory attacks were already instituted for the brazen attacks that Osama Bin Laden's Al-Qaeda had made against US and the World Communities since 1993 - as listed in my last reply on Page 2 of this thread.</p>
              <p>Should we be surprised at your deliberate distortion of events ?</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>The pundits for the American television networks and major daily newspapers celebrate the rapid military defeat of the Taliban regime as an unexpected stroke of good fortune. They distract public attention from the conclusion that any serious observer would be compelled to draw from the events of the past two weeks: that the speedy victory of the US-backed forces reveals <strong>careful planning and preparation by the American military, which must have begun well before the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.</strong></p>
              <p>...</p>
              <p>This is only one of countless lies emanating from the Pentagon and White House about the war against Afghanistan. The truth is that the US intervention was planned in detail and carefully prepared long before the terrorist attacks provided the pretext for setting it in motion. If history had skipped over September 11, and the events of that day had never happened, it is very likely that the United States would have gone to war in Afghanistan anyway, and on much the same schedule.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>The truth is that the US had been planning to attack Al-Qaeda's training centers inside Afghanistan as they have been attacking US installations across the globe since 1993, and had even attempted to bomb the World Trade Center as early as in 1993.</p>
              <p>Yes, if the World Trade Center was not completely destroyed on that fateful day marked forever as  9/11 - the USA would have gone into attack mode if Al-Qaeda continue to hit with impunity at US facilities anywhere and everywhere on this globe.</p>
              <p>How many lives have already been lost - both US and other nationalities - in the various attacks that I have listed in my previous reply on Page 2 of this thread ?</p>
              <p>Do you think that the USA should sit idly by and absorb more of Al-Qaeda's attacks without planning any kind response ? </p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>“Mr. Naik was told that Washington would launch its operation from bases in Tajikistan, where American advisers were already in place.</p>
              <p>“He was told that Uzbekistan would also participate in the operation and that 17,000 Russian troops were on standby.</p>
              <p>“Mr. Naik was told that if the military action went ahead it would take place before the snows started falling in Afghanistan, by the middle of October at the latest.”</p>
              <p>Four days later, on September 22, the <em>Guardian</em> newspaper confirmed this account. The warnings to Afghanistan came out of a four-day meeting of senior US, Russian, Iranian and Pakistani officials at a hotel in Berlin in mid-July, the third in a series of back-channel conferences dubbed “brainstorming on Afghanistan.”</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Do you know that Uzbekistan has 90 percent of its population being Muslims ?</p>
              <p>Do you seriously believe that the political leadership will be in any position to have US forces on Uzbek soil without good reasons such as that provided by Al-Qaeda's actions of impunity at hitting US Military and Civilian targets ?</p>
              <p>If any attack plans were to be made prior to 9/11 against the Taliban controlled Afghanistan, it would have been the on-going planning to respond to Al-Qaeda's attacks at US Military and Civilian targets around the globe.</p>
              <p>Al-Qaeda's actions on 9/11 simply provided the urgent impetus to deal more seriously with Osama and his Al-Qaeda, which resulted in more re-evaluation made, detailed studies to determine the best strategy plans and methods to be employed.</p>
              <p>The final analysis resulted in less than 300 plus Special Forces personnel entering Afghanistan to work closely with the various Nationalist Forces fighting the Talibans.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Further light on secret contacts between the Bush administration and the Taliban regime is shed by a book released November 15 in France, entitled <em>Bin Laden, the Forbidden Truth</em>, written by Jean-Charles Brisard and Guillaume Dasquie. Brisard is a former French secret service agent, author of a previous report on bin Laden’s Al Qaeda network, and former director of strategy for the French corporation Vivendi, while Dasquie is an investigative journalist.</p>
              <p>The two French authors write that the Bush administration was willing to accept the Taliban regime, despite the charges of sponsoring terrorism, if it cooperated with plans for the development of the oil resources of Central Asia.</p>
              <p><strong>Until August, they claim, the US government saw the Taliban “as a source of stability in Central Asia that would enable the construction of an oil pipeline across Central Asia.” It was only when the Taliban refused to accept US conditions that “this rationale of energy security changed into a military one.”</strong></p>
              <p>By way of corroboration, one should note the curious fact that neither the Clinton administration nor the Bush administration ever placed Afghanistan on the official State Department list of states charged with sponsoring terrorism, despite the acknowledged presence of Osama bin Laden as a guest of the Taliban regime. <strong>Such a designation would have made it impossible for an American oil or construction company to sign a deal with Kabul for a pipeline to the Central Asian oil and gas fields.</strong></p>
              <p>Talks between the Bush administration and the Taliban began in February 2001, shortly after Bush’s inauguration. A Taliban emissary arrived in Washington in March with presents for the new chief executive, including an expensive Afghan carpet. But the talks themselves were less than cordial. <strong>Brisard said, “At one moment during the negotiations, the US representatives told the Taliban, ‘either you accept our offer of a carpet of gold, or we bury you under a carpet of bombs’.”</strong></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Should it be any surprise that neither the Bush nor Clinton administration placed the Talibans nor Osama bin Laden as a political entity that promoted terrorism before the 9/11 incident ?</p>
              <p>If at all, the previous US Administration during Ronald Reagan's days had embraced and supported the Talebans and Osama bin Laden in the joint battle against the Soviet forces occupying Afghanistan.</p>
              <p>From Reagan to Bush Jr - (it was one term for Bush Sr, and two terms for Clinton) - which amounted to a 12 year interlude that changed US support for Talebans against Soviet Occupation, to one of military threats to dismantle the Talebans and Al-Qaeda ?</p>
              <p>Can you even hope to be in any independent position to think for yourself the reasons for this sea-change in US policies ?</p>
              <p>By the standards displayed up until this page, it seems that you will prefer to use the information from the blogs posted by supporters of radical Islam.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>This account of the preparations for war against Afghanistan brings us to September 11 itself. The terrorist attack that destroyed the World Trade Center and damaged the Pentagon was an important link in the chain of causality that produced the US attack on Afghanistan. The US government had planned the war well in advance, but the shock of September 11 made it politically feasible, <strong>by stupefying public opinion at home and giving Washington essential leverage on reluctant allies abroad.</strong></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>The earlier plans to attack Afghanistan before 9/11 was due to the attacks made with such impunity by Al-Qaeda since the first car bombing attack inside the WTC in 1993, and the various Al-Qaeda's attacks at US Civilian and Military facilities and properties around the globe.</p>
              <p>The shock of September 11, 2001 simply made a counter attack more than necessary, it was a clarion call to action for all the dastardly unprovoked attacks that culminate the ten years of consistent and persistent attacks at US interests across the globe. </p>
              <p>Was public opinions stupefied by George Bush Jr public relation machinery, or was the brazen attack at the WTC on 9 /11 simply too stupefying that it even elicited condemnation from staunchly Islamic Governments that had previously refused to associate themselves closely to the USA ?</p>
              <p>Malaysia and Indonesia condemned it; and so did Saudi Arabia, Algeria, Libya, Morroco, Syria, Egypt, Jordan, Pakistan - and with the majority of <a rel="nofollow" href="http://groups.colgate.edu/aarislam/response.htm">Muslim reactions immediately after 9/11 destruction of WTC </a>being respectfully subdued and went unreported by the main mass media. </p>
              <p>It is so easy to distort events and opinions after a lapse of 8 years since 9/11, and new opinions can be reconstructed from the faded events that began since 1993.</p>
              <p>What is your agenda in this effort to propagate these new opinions perpetuated by unknown persons ?</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>In the immediate aftermath of September 11, <strong>there were press reports—again, largely overseas—that US intelligence agencies had received specific warnings about large-scale terrorist attacks, including the use of hijacked airplanes.</strong> It is quite possible that a decision was made at the highest levels of the American state to allow such an attack to proceed, perhaps without imagining the actual scale of the damage, in order to provide the necessary spark for war in Afghanistan.</p>
              <p>This is not to say that the American government deliberately planned every detail of the terrorist attacks or anticipated that nearly 5,000 people would be killed. <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">But the least likely explanation of September 11 is the official one: that dozens of Islamic fundamentalists, many with known ties to Osama bin Laden, were able to carry out a wide-ranging conspiracy on three continents, targeting the most prominent symbols of American power, without any US intelligence agency having the slightest idea of what they were doing."</span></strong></p>

              <p>US Congressional Committee that was formed by prominent Congressmen from both political parties were tasked to investigate all angles and all levels of the different roles of government agencies that led to this sordid event.</p>
              <p>The investigation had shown the lapses in the various intelligence agencies that had fought turf wars before and continued the relentless fight up to the date of the investigation. The various agencies had jealously guarded information that remained within their own domain and refused to share it beyond the perimeters of their building.</p>
              <p>The US Congressional Committee had even discovered that within the FBI alone, field operatives' reports of suspicious activities was left unattended by their superiors at FBI HQ, with some of these reports being dismissed.</p>
              <p>Conspiracy theories abound and if you can accept such conspiracy theories to be true, I wonder why no one give any credibility to the conspiracy theories of the monies that was supposed to have been lent to Indonesia when the late Indonesian President Suharto had faced a financial melt-down in 1997 and sought Singapore's help ?</p>
              <p>In a tightly controlled environment such as Singapore, where information is kept in SECRET into perpetuity, such conspiracies will never see the light of day.</p>

              <p>The catalogue of evidence does, however, fall into place when set against the PNAC blueprint. From this it seems that the so-called "war on terrorism" is being used largely as <strong>bogus cover for achieving wider US strategic geopolitical objectives.</strong> Indeed Tony Blair himself hinted at this when he said to the Commons liaison committee: <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">"To be truthful about it, there was no way we could have got the public consent to have suddenly launched a campaign on Afghanistan but for what happened on September 11" (Times, July 17 2002).

              <p>In fact, 9/11 offered an extremely convenient pretext to put the PNAC plan into action. <strong>The evidence again is quite clear that plans for military action against Afghanistan and Iraq were in hand well before 9/11.</strong> A report prepared for the US government from the Baker Institute of Public Policy stated in April 2001 that "the US remains a prisoner of its energy dilemma. Iraq remains a destabilising influence to... the flow of oil to international markets from the Middle East". Submitted to Vice-President Cheney's energy task group, the report recommended that because this was an unacceptable risk to the US, "military intervention" was necessary (Sunday Herald, October 6 2002).</p>

              <p>The war to capture Osama bin Laden and destroy Al-Qaeda had unexpectedly open new doors to new partnership, to face the potential threats from a rising China that is confident with her new found economic strengths, and to face the threats of a belligerent Iran.</p>

              <p>Which insider account are you alluding to ?</p>
              <p>How reliable is the insider account and where is their sources
              of information, when you claim - (further paragraphs down)
              - that even the Bush Administration is not aware of the going
              on within the Government ?</p>
              <p>It will not be surprising if some smaller retaliatory attacks
              were already instituted for the brazen attacks that Osama Bin
              Laden's Al-Qaeda had made against US and the World Communities
              since 1993 - as listed in my last reply on Page 2 of this
              thread.</p>
              <p>Should we be surprised at your deliberate distortion of events
              ?</p>
              <p>The truth is that the US had been planning to attack
              Al-Qaeda's training centers inside Afghanistan as they have
              been attacking US installations across the globe since 1993, and
              had even attempted to bomb the World Trade Center as early
              as in 1993.</p>
              <p>Yes, if the World Trade Center was not completely
              destroyed on that fateful day marked forever as
               9/11 - the USA would have gone into attack mode if Al-Qaeda
              continue to hit with impunity at US facilities anywhere and
              everywhere on this globe.</p>
              <p>How many lives have already been lost - both US and other
              nationalities - in the various attacks that I have listed in
              my previous reply on Page 2 of this thread ?</p>
              <p>Do you think that the USA should sit idly by and absorb more of
              Al-Qaeda's attacks without planning any kind response
              ? </p>
              <p>Do you know that Uzbekistan has 90 percent of its population
              being Muslims ?</p>
              <p>Do you seriously believe that the political leadership will be
              in any position to have US forces on Uzbek soil without good
              reasons such as that provided by Al-Qaeda's actions of impunity at
              hitting US Military and Civilian targets ?</p>
              <p>If any attack plans were to be made prior to 9/11 against
              the Taliban controlled Afghanistan, it would have been the on-going
              planning to respond to Al-Qaeda's attacks at US Military and
              Civilian targets around the globe.</p>
              <p>Al-Qaeda's actions on 9/11 simply provided the urgent impetus to
              deal more seriously with Osama and his Al-Qaeda, which
              resulted in more re-evaluation made, detailed studies to
              determine the best strategy plans and methods to be
              employed.</p>
              <p>The final analysis resulted in less than 300 plus Special Forces
              personnel entering Afghanistan to work closely with
              the various Nationalist Forces fighting the Talibans.</p>
              <p>Should it be any surprise that neither the Bush nor
              Clinton administration placed the Talibans nor Osama bin Laden as a
              political entity that promoted terrorism before the 9/11 incident
              ?</p>
              <p>If at all, the previous US Administration during Ronald Reagan's
              days had embraced and supported the Talebans and Osama bin
              Laden in the joint battle against the Soviet forces occupying
              Afghanistan.</p>
              <p>From Reagan to Bush Jr - (it was one term for Bush Sr,
              and two terms for Clinton) - which amounted to a 12 year
              interlude that changed US support for Talebans against Soviet
              Occupation, to one of military threats to dismantle the Talebans
              and Al-Qaeda ?</p>
              <p>Can you even hope to be in any independent position to
              think for yourself the reasons for this sea-change in US
              policies ?</p>
              <p>By the standards displayed up until this page, it seems
              that you will prefer to use the information from the
              blogs posted by supporters of radical Islam.</p>
              <p>The earlier plans to attack Afghanistan before 9/11 was due
              to the attacks made with such impunity by Al-Qaeda since the first
              car bombing attack inside the WTC in 1993, and the various
              Al-Qaeda's attacks at US Civilian and Military facilities and
              properties around the globe.</p>
              <p>The shock of September 11, 2001 simply made a
              counter attack more than necessary, it was a clarion call to
              action for all the dastardly unprovoked attacks that
              culminate the ten years of consistent and persistent attacks at US
              interests across the globe. </p>
              <p>Was public opinions stupefied by George Bush Jr public relation
              machinery, or was the brazen attack at the WTC on 9 /11
              simply too stupefying that it even elicited condemnation from
              staunchly Islamic Governments that had previously refused to
              associate themselves closely to the USA ?</p>
              <p>Malaysia and Indonesia condemned it; and so did Saudi
              Arabia, Algeria, Libya, Morroco, Syria, Egypt, Jordan, Pakistan -
              and with the majority of <a rel="nofollow" href="http://groups.colgate.edu/aarislam/response.htm">Muslim reactions immediately after 9/11 destruction of
              WTC </a>being respectfully subdued and went unreported by the
              main mass media. </p>
              <p>It is so easy to distort events and opinions after a lapse of 8
              years since 9/11, and new opinions can be reconstructed from the
              faded events that began since 1993.</p>
              <p>What is your agenda in this effort to propagate these new
              opinions perpetuated by unknown persons ?</p>
              <p>US Congressional Committee that was formed by prominent
              Congressmen from both political parties were tasked to investigate
              all angles and all levels of the different roles of government
              agencies that led to this sordid event.</p>
              <p>The investigation had shown the lapses in the various
              intelligence agencies that had fought turf wars before and
              continued the relentless fight up to the date of the investigation.
              The various agencies had jealously guarded information that
              remained within their own domain and refused to share it beyond the
              perimeters of their building.</p>
              <p>The US Congressional Committee had even discovered that within
              the FBI alone, field operatives' reports of suspicious activities
              was left unattended by their superiors at FBI HQ, with some of
              these reports being dismissed.</p>
              <p>Conspiracy theories abound and if you can accept such conspiracy
              theories to be true, I wonder why no one give any credibility to
              the conspiracy theories of the monies that was supposed to have
              been lent to Indonesia when the late Indonesian President Suharto
              had faced a financial melt-down in 1997 and sought Singapore's help
              ?</p>
              <p>In a tightly controlled environment such as Singapore, where
              information is kept in SECRET into perpetuity, such conspiracies
              will never see the light of day.</p>
              <p>Can the same be said of events in the USA - when Government
              archives are open to the public when it reaches the statutory
              period of 30 years ?</p>
              <p>Can conspiracy theories survive with information that is readily
              available ?</p>
              <p>Jeb Bush (George Bush Jr's younger brother) barely retained his
              Governor's seat, while Donald Rumsfeld was forced out of office,
              Paul Wolfowitz had to climb down from his Defense position and
              could not even hold on to his chair at the World Bank, Lewis
              Libby was prosecuted for lying to the Grand Jury, leaving Dick
              Cheney and George Bush to hold on to the torn pages of the
              supposed "<em>Pax Americana</em>" - if such a book can even be
              dreamed up by the brains of these two cowboys with blood flow
              constricted by tight boots that were undersized for their feet.</p>
              <p>So much for the "Pax Americana" speculation.</p>
              <p>This is not the first time that the CIA had made poor choices,
              and this is not a hallmark that is the preserve ground of the CIA,
              as the reputation of other National Spy Agencies have suffered
              as much in the hands of 'double-agents'.</p>
              <p>The Russian Spy ring that infiltrated the upper crust
              of Cambridge University providing leadership talents and
              materials to the UK Government had remained undetected for decades,
              and had its origins during the early days of Stalin's reign -
              and was exposed in the late 1960s, after a period of over
              forty years.</p>
              <p>Even to this day, there remain a Russian mole deep within
              the UK Intelligence Service that is thought
              to have existed and remain unknown; and time will simply
              see the mole being retired and perhaps any successor will be more
              easily detected.</p>
              <p>Is this anything new in the World of Spy vs Spy ?</p>
              <p>Was there any denial on the part of the US Government that the
              new arrangements with the Central Asian Governments that splintered
              from the old Soviet Russian Bloc had opened new partnership
              opportunities to face new political challenges in the 21st Century
              ?</p>
              <p>The war to capture Osama bin Laden and destroy Al-Qaeda had
              unexpectedly open new doors to new partnership, to face the
              potential threats from a rising China that is confident with her
              new found economic strengths, and to face the threats of a
              belligerent Iran.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, the new partnership that the USA had found with
              the Central Asian governments were not set in concrete, as most of
              the pacts have worn out the welcome and enthusiasm first given by
              these Central Asian host nations to USA.</p>
              <p>Where is the "<em>Pac Americana</em>" - when the key proponents
              are no longer in power, with George Bush Jr unable even to get any
              interest in his autobiography, nor obtain any interests in speaking
              tours as Bill Clinton had ?</p>
              <p>Where is the "Pac Americana" - when the USA is in debt up to its
              hair, and with Obama planning to spend its way out of the economic
              morass ?</p>
              <p>You would have sounded more credible if you were more
              discerning with your efforts. </p>
              <p>Unfortunately, the bogus is in the myth that you have created
              with your undiscerning propagating of a shrill and alarmist message
              that distorts conventions and reality.</p>
              <p>The line taken is so obvious that only the blind and the deaf
              cannot discern what you have preferred to perpetuate the distorted
              views by subverting the truth.</p>
              <p>The Bin Laden Family had never had any close ties with the black
              sheep of the family - Osama.</p>

              <p>The 1993 WTC attacks have already been shown to have been directed by Emad Salem, an ex-Egyptian intelligence agent and FBI informant. In fact it was the FBI that supplied him with explosives and instructions that led to the attack despite his relunctance. Another instance of a false-flag operation to increase the government's police powers.</p>
              <p>Al Qaeda itself was a creation of the CIA during the Afghan-Soviet wars and Bin Laden was the liason with the CIA. What better way to spread US imperialism round the world than to justify it with a war on terror, perpetuated by a CIA asset? This sea-change which you referred to, was indeed, sparked by the Afghan invasion, which of itself was a war to secure energy routes in Central Asia. Likewise, Iraq followed even though the US leadership knew that the WMD story was bogus.</p>
              <p>After 9/11, public opinion was stupified, to the extent that legislation eroding civil liberties, like Hitler's move to protect the Fatherland was welcomed after the false flag operation on the Reichstage, was rammed through Congress without even provoking any significant outrage. The US could wage two wars of aggression, not including any secret wars in Latin America and elsewhere, without much public outrage or action. Is this the reaction of a stupified public? Or is this simply democracy in action?</p>
              <p>And which government would not react the way they did afer 9/11? Would a Muslim country like Malaysia publicly declare to the US, "You had it coming!"? Isnt foreign relations a sham? Even if, for instance, Pakistani intelligence had connections to the Mumbai bombers, would they admit it? Of course, its always denial. Even if it benefited Singapore when anything unfortunate happens to its neighbours, we will always profess condolences. Likewise, with any nation. This thing that we call decorem amongst ourselves also exist between countries.</p>
              <p>If the Bin Laden family didnt have any ties to the supposed terrorist, why the need to fly them out immediately after the attack? If they had nothing to hide, could they provide the CIA with information about their black sheep brother?</p>
              <p>The Pax Americana didnt only exist after 9/11. Even during the 1990s, the US was taking steps to dominate the world with its actions in the Balkans, provoking a hapless Russia while Bush, Sr's New World Order was being created in the Middle-East. Its not only recently that American bases have encircled the globe. And this isn't imperialism? This isn't an empire?</p>
              <p>For an 'academic', I expected better ad hominem attacks. I'm sure you can do better.</p>

              <p>As a result of this July 2001 ban, opium poppy cultivation was reduced by 91% from the previous year's estimate of 82,172 hectares.

            <div class='col-md body'>Obama like previous US President Bush  create fear and will justfiy US killing in the so called "war on terror". In Afghanisatan and northern Pakistan, the bombing will continue just because of one man (alleged terrorist of 911). Most world leaders will parrot what are being said and support.  Taliban have not attacked anyone.  US and allies bombed Afghanistan and create the war from 2001. Taliban merely defending their country with light weapons (like mortars, RPG and IEDs).  Who are the aggressors with aircrafts, helicopters, tanks, armoured vehicles, etc? You think, if people come to your house and start shooting at your family members, do you welcome them with warm tea?  No, you will definitely fight.   So that is what Taliban are doing, fight.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Taliban was the government of the day before US &amp; allies invaded Afghanistan.  Yes there were infighting for control among the various tribes but Taliban was the winner, hence the authority of the country.  Just like Israel is the winner of all wars with its Arab neighbours.  Everyone knows that, just use some common sense and don't parrot what the west have been sayings about Taliban treatment of women, etc.</div>
