They distract public attention from the conclusion that any serious observer would be compelled to draw from the events of the past two weeks: that the speedy victory of the US-backed forces reveals</strong> <strong>careful planning and preparation by the American military, which must have begun well before the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.</strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><strong><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">This is only one of countless lies emanating from the Pentagon and White House about the war against Afghanistan. The truth is that the US intervention was planned in detail and carefully prepared long before the terrorist attacks provided the pretext for setting it in motion. If history had skipped over September 11, and the events of that day had never happened, it is very likely that the United States would have gone to war in Afghanistan anyway, and on much the same schedule.</span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Again this is a conclusion that you drawn from targeting OBL. </span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Atobe was right to point out that US has been planning to take out Al Qaeda training Camp. Prior to 9/11 the US military leader has repeatedly indicate within their leaders that they are not willing to involve any ground troops in Afghanistan. <span> </span><span> </span></span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span> </span>The CIA had to find alternate ways by working in conjuction with MI6 to fund Northern Alliance against their nature enemy Taliban in return alliance with Al Qaeda. The contact was officially known as "Northern Afghanistan Liaison Team". The Northern alliance (N.A.) was a mixed of <span> </span>ethnic Tajiks, Uzbeck, and Hazzara. (MI6 has already been working with N.A. since 1980 during the soviet invasion) <span> </span></span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Even after 9-11 the US still favor the plan to fund the Northern Alliance to fight a proxy war rather than fully involved. It shows that US was never really wanted a Full pledge WAR in Afghanistan to begin with.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Your conclusion has repeatly going against the actual events. <span> </span></span></p>

              <p class="q"><strong>Question:</strong> The former director of the CIA, Robert Gates,
              stated in his memoirs ["From the Shadows"], that American intelligence
              services began to aid the Mujahadeen in Afghanistan 6 months before the
              Soviet intervention. In this period you were the national security
              adviser to President Carter. You therefore played a role in this
              affair. Is that correct?</p>
              <p><strong>Brzezinski:</strong> Yes. According to the official version of history, CIA aid
              to the Mujahadeen began during 1980, that is to say, after the Soviet
              army invaded Afghanistan, 24 Dec 1979. But the reality, secretly
              guarded until now, is completely otherwise<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Indeed, it was July 3, 1979
              that President Carter signed the first directive for secret aid to the
              opponents of the pro-Soviet regime in Kabul. And that very day, I wrote
              a note to the president in which I explained to him that in my opinion
              this aid was going to induce a Soviet military intervention. </span></p>
              <p class="q"><strong>Q</strong>: When the Soviets justified their intervention by asserting that they
              intended to fight against a secret involvement of the United States in
              Afghanistan, people didn't believe them. However, there was a basis of
              truth. You don't regret anything today?</p>
              <p><strong>B:</strong> Regret what? That secret operation was an excellent idea.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> It had the
              effect of drawing the Russians into the Afghan trap and you want me to
              regret it? </span>The day that the Soviets officially crossed the border, I
              wrote to President Carter. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">We now have the opportunity of giving to the
              USSR its Vietnam war.</span> Indeed, for almost 10 years, Moscow had to carry
              on a war unsupportable by the government, a conflict that brought about
              the demoralization and finally the breakup of the Soviet empire.</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/articles/BRZ110A.html">http://www.globalresearch.ca/articles/BRZ110A.html</a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Very strange that USA got caught in a trap that it set up itself.</p>
              <p>They set a trap for USSR to rot in Afghanistan, but now end up they themselves rotting in Afghanistan.</p>
              <p>Don't understand them.</p>

              <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0525951016/ref=nosim/cryptogoncom-20">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0525951016/ref=nosim/cryptogoncom-20</a></p>
              <p><em>Blank Spots on the Map</em> is an expose of an empire that continues
              to grow every year—and which, officially, it isn’t even there. It is
              the adventurous, insightful, and often chilling story of a young
              geographer’s road trip through the underworld of U.S. military and
              C.I.A. “black ops” sites. This is a shadow nation of state secrets:
              clandestine military bases, ultra-secret black sites, classified
              factories, hidden laboratories, and top-secret agencies making up what
              defense and intelligence insiders themselves call the “black world.”
              Run by an amorphous group of government agencies and private companies,
              this empire’s ever expanding budget dwarfs that of many good sized
              countries, yet it denies its own existence.<br><br> Author Trevor
              Paglen is a scholar in geography, an artist, and a provocateur. His
              research into areas that officially don’t exist leads him on a
              globe-trotting investigation into a vast, undemocratic, and
              uncontrolled black empire—the unmarked blank areas whether you are
              looking at Google Earth or a U.S. Geological Survey map. Paglen knocks
              on the doors of CIA prisons, stakes out the Groom Lake covert air base
              in Nevada from a mountaintop 30 miles away, observes classified
              spacecraft in the night sky with amateur astronomers, and dissects the
              Defense Department’s multibillion dollar black budget. Traveling to the
              Middle East, Central America, and even around our nation’s capital and
              its surrounding suburbs, he interviews the people who live on the edges
              of these blank spots.<br><br> Paglen visits the widow of Walter Kazra,
              who, while working construction at Groom Lake, was poisoned by the
              toxic garbage pits there. The U. S. Air Force defense to his estate’s
              suit? The base does not exist. The U. S. Supreme Court declined to
              review the case. Whether Paglen reports from a hotel room in Vegas,
              Washington D. C. suburbs, secret prisons in Kabul, buried CIA aircraft
              in Honduras, or a trailer in Shoshone Indian territory, he is
              impassioned, rigorous, relentless—and eye-opening. This is a human,
              vivid, and telling portrait of a ballooning national mistake.</p>

                of disastrous adventure. I asked if he suggests to act immediately and I was shocked when
                I realized that he does. I said that if indeed Iraq will move into Syria with its army it
                will be a revolutionary turn which will ... justify far reaching conclusions, but for the
                time being this is only a danger, not a fact. It is not even clear if Shishakly will fall:

                precious and we must act so as not to miss an opportunity which otherwise might be lost
                forever. Again I answered that under the circumstances right now I cannot approve any such
                action. Finally I said that next Saturday we would be meeting with Ben Gurion ... and we
                could consult him then on the matter. I saw that he was extremely displeased by the delay.

              <h4 style="text-align: left;">Moshe Dayan posthumously speaks out on the Golan Heights</h4>
              <p> </p>
              <p>“Moshe Dayan, the celebrated commander who, as Defense Minister in
              1967, gave the order to conquer the Golan...[said]<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> many of the
              firefights with the Syrians were deliberately provoked by Israel</strong></span>, and
              the kibbutz residents who pressed the Government to take the Golan
              Heights did so less for security than for the farmland...[Dayan stated]
              <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>‘They didn’t even try to hide their greed for the land...We would send
              a tractor to plow some area where it wasn’t possible to do anything, in
              the demilitarized area, and knew in advance that the Syrians would
              start to shoot. If they didn’t shoot, we would tell the tractor to
              advance further, until in the end the Syrians would get annoyed and
              shoot.</strong></span></p>
              <p>And then we would use artillery and later the air force also, and
              that’s how it was...The Syrians, on the fourth day of the war, were not
              a threat to us.’” <em>The New York Times, May 11, 1997</em></p>
