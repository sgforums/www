              <p>Thats the understatement of the year. PAP has almost total control over the economy. DBS, Keppel Shipbuilding, Keppel Properties...I can keep going on and on.</p>

              <p>Restructuring wages is not the way to address rising costs?  Wow, we do have a genius up there.  A genius that recieved restructured wages albeit.</p>
              <p>He's right though. If the employer has to pay more for his manpower, where does he get his money from?  Costs of products or services rendered by the company would also increase.  This is gonna happen across the board, hence an upward spiral.</p>
              <p>Rising fuel and food costs is a hot potato around the world. No one has a true solution for it.  Don't expect the Men in White to have also. They aren't gonna take a pay cut for us, so we Lan lan suck thumb, suck in our stomach and tighten our belt.</p>
              <p>End of the day, cos we got no natural resource, and hardly produce anything, I fear we are gonna be the hardest hit of all.  We can either choose to be cheap, and attract more foreign investors looking to save money, or be caught in the upward spiral.</p>
              <p>Oh of course it would help if Temasek or GIC would start to look at investing in Singapore more instead of losing money elsewhere.</p>

              <p><br>When you have control, even partial control, market manipulation occurs.</p>
              <p>Take one example, when only Singtel is allowed to supply internet access services to business, they charge $400-500/mth for unlimited access plan but once Starhub is also authorize to do so, Singtel slash their prices to $99/mth. This means Singtel is still able to turn a profit at 80% price reduction (amid rising inflation)</p>
              <p>where did all that profit got? the stock holders (government) then in to the pockets of ministers as their 'salary'</p>
              <p>not raising wages means more profit from companies under government control so again translate to more money for minister's 'salary'</p>
              <p>If you do enough research, you will realised that private companies pay better than government link companies. It is only those working for the GLCs that really need the pay raise but in doing so would affect the minister's salary hence the announcement.</p>

              <p>... it seems the logic is that all <span style="color: #ff0000;">costs in services &amp; goods can increase</span>, but wages must be decreased to remain 'competitive'... this is to <span style="color: #ff0000;">keep the cost of labour low</span> in SG so that <span style="color: #0000ff;">foreign investors will stay</span>...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>... if you look at the above reasoning, do you see a contradiction?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>... I mean, of course if we are paid more then obviously services &amp; goods will increase as well...</p>
              <p>... but as it is now, with low wages of foreign talents and locals who fights to remain employed, are services &amp; goods any cheaper? ... no.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>... so, where's the solution? where's the logic?</p>
              <p>... obviously, the positive effects are better received and experienced by the rich and of course the boys in white who lives in their Ivory Towers...</p>
