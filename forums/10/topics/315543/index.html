              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Raising wages to address the issue of rising costs may
              be an enticing option but that is not the right solution, said Acting
              Manpower Minister Gan Kim Yong.
              <br> <br>He said adjusting wages upwards to meet rising prices would only
              result in a "price-wage spiral" and Singaporeans should look at the
              bigger picture.
              <br> <br>"What is more important is for us to have a realistic expectation
              of wages that reflect the underlying economic strength of our
              industries and also of our productivity. That will allow us to ensure
              that our economy will be able to sustain its growth momentum," said Mr
              Gan.
              <br> <br>Since the last two recessions, tripartite partners – the
              government, unions and employers – have been working hard to encourage
              companies to restructure their wage systems and to make them more
              flexible. This would allow companies to respond quickly when there is
              an economic downturn. <br> <br> One component that has been built into the structure is the monthly
              variable component (MVC). Mr Gan said this has worked well but more
              needs to be done.
              <br> <br>He said: "It is not an easy instrument to introduce because
              companies have to put in place certain mechanisms, particularly in the
              small and medium enterprises. Many of them take the position that in
              any case, their wages are quite flexible because they are small and
              nimble, and are able to adjust the wages as they go along.
              <br> <br>"We do acknowledge that some of these companies already have a
              flexible wage system in their own structure... but it is also important
              for us to look at other flexible components of the wage system,
              including reducing the ratio between minimum and maximum wages." <br> <br> A major preoccupation of the Manpower Ministry is to finalise
              Singapore's reemployment legislation which is expected to come into
              effect by 2012. <br> <br> Mr Gan has assured that it would not be a top-down approach – there
              will be widespread public consultation with both employers and unions
              before the final legislation is crafted.
              <br> <br>The acting manpower minister also said the feedback received so far
              has indicated that employers welcome the initiative and see the benefit
              of employing older workers.
              <br> <br>In fact, the employment rate of those aged between 55 and 64 went
              up by 3 percentage points from 2006 to reach almost 56 percent last
              year. The tripartite partners hope to achieve a 65 percent target by
              2012.
              <br> <br>Mr Gan said: "Employers are ready and willing to give it a try, and
              we are now helping them to introduce this system even ahead of the
              introduction of the legislation.
              <br> <br>"Drafting the legislation is not so difficult. What is difficult is
              to decide what are the criteria, terms within the legislation and this
              is something we have to work with the industry and unions so that we
              can arrive at some common understanding how reemployment is to be
              implemented." <br> <br> A tripartite work group has also been set up and it will visit
              companies to enhance the consultation process before the final law is
              introduced.

              Mr Gan has assured that it would not be a top-down approach â€“ there
              will be widespread public consultation with both employers and
              unions before the final legislation is crafted.<br>
              <br>
              The acting manpower minister also said the feedback received so far
              has indicated that employers welcome the initiative and see the
              benefit of employing older workers.<br>
              <br>
              In fact, the employment rate of those aged between 55 and 64 went
              up by 3 percentage points from 2006 to reach almost 56 percent last
              year. The tripartite partners hope to achieve a 65 percent target
              by 2012.<br>
              <br>
              Mr Gan said: "Employers are ready and willing to give it a try, and
              we are now helping them to introduce this system even ahead of the
              introduction of the legislation.<br>
              <br>
              "Drafting the legislation is not so difficult. What is difficult is
              to decide what are the criteria, terms within the legislation and
              this is something we have to work with the industry and unions so
              that we can arrive at some common understanding how reemployment is
              to be implemented."<br>
              <br>
              A tripartite work group has also been set up and it will visit
              companies to enhance the consultation process before the final law
              is introduced.<br>

              <h2>SDP’s May Day mesage</h2>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Gandhi Ambalam, Chairman,</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Singapore</span></strong><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"> Democratic Party</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"><span><br> </span></span></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Friends and fellow Singaporeans, </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">May Day is an annual event to honor the workers of the world.<span> </span>In Singapore, it is only appropriate that our workers, who hold up our economy, are honored and have their rights protected. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">There
              are about 2.5 million workers in Singapore. But they are left with no
              rights under the PAP which, ironically, came to power on the backs of
              our workers in 1959.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">After
              winning power, one of the first things that the PAP did was to remove
              some of those basic rights – the right to decent wages, the right to
              proper annual leave, medical care etc.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">What
              was worse, the PAP introduced draconian laws in the late 60s such as
              the Employment Act, the Trade Unions Act and the Industrial Relations
              Act to deny our workers their rightful entitlements.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">These
              three pieces of archaic legislation that are still being retained at
              present are in fact used by the employers to exploit our workers. In
              other words, our workers became victims of big business, including
              Government and Temasek-linked companies. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Over
              the years, instead of improving the lot of our workers, the PAP has
              further exploited them through the National Trades Union Congress.<br> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">The PAP set up the NTUC in 1961 after arresting trade unionists and deregistering their genuine trade unions that existed then.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">The
              NTUC has been a failure in representing the interests of our workers.
              Despite being around for 47 years, the NTUC has been able to bring
              under its fold only less than 20 per cent of our workforce. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">The
              NTUC seems to be everywhere and doing everything including running
              supermarkets, selling anything from insurance to duck rice, and even
              running massage and funeral parlors - everything except looking after
              the interests of our workers. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">What
              is most obnoxious is that NTUC is in collusion with the government to
              indiscriminately let in foreigners to take away the jobs of our
              workers. One-third, or more, of the workforce in Singapore is made up
              of foreigners. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">The uncontrolled influx of cheap foreign labor has led to our workers reduced to doing contract and casual jobs.<span> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">It
              is common to see our workers holding two jobs with long working hours
              just to survive. In contrast, our ministers demand millions of dollars
              in what they call salary.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">The
              PAP government manages one of the most centrally controlled economies
              in the world and it often intervenes and manipulates market forces with
              the result that our workers are left high and dry at the mercy of the
              employers.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">There’s
              no minimum wage. The PAP government and the NTUC are sacrificing the
              workers’ right to earn a decent living wage by retaining labor
              intensive industries whose needs are met by the foreign cheap labor.<span> </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Most of the jobs created go to foreigners, leading to economic hardship and displacement of Singaporeans.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">This downhill path of depending on cheap labor is badly hurting the morale of our workers and their productivity.<br> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Another bugbear is inflation that has hit a 26-year high.<span> </span>To
              a certain extent the problem is global. But the major responsibility
              for this high inflation has to be borne by the Government that has
              introduced a slew of increases for govt services including ERP
              gantries, GST, transport costs, hospital charges and exorbitant fees at
              institutions of higher learning while foreigners are provided with
              subsidized and free education with taxpayers’ money.<span> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">The
              continued neglect of Singaporeans have led to families finding it
              increasingly difficult to cope with the constant upping in the price of
              essentials while their incomes remain stagnant or further suppressed by
              the foreign cheap labor.<span> </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">School children
              go hungry because they can’t afford to pay for the food at the canteen.
              Can you imagine all this is happening in a First World country that
              Singapore claims to be?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">The Government claims that a record number of 234,900 jobs were created last year, up from 176,000 jobs in the previous year.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">But of these only 38 per cent of them went to locals, which include permanent residents.<span> </span>We are not given the unemployment rate for citizens.<span> </span><br> <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Here I remember what the founding chairman of the PAP, Dr Toh Chin Chye said some time back.<span> </span></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">He said that he
              did not believe the statistics and data put out by the government and
              that we don’t know whether we are on solid rock or thin ice!</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">But
              billions of dollars of our reserves are being used to rescue sinking
              Western banks and financial institutions ravaged by the sub-prime
              crisis.<span> </span>But when it comes to helping our poor with an additional $30 in allowance a month, extensive debate takes place.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">The
              Singapore Democratic Party wants our workers to regain their lost
              rights and free themselves from the clutches of the greedy,
              exploitative and dictatorial PAP and its approved NTUC.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">The fact that PAP ministers and MPs are running the union makes a mockery of the labor movement.<span> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Our workers must be allowed to form independent trade unions to protect their interests.<span> </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Employers,
              including those from the US, Germany and Japan have their own
              organizations in Singapore to ensure that their demands are met. But
              our workers have no say in their own country.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Forty-nine years of PAP rule and domination has led to a mass exodus of our bright and young to other countries.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">This is due to PAP’s economically, socially and politically stifling attitude.<span> </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Those who are unable to emigrate find themselves increasingly displaced by foreign workers who are prepared to accept low wages.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">What happened to PAP’s core value of placing community interest first before self?<span> </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Like other PAP
              promises of more good years, a golden period and that no one will be
              left behind, this one is also an empty rhetoric.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Let’s not be fooled by the PAP and its NTUC on this May Day.<span> </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">It’s time that we say enough is enough.<span> </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Let us unite to call for the repeal of the archaic and draconian anti-labor laws that shackle the labor movement.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">We
              are in a different age where innovation and creativity are crucial
              talents if our country is going to compete in the league of First World
              nations.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">To do this we cannot have a First World for the PAP with Third  World wages for our workers.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">On May 1, my colleagues and I will be at Toa Payoh Central to mark Workers’ Day.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">We will have the Tak Boleh Tahan petition calling on the Government to stop exploiting our workers.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Come and join us for the day and support the campaign. I look forward to seeing you.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Together, let us work towards a free and democratic Singapore where prosperity belongs to all. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Thank you.<span> </span>Happy MAY DAY. </span></p>

              <p>3. although cost in europe is higher, their salaries are also much higher giving them more nett income than asians. thats why when u see ang more in asia, you regard them like gods. like superior than you. because even a normal IT staff of europe are richer than the same asian counterpart, who surely earns less salary. Europeans still earn more even after minusing the tax and cost of living.</p>
              <p>4. its not really fair to say that the ERP here is lower than London's because the pore employees do not earn as much. Thus, its not right to have same high level of ERP toll which has been increasing.</p>

              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Raising wages to address the issue of rising costs may be an enticing option but that is not the right solution, said Acting Manpower Minister Gan Kim Yong.<br><br>He said adjusting wages upwards to meet rising prices would only result in a "price-wage spiral" and Singaporeans should look at the bigger picture.<br><br>"What is more important is for us to have a realistic expectation of wages that reflect the underlying economic strength of our industries and also of our productivity. That will allow us to ensure that our economy will be able to sustain its growth momentum," said Mr Gan.<br><br>Since the last two recessions, tripartite partners – the government, unions and employers – have been working hard to encourage companies to restructure their wage systems and to make them more flexible. This would allow companies to respond quickly when there is an economic downturn.<br><br>One component that has been built into the structure is the monthly variable component (MVC). Mr Gan said this has worked well but more needs to be done.<br><br>He said: "It is not an easy instrument to introduce because companies have to put in place certain mechanisms, particularly in the small and medium enterprises. Many of them take the position that in any case, their wages are quite flexible because they are small and nimble, and are able to adjust the wages as they go along.<br><br>"We do acknowledge that some of these companies already have a flexible wage system in their own structure... but it is also important for us to look at other flexible components of the wage system, including reducing the ratio between minimum and maximum wages."<br><br>A major preoccupation of the Manpower Ministry is to finalise Singapore's reemployment legislation which is expected to come into effect by 2012.<br><br>Mr Gan has assured that it would not be a top-down approach – there will be widespread public consultation with both employers and unions before the final legislation is crafted.<br><br>The acting manpower minister also said the feedback received so far has indicated that employers welcome the initiative and see the benefit of employing older workers.<br><br>In fact, the employment rate of those aged between 55 and 64 went up by 3 percentage points from 2006 to reach almost 56 percent last year. The tripartite partners hope to achieve a 65 percent target by 2012.<br><br>Mr Gan said: "Employers are ready and willing to give it a try, and we are now helping them to introduce this system even ahead of the introduction of the legislation.<br><br>"Drafting the legislation is not so difficult. What is difficult is to decide what are the criteria, terms within the legislation and this is something we have to work with the industry and unions so that we can arrive at some common understanding how reemployment is to be implemented."<br><br>A tripartite work group has also been set up and it will visit companies to enhance the consultation process before the final law is introduced.<br><br><br>- CNA/so</span></p>

              <p>The true cock and bull story is the SDP one, when has PAP ever MANIPULATED the market?</p>
              <p>Isn't it because they left it to market forces that people are kao-behing?</p>
              <p>So if the govt leaves it to the market, SDP will kao beh. If the govt attempts to MANIPULATE, also kao beh. What they want? Isn't a minimum wage a manipulation of the market?</p>
