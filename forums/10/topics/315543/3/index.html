              <h3 class="post-title entry-title">Singapore. Believe it or not, foreigners do not take jobs away from locals: PM</h3>
              <p>Ladies and Gentlemen,<br><br>According to the Singapore state controlled newspaper, the Straits Times of May 01, 2008, in the story <em>"Foreigners do not take jobs away from locals: PM", </em>Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_0" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew's son, the Prime Minister claims that the present island wide
              rampant anger among Singaporeans against foreign workers for taking
              their jobs is totally misplaced! On the contrary, he says, believe it
              or not, foreign workers actually help create more jobs! Wait a minute!
              Am I missing something here! I have read Alice in Wonderland but this
              statement beats even that!<br><br>As to how this can be true, defies
              logic. In fact it would have defied the most vivid imagination of a
              drug addict high on heroin!<br><br>In Singapore, there are about a
              million foreign workers, most of them engaged in the lower end lower
              skilled jobs. We all know that. We also know, there is no need for an
              employer to articulate a reason why foreign workers are to be admitted.
              They can be admitted in unlimited numbers. The only burden upon him is
              to pay the government a levy for each worker; thereby benefiting the
              government with increased revenue. Having done that he can pay the
              foreigner as low a wage as he wants, even $500.00 per month, if the
              impoverished foreigner will take it. In this manner of suppressing
              wages, Singaporeans looking for jobs cannot find any; and those already
              in jobs are fired, only to be replaced by a foreigner willing to accept
              even lower wages.<br><br>It should be quite clear to anyone with a head
              on his shoulders that foreigners take jobs away from Singaporeans and
              suppress wages to their detriment. Living standards of Singaporeans are
              lowered, they have less money, they and their families suffer, while
              employers benefit through lower wages and greater profits; and of
              course the government benefits through the collection of foreign worker
              levies. The sucker in this equation is the native Singaporean.<br><br>I
              have been told, it is in fact a disadvantage to be a Singaporean in
              Singapore. Imagine that! A disadvantage to be a citizen of his own
              country. I have been told from reliable sources that the first thing an
              employer asks a job applicant is whether he is a Singaporean. If he
              answers in the affirmative, there goes his job opportunity. In fact I
              have heard of the bizarre pathetic situation where desperate
              Singaporeans have in fact claimed that they were foreigners at job
              interviews, so as to increase their chances of landing the job! Such
              lack of compassion, such an uncaring, insensitive government can only
              be found in such a country like Singapore; with a Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_1" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew father and son dictatorship.<br><br>So
              one thing is quite obvious in this situation. This indiscriminate
              import of cheap labor in unlimited numbers benefits foreign workers,
              not Singaporeans, who are in fact, on a daily basis, kicked out from
              their jobs, only to be replaced by a cheaper foreigner prepared to work
              for less.<br><br>Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_2" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew's son, the Prime Minister, makes a preposterous assumption that
              Singaporeans are not prepared to take these jobs, and therefore it is
              no loss to them if some foreigner takes it. This statement cannot be
              further from the truth. It is in fact a shameless lie.<br><br>I have
              personally been told by Singaporeans, already working, that they were
              told to accept lower pay, or else they would lose it to a foreigner!
              Having no choice, to feed a family of wife and children, they are
              compelled to reluctantly accept lower wages or else they would lose the
              job altogether; with no other hope but starvation.<br><br>As a result
              of the government increasing the cost of living essentials; in order to
              make ends meet, one needs to have more money. This increase in wages,
              makes Singapore less competitive than neighbouring countries. But the
              government, in the light of the higher costs of living, should not hang
              on to the low cost assembly line jobs which were the norm. They should
              let it go and move on to high end high value added industry which pays
              higher wages. As Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_3" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew had himself said before, Singapore is the Switzerland of the east.
              And if so, the workforce should be paid Swiss wages with Swiss
              productivity levels and Swiss high tech high value added industry.<br><br>But
              that is not what this government is doing. Even though it is very clear
              that at today's costs, Singaporeans should have at least $3,000.00 per
              month, what Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_4" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew is trying to do is is to pay workers $300.00 per month instead. Clearly the sums do not add up.<br><br>In
              order to compete with third world cheap wage countries, Lee brings in
              cheap labor foreigners, paying them third world wages in Singapore. In
              these circumstances the unskilled Singaporean has no choice but to
              accept $300.00 a month or not eat at all.<br><br>And not satisfied with
              deliberately hurting the livelihood of the lower income Singaporeans,
              to rub salt into the wound, he makes fun of the plight of the poor by
              mocking them by his flippant remarks.<br><br>He says foreigners are not
              here to take jobs from Singaporeans but to enlarge the economic pie.
              This is a very uncaring hurtful remark especially for Singaporeans who
              have lost their jobs to cheaper foreign labor. As to how the economic
              pie is enlarged he does not elaborate. It is quite obvious he cannot.<br><br>To add insult to injury, he makes a joke out of the plight of those who have lost their jobs. He agrees with <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_5" class="blsp-spelling-error">Lim</span> Boon <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_6" class="blsp-spelling-error">Heng</span> the minister that foreign beer ladies attracted more customers instead
              of locals, presumably because they are beautiful and Singapore women
              are ugly! Is he now insulting Singapore women as being ugly and unable
              to attract male customers? He than enjoys a laugh at the expense of
              Singaporeans who have lost their jobs saying it is a good thing to have
              pretty (foreign) beer ladies who will encourage Singaporeans to drink
              more!<br><br>He says foreigners can work long hours seven days a week
              while Singaporeans cannot. Therefore foreigners are better workers who
              will reduce costs and increase productivity and profits. A slap in the
              face for every Singaporean; no doubt about it. Not satisfied that he
              denies Singaporeans jobs; he is determined to insult them as well!<br><br>He
              then says with the help of foreigners the airport seaport factories etc
              will remain open longer hours, implying that had it been Singaporeans
              working at these places, these facilities would have all shut down and
              gone out of business!<br><br>He then says that smaller unproductive
              businesses can remain in business by employing cheap foreign worker at
              the expense of Singaporeans. What sort of economic sense this makes
              does boggle one's mind!<br><br>And then in his usual gibberish, he
              claims that foreigners are in fact an asset to Singaporeans and that we
              should not complain at all when our jobs are taken from us!<br><br>Reading
              this deliberate insult to Singaporeans, it makes my blood boil. If it
              does yours, then it is about time you told him so very clearly and
              deliberately. Arrange with the Singapore Democratic Party to hold a
              peaceful assembly outside his office with banners and placards, in
              numbers exceeding 5, with a clear message to him to stop insulting the
              intelligence of Singaporeans. Contrary to what he may think,
              Singaporeans have a brain too.<br><br>Gopalan Nair</p>

              <p><strong>Industries urged to give foreign workers proper pay package<br>By May Wong, Channel NewsAsia | Posted: 05 May 2008 2053 hrs</strong></p>
              <p>    <br>  </p>
              <p>SINGAPORE: Industries need to provide proper remuneration and recognition to retain foreign workers in Singapore especially in the construction sector, according to Senior Minister of State for National Development, Grace Fu.</p>
              <p>She was responding to media queries on manpower shortage in this sector, which is expected to remain robust for the next two years.</p>
              <p>Ms Fu also gave an update on what the government is doing to help meet the demand for workers. This includes setting up more skills training centres overseas.</p>
              <p>She said: "By doing so, we're expanding the (pool of) workers, but at the same time, we want to make sure they are well-trained before they come over. So that's really striking a balance between having more supply and at the same time, ensuring that some minimum standards apply.</p>
              <p>"Over in Singapore, we're looking at how we could allow skilled foreign workers to stay on longer and the Ministry of Manpower has been very positive. They have made changes to legislation for example, to allow work permit holders to stay up to 18 years.</p>
              <p>"So with that we hope that the foreign workers will stay longer and hopefully there's a larger pool of experienced workers in Singapore to help supervise some of the newcomers. So we are expanding the number of workers, but not at the expense of safety."</p>
              <p>Ms Fu was speaking to reporters after opening the Construction Safety, Health and Security Campaign on Monday.</p>
              <p>She said Singapore's construction industry employs almost 300,000 workers, including those in managerial and technical positions.</p>
              <p>In 2007, for every 100,000 construction workers, there were 8.1 fatalities. The single largest cause of fatalities is falling from height, with 14 fatalities recorded last year.</p>
              <p>The Building and Construction Authority (BCA) carries out over 2,000 safety inspections annually. Last year, BCA revoked 51 permits issued to companies which failed to meet safety requirements.</p>
              <p>On legislation, Ms Fu said the government has decided to delay the scheme to license builders, which was originally planned for this October. However, this has since been postponed to next January after feedback from the industry.</p>
              <p>The scheme will ensure that only competent builders with the required resources and technical capability can carry out building works. - CNA/vm</p>

              <p><br>When you have control, even partial control, market manipulation occurs.</p>
              <p>Take one example, when only Singtel is allowed to supply internet access services to business, they charge $400-500/mth for unlimited access plan but once Starhub is also authorize to do so, Singtel slash their prices to $99/mth. This means Singtel is still able to turn a profit at 80% price reduction (amid rising inflation)</p>
              <p>where did all that profit got? the stock holders (government) then in to the pockets of ministers as their 'salary'</p>
              <p>not raising wages means more profit from companies under government control so again translate to more money for minister's 'salary'</p>
              <p>If you do enough research, you will realised that private companies pay better than government link companies. It is only those working for the GLCs that really need the pay raise but in doing so would affect the minister's salary hence the announcement.</p>

              <p>it does not help at a time of when Sporeans are witnessing an inflationary spiral never seen in decades  when we have GLCs who are monopolies providing BASIC amenities like PUBLIC Transportation, where fares can go UP on an annual basis despite record profits, making a mockery of the agencies such as case, ptc and  competition commission <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/smile.png" alt="smile.png"> .</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>lower incomes wages earners hard earned money got 'potong' because of the lack of competition and this is only one example.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Look at the COMPULSIVE and substantive increases in deposits to a get a easi link and cash cards. There is no ALTERNATIVE, they make u pay more with cash payment to take Public transport.</p>
