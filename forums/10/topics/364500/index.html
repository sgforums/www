              <h3 class="post-title entry-title">Singapore Island. The standoff.</h3>
              <p>Ladies and Gentlemen,<br><br>The
              standoff between the democracy activists and the Singapore Island
              dictatorship of Lee Kuan Yew continues. There are 19 human rights
              activists who are now on trial in Lee Kuan Yew's courts for staging a
              peaceful protest, the "Ta Boleh Tahan" (meaning we cannot take it
              anymore) in 2006 in front of Singapore's make believe Parliament.
              Except for 3 of the 19 who pleaded guilty for personal reasons, the
              rest remain defiant in their determination not to succumb and give this
              government a run for their money.<br><br>Lee Kuan Yew's ever willing
              Attorney General Walter Woon finds himself in a quandary. With the
              earlier trials against other peaceful protesters which had all
              backfired resulting in the government getting very bad publicity
              throughout the world for human rights violations for jailing peaceful
              protesters, they find the prospect of sending these 16 peaceful
              protesters to jail in this case would tarnish their already damaged
              reputation even further. Lee Kuan Yew's enforcer, Walter Woon would
              rather let all these protesters go for damage control if they would
              only plead guilty, but they are simply refusing to budge. <br><br>In
              the meantime, with this government not knowing what to do, they keep
              postponing the case, as if they rather keep the day of reckoning as far
              away as possible. As for these brave young men and women, they on their
              part refuse to let up, no matter how long the government keeps
              postponing the case. And the one that actually suffers the most are the
              island's taxpayers, as their money is being wasted in this totally
              unnecessary court case which simply refuses to end.<br><br>The message
              from this case should be very clear. This dictatorship has finally
              realized that there is a very high price to pay in the damage to their
              international image if they are seen repeatedly to throw peaceful
              protesters in jail.<span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> Each time they do it, it is picked up by the
              international press who relish the opportunity to paint this government
              in as bad a light as they can; not surprisingly since Lee Kuan Yew
              repeatedly sues them in his courts for no rime or reason. </strong></span></span><br><br>In
              this standoff between Singapore's human rights activists and Lee Kuan
              Yew, Mr. Lee appears now to be suffering from prosecution fatigue. He
              is now beginning to realize that abusing the law to jail peaceful
              protesters does not appear to deliver the desired results.<span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> Too many of
              these prosecutions against these innocent men and women tends to be
              counter productive, it angers the general public which see the
              government as bullies who go about punishing innocent victims. </strong></span></span><br><br>One
              example is the recent arrest of human rights activist Seelan Pallay and
              Kai Xiong who had demonstrated in front of the ministry of Manpower
              about 4 months ago, in support of Burmese nationals who were being
              deported. It appears that until today, the police have not taken any
              action against them, since nothing has been reported in the press. So
              finally, this government has seen the light, it seems. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Prosecuting them
              and sending them to jail would only tend to show this government even
              further as the ruthless intolerant fascist government that it is. </strong></span></span><br><br>At
              the present moment, this government finds itself hard put to charge
              anyone for any new peaceful protest incidents. They appear to have
              learnt their lesson finally which is, it hurts their image more to
              abuse the law repeatedly. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>There comes a point where fear turns to hate,
              and that is the point which this dictatorship has reached.<br></strong></span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br>So
              with the standoff now ongoing with these human rights activists and
              this dictatorship which relies on fear to stay in power, I feel that
              from this point on, Singapore's freedom fighters have the upper hand in
              peaceful protests. This government has finally become powerless. So
              seize the moment. I think you have the upper hand now.</strong></span></span><br><br>Gopalan Nair</p>

              <p>It is really hard to say which city is more livable.</p>
              <p>Why are singaporean who migrate to vacouver all stay at coquitlam? Why not stay at Burnaby and speak cantonese, or stay at surrey with the singh? go to the abedeen mall in richmond and you will wonder where are the native canadian? but who are native? the red indians or the caucasian? </p>
              <p>if you have money, anywhere is livable.</p>
              <p>if you come to singapore, board a taxi and you will always meet a singaporean uncle who speak good about singapore and bad about PAP. Everytime i took taxi in vancouver, the driver is a singh, just arrived, have to tell him the way. So far I have never taken two taxis driven by the same ethnic group in toronto, one italian, one polish, one pakistani, one hungarian.....and here is hear people say the government don't protect job for locals.</p>
