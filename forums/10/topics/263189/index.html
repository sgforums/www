            <div class='col-md body'>who says singapore is not creative!<br><br>En bloc<br>Uniquely Singapore<br>At a rate of one deal every three days, this property culture hardly exists anywhere else. By Seah Chiang Nee.<br>Jun 23, 2007<br><br>SINGAPOREÂ’S hot property market has developed a new culture rarely seen anywhere else in the world.<br><br>ItÂ’s something called Â“en bloc saleÂ”, in which a developer pays out a small fortune to owners of an expensive condo estate, tears it down and builds an even more expensive one.<br><br>In other parts of the world, the term Â– if used at all Â– would probably apply to slum clearance for commercial development, but it takes on a different form in this land-scarce city.<br><br>By this process of renewal, developers are squeezing values out of existing condos in exclusive areas to take advantage of a property boom.<br><br>An influx of funds from abroad and a re-rating of the cityÂ’s economic future have contributed to the frenzy.<br><br>It started soon after Singapore awarded contracts to build two high-end casino resorts and announced plans to attract the worldÂ’s rich and talented.<br><br>Collective sales last year hit a whooping S$8bil (RM18bil), turning thousands of homeowners into multi-millionaires almost overnight. (Indonesians and Malaysians have long been the two top investing groups here.)<br><br>The tempo intensified this year. In the first five months, 57 more condo projects Â– including relatively new ones Â– have changed hands for S$7.59b, almost reaching last yearÂ’s total.<br><br>It works out to one deal every three days.<br><br>Â“ItÂ’s spreading like wildfire. As soon as one price record is established, it is replaced by a higher figure,Â” said a real estate agent.<br><br>The action has mainly been confined to the exclusive Districts of 9, 10 and 11 in the centre and southern Singapore, the choice of wealthy investors.<br><br>The ripples are, however, felt in varying degrees by the rest of the island state, affecting even some public Housing and Development Board (HDB) flats, where 80% of the people live.<br><br>A collective sale allows owners to sell their properties for a much higher price than they can fetch individually on the open market. It must be approved by at least 80% of the residents.<br><br>One example is Farrer Court. Two years ago you could have bought a unit for S$460,000. Developers are offering owners S$2.8mil each in an en bloc deal for the 20-year-old estate.<br><br>Then a short distant away, the owners of Leedon Heights sold their homes for S$2.4mil (RM5.4mil) each.<br><br>Developers paid the residents of Char Yong Gardens in Cairnhill near Orchard Road S$1,788 per square foot (psf), a new benchmark.<br><br>That record lasted only a few days before another en bloc deal crossed the magical S$2,000 psf mark. The 24 owners of The Ardmore got an eye-popping S$11mil each in a S$262mil deal for the S$2,337 psf up-market property.<br><br>Until the recent revival, property had been languishing some 40% below its 1995 peak.<br><br>The pre-casino early birds who invested in the luxurious condo The Sail, a stoneÂ’s throw from the Sands resort, have already doubled their money.<br><br>With a projected 6% annual growth for the next few years and a projected population of six million to seven million, more foreigners are placing their bets on the island-state.<br><br>Their money is going into the stock market and properties.<br><br>Â“Singapore is a small place with limited land. Its size cannot expand but demand for land is growing,Â” a long-time agent once told me.<br><br>Â“As long as there is strong growth and stability, the demand for land here will outstrip supply.Â”<br><br>The en bloc strength underlies the industryÂ’s faith that at least for five to 10 years, the market will continue to be strong.<br><br>This uniquely Singaporean trend is raising activity in the general property market to a feverish pitch as some 10,000 en bloc beneficiaries Â– with a lot of cash Â– seek alternative homes.<br><br>Two of them just had record prices Â– S$675,000 and S$720,000 Â– in cash for five-room HDB flats, or S$150,000 higher than market valuation.<br><br>Few things in life are a one-way traffic, not even en bloc sales.<br><br>While the majority ends up a happier lot, a few who had bought their units at the height of the last boom may have ended up losers despite the high price.<br><br>Some elderly citizens who had grown too attached to their homes to want to sell were also compelled to move out Â– because 80% of the residents voted to sell.<br><br>The minority has no legal resort against the decision.<br><br>Broadly, Singaporeans welcome the rise in property values because 90% of them own their homes.<br><br>This is checked, however, by concern among the middle class of being left behind by a widening wealth gap.<br><br>While the values of private properties leap manifold, those of HDB homes move far more slowly.<br><br>Another group that worries about the boom is the thousands of young graduates just starting off in life who see the dream of owning a condo slipping away.<br><br>Â“At this rate we may not be able to afford even an HDB flat,Â” said an IT engineer who is saving to get married.<br><br>That, of course, would be a political disaster for the government, so it is closely monitoring the market to ensure enough cheap affordable homes for all.<br><br>Foreign funds can come and they can also go, so is the boom sustainable?<br><br>Some who believe it will end are planning to sell into strength. But, at least for now, the feeling is that the flourishing market is a re-rating of values rather than a property bubble.<br><br>The buyers are looking into a future global city of seven million affluent people who will need a lot of new homes.<br><br>(This article was first published in The Star, Malaysia, onJune 23, 2007)<br></div>
