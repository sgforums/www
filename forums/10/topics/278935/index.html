What are the ways to repay the debt? You may have even more questions.<br><br>Anybody who had studied economics would have known what public debt is.<br>If  you havenÂ’t , try DIY research, google like I did. If you can obtain information from other sources, better.<br><br>IÂ’m sure that after your research, you will be able figure out somehow so many policies that affect us has to do with money.

            <div class='col-md body'>"Singapores bond market is the best-developed in ASEAN and one of the most highly developed in Asia. The government has been issuing government bonds in recent years (despite posting budget surpluses) in an effort to build a yield curve in long-term debt. The aim is to increase further the depth and liquidity of the market, and to encourage listing by both domestic and foreign companies operating within Asia as a whole.

            <div class='col-md body'>Extract from an article - Growing in debt: Are we heading to a debt trap? By the Economist.com<br><br>Excessive accumulation of public debt can adversely affect the financial markets and the GovernmentÂ’s development efforts. In particular, interest payments on a large stock of public debt could constrain fiscal expenditure and prevent the Government from focusing on investments in physical and social infrastructure.<br><br>Moreover, a rising interest burden can easily allow public debt to spiral out of control. These concerns will, in turn, impair the autonomous management of the monetary policy by driving the monetary authority to increase inflation and lower interest rates.<br>-------------------------------------------------------------<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Back to the non-existent country Sunkenpore. Where else can she tap on to reduce government debt? LetÂ’s assume itÂ’s a non-welfare state (If itÂ’s a welfare state, the problem would be more complicated).<br><br>How about cutback on civil servantÂ’s pay to a level comparable to the countryÂ’s low income earners?<br>Or adjust the healthcare cost?<br>Or monkey with the immigration policy?<br></span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Another thing that shouldn't be overlooked is the incentive behind clearing public debts. This doesn't apply to dictatorships like this regime though.<br><br>Take the US for instance. Considering the fact numerous creditors (through the securities issued by the federal government) which the federal government (and its agencies) is indebted to are actually American firms, the need to service the national debt may not actually be as pressing. In truth, it might actually prove beneficial to the securities' holders that the government holds a sizable debt - through issuing securities - with such firms to stimulate economic growth and employment (through the prosperity of the creditors). A couple of Democrat presidential administrations (Franklin Roosevelt's public spending policies have its root in this) have actually utilised this principle in some form, shape or way.<br><br>Ironically, the 'demise' of a debt issuer often benefits the holder (tangibly and intangibly) and this pretty much holds at both governmental and corporate levels. This is clearly born out by the fact that a couple of prominent financial institutions' vast improvement in performances (most notably Goldman Sachs) in the aftermath of the burst of the dotcom bubble in the late 1990's.</div>
