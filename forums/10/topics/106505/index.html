Â“Their official dogma was contradicted by his reporting and they did not want to hear it,Â” said Roy Krieger, the officerÂ’s attorney.<br><br>CIA spokeswoman Anya Guilsher told the daily she could not comment on the lawsuit, adding: Â“The notion that CIA managers order officers to falsify reports is flat wrong. Our mission is to call it like we see it and report the facts.Â” Krieger wrote a letter requesting a meeting with CIA Director Porter Goss due to Â“the serious nature of the allegations in this case, including deliberately misleading the president on intelligence concerning weapons of mass destruction,Â” said the daily quoting from the letter.<br><br>The United States overthrew the Iraqi dictatorship of Saddam Hussein in April 2003, but has found no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq since then. The US government has acnowledged some of its pre-war intelligence may have been faulty. The plaintiff, whose identity is blacked out in the lawsuit as well as any reference to Iraq, is of Middle Eastern descent, worked 23 years in the Central Intelligence Agency, much of them in covert operations to collect intelligence on weapons of mass destruction, said the daily.<br><br>The lawsuit was filed in a US District Court in Washington on Friday and made public Wednesday after it was screened by a judge, said The Washington Post which obtained a copy. afp</div>
