              <div><strong>Overseas students don't want to work in
              Singapore</strong><br> <br> <img src="http://www.asiaone.com/a1media/news/07Jul09/images/20090728.182733_overseasstudents_myp.jpg" alt=""><br> <br> Jonah , 22, has been studying in US for less than a year, but he
              has already decided that he will not return to Singapore to work
              after graduation.<br> <br> A first-year student taking computer science at Stanford
              University, he says that US is far ahead of Singapore in science
              and technology. Situated near the Silicon Valley, Stanford's
              outstanding students are offered jobs by top IT firms even before
              they graduate.<br> <br> "They have the world's top firms like Google, Microsoft and Apple -
              companies that value creativity. Working for them will broaden my
              horizons and improve my resume," he told my paper.<br> <br> "While there are also many multi-national companies in Singapore,
              my impression is that they focus on product assembly, marketing and
              sales."<br> <br> According to a survey by Experiences 2009, the organiser of an
              annual US education convention, there are quite a lot of overseas
              students who think like Jonah.<br> <br> According to the survey of 153 Singaporean undergraduates at 15 top
              US universities, as many as 79 per cent prefer to work in US after
              they graduate. Only 18.1 per cent want to return to Singapore
              immediately after they complete their studies.<br> <br> At Chung Cheng High School's 70th anniversary celebration last
              month, Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong expressed his concerns about
              this phenomenon. He said that more than one-fifth of the students
              who performed well between 1996 to 1999 (those who scored at least
              four 'A's and a B3 in General Paper) are no longer working in
              Singapore a decade later.<br> <br> More than one third of those who studied overseas and did not
              receive scholarships are also not working in Singapore.<br> <br> In SM Goh's speech he pointed out Singapore's conundrum - while
              preparing our students to be 'entrepreneurial and world-ready', we
              are also 'growing wings' on them and more students will be heading
              overseas to develop their careers in future.<br> <br> <strong>Why they leave</strong><br> <br> Why has Singapore no hold for these students? Do they leave because
              the pull factors from other countries are much stronger?<br> <br> Students interviewed by my paper say that they leave not only
              because of the lack of job opportunities, but also because
              Singapore is too stressful, or because they don't feel
              appreciated.<br> <br> Ng Hui Jin, 20, a Biology student at Imperial College in UK said
              that the pace of life is so fast in Singapore she can barely catch
              her breath at times. She feels that Europeans place more emphasis
              on quality of life. The pace is slower there and her classmates do
              not compare their results.<br> <br> "Perhaps the learning environment and lifestyle here is what keeps
              Singaporean students in Europe," said Hui Jin.<br> <br> Ridy Lie, 28, who graduated from Carnegie Mellon in 2003 has worked
              at Amazon.com for six years. He said that he likes the free and
              easy culture in American IT companies. A software developer, he can
              wear t-shirt and jeans to work, and their supervisors do not
              require that they report to work by a certain time.<br> <br> "The company also provides a two-storey recreation area which
              includes a basketball court, arcade and gym. Our bosses even
              encourage us to spend our time there during work hours, to get
              inspiration."<br> <br> Higher pay also played a part in his decision to stay in the
              US.<br> <br> "Big IT firms in US will pay a fresh grad between US$60,000 to
              US$80,000 (S$87,000 to S$115,000) while investment banks and
              consultancies can pay up to US$90,000 (S$130,000), this is
              practically three to five times more than what they can get in
              Singapore."<br> <br> At least one student says that she wants to leave because she
              doesn't feel appreciated.<br> <br> After the financial crisis last year, many firms around the world
              retrenched a large number of employees and quite a number of
              graduates made their way back home but were unable to find a job in
              Singapore.<br> <br> London School of Economics graduate Ruchika Tulskyan, 22, applied
              to 20 companies for a job but received no response.<br> <br> "The government has been encouraging overseas students to return to
              Singapore, but Singaporean corporations do not seem to hold the
              same attitude. It has made me doubt my decision to come
              back."<br> <br> Disappointed, Ruchika has decided to further her studies at
              Columbia University next month.<br> <br> <strong>"Roots" and family ties</strong><br> <br> Jonah Tang observed that students from other countries such as
              Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan and India return home as they feel a
              greater sense of belonging.<br> <br> He thinks that Singaporean students are less patriotic, and feel no
              sense of "rootedness", so they can "grow roots" anywhere.<br> <br> But according to the survey by the organising committee of
              Experiences 2009, many students also said that they wish to return
              to Singapore three to five years after working overseas, for their
              families.<br> <br> For this same reason, Jonah Tang hopes to return after three or
              four years, provided there are suitable job opportunities.<br> <br> Li Wanzhen, 20, a first year LSE student, also thinks that in the
              long run, she will feel lonely and want to return home. But the
              economic conditions and whether there are attractive job
              opportunities will be an important consideration.<br> <br> Qiu Junxiong, 27, who studied in San Francisco, is one of those who
              returned one year after he graduated. He said that he returned to
              Singapore because there happened to be a suitable job
              opening.<br> <br> He thinks that if one wishes to develop a career in Asia, they
              should seriously consider returning to Singapore. After all, as
              Asians, they also have an advantage on their "home turf".<br> <br> "The government should not be unduly worried about brain drain,
              more Singaporeans now want to work in Asia instead. They are happy
              to use Singapore as their base, and will return every few months,
              instead of staying in Europe or the States for many years."<br> <br> <strong>Government efforts in retaining talent</strong><br> <br> The government has also invested resources in efforts to connect to
              overseas Singaporeans. The National Population Secretariat (NPS)
              set up the Overseas Singaporean Unit (OSU) in 2006 to help overseas
              Singaporeans maintain contact with Singapore.<br> <br> An NPS spokesperson told my paper that with the increasing
              globalisation, many Singaporeans are choosing to study, work and
              live abroad. More than 180,000 are now studying or working overseas
              and 63 per cent of them are between 20 to 54 years old.<br> <br> Singaporeans go overseas to expand their horizons or gain
              experience, but whether they maintain contact with Singapore is one
              of the critical factors that determine whether they return.<br> <br> They have observed that more Singaporeans have returned in recent
              years, hoping to ride on Singapore's economic growth. The response
              to "Singapore Day" organised by OSU in various cities around the
              world has also become increasingly popular.<br> <br> Source: <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.asiaone.com/News/Education/Story/A1Story20090728-157641.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">http://www.asiaone.com/News/Education/Story/A1Story20090728-157641.html</span></span></a></div>

              <p>It doesnt come as a surprise that our schooling system fails to produce creative, independent and well-rounded citizens since the role of schooling here is not to educate, but to increase the job-readiness of the people here. Note that I use "schooling" and not "education" because those 2 are distinct and we only have the former in Singapore.</p>
              <p>For instance, maybe the reason why Singapore has yet to produce a Nobel Laureate is because the only time we learn something new is in the context of studying for an examination. While that may be a generalisation, trends in our society doesnt seem to refute it. Learning is separated from having fun, evident in the duality of work-play used by our social institutions.</p>
              <p>On a personal level, I experience this a lot. Whenever I'm seen reading about issues such as geopolitics, social problems etc, the first question which my friends would ask would be "Why are you studying GP?" as if broadening one's mind and expanding one's level of information has already been encapsulated into a so-called 'academic' subject.</p>
              <p>Coming back to Singapore's schooling system, from the start of a child's schooling, it is a system that does not make children WANT to learn, and instead FORCES the child to learn. Already, that destroys a lot of a child's natural curiosity and impulse to learn. Multiply that for the ten years of primary and secondary schooling and you'll instill an aversion to learning. As a result, an entire generation, possessing tremendous potential, looks at learning as a drudgery, a chore that our society imposes on them. </p>
              <p>Going to school becomes a mechanical and unenjoyable affair devoid of real growth as an informed citizen capable of critical thinking, self-reflection and depth of imagination, instead, we are trained to have whatever mediocre skills needed to function in an increasingly corporate-dominated world.</p>
              <p>While school fails to provide a genuine sense of growth, children leave school only to fall prey to our corporate-driven media culture that produces materialistic, hedonistic, self-centered and dissatisfied consumers, uninformed about the state of affairs of the world at large and incapable of questioning underlying assumptions that govern our society. We are producing consumers and workers, not thinkers and problem solvers.</p>
              <p>For those who are interested on the dumbing down effects of our schooling system, you could research the work of John Taylor Gatto.</p>

              <p>Ppl on the streets no matter where they turn, they can't seem to escape from students badgering  for donations. it's actually doing the community a disservice!!</p>

              <p>It doesnt come as a surprise that our schooling system fails to produce creative, independent and well-rounded citizens since the role of schooling here is not to educate, but to increase the job-readiness of the people here. Note that I use "schooling" and not "education" because those 2 are distinct and we only have the former in Singapore.</p>
              <p>For instance, maybe the reason why Singapore has yet to produce a Nobel Laureate is because the only time we learn something new is in the context of studying for an examination. While that may be a generalisation, trends in our society doesnt seem to refute it. Learning is separated from having fun, evident in the duality of work-play used by our social institutions.</p>
              <p>On a personal level, I experience this a lot. Whenever I'm seen reading about issues such as geopolitics, social problems etc, the first question which my friends would ask would be "Why are you studying GP?" as if broadening one's mind and expanding one's level of information has already been encapsulated into a so-called 'academic' subject.</p>
              <p>Coming back to Singapore's schooling system, from the start of a child's schooling, it is a system that does not make children WANT to learn, and instead FORCES the child to learn. Already, that destroys a lot of a child's natural curiosity and impulse to learn. Multiply that for the ten years of primary and secondary schooling and you'll instill an aversion to learning. As a result, an entire generation, possessing tremendous potential, looks at learning as a drudgery, a chore that our society imposes on them. </p>
              <p>Going to school becomes a mechanical and unenjoyable affair devoid of real growth as an informed citizen capable of critical thinking, self-reflection and depth of imagination, instead, we are trained to have whatever mediocre skills needed to function in an increasingly corporate-dominated world.</p>
              <p>While school fails to provide a genuine sense of growth, children leave school only to fall prey to our corporate-driven media culture that produces materialistic, hedonistic, self-centered and dissatisfied consumers, uninformed about the state of affairs of the world at large and incapable of questioning underlying assumptions that govern our society. We are producing consumers and workers, not thinkers and problem solvers.</p>
              <p>For those who are interested on the dumbing down effects of our schooling system, you could research the work of John Taylor Gatto.</p>

              <p>You are certainly very insightful in knowing that education about family result in 'low birth rates'.</p>
              <p>Such education is also known as "Family Planning".</p>
              <p>This will result in population shrinkage, which will affect the manpower pool available to an economy, and cause a stunted economic prospects - which result in poor employment prospects too.</p>
              <p>Think about it - who has caused the present situation that began with Family Planning.</p>
