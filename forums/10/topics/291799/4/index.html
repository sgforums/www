The chinese leaders do care for the welfare of the large population in China.   Though the country is so many times bigger than Singapore they  are willing to give pension to the people and people who are 70 and above don't need to pay when they travel on public transport.   The chinese government care and put into action to take care of the people but our PAP gahmen don't take care and put into action to take money away from us.</div>
