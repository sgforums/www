We pledged US$5 Billion to Indonesia and US$1Billion to Thailand in loans during the Asian Financial crisis in 1997 to supplement IMF efforts. Japan had pledged US$5 Billion as well. It seems that that amount pledged was never loaned out as IMF funds were not exhausted.<br><br>Chee decided to inflate the amount to US$ 10-12 Billion ? He accused GCT and LKY of loaning the money to Suharto. "Where is the S$18 billion that you have lent to Suharto?"</div>
