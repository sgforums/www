Every visit I make to China Â– and I made 27 visits in the past 30 odd years Â– I see different people... <span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Their thinking, aspirations, the determination at which they are acquiring new knowledge, leave me no doubt that this is a society on the move</span></span>, and we should position ourselves to connect with China."<br><br>He added that Singapore will also adjust programmes in schools to produce 1,000 students each year, who are effectively bilingual and bi-cultural.<br><br>The minister mentor said Singaporeans need three capabilities to do business in China.<br><br>These three points are fluency in the Chinese language, knowledge of China's traditional culture and an understanding of the socio-political, economic and lifestyle changes of <span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">a society in transition Â– from an agricultural economy to an industrial one</span></span>.<br><br>Premier Wen, who spoke at the National University of Singapore, said that China will continue on its reform and open up its economy. It will also play its part in tackling climate change.<br><br>He added that Business China is a meaningful platform. "Young Singaporeans must be like the older generations and continue to uphold and promote traditions; open up and keep abreast of the world's latest innovations," said the Chinese premier.<br><br>Mr Wen also answered wide-ranging questions from students and participants on the housing and stock market situation in China.<br><br></blockquote></span><br><br><span style="color: darkred;">Yes, China is on the move - and in the familiar traditional manner of self-criticism, the leadership has the wisdom to look inward at their present organisational structure, their system, their methods - to find the strengths and weaknesses, and chart into new territories.<br><br>Can Singapore afford to wait 30 to 40 years time to learn from China ?<br><br>Is LKY contradicting himself here, when he is saying that China is already progressing in the fast lane, in a hurry to <span style="font-style: italic;">''transform from an agricultural base to an industrial one''</span> ?<br><br>At present, China has a satellite surveying the moon, that will dovetail into the plan of <a href="http://www.thechinamogul.com/2007/10/chinas-goal-to-put-man-on-moon.html" rel="nofollow">landing a Chinese onto the surface of the moon in 15 years</a>.<br><br>Can Singapore hope to match the new China, if we continue with our old ways, and refused to acknowledge that the sum total intelligence of the Singaporean citizens far outweigh that of a political elitist cult to lead Singapore into the future ?<br><br>Can Singapore hope to catch up if the leadership will not respond to constructive criticism, nor even look at their own failings and weaknesses, but will only loudly depend on its past successes, staking its reputation on past laurels achieved ?<br><br></span><br><br></div>
