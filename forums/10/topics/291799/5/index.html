He is synonymous with SDP. Present day SDP won't be what it is without his efforts and presence. Good or bad i leave for others to judge. Sometimes i wonder what would happen in Sembawang had he not stepped in.<br><br>We recall that WP was about to contest Sembawang with Poh Lee Guan doing some ground work. Chee decided to go in and capitalise on the NKF issue with him priorly accusing the government of covering up the issue. We also recall that 5 years prior to that he had made the accusation that LKY and GCT had misleaded parliament into making a loan to Suharto. Same modus operandi...SDP suffered a resounding defeat.<br><br>Now he has started soliciting for funds as we can see from many threads here, including this one. He has openly criticised WP and we have never seen Singaporeans that split about opposition parties. Good or bad i leave for others to judge. As long as he remains in politics, he can sway votes. However, is he diminishing support for PAP or is he fighting for a larger share of the pie that the opposition holds.</div>

The eight democratic parties are: Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, China Democratic League, China National Democratic Construction Association, China Association for Promoting Democracy, Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party, China Zhi Gong Dang, Jiu San Society and Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League.''<br><br>A-3<br>''Based on the principle of "long-term coexistence, mutual supervision, treating each other with sincerity and sharing each other's weal and woe," the CPC and the eight democratic parties work hand in hand in developing socialism with Chinese characteristics, thus giving rise to the basic feature of "multi-party cooperation system under the leadership of the CPC, with the CPC holding power and the other eight parties participating fully in state affairs."<br><br>A-4<br>''The multi-party cooperation system shows unique political advantage and strong vitality, and plays an irreplaceable role in China's political and social life.''</span><br><span style="color: darkred;">{A-1 to A-4: will contrast the attitude that of the Singapore's Ruling Party, who simply has no respect towards the Alternative Parties}</span><span style="color: darkgreen;"><br><br>A-5<br>''The political history and practice of modern and contemporary China prove that the construction of democratic politics in China must proceed from the country's basic conditions, and blind emulation of the political or party systems of any other country will never succeed; and that <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">dictatorship will also end in failure</span></strong>, as it is against the law of historical development and the people's will.''<br><br>A-6<br>''In a liberal, stable and harmonious political atmosphere, the CPC maintains wide political cooperation with the democratic parties, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">attends to their political and material interests</span>, </strong>and unites with them in the march forward.''<br><br>A-7<br>''The CPC and the other eight democratic parties supervise each other. Such supervision is political supervision exercised through exchanging views and airing criticisms and suggestions. <strong>Since the CPC is the leading and ruling party, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">it needs particularly supervision from the democratic parties more than the other way round</span></strong>.''</span> <span style="color: darkred;">{This must surely make the tinpot supporters red in the eye.}</span> <span style="color: darkgreen;"><br><br>A-8<br>''The multi-party cooperation system has created a new form of political party system in the world, a unique system by itself. Under this system, the CPC and the democratic parties work closely together and supervise each other, instead of opposing each other.''</span> <span style="color: darkred;">{This is the courage and self-confidence of a New China, to formulate a system that is answerable to the People, and not to a cult of self-annointed Elites}</span><span style="color: darkgreen;"><br><br>A-9<br>'' This system accords with the system of people's congresses to ensure that the <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">people are the masters of the state</span>, rather than a democracy for a minority of people</strong>.''</span><br><span style="color: darkred;">{It looks as if China studied and rejected the Singapore Political Model. Is China referring to the 66.6% majority in a democracy for only 1,000,000PLUS Singaporeans out of an electorate of of  3,000,000 PLUS ? China ought to be congratulated for its astute ability to discern flawed democracy.}</span><span style="color: darkgreen;"><br><br>A-10<br>''Without democracy there can be no socialism, let alone socialist modernization.''<br><br>A-11<br>''The CPC aims to serve the people wholeheartedly, and represents the fundamental interests of the overwhelming majority of the Chinese people.''<br><br>A-12<br>''One major feature of China's socialist democracy is the combination of democratic election and democratic consultation. In China, the people's congress system and the multi-party cooperation system under the leadership of the CPC supplement each other. That the people exercise their democratic rights through election and voting and that consultation is conducted among people of all walks of life <strong>to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">achieve consensus as much as possible before any significant decisions are made</span> are two important ways to realize socialist democracy</strong>.''<br><br>A-13<br>''Full political consultation both takes into account the opinions of the majority and shows respect to the reasonable requirements of the minority, thus guaranteeing democracy of the widest scope and promoting the harmonious development of society.'' </span><br><span style="color: darkred;">{Paragraphs A9-A13 must be the understatement of the year - if seen from the Singapore context}</span><span style="color: darkgreen;"><br><br>A-14<br>''In the new historical circumstances, one of the key jobs for developing socialist democracy is <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">adhering to and improving the multi-party cooperation system</span></strong> under CPC leadership, which <strong>entails expanding the orderly political participation of citizens, broadening the channels for the expression of social interest and fostering harmonious social development</strong>.''<br><br>A-15<br>''It is a key part of the multi-party cooperation system under the leadership of the CPC that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">democratic party members take leadership positions in government and judicial organs</span>.'' </span><br><span style="color: darkred;">{Surely, Singapore's Government aka Ruling Party has alot more to learn from China now ?}</span><span style="color: darkred;"><br><br></span></blockquote></span><br><br></div>
