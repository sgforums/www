            <div class='col-md body'>There is really <strong>No big change </strong>, it was originally 2 years.  Later Government   extended NS  by another 6 months - <strong>without a national consensus</strong>. <strong>Most Singaporeans were terribly upset and dead AGAINST it.</strong><br><br>If NS cut to 12 months -  that  will be seriously considered as government's  genuine concern for the financial hardship and inconvenience sufffered by many Singaporeans because of lengthy NS.<br><br>Take a look at these countries which have NS like us -<br><br>Countries with mandatory military service<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Austria</span><br>In Austria, compulsory military service applies to all male citizens from 18 to 36 years of age (with some exceptions), in which the basic military service must be done. The duration of the basic military service is <strong>eight months</strong>. This can either be done in one go, or as a service of six months with regular weapon exercises of several days as member of the Miliz until the duration of eight months is reached.<br><br>Military alternative service or civil service is possible in place of the compulsory military service. Its duration is 12 months and can be performed at different organizations.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">China (PRC)</span><br>The People's Republic of China has conscription for both men and women. Women who are conscripted go to the army for <strong>two months</strong> and learn to fire guns. .<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Finland</span><br>As of 2004, Finland has mandatory military service of at least <strong>six months</strong>, depending on the assigned position: those trained as officers serve for twelve months, specialty troops serve for nine months, and other rank and file serve for six months. Women can serve, if they choose. Civilian service of 13 months is available in lieu of military service. Men who opt for neither are sent to open prison where they may work and study for a period of six months.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Germany</span><br>Germany has a mandatory military service of <strong>nine months</strong> for men. Women may volunteer and are allowed to perform the same jobs as men. A conscientious objector may write a petition requesting permission to do a civilian "substitute service",  which is usually accepted, whereupon he is expected to serve 10 months. Overall, however, during the past few years, the number of men being drafted has declined significantly.<br><br>German law provides several options for conscientious objectors to perform alternative public service instead of a weapons-based military service:<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Greece</span><br>As of 2002, Greece (Hellenic Republic) has a mandatory military service of <strong>18 months</strong>. However, <strong>it is developing a professional army system, and it is widely expected that the mandatory military service will be abolished soon, </strong>with some ranks serving for 14 or 16 months in recent times. Greek soldiers fire a gun during the first two months of their service.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Israel</span><br>Israel has mandatory military service for both men and women who hold Israeli citizenship. It is the only country which currently practices female conscription.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Lebanon</span><br>Lebanon has a mandatory military service of <strong>one year </strong>for men.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Malaysia</span><br>As of 2004, Malaysia has a mandatory national service of <strong>three months</strong> for a selected group of both men and women. 20% of 18-year-olds are selected through a lottery system to join this program. Trainees will not be trained using firearms. The first training date is Feb 16, 2004.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Norway</span><br>Norway has mandatory military service for men (women can volunteer) of <strong>6, 9 or 12 months</strong>. Pacifists can apply for alternative service.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Russia</span><br>As of 2002, Russia (Russian Federation) has a mandatory two-year draft but most Russians avoid it.  Only 11 percent of Russian men enter mandatory military service.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Singapore</span><br>Singapore has one of the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">longest mandatory military service </span>for males, at two and a half years.</strong> As of Jan 2005, it will be reduce by 6 months.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">South Korea</span><br>As of 2002, South Korea has a mandatory military service of <strong>26 months</strong>.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sweden</span><br><strong>Less than a third </strong>of the Scandinavian country's eligible 19-year-olds are actually drafted each year.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Switzerland</span><br>Switzerland has the largest militia army in the world (200 000 including reserves). Military service for Swiss men is obligatory according to the Federal Constitution, and includes <strong>17 weeks</strong> of basic training as well as annual 3-week-refresher courses until a number of service days which increases with rank (300 days for privates) is reached. Service for women is voluntary, but identical in all respects. Conscientous objectors can choose 450 days of community service instead of military service. Medical deferments and dismissals from basic training (often on somewhat dubious grounds) have increased significantly in the last years. Therefore, only about 33% of Swiss men actually complete basic training.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Taiwan (ROC)</span><br>As 0f 2004, The Republic of China has implemented mandatory military service for all males since 1949. Females in the outlying islands of Fujian must also serve. Beginning January 2004, the mandatory service has been shortened by two months.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Canada</span><br><strong>In Canada conscription has never taken place in peace-time.</strong> Conscription became an extremely controversial issue during both WWI and WWII, especially in the province of Quebec.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">France</span><br>France was one of the first nations to employ conscription. During the wars following the French Revolution the army needed men to stop invasions Austrian and British invasions. <strong>France abolished peacetime military conscription in 2001.</strong><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Slovenia</span><br><strong>Slovenia's Prime Minister Anton Rop abolished mandatory military service on September 9, 2003.</strong><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">United Kingdom</span><br>The United Kingdom had conscription during the First World War and the Second World War. After the Second World War, it introduced <strong>National Service, which was abolished in 1960.</strong><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">United States of America</span><br>The United States has instituted mandatory military service at various times, usually during wars such as the American Civil War, World War II and Vietnam War. Registration for selective service (for possible future drafts) is required of all males at their 18th birthday. Registrants remain in the pool until January 1 of the year they turn 25.<br><br>When the United States began mobilizing in 1940, in response to the threat from Nazi Germany, the first peacetime draft in its history was introduced. Use of the draft persisted through the early years of the Cold War.<br><br>However, in the aftermath of Vietnam, it was recognized that retention of conscription would be completely impracticable.<br><br><strong>The military currently does not believe that a draft is needed. They feel that the current personnel levels of the military services is sufficient.</strong> <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Some members of the military feel that an all volunteer military provides military services with people that are in the military because it is truly what they want to do, and makes the military better.</span></strong> In recent times many more positions in the military require highly skilled and trained individuals, which some in the military have felt could only be obtained through volunteer means. There have been rumours of a targeted draft to obtain the people that have specific skills for military service.<br><br><strong>We can learn from USA , we must also admit a strong regular army is sufficient to deter and fight terrorists during peace time.  Afterall, in war time, our island has been considered by many top military experts as being too small to afford  a strong defensive position if we are attacked.<br><br>So why NS for Singapore - a country not threatened, in conflict or fighting a war with its neighbour?<br><br>Have a regular army of 50,000.  It will cost  much more.<br><br>Obviously Government prefers NS  because it's  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">very cheap labour. </span></strong><br><br></div>

We r surrounded by... well... our threats r real too.... The military strategy for singapore is every male is a soldier... if u want to rule singapore u have to kill all the men, which will makes it undesirable to attack singapore anymore...<br><br>Anyway our situation r similar to taiwan, isreal and south korea where there may be real threat to our well beings... However I will support NS to be shortened further as our threat is not as serious as the above few mentioned countries...</div>
