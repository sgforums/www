Actually, they are the one who can make life better for Singaporeans if they serve with a genuine heart, with compassion, undying commitment to the people.<br><br>Why cost of living is constantly increasing is because the govt cares solely for themselves.   If they care for the people, I suggest they stop being so selfish and self centred, protect the rice bowl of locals, and do their best to help the poor or even the middle income people who at times have problems to cope with the constant rising costs of living.   The great help is for them to stop raising the cost of living so fast.</div>
