              <p><strong>Given that public hospitals are funded by public funds, I believe that MOH has the obligation to make available for public scrutiny, the total (if not individual) payouts for such claims.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Certainly more accountability is necessary rather then just other ministers making unscrupulous, unsubstantiated claims like so reported:</strong></p>

              <p>Title     :     Hospitals make an average 8 out-of-court settlement cases a year<br>Date     :     20 January 2009 1557 hrs (SST)<br>URL     :     <a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/403696/1/.html">http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/403696/1/.html</a><br><br>SINGAPORE: Health Minister Khaw Boon Wan said there were on average eight cases a year where the hospitals made an out-of-court settlement with the patients as part of the mediation process.<br><br>In these cases, the hospital or staff concerned might have had some liability or were negligent.<br><br>However, as the settlements were undertaken with non-disclosure requirements, the Ministry of Health (MOH) is unable to determine the true nature of these cases.<br><br>Mr Khaw gave this update in a written answer to a parliament question by Ang Mo Kio MP Lee Bee Wah on the incidence of medical negligence at public hospitals.<br><br>He said heavy demand on public hospitals should not be an excuse for any act of medical negligence.<br><br>A healthcare professional may be found negligent by the court if he fails to exercise reasonable diligence and care when providing treatment and causes injury to his patient as a result.<br><br>Ms Lee also asked about the procedures in place to detect such negligence.<br><br>Mr Khaw said hospitals have in place a Sentinel Event Reporting System where the hospitals' Quality Assurance Committee will promptly look into any alleged case of medical negligence.<br><br>In the review, the committee will determine the root causes, recommend strategies to reduce risk and follow up on their implementation.<br><br>The MOH will be notified of all such reviews and it will monitor the follow-up actions to ensure that the corrective measures are put in place and that useful lessons are shared with the healthcare community.<br><br>Mr Khaw added that not all claims of medical negligence are valid. Some adverse outcomes happen in hospitals despite the best efforts and may not be due to medical negligence.<br><br>For example, a patient can develop a serious drug allergy after receiving an antibiotic for the first time. This may be an acceptable adverse outcome of the drug. - CNA/vm</p>
