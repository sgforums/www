With budget airlines such tickets are dirt cheap. It is when you want to be sure that you can return, that is difficult! It is difficult to find a place where you can migrate, which mean a place you like to go and the place want to accept you!! If you have no money, you go no way, that is the sad story that apply to all poor people in the whole wide world. sigh.....</div>
