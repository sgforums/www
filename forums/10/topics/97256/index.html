It is not a communist system really - communists are supposed to make everything equal.....everything is state owned ...not sold away or privatised. AND not to mention : ministers don't earn 1 million straight out in a communist country. And a communist system never trusts foreigners to run anything. ...you catch my drift</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Over a period of 39 years with the schools and media continually and subtly drumming messages into our young and old how successful we are in all areas, our general population has essentially become brainwashed. Many people now still believe the naivety that life is good and standards of living is high.<br><br>Just believe it, many citizens do not know the true meaning of success and do not want to know the facts that Singaporeans are the most indebted in the world and our wage except for public sector have been falling lower and lower since 1997 Asian Financial crisis. Our investment return is a miserable 1.4 - 4 % compared with 6% for Hongkong.<br><br>9 out of 10 businesses are struggling to keep the business surviving even as the GDP was supposed to grow by 6-10 % for 2004.<br><br>Many official statistics continue to ignore the plights of ordinary people or smaller businesses, the unemployed or under-employed populations who are among the most highly educated unemployed.<br><br>Our entrepreneurship is in a sorry state despite many years of trying to produce more entrepreneurs. Foreigners and PRs have to be recruited to take up or over the locals' jobs. Most businesses cannot survive except for the bigger companies or foreigners like the case of foreign MNC contractors taking over big jobs from various local contractors.<br><br>No wonder communism may be the system that Singaporeans now prefer as the people cannot differentiate facts from frictions and don't know what to expect.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Whether the country is or is not a democracy, is or is not a republic, may be academic. The important thing is common sense that is whether the citizens or the more educated younger electorate of today will want to have choice. Ever watch the blockbuster: "Matrix reloaded" to understand the importance of choice or causation.<br><br>If they do not care or do not need choice then they must depend on causation to offer them good or better lives. If they still prefer to have no opinion or choice about which is best or even prefer a communist system which itself is also being evolved to offer more choices producing 2.5 new millionnaires etc and improving lives etc, then our future generations can only blame us for our lack of foresights and we all should deserve all the consequences.<br><br>So the pertinent issue facing all is: having succeeded in some areas in the past, is our political system whether republic or democratic is still what we want to perpetuate.<br><br>Based on our current republic model, it would appear that a few elected representatives can decide every thing. What are the results? Are the latest results improving the lives of all with greater economic opportunities, solutions to structural unemployments, modified elitism or lowering of present high costs caused by past policies.<br><br>Many people have grown dissatisfied and grievous. Some are becoming the new poor, destitutes and desparate citizens who cannot pay the high utility bills or daily necessities.<br><br>Can our politicians with all the scholars among them ignore such social, cultural and material problems as pointed out in the foregoing. Can the leaders maintain hopes and sanity of all who might be affected without resorting to media or selective comparisons with less well to do countries.<br><br>Let us all not become so complacent with existing state of governance which did not yet solve the latest problems. It is hoped that those who are doing well in society or connected to the system and power will also understand the real needs and aspirations of people to have more choices.<br><br>If anyone continues to claim that our system is the best and should not be seen to be more accountable and transparent to answer to common men's problems with high costs or expectations and to safeguard jobs and equalize opportunities, let them justify their claims with more facts and good debates. We are now at the critical point of self-renewal or mass participation by youths to cater to a more educated workforce. Can republic system with centralized power deliver the goods to meet diverse problems now faced but largely not admitted as yet.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>People say there are lies, lies and statistics. Statistics can prove anything u want it to prove. How u phrased the question and who u asked can determine the results. SO never believe statistcs. Singapore's GDP is high, but do most Singaporeans know what makes up GDP? One component is government spending amongst others. With increased security spending, Sars and so on, of course GDP will rise. Stalin believed that communism was the end point for all societies, but in order to have communism, u have to have capitalism. Where the rich climb on the backs and feed off the poor for many years till there is an uprising, and there u have it, Communism.<br><br>I believe that Singaporeans have been cultivated to be indifferent and passive. How? By suing the Sh*t out of any person that defames the government. (No free speech) It has reached the point where no one dares to be associated with the opposition.<br><br>Communism, dun think so.

It is the arrangement of political leaders and heads-of-state. It is the manner a country decides to organize its political unit. Apollo said:<br><span style="font-style: italic;">republic - a political system in which the supreme power lies in a body of citizens who can elect people to represent them </span><br><br>But your definition could just as well define the word 'democracy'<br>democracy -a political system in which the supreme power lies in a body of citizens who can elect people to represent them<br><br>So is a republic a democracy? The answer is obviously an emphatic NO since many non-democratic countries are republics as Silverkris pointed out earlier.<br><br>Examples of political systems include: democracy, theocracy, monarchy, stratocracy, plutocracy, oligarchy etc. "Republic" is not one of them. It may also interest you that for political scientists, academia and economists, communism is less a political system, than an economic system. Many users in this forum use 'communism' loosely of course when referring to the "communist governments" in China, Cuba or North Korea.<br><br>I used the dictionary as well:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">reÂ·pubÂ·lic    ( P )  Pronunciation Key  (r-pblk)<br>n.<br><br>A political order whose head of state is not a monarch and in modern times is usually a president.<br>A nation that has such a political order.<br><br>A political order in which the supreme power lies in a body of citizens who are entitled to vote for officers and representatives responsible to them. </span><br><br>Both meanings appear in all 4 dictionaries I looked up even though you say "the first definition rarely comes up in the dictionary." And then you appear to contradict yourself when you then go on to add "however, internationally, republic is just plain old, "a non- monarchial type of country." as if to suggest the first meaning is the more common and regular one too.<br>The differences in meanings between 'system' and 'order' are subtle but crucial. The two do not mean the same thing if one is pedantic.<br><br>From your first post:<br><blockquote>"DEMOCRACY?<br>WHAT DEMOCRACY?<br>FOR HELL'S SAKE,<br>ITS A BLOODY REPUBLIC!!<br>BESIDES CHOOSING THE LEADER,<br>WHAT ELSE DO YOU VOTE FOR?<br>IF YOU CAN VOTE ON ISSUES,<br>ITS A DEMOCRACY" </blockquote>Surely you don't expect others to conclude from that post that you really mean to say:<br><br><blockquote>heard of alternate definitions?<br><br>republic - a political system in which the supreme power lies in a body of citizens who can elect people to represent them .</blockquote>I think not, and that was what Silverkris was trying to point out. Your second post and what you purport to claim comes out of the blue. A democracy is really about having the right to vote for leaders in an election. It's less about voting for 'issues'. I think what you were trying to refer to is a 'referendum'. As you acknowledged yourself in the second post, in a democracy, elected leaders are given the responsibility to decide on issues in the interests of the country. They do not leave to the citizens who elected them to decide on every issue. However if they do, they hold a referendum.<br><br>Even in democracies, national referendums are RARELY held. Those which have occurred are politically significant like voting to join the EU (many East European countries), or voting to become independent (East Timor), or voting to become a republic (Australia).<br><br>Lastly, the origins of the Democratic and Republican parties have little to do with their literal meanings. For the Republican party in the US, it was borne out of deep-seated beliefs in liberalism and anti-slavery in the mid-1850s. The manner in which the first definition is structured has absolutely nothing to do with it despite your claims.<br><br>Cheers.<br></div>
