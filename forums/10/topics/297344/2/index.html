We are only talking about a tiny population.<br><br>mind ourselves, china , india and USA, japan, s.korean and european job creation ministers , how much they getting only? and look at the numbe of jobs they have created and how many more they need to create!<br><br>*note: I must clarify that its not really logical to me that jobs created is created by someone person. I think no one person created the jobs. Enterprising entreprenuers create jobs for the people, that is true. So, I urge the people to starting thinking when some papers report a glorious picture of say x number of jobs created, you need to think also, is it fair to say that 1 person created that number of jobs by himself? I stress again, entreprenuers have been creating jobs like jobs in the creative tech company. No other person could have created this number of jobs for this company.<br><br>I believe in getting value for money paid. This is only a very basic fundament thing.  the least of expectations.</div>

FRankly, if they want to mislead Singaporeans, you think they will be truthful to publish real accurate figures?  Don't need figures, just go round companies in Singapore, you will be able to see there are getting more and more FTs and FWs to replace Singaporeans.    Not too long ago, I went to a company and among the 20 staff there, only 3 locals are working there.   So pathetic!   They even get a Indian FW to do the job of a tea lady cum cleaner.

I share life experience, reality and facts.   I believe in facts and reality more than theory and statistics.   There is nothing to do with generalisation, it is reality and facts.   Think it is just "dui niu dan qing" to talk to you about the working life.   I have already shared and if you don't accept the fact and reality of the happening, there is nothing I can do.    REality is what is happening in the real world.   To me if one base on theory to analyse on the present happening (reality) it is just not completely appropriate.   That is all I wanna say.   You need to be working and face with problems then you will know.   I hope I don't need to keep communicating with you about the reality and facts of working life, work/job employment problems/figures, for I can see that it is going to be in vain.</div>
