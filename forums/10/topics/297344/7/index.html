FW here need to go 1st a specified cert like pipefitter or boilerman or riggers in order to do the job. for most people like you and me, its not a must but to them, its as impt as your own ricebowl.<br><br>the MOM will ensure that these guys undergo proper training and certification prior to their employment in their respective companies. not all tom dick or harry can do the job.<br><br>these courses are heavily subsidised by the government and the company for them compared to the locals. heard and seen the process already. anyway for the company's benefit they surely would employ FT or FW since its more economical.<br><br></div></blockquote>This is a case of avoiding the issue by MOM even though there are many opportunities created by such a policy for the employers going all out to exploit loopholes deliberately created by such a FT policy.<br><br>Many locals who are equally skilled or even more experienced are now being by-passed by employer who prefer to employ the cheaper but not necessarily similarly skilled FT skill for skill and certificates for certificates. The asking by MOM for certification is purely a safeguard against scandal but other than that self-interest there is a lot of leeway left for the employer to exploit the locals.<br><br>If MOM wants to reduce unhappiness currently caused by employers indiscriminately by-passing the locals due to personal reasons or loopholes in the FT policy it should at least ask the employer to fulfill a few more requirements e.g. FT indeed are of skills not available among locals or the skills will definitely create more jobs and not exploitative manipulations by employers to undercut the locals.<br><br>The worse practice is for MOM to keep a blind eye to succeed for their own purpose of GDP which does not help creating jobs for the locals. Many FT may be equipped with paper qualification or certification but other than papers many locals are actually more capable and not employed due to imperfection of the job market.<br><br>Many skilled workers are being replaced by lesser skilled FT despite the certfications. Ask any construction bosses they will tell you the locals are more more experienced in plastering or welding but they were hard to find because of market imperfection caused by past retrenchments and recessions.<br><br>The same local plasters are still preferred by our local construction firms over the Bangla or Indians who need under-study and tutelage by our own experienced local. Only certain Thai plasterers could match our own local plasterers. So in name MOM says they only admit skilled workers but in actual fact they are not that skilled in many cases. It is necessary for bosses to get the local experienced skilled workers to train up the lesser skilled FT like those from Bangla. Eventually after offering in-house training of these so-called skilled FT, the FT were pushed up to take over the locals.<br><br>There are many loopholes for exploitative employers to take the easy way out. For examples in the construction sector the skilled plasterers sought after by construction bosses continue to be among the locals who have better skills but they were side-stepped by exploitative practices causing eventually more resentments among our own citizens who could close one-eye to such malpractices defying all logics and rationality.<br><br>The government should have put in a safeguard of ensuring that the local skilled workers are not being bypassed or superseded by exploitative or wrongful practices to short-change the locals.<br><br>Many people who were skilled workers would love to have an opportunity to get back their jobs but sad to say the government is not lending a helping hand-holding. So this is the kind of talents we do have in MOM so the unhappiness continues in the work place.<br><br>It looks like NKF which will not admit problems until another change of regime.</div>

It is too shallow an objective which is not in-depth aimed at serving the people.<br><br>When found wrong, Singaporeans often failed to act as one - united to act as one. Instead the people seem to have been thoroughly brainwashed for many years that they cannot think. Even in wrongs like the NKF or the retirement CPF drawdown age, people are taken for granted and their outcry or objection to unfair deprivation of their own personal property was being set aside by legalistic passing of law to persist in wrong self-centred and self-serving policy to avoid government's own problem it failed to solve over many years of bankrupting of people's CPF by its HDB.<br><br>Today we the people reap what we sow as they have not been supportive of their right but instead frequently arguing among themselves like yo-yo which allows the government to engage in assumptions and untruths that only make the government even more determine to take people for granted.<br><br>If a policy is wrongful like unbridled opening of FT floodgate the people ought to speak with one clear voice and not with some saying yes some say but. Let the government earn their keep by convincing the people any particular policy is really beneficial people and not continue to take people for granted by coming with hypocrisy like pragmatism or "no free lunch" to avoid all problems and issues.<br><br>A divided people does not deserve the best from democracy. Only when people are totally united in presenting problems as they are instead of some speaking yes and some saying but. Let the convincing of policy come from the government. Let the ministers be good effective leaders who could show their talents in overcoming all doubts and not do it for the government.<br><br>If we want democracy we as people must do the right stuff otherwise we do not deserve a good government at all. The starting point is the forummers now as they appear thanks to internet to hold the sway eventually to truths and change. So I ask all people to stay firm on their objective views and not allow government to take them for granted. They must have resolve and good quality to bring about change. They ought to hold good views and good thinking to encourage a democratically elected government to serve the people - government for the people and by the people without compromise by hypocrisy as seen happening once too often.</div>

I used to ask around for a min 1.7k for starters but now seeing the situation, I resigned myself to lowly 1.3k... to compare head to head, it would be a big difference, the FT construction worker earns 1.2k, no cpf, no house bills(living in company Dorm),free transport, free meals! compared to us who have a number of bills and loans to sustain...<br><br>Having a diploma is like the new o level, the degree is the new diploma... but to me and maybe some of you, skill work and experience is also a valubale asset to our resume.<br><br>the government has made a mistake somewhere. i do feel discriminated as a singaporean in singapore.</div></blockquote>Precisely, that is the way I look at it as well.</div>

But it does not fully show the true picture, something which I have been claiming all along. There are a variety of reasons, one of which I have mentioned is industry, and another of which is that the largest employer in Singapore is the public service, which mainly employ locals/citizens. Just SAF alone has 60.5k regular soldiers, and this most likely excludes the admin stuff. Imagine with MAS, EDB, GIC, DSO, and many other govt agencies, how many workers out of the 1.25 mil citizens are left to work in private companies that we see outside?<br><br>Again, supposed there are 1000 locals with 4% unemployed (40 pple). Supposed you were to choose 0.2% (20 pple) out. Do you think such a sample size will correctly give an estimation of the situation at hand? It is only qlqq9, whom with a poor understanding of statistics, who prefers to call it a form of attacking him when I talk logic. To him, his experience is logic. Everything else must be illogical.</div>
