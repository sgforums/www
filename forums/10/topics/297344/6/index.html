As I have already explained earlier, although I calculated a minimum of 96% employment, most of the sgreans employed are in government service, the largest employer in Singapore (SAF alone employs 60.5k regulars [from wiki], and I'm sure this excludes the admin staff). In addition, you can see a lot of "self-employed" sgreans in industries like hawkers, taxi drivers, etc.<br><br>Thus, how many sgreans do you think are left to fill up the slots in these companies?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>In addition, as I have already mentioned in another thread, another way for a company to "employ" a citizen is to only employ in name, only paying CPF to the particular citizen, who could be a housewife. It is a win-win situation: On one hand, the citizen has more CPF savings for doing nothing. On the other end, the "employer" pays less corporate tax and has a better citizen to foreigners ratio, thus enabling him to hire more and cheaper Foreign workers</div>
