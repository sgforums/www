You gave observations and experiences, facts that cannot be counted reliable at all with regards to the Singapore labour force. Which ones are truly reliable facts in your discussion? Do you think I'm debating? I gave you overall facts and figures for you to make a more well-rounded conclusion, and you would call it debating? The reason behind this will most likely be that you knew all along your conclusions were based on a limited view of the entire labour force, and when actual facts and figures are presented to you, you would feel that the presentation of these facts and figures are a form of attacking you.<br><br>Just a comparison between you and Gazelle and you would have to type in Caps <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> Are you sure you aren't the one getting agitated? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> You surely can do selective understanding <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> So the figures can be calculated from the singstats website. If you really doubt the validity of it, you could always go to the websites to do a check. No point talking all the points you want to raise are based purely on your experiences and observations. The sample size is just too small for you to have a conclusion. It is only an extremely limited window of the situation at hand..<br><br>What weird comparisons you made  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> So how old do you think I am? How old are you? How many years working experience do you have? How companies have you actually seen? What do you work as, so much so that you could see a full picture of Singapore? An experience with a company of 20 employees is not exactly what one would use in an allegation against the PAP for the whole labour force.<br><br>Now, in which statement did I say your observations are wrong? Did I fight for being correct? I am merely challenging your conclusions with figures obtainable from the singstats website. You could always fight and defend them. Is there a need to type in Caps?<br><br>I'm not going to talk to you like I talk to Gazelle yet and I'm giving you the benefit of the doubt that you missed reading certain facts due to my long posts. In case you have misunderstood everything I have pointed out from the facts and figures, I shall summarized them for easier understanding.<br><br>1) Out of 172,400 jobs, it is very highly likely that around 79k~80k jobs are taken up by locals<br>2) More FTs and FWs may perhaps have displaced Singaporeans, but many more Singaporeans have a job.<br>3) &lt;46k Singaporeans are unemployed, which a large portion can be easily explained off (just went into early retirement, transition between jobs, etc ,etc)<br>4) Most Singaporeans are working in the largest employer in Singapore, the public service, thus your observations.<br><br>None of my points clash with your observations.</div>
