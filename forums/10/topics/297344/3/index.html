I share life experience, reality and facts.   I believe in facts and reality more than theory and statistics.   There is nothing to do with generalisation, it is reality and facts.   Think it is just "dui niu dan qing" to talk to you about the working life.   I have already shared and if you don't accept the fact and reality of the happening, there is nothing I can do.    REality is what is happening in the real world.   To me if one base on theory to analyse on the present happening (reality) it is just not completely appropriate.   That is all I wanna say.   You need to be working and face with problems then you will know.

Do you think that can be an accurate estimate?<br><br>1) Doesn't this confirm my initial estimation of 80k?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>2) Well, if you are not convinced of the truth of the statistics Singapore website, there's nothing I can do right?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  I have merely calculated according to the figures there.

I'm disappointed with you... You would be better off saying that the Sg government should further reduce this 46k estimate, which they should anyway.<br><br>4) If you want the proof, you could always go to statistics Singapore to get the values for your own calculations, and prove my estimations wrong.<br><br>All available information are out there on the net for you to analyse and think through. Just whether you want to look and analyse deeper into the information, or skim on the surface of the information like Gazelle.

I too don't fully support the PAP, but to show their ineptitude, we should not give baseless allegations. Then the question comes back to you, why are you so anxious to say that my figures are wrong? I took my sources from others, I did my research, how could it be said that I'm anxious? Did you do your research and analysis before coming to your own conclusions? Or did your conclusion came just from your own 2 eyes, your experience with &lt;0.1% of the labour force?</div>

Think it is not appropriate, it is appropriate for us to come out with appraisal system to assess the performance of the PAP rather than opposition.  Other than the few oppositions are paid for they are members of the parliament, the rest of the oppositions are not paid.    WE should instead concentrate on assessing the performance of PAP for they are all paid by the taxpayers.  It is only right and necessary to assess the greedy PAP.</div>

It is obvious that in the face of hard facts and figures, you prefer to continue in your own delusions. Either that, you have not read through the whole analysis and argument before making a sensible post. However, it seems that you do not understand the reason behind your observations, as I have explained. Hint: Most Singaporeans are in govt jobs. Why? Cannot accept facts and figures that a student compiled from singstats website? If you are really that experienced, show me your facts and figures to prove me wrong, not draw a conclusion from the &lt;0.1% of the labour force that you have seen. The sample size is simply too small.<br><br>Think badly of you? Nah, you haven't reached that stage yet. I'm trying to put hard facts and figures in front of you so that you won't make wrong and uninformed conclusions. Again, I'm answering with respect to your first post, whether we are able to interpret the news. I have shown you my analysis. To prove your point, you should give further analysis.<br><br>Of course, all of us agree that the news did not give a breakdown. Again, my point is that such figures can be calculated from available sources of information in the singstats website. My earlier estimation of 80k has been proven correct by reddressman, when he took my calculations and came out with a value of 79k. Is that a coincidence?<br><br>Anyway, I wouldn't see how your first post stands if we are talking about the Singapore news. Why would a Singapore news reporter bother to<br>1) really calculate and analyse statistics<br>2) publish information that might cast bad light on the PAP<br>3) publish information that might land him in court?<br><br>In addition, why don't you just claim that the news did not publish HOW MANY of these 172,400 jobs come from the private sector in addition to the number of Singaporeans employed. Now, that is a more important factor, and a more valid point of argument.<br><br>P.S.
