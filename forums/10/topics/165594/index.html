I've live near East Coast and I say if there's any change needed, we should try to make it less crowded and noisy. In US, I remember going to this park where man-made noises are forbidden. You can get fine for leaving your engine running and as creates noise pollution.

Generally, 3 to 4 reminders/letters are sent if payment is still outstanding by the 3rd month.<br><br>(b) House visits<br>Some TCs conduct house visits if payment is not made after reminders have been served.<br><br>(c) Write-offs<br>For rental cases, depending on the merit of the cases, some TCs may write-off the outstanding arrears.<br><br>(d) Employment as Temporary Estates Inspectors<br>Some TCs have employed the residents concerned to work as Temporary Estates Inspectors. The salary of these Inspectors is deducted for payment of their arrears.<br><br>(e) Deferment of payment / waiver of penalties<br>Generally, the penalties are waived if the residents follow through with payment plans.<br><br>(f) Funding for hardship cases<br>Some TCs may refer cases to Community Development Councils and / or MCYS for ComCare Fund assistance to help residents with arrears payment.<br><br>4 The above measures are adopted to help residents with their arrears payments. Solicitors are only engaged as a last resort, for example, in chronic arrears cases where residents choose not to pay despite numerous reminders.<br><br>5 Thank you for your feedback. </span></blockquote></div>
