              <p>One more day to know the outcome to this youth Olympig bid. Singapore even put up a party to celebrate... What if we lose???!!!!</p>
              <p>&lt;Padang Party to greet Youth Olympic Games bid outcome <br><br> Wed, Feb 20, 2008<br> <br> ONE more day. That is all that separates the world from knowing whether Singapore or Moscow will host the inaugural 2010 Youth Olympic Games (YOG).<br><br>Starting from 5.30pm on Thursday, Singaporeans can be part of The Final Countdown party at the Padang.<br><br>The party will climax with the live satellite announcement of the winner from the IOC headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland at 7pm.<br><br> Two giant LED screens have been put up in front of City Hall, where the public can catch the eight-minute broadcast at 7 pm.<br><br>Over 5,000 people, dressed in red, are expected to turn up.<br><br>Festivities include performances by Asian Idol Hady Mirza and Project Superstar winners Daren Tan and Tan Diya on the stage at the steps of City Hall.<br><br>The result will round off over seven months of hard work by Singapore's bid committee - work that included submitting a comprehensive candidature file, securing financial and infrastructural guarantees and making a presentation to the IOC.<br><br>From nine cities in October, a shortlist of five was made in November, then whittled down to two last month.&gt;</p>
              <p>To be frank, I'm more interested to know if I have won my 10 million $$ TOTO tmr.<br><br><br><br><br><br></p>

              <p>i think sinkapore will get it.<br> <br> but if u know the ioc culture, it's riddled with bribes and
              undertable negotiations. i think sinkapore will bribe its way in,
              unless moscow is able to pull something bigger.<br> <br> youth olympics is way over-rated. it's like the youth WC, under 18
              WC, etc. if you go to those hosting venues or watch it on telly, it
              is played to empty terraces. similarly, i doubt majority of
              sinkaporeans will give a hoot. it will only appeal to the FTs,
              portion of the youth, the sinkapore elites and certain segment of
              the population. i doubt it will be a revenue generator. other than
              the participants, there will not be droves of ppl who will come
              here just to watch the youth games. this talk about increased
              tourism is baloney. get real!<br> <br> sinkapore got a new sports hub, so it is quite appropriate to
              showcase it. the other reason is the `feel good' factor. however,
              sinkapore is at least 10 years late in this game.<br> <br> there is a lot of hype. and just hype.<br> <br> but sinkapore will be pronunced winner and tt will make quite a few
              ppl's political stock price rise immeasurably.<br> <br><strong> me, i will stick to my EPL. or if it is off season, i might take a
              holiday abroad. better still, i might be settled elsewhere already
              by then already.</strong></p>
