               SINGAPORE is punching above its weight in human embryonic stem cell
                              research, the cutting-edge and highly controversial field that holds
                              the promise of cures for a range of diseases.
              <p>This is the conclusion of a study in the leading industry journal
                              <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>Cell Stem Cell</em></strong>, which ranked Singapore fourth behind Britain, Israel
                              and China, after looking at papers published on breakthroughs in the
                              field. </span></p>
              <p>Singapore's global share of published work in this area <span style="color: #ff0000;">is
                              2.9 per cent</span>. Although small compared to the United States' 36 per
                              cent, it is almost nine times more than what the city state is expected
                              to produce, the study noted.</p>
              <p>Together with Israel, Singapore was singled out for its
                              focused research efforts which 'appear to have paid dividends', said
                              the report in the US journal.</p>
              <p>An actual cure and profits from research in this field may be
                              some way down the road, but scientists here say the study is a strong
                              endorsement of Singapore's performance in a highly competitive arena.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Dr Alan Colman</span>, executive director of A*Star's Singapore Stem
                              Cell Consortium, said: 'It is reassuring and great for Singapore to see
                              independent and foreign affirmation of this welcome development.'</p>

              The study identified the US, France and Japan as underperformers. The
                              trio had one thing in common - an uncertain research environment.</p>
              <p>This is because of the protracted policy debates over ethical
                              issues such as harvesting stem cells from days-old embryos, which are
                              destroyed in the process.</p>
              <p>Singapore tackled the issue by being among the first to
                              embrace the research with full government support and strict laws
                              enacted to prevent abuse.</p>
              <p>This climate helped attract the likes of Colombian
                              clinician-researcher Eliana Martinez, 32, who came here because she was
                              frustrated with constraints in the US.</p>
              <p>'I learnt that Singapore is conducive for research and would
                              not create frustrating blocks over the use of new cell lines,' said the
                              National University of Singapore researcher.</p>
              <p>Singapore has moved from strength to strength since a
                              jumpstart in 1993, when stem cell pioneer Ariff Bongso became the first
                              to obtain the precious cells from days-old human embryos.</p>
              <p>There are more than 40 groups doing stem cell research here.
                              And since 2000, more than US$20 million (S$28 million) has been granted
                              for such work.</p>
              <p>Just yesterday, the Republic counted its latest coup:
                              Researchers from the Genome Institute of Singapore and NUS uncovered
                              over<span style="color: #ff0000;"> 3,000 hotspots - a treasure map of sorts, s</span>howing areas in the
                              genetic blueprint of embryonic stem cells which help them maintain
                              their special qualities.</p>
              <p>The work, published in the journal Cell, was done on mouse
                              stem cells, but could easily be moved on to human cells if successful.</p>
              <p>Professor Lee Eng Hin, executive director of A*Star's
                              Biomedical Research Council, said it was another sign that Singapore
                              was on the right track in the biomedical sciences.</p>
              <p>'It shows that with the right combination of factors such as
                              strong government support, a robust legal and ethical framework, the
                              right mix of dedicated talent and state-of-the- art research
                              infrastructure, we have been able to make our mark in the international
                              scientific arena.'</p>

              <p>A.        IDENTIFICATION<br><br>1.        The Issue<br><br>     Burgeoning human population growth around the Western edges of<br>the park poses a great threat to big cats and other predators that<br>roam the Serengeti plains.  Many of the villagers living outside<br>the park own dogs, and these dogs oftentimes are not vaccinated<br>against such common diseases as rabies or CDV.  When these dogs<br>intermingle with Serengeti predators at kill or scavenge sites,<br>viruses such as CDV that can be spread through mucus secretions<br>have a means by which to jump from domestic to wild animal<br>populations.  In the case of the CDV outbreak of big cats in the<br>Serengeti in 1994, it is thought that hyenas intermixing with<br>domestic dogs at one of these sites contracted the virus and then<br>spread it to other predators at different kill sites throughout the<br>park.  How the fatal virus was able to make the leap from<br>afflicting domestic dogs to threatening to wipe out a sizable lion<br>population was a question scientists did not have any answer to. <br>And if the virus could do so much damage this time around, what, if<br>anything, could be done to protect the lion population from future<br>outbreaks?<br><br>2.        Description<br><br>     The Serengeti game reserve in Tanzania, Africa is one of the<br>largest wildlife areas left in the world and is known in part for<br>its well-documented and studied lion prides.  Here, thousands of<br>antelope, wildebeests, and other herbivores carry on a daily life<br>and death struggle with the hyenas, jackals, cheetahs, and lions<br>that inhabit the reserve.  The income derived from the thousands of<br>tourists that annually visit the park is a key source of revenue<br>for the Tanzanian government.  Several years ago, a mysterious<br>virus appeared among the thriving lion population in 1994 and<br>proceeded to wipe out a third of the population before the eyes of<br>baffled scientists worldwide.  It was only after the virus had run<br>its course several months later that the culprit was found: Canine<br>Distemper Virus (CDV).  Previously thought to only afflict dogs and<br>a small number of other mammals on a limited scale, its discovery<br>lead scientists to wonder how this potent virus had jumped species<br>with such lethal results.<br><br>     The Serengeti National Park is a 15,000 square kilometer<br>ecosystem and a place where natural preservation and economic<br>development are on equal footing.  In 1994, there were an estimated<br>3,000 lions living within the Serengeti, the largest population of<br>big cats in the world. <br><br>     Between January and March of that year, 11 lion carcasses were<br>found - representing a dramatic increase in mortality from previous<br>years and indicating to observers that there was a serious epidemic<br>stalking the lions.  Tourists, many flying in hot-air balloons over<br>the park to get a better view of the wildlife, were the first to<br>notice that the lions were dying.  One of the first lions suspected<br>of suffering from CDV-like symptoms was observed on February 3,<br>1994 and was identified because of the uncontrollable twitching and<br>convulsions that wracked its body.  After watching many of the<br>lions dying or after examination of their corpses, no one scientist<br>knew why the outbreak had been so sudden or severe or if in fact it<br>was CDV that was killing the cats.  At least 40 lions had died<br>since the outbreak started in February and some of the largest and<br>best-studied prides had been wiped out.<br><br>     In fact, by early that year, approximately a third of a well-<br>known lion population study group of 250 was culled by the virus. <br>There was nothing experts could do to stop the current outbreak of<br>the virus except to let it run its natural course.  The only<br>vaccine they had was of a weakened live virus and they didn't want<br>to use it because of the small chance of infecting a healthy lion<br>(Morrell 1994, 1664).  Fortunately, the virus did not kill all<br>those lions that were infected so that the survivors will have<br>immunity against future outbreaks. <br><br>     As investigators suspected and later confirmed through<br>extensive scientific analysis, the animals of the Serengeti were<br>dying of a canine distemper virus (CDV) that belonged to a<br>morbillivirus family or a virus very similar to it.  CDV is a viral<br>disease that causes severe neurological symptoms and usually death<br>(Leary 1994, 13).  Lions that were severely affected almost<br>inevitably died.  CDV kills by attacking the respiratory,<br>gastrointestinal, immune, and central nervous systems of its<br>victims.  It affected the lions' brains and caused facial<br>twitching, flailing paws, and convulsions.  Other symptoms<br>included: lions looking off color with dull coats to complete<br>paralysis.  The virus struck down lions of all ages throughout a<br>1,000 kilometer area within a few weeks of the initial outbreak.  <br><br>     Some mammals have their own version of the canine distemper<br>virus such as seals, dogs, black-footed ferrets, and livestock<br>(Miller 1994, 5).  The virus strikes humans in the form of measles. <br>CDV can be so pervasive that it nearly wiped out the black-footed<br>ferret population in the Western U.S. in the 1980s.  The virus had<br>occurred in lions and leopards in American zoos in earlier years<br>but never was such a large-scale epidemic among big cats observed<br>previously in the wild.  <br><br>     The disease is spread through fine droplets of an animal's<br>breath and is as easily transmitted as a cold.  For instance - a<br>hyena or jackal scrapping with domestic dogs over a carcass could<br>have picked up the infection and passed it along to the lions in<br>the park in the same way (drooling, snapping, or biting) (The<br>Economist 1994, 76).  It is thought that hyenas were the most<br>likely vectors of the virus because they travel great distances and<br>intermingle with both lions and domestic dogs at separate kill and<br>scavenge sites within and without the park.  Nomadic lions (not<br>attached to any pride) could also have contributed to CDV<br>dissemination.  The high densities of these susceptible carnivores<br>at kill sites could have provided an ideal environment for CDV<br>amplification and transmission.<br><br>     Even though several suspected vectors were identified, no one<br>knew why there was a sudden outbreak within the big cats of the<br>Serengeti in 1994 because canines and felines had lived together<br>for many years without the virus jumping species with such<br>virulity.  It has been known throughout the scientific community<br>that CDV has infected hyenas in the park since the 1960s and both<br>hyenas and lions have shared the same food supplies since then.  If<br>that were true, why then was there a major lion epidemic of CDV in<br>1994 and not earlier?  One of the theories put forward by<br>scientists was that CDV may have always been present in big cats<br>but that it had recently mutated to become more virulent (New<br>Scientist 1994, 8).  As scientists later discovered, the CDV had<br>mutated due to an influx of CDV-infected dogs in the villages<br>surrounding the park allowing for the easy exchange of microbes<br>between species as domesticated dogs and wild animals intermingled. <br><br>     To find out if the virus was a mutant virus, tissue samples of<br>23 dead lions, 11 sick lions, and 72 apparently healthy lions were<br>taken and sent to several labs in the U.S.  It was hoped that<br>through extensive scientific analysis it could be determined<br>whether the affliction was a new strain of CDV and how it had<br>jumped species from dogs to cats after historically not doing so. <br>After many months of study and through the use of new genetic<br>analysis techniques, scientists were able to confirm that the<br>Serengeti organism was a new variant, or biotype, that was<br>genetically different from normal CDV (Morrell 1996, 596).<br><br>     The new biotype was identified in several different ways.  The<br>new lion strain infected lions' hippocampus whereas other strains<br>primarily cause an inflation of the brain stem in dogs.  It also<br>affected dogs' bronchial tubes but in cats, it attacked alveoli,<br>the air sacs in the lungs (Morrell 1996, 597).  A virus that has<br>expanded and affected new tissue areas previously not shown to be<br>afflicted is a sure sign of an emerging biotype.  Besides the<br>symptoms that characterize CDV such as grand mal seizures and<br>recurrent twitching, scientists were able to diagnose that the<br>lions that had died in 1994 as also suffering from encephalitis and<br>pneumonia.  These two diseases were usually not found in dogs<br>suffering from a normal CDV strain. <br><br>     Scientists have been able to trace environmental changes that<br>apparently prompted the mutation:  growing human settlements along<br>the Serengeti National Park's western border, with large<br>populations of CDV-infected domestic dogs.   "Human activity was<br>the underlying cause of the epidemic." (Schwartz 1996, 4)  The<br>Serengeti is surrounded by a human and dog population that is<br>growing at four percent a year and the people in the area own<br>roughly 30,000 dogs.  People are moving to these areas to look for<br>work and the opportunity to make a living.  Poor soil conditions<br>and job scarcity are often the reasons people leave the surrounding<br>areas to crowd around the national parks.  Vaccination of the dogs<br>in these villages against CDV is rare although some dogs in the<br>surrounding villages had been vaccinated against distemper and<br>rabies.  Between 1993 and 1994 a CDV epidemic swept through<br>villages to the west of the Serengeti killing thousands of dogs. <br>Tissue samples of lions taken between 1990 and October 1993 showed<br>no evidence of CDV.  Of samples taken in 1994, 63 apparently<br>healthy lions and 8 of the 11 sick lions showed evidence of<br>infection. <br><br>     Burgeoning human populations and their diseased animals put<br>new and unexpected pressures on wilderness areas - pressures that<br>make it more likely that dangerous microbes will move between<br>species in the future (Schwartz 1996, 1).  An exchange of diseases<br>between species often encourages and promotes successful mutations. <br>Unfortunately, there are too many dogs to inoculate against these<br>diseases and prevent their mutation.  The dogs have an extremely<br>high birthrate and a high population turnover so there are lots of<br>susceptible CDV host-animals.  This kind of environment provides an<br>ideal condition for maintaining an epidemic.  Morbilliviruses have<br>made incredible gains in these kinds of environments and have<br>evolved considerably to increase their host range.  In fact, new<br>morbilliviruses have recently been identified in seals, dolphins,<br>and horses and it is thought that genetic changes may make such<br>expansion possible.  The human population growth combined with a<br>pool of CDV-susceptible dogs probably lead to the new strain of the<br>virus that afflicted the lions.<br><br>     Scientists were and still are alarmed about this latest<br>outbreak because the virus could come back at any time because of<br>the close proximity of so many non-vaccinated dogs.  With the<br>number of dogs increasing yearly, there is a more likely chance of<br>contact between domestic dogs and wildlife in the future and thus<br>a chance of that another outbreak could occur.  To help prevent<br>this reoccurrence, veterinarians from the Institute of Zoology in<br>London and the Tanzanian Parks Service are vaccinating dogs to try<br>and get rid of some of the reservoir where the disease could<br>remain.<br><br>     Currently, Project Life Lion, a group local veterinary<br>services and wildlife authorities is traveling from village to<br>village vaccinating dogs in hopes of creating a cordon sanitaire<br>around the western villages (Miller 1995, 10).   Supported mainly<br>through private donations, the vaccination program for dogs uses<br>First World money to protect an ecosystem of global importance.  In<br>1995, forays into local villages helped vaccinate 80 percent of the<br>dogs in the places they visited.  It is not certain, however, how<br>many dogs have to be vaccinated before the chain of transmission is<br>broken.  The veterinarians have funding until 1999 and hope that<br>three years of intensive vaccination will eliminate the disease. <br>They are also vaccinating for rabies to stop the outbreak of that<br>disease.  Yearly vaccination in the cattle of the villages since<br>the 1950s to stop the spread of rinderpest (a morbillivirus that<br>fatally afflicts cattle) has proved successful.  It is hoped that<br>the same kind of yearly vaccination program would work as well for<br>the dogs.  <br><br>      Scientists believe that the reason the outbreak was so severe<br>in 1994 was because the lions were immunologically naive to CDV. <br>It is ironic that rinderpest in cattle has been controlled,<br>however, since lions may have gained immunity to CDV by eating<br>wildebeest or cattle infected with rinderpest (a cousin of CDV). <br>There are some studies that have shown that carnivores can be<br>protected from CDV by exposure to rinderpest (The Economist 1994,<br>76).   Hence, its eradication through widespread vaccination of<br>cattle within the past twenty years may have left lions more<br>vulnerable to a virulent CDV strain this time around.  Previous<br>samples taken from 77 lions tested between 1984 and 1989 showed<br>exposure to a virus suggesting that a similar but less lethal<br>epidemic occurred about a decade ago.  Lions vulnerability in the<br>park may also be caused by the lions higher population density<br>(3,000 individuals in 1994, an all-time high) or their resistance<br>to disease might have been reduced by other infections or drought. <br>The large lion numbers possibly made it easier for the disease to<br>pass from animal to animal because there was more frequent contact.<br><br>     By the time the outbreak was over several months later,<br>approximately 1,000 lions died of CDV and all sixteen prides within<br>the park were affected.  It was hard for scientists to get an exact<br>figure because the park is so large and the lion prides are<br>generally spread out.  Combined with the fact that scavengers can<br>reduce a carcass to nothing overnight, it was difficult to<br>calculate how many lions actually died.  Because of this new potent<br>CDV strain, prospects for endangered populations where it occurs<br>may quickly take a turn for the worse.  CDV impact on other<br>carnivore species is unknown.  Less dense populations of cheetahs,<br>lions, or wild dogs are a clear cause for concern if exposed to a<br>virulent pathogen such as the new CDV biotype.  There was fear<br>among Tanzanians and scientists that the CDV strain would spread to<br>the lions of the Ngorongoro Crater, an inbred and isolated<br>population of 80 individuals located just outside of the Serengeti. <br>Their genetic homogeneity could have caused them to succumb easily<br>to the disease (Miller 1994, 5)  Fortunately, the biotype didn't<br>spread into their areas and the lions remained unaffected.  Besides<br>afflicting lions, the new pathogen also killed a large number of<br>hyenas, leopards, and bat-eared foxes. After infecting the<br>Serengeti, the CDV spread northwards from Tanzania to the Maasai<br>Mara Game Reserve in Kenya.<br><br>     For now, the threat to the Serengeti lions is past.  No new<br>cases of CDV have been reported within the last year.  Survivors<br>have developed an immunity and the lion population has already<br>recovered a quarter of its losses.  By August of 1994, 85 percent<br>of the Serengeti lion population were found to have anti-CDV<br>antibodies (Roelke-Parker et al. 1996, 441).  A number that bodes<br>well for lions facing possible future outbreaks.  However tragic it<br>may seem to human observers, the epidemic has simply returned the<br>population to its previous level since 3,000 animals was an all-<br>time high (Morrell 1994, 1404).  The surviving lions from the<br>latest outbreak could teach scientists about genetic factors that<br>made them immune to the virulent pathogen. <br><br>3.        Related Cases<br><br><a

1996)<br><br>B.        LEGAL Clusters<br><br>5.        Discourse and STATUS: Agreement and In Progress<br><br>      Although Tanzania has done little to capitalize on its<br>natural resources, increased tourist activities could help support<br>its conservation efforts.  So far, Tanzanian authorities have<br>limited tourist accessibility to the Serengeti for fear of too much<br>destruction and tourist-driven development and degradation of the<br>area.  But if the Tanzanian government would allow more tourist-<br>driven activities near the park, they could use the generated<br>revenue to potentially build housing elsewhere and relocate many of<br>the villagers presently living on the park's western fringes.  (Or<br>they could institute a thorough dog vaccination campaign)  By<br>moving these people and their dogs, the risk of future CDV<br>outbreaks in the park becomes less-likely to occur.<br><br>6.        Forum and Scope: TANZANIA and UNILATeral<br><br>     If the Tanzanian government had the money and the<br>infrastructure in place, it could pass legislation making it<br>mandatory for all dogs in the Serengeti area to be vaccinated for<br>CDV, rabies, and other highly-infectious diseases.  Some sort of<br>dog registration and vaccination could be required.  Presently, the<br>task of inoculating these village dogs has been taken over by<br>veterinarian groups based outside of Tanzania and funded mostly<br>through private sources. <br><br>7.        Number of Parties Affected: 1<br><br>     Tanzania's Serengeti National Park was the most severely<br>affected area during the 1994 CDV outbreak.  As noted previously,<br>however, the virus did spread into neighboring Kenya and the<br>animals of the Maasai Masa Game Reserve.  Overcrowding and<br>encroachment on park areas is an increasingly-serious problem faced<br>by many governments around the world.  Trying to balance the needs<br>of the country's populace with the needs of the country's natural<br>resources is a difficult task.  As long as you have human<br>populations living in close proximity to wild animals, the<br>possibility for outbreaks like the one in 1994 in the Serengeti are<br>inevitable.<br><br>8.        Legal Standing: NGO<br><br>     Project Life Lion, run by veterinarians based in the U.S. and<br>Britain, along with Tanzanian Park authorities, is doing all that<br>it can to prevent future outbreaks by vaccinating as many dogs as<br>possible before their money runs out.<br><br>C.        GEOGRAPHIC Clusters<br><br>9.        Geography<br><br>a.

to what might happen if a more virulent CDV<br>outbreak occurs among the lions in the near future.  If a high-<br>profile species like the lion is reduced to a few prides or<br>eliminated altogether from the park by a new outbreak, then<br>Tanzania is likely to have very little tourism at all and the harm<br>inflicted by potential tourists is a moot point.<br><br>13.       Impact Direct of
