Felt kind of weird/disturbed being so close to such an infamous person/dictator. Apparently he was buying rice, so much rice that the cold storage stuff had to bring out 10-20 big card boxes to put the rice in. He screwed his country so much that he has to buy rice in Singapore!?</p></div>

              <div class="articleSubTitle"><em>Anglo-American and Chinese interests clash over Zimbabwe’s strategic mineral wealth</em></div>
              <div class="articleSubTitle"><br></div>
              <div class="articleSubTitle">by  F. William  Engdahl</div>
              <div class="articleSubTitle"><br></div>
              <div class="articleSubTitle">
              <p><em>Robert Mugabe, the
                      President of Zimbabwe, presides over one of the world’s richest
                      minerals treasures, the Great Dyke region, which cuts a geological
                      swath across the entire land from northeast to southwest. The real
                      background to the pious concerns of the Bush Administration for human
                      rights in Zimbabwe in the past several years is not Mugabe’s possible
                      election fraud or his expropriation of white settler farms. It is the
                      fact that Mr. Mugabe has been quietly doing business, a lot of it, with
                      the one country which has virtually unlimited need of strategic raw
                      materials Zimbabwe can provide—China. Mugabe’s Zimbabwe is, along with
                      Sudan, on the central stage of the new war over control of strategic
                      minerals of Africa between Washington and Beijing, with Moscow playing
                      a supporting role in the drama. The stakes are huge.</em></p>
              <p>Zimbabwe’s President, Robert Mugabe is a very very
                      bad man. This we all know from reading the newspapers or hearing the
                      pronouncements of George W. Bush, earlier Britain’s Tony Blair and more
                      recently Gordon Brown. In their eyes he has sinned badly. They charge
                      that he is a dictator; that he has expropriated, often with violence,
                      the farms of whites as part of land reform; they claim he rigged his
                      re-election by vote fraud and violence; that he has ruined the economy
                      of Zimbabwe.</p>
              <p>Whether Robert Mugabe deserves to be in Washington’s
                      honor roll of villains alongside Fidel Castro, Saddam Hussein,
                      Milosevic, Ahmadinejad, and Adolf Hitler, however, it is not the reason
                      Washington and London have made Zimbabwe regime change priority number
                      one for their Africa policy.</p>
              <p>What his sin is seems to have more to do with his
                      attempts to get out from under Anglo-American neo-colonial serfdom
                      dependency and to pursue a national economic development independent of
                      the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. His real sin seems to
                      be the fact that he has turned to the one nation that offers his
                      government credits and soft loans for economic development with no
                      strings attached—The Peoples’ Republic of China.</p>
              <p>Western media accounts conveniently tend to omit the
                      second major party to what is a huge tug of war between Anglo-American
                      interests and China to get control of Zimbabwe’s vast mineral wealth.
                      We should keep in mind that for Washington there are always "good
                      dictators" and "bad dictators." The difference is whether the given
                      dictator serves US national interests or not. Mugabe clearly is in the
                      latter category.</p>
              <strong>
              <p>Cecil Rhodes’ legacy</p>
              </strong>
              <p>Zimbabwe is the name of what under the era of
                      British Imperialism a century ago was named Rhodesia. The name Rhodesia
                      came from the British imperial strategist and miner, Cecil Rhodes,
                      founder of the Rhodes scholarships to Oxford, and author of a plan for
                      a vast private African zone, to be chartered from the Queen of England,
                      from Egypt to South Africa. Cecil Rhodes created the British South
                      Africa Company, modeled on the East India Company, along with his
                      partner, L. Starr Jameson of Jameson Raid notoriety, to exploit the
                      mineral riches of Rhodesia. It controlled what was later named Northern
                      Rhodesia (Zambia) and Southern Rhodesia-Nyasaland. The model was that
                      the British Government would assume all risks to militarily defend
                      Rhodes’ looting while Rhodes and his London bankers, above all Lord
                      Rothschild, who was a close associate, would assume all the gains of
                      the business.</p>
              <p>Rhodes, a seasoned geologist, knew well that there
                      was a remarkable geological fault running from the mouth of the Nile at
                      the Gulf of Suez south through Sudan, Uganda, Tanzania, down through
                      today’s Zimbabwe on to South Africa. Rhodes had already instigated
                      several wars to gain control of the diamonds of Kimberly and the gold
                      of Witwatersrand in South Africa. This geological phenomenon he, as
                      well as enterprising German explorers, had discovered in the 1880’s.
                      They named it the Great Rift Valley.</p>
              <p>Rhodesia, like South Africa after the bloody Boer
                      wars, was settled by white settlers to secure future minerals gains for
                      allied interests of the City of London, mainly those of the powerful
                      Oppenheimer family and their gold and diamond enterprises in the
                      region.</p>
              <p>In 1962 when Africa was undergoing the wave of
                      national liberation from colonial rule, a wave calculatedly supported
                      by "non-colonial power" Washington, Rhodesia was one of the last
                      bastions, along with former British colony South Africa, of white
                      Apartheid rule. Whites in Rhodesia constituted only 1-2% of the total
                      population so their methods of holding on to power were rather
                      ruthless.</p>
              <p>White supremacist Prime Minister, Ian Smith,
                      declared Rhodesian independence from Britain in 1965 rather than agree
                      to the slightest compromise on race or power sharing with black
                      nationalists. Britain got UN trade sanctions imposed to force Smith to
                      buckle under. Despite sanctions, there was considerable support from
                      conservative business interests in London. Britain’s Tiny Rowland, head
                      of the Lonrho mining conglomerate, secured the bulk of his African
                      profits from Rhodesian copper mining and related ventures under the
                      Smith regime. The City of London knew very well what riches lay in
                      Rhodesia. The question was how to secure enduring control. Smith’s
                      Rhodesian backers had little interest in giving it all to London.</p>
              <p>Following a long and bloody struggle, in 1980 the
                      leader of the black African Popular Front coalition, Robert Mugabe,
                      overwhelmingly won election as the first Prime Minister of a new
                      Zimbabwe. Twenty eight years later, the same Robert Mugabe is under
                      escalating attack from the West, especially Zimbabwe’s former colonial
                      master, England, including strong economic sanctions designed to bring
                      the country to the brink of collapse, to force him to open the economy
                      to foreign (read Anglo-American and allied) investment. Ironically, the
                      issue seems not all that different from the Ian Smith era: London and
                      US control of the resources of the rich land, and Zimbabwean efforts to
                      resist that control.</p>
              <strong>
              <p>The Great Dyke</p>
              </strong>
              <p>Within Zimbabwe, a portion of the rich Great Rift is
                      called the Great Dyke, an intrusive geological treasure zone running
                      over 530 kilometers from the northeast to the southwest of the country,
                      in places up to 12 kilometers wide. A river runs along the fault and
                      the region is volcanically active. Here also lie vast deposits of
                      chromium, of copper, platinum and other metals.</p>
              <p style="margin-right: 0px;" dir="ltr">The US State
                      Department, as well as London, is aware of the vast minerals and other
                      riches of Zimbabwe. It states in a recent report on Zimbabwe, <em><br><br>"Zimbabwe
                      is endowed with rich mineral resources. Exports of gold, asbestos,
                      chrome, coal, platinum, nickel, and copper could lead to an economic
                      recovery one day...The country is richly endowed with coal-bed methane
                      gas that has yet to be exploited. </em></p>
              <p style="margin-right: 0px;" dir="ltr"><em>With
                      international attractions such as Victoria Falls, the Great Zimbabwe
                      stone ruins, Lake Kariba, and extensive wildlife, tourism historically
                      has been a significant segment of the economy and contributor of
                      foreign exchange. The sector has contracted sharply since 1999,
                      however, due to the country's declining international image.(sic). </em></p>
              <p style="margin-right: 0px;" dir="ltr"><em>Energy Resources</em></p>
              <p style="margin-right: 0px;" dir="ltr"><em>With
                      considerable hydroelectric power potential and plentiful coal deposits
                      for thermal power station, Zimbabwe is less dependent on oil as an
                      energy source than most other comparably industrialized countries, but
                      it still imports 40% of its electric power needs from surrounding
                      countries--primarily Mozambique. Only about 15% of Zimbabwe's total
                      energy consumption is accounted for by oil, all of which is imported.
                      Zimbabwe imports about 1.2 billion liters of oil per year. Zimbabwe
                      also has substantial coal reserves that are utilized for power
                      generation, and coal-bed methane deposits recently discovered in
                      Matabeleland province are greater than any known natural gas field in
                      Southern or Eastern Africa. In recent years, poor economic management
                      and low foreign currency reserves have led to serious fuel shortages."</em></p>
              <p>In short, chrome, copper, gold, platinum, huge
                      hydroelectric power potential and vast coal reserves are what is at
                      stake for Washington and London in Zimbabwe. The country also has
                      unverified reserves of uranium, something in big demand today for
                      nuclear power generation.</p>
              <p>It is clear of late that so long as the tenacious
                      Mugabe is running things, not the Anglo-Americans, but rather the
                      Chinese, are Zimbabwe’s preferred business partners. This seems to be
                      Mugabe’s greatest sin. He’s not reading from the right program as
                      George W. Bush’s friends see it. His real sin seems to be turning East
                      not West for economic and investment help.</p>
              <strong>
              <p>The Chinese connection</p>
              </strong>
              <p>During the Cold War China recognized and supported
                      Robert Mugabe. In recent years as China’s search for secure raw
                      materials escalated its foreign diplomacy, relations have become
                      stronger. According to the Chinese media, China has invested more in
                      Zimbabwe than any other nation.</p>
              <p>Already back in July 2005 as Tony Blair turned the
                      sanctions screws tighter on Zimbabwe, Mugabe flew to Beijing to meet
                      with the top Chinese leadership, where he reportedly sought an
                      emergency loan of US$1 billion and asked increased Chinese involvement
                      in the economy.</p>
              <p>It began to bear fruit. In June 2006 state--owned
                      Zimbabwean businesses signed a number of energy, mining and farming
                      deals worth billions of dollars with Chinese companies. The largest was
                      with China Machine-Building International Corporation, for a $1,3bn
                      contract to mine coal and build thermal-power generators in Zimbabwe,
                      to reduce Zimbabwe’s electricity shortage. The Chinese company had
                      already built thermal-power stations in Nigeria and Sudan, and had been
                      involved in mining projects in Gabon.</p>
              <p>In 2007 the Chinese government donated farm
                      machinery worth $25 million to Zimbabwe, including 424 tractors and 50
                      trucks, as part of a $58 million loan to the Zimbabwean government. The
                      Mugabe administration had previously seized white-owned farms and gave
                      them to blacks, damaging machinery in the process. In return for the
                      equipment and the loan the Zimbabwean government will ship 30 million
                      kilograms of tobacco to the People's Republic of China.</p>
              <p>Other Zimbabwe-China agreements included a deal
                      between the Zimbabwe Mining Development and China’s Star
                      Communications, forming a joint venture to mine chrome, with funding
                      from the China Development Bank. Zimbabwe also agreed to import
                      road-building, irrigation and farming equipment from the China National
                      Construction and Agricultural Machinery Import and Export Corporation
                      and China Poly Group. Zimbabwe also relies on China for imports of
                      telecommunications equipment, military hardware and many other critical
                      items it can no longer import from the west because of the British-led
                      sanctions.</p>
              <p>Relations have become so important that Zimbabwe’s
                      police have a dedicated "China desk" to protect Chinese interests in
                      the country.</p>
              <p>In April 2007 the chairman of China’s top political
                      advisory body, Jia Qinglin, head of the National Committee of the
                      Chinese Peoples’ Political Consultative Conference, flew to Harare to
                      meet with Mugabe. It was a follow-up to the 2006 Beijing China-Africa
                      Cooperation Summit where the Chinese government invited the heads of
                      more than 40 African states to discuss relations. Africa has become a
                      diplomatic and economic priority for China and its economy.</p>
              <p>At that time, Beijing got an open invitation to help
                      develop dormant mines in the country. The deputy speaker of Zimbabwe's
                      parliament called for more Chinese investment in the country's mining
                      sector, according to China's Xinhua news agency. Zimbabwe's mining laws
                      were changed to allow the government to reallocate mining claims that
                      were not being exploited.</p>
              <p>Mining generates half of Zimbabwe's export revenue.
                      It is the only sector in the country that still has foreign investors
                      after the collapse of the main agricultural sector. Western companies
                      with mining claims in Zimbabwe were not exploiting them. "We would
                      appeal to the Chinese government to come in full force to exploit these
                      minerals," Zimbabwean Deputy Parliamentary Speaker, Kumbirai Kangai
                      said to the official Xinhua.</p>
              <p>Kangai assured potential Chinese investors that they
                      would not expose themselves to legal action if they took over claims
                      held by Western companies.</p>
              <p>A few months after, in December 2007, Chinese
                      company, Sinosteel Corporation, acquired 67 percent stake in Zimbabwe's
                      leading ferrochrome producer and exporter Zimasco Holdings. Zimasco
                      Holdings is the fifth largest high carbonated ferrochrome producer in
                      the world. It used to produce 210,000 tons of high-carbon ferrochrome
                      per year, nearly all of it along the mineral-rich Great Dyke,
                      accounting for 4 percent of global ferrochrome production.</p>
              <p>Zimasco has also the world's second largest reserves
                      of chrome, after South Africa. It was formerly owned by Union Carbide
                      Corporation, now part of Dow Chemicals Corp.</p>
              <p>Oh, oh! Alarm bells went ringing in London and in Washington at that news.</p>
              <p>China clearly views Africa as a central part of its
                      strategic plan, most notably for its oil reserves and vital raw
                      materials such as copper, chrome, nickel. The continent is also at the
                      same time becoming an important region for Chinese manufactured
                      exports. But the raw materials battle is at the heart, and the real
                      reason by all accounts, why Washington recently decided to form a
                      separate Africa Command in the Pentagon.</p>
              <p>Controlling China’s economic emergence is an
                      un-stated strategic priority of United States foreign and military
                      policy and has been since before September 11, 2001. The only delicate
                      point in the business is the fact that China, with well over $1.7
                      trillions of foreign exchange reserves, most believed in form of US
                      Treasury securities, could trigger a complete dollar panic and further
                      collapse of the US economy should she decide for political reasons it
                      were too risky to continue holding its hundreds of billions of US
                      dollar debt. In effect, by buying US Government debt with its trade
                      surpluses, China has been indirectly financing US policies counter to
                      Chinese national interest such as the Iraq war, or even the $100
                      million or so annually that Condi Rice’s State Department spends on
                      Tibet.</p>
              <p>China is refusing to play by the rules of the
                      Anglo-American neo-colonial game. It does not seek IMF or World Bank
                      approval before dealing with African countries. It makes soft loans,
                      regardless who might be running the country. In this it does nothing
                      different from Washington or London. The Chinese see American influence
                      in Africa less entrenched than in the rest of the world, thus offering
                      unique opportunities for China to pursue its economic interests. </p>
              <p>It may or may not be cynical. It may be Realpolitik.
                      If it results in the ability of certain African countries to use China
                      as a political counterweight to the one-sided Anglo-American domination
                      of the Continent, that itself could be a major benefit to Africans
                      depending on how they use it.</p>
              <p>Clearly, it has been extremely positive for Chinese
                      access to vital economic minerals for its economy as well as oil from
                      places such as Darfur and southern Sudan, or Nigeria.</p>
              <p>Mineral wealth has once more put Africa on center
                      stage of a battle for mineral riches between East and West. This time,
                      unlike during the Cold War era, however, Beijing is playing with far
                      more assets, and Washington with far less.</p>
