            <div class='col-md body'>I think the MOE should offer Pure Sciences subjects to those who are in NA. Those students who are in NA might have done and have passion for Sciences but because of the result of theirs, they could not take up Pure Sciences. It's such a sad case. It happened to me before. So I know how it feel to be like one of them.</div>

You cannot fail maths yet want to do science. There are a lot of statistics, a lot of calculations.<br><br>All-rounded doesn't mean you study all kinds of things.

Before poly, I used to think so. After poly, I realized the difference. I studied some general modules in my first year. I thought chemistry had little to do with maths, like in secondary school. The first year proved me wrong. I had to do a lot of calculations. You have to find angles (relating to chirality). Without a maths background, you would find it hard to understand. So is technology. You think those numbers have no use. Until you try your hands on writing a program, you never know.</div>

It's only at higher levels that you see the relationship and regret that you can't pursue science/maths because you are weak in either.<br><br>He may not be interested in humanities, which has no direct link with his science subjects. However, that is only if he is interested in subjects like physics, chemistry etc. What if he is interested in geophysics? He needs to know geography well. That's where humanities come into play. I would prefer that humanities is not compulsory, unless it is direct relationship with the studies. That's my view.</div>

UR ATTITUDE has to be changed!<br><br>it's a new era, changes are also came from students who have diff perspectives. do u think that there would only be a kind of system that will suit to everyone? even Polytechnics have oso implemented new learning system. the PBL - problem based learning.<br><br>(despodent's topic: dressing sloppily), how often do u see raffles sch students wear until so much like ah beng or ah lian? at most, i will say it's the own style of uniform dressing they adapted long ago, thru batches n batches.<br><br></div>
