            <div class='col-md body'>In defence of Singlish<br>An anti-Singlish editorial in the Straits Time (May 2, 2000) was yet another attack by a Singapore opinion leader, but the issue needs a less reactionary approach. Firstly, like nearly all official campaigns against language issues, there will be little to show for the money spent. Language change is driven by forces nearly always well beyond the control of governments and newspaper editors. Even Stalin failed, and governments more sensitive to public opinion risk looking foolish. Secondly, the concerns that Singlish is a danger to the international competitiveness of Singapore are wrong. Many English speakers around the world speak non-standard dialects of English as their main language, yet they are still fluent in standard English. In fact, leading researchers say that less than 15% of native-born Britons speak standard English as their everyday dialect1 See the papers linked below.<br><br>Speaking different dialects in different situations is called "diglossia", and happens everywhere there are dialects of different prestige. In Singapore, Singlish is the low prestige dialect, and standard English is the high prestige dialect.<br><br>Actually, there is no one "Singlish". At its most extreme, it has relatively few speakers, just as standard English is Singapore hardly ever is exactly the same as the English of the Home Counties. However, it is clear the most Singaporeans who can speak Standard English also use a different form of English that we call Singlish, and which of these two forms they use is easily predictable depending on the social situation. Using two dialects for different social purposes is called "Diglossia", and it has been widely researched, in Singapore and in many other places. The research goes back decades. It can be difficult to find a good way of explaining to standard English speakers how people can easily move between different dialects because the variation in English dialects around the world is usually not very great2 "Grammatical differences between Standard English and other dialects are in fact rather few in number, although of course they are very significant socially" Trudgill . Most people think of "Cockney" as being a separate dialect, although most of the characteristics of "Cockney" that make it a "dialect" are pronunciation based, not grammar based. However, "Cockney" can still illustrate the key points. First, we need a definition of fluency in standard English using a few tests, and then we ask if "Cockney" speakers can pass these tests. My tests are<br><br>Cockneys can sustain a ten minute, two-way conversation with a member of the British royal family (or Hugh Grant, or a job interview with a bank manager from Brighton. These are conversations very likely to be in standard English.)<br>They can comprehend the Daily Mirror, and they can understand a London BBC news broadcast and the Queen's annual address (to linguists, these tests are not as important, but I include them to show how difficult it is to imagine residents of London not having good standard English skills).<br>My claim is not that an East Londoner (or Geoffrey Boycott or a Norfolk speaker (this is a recording) for that matter) can sound like a member of the royal family, but by passing these tests in their ability to produce standard English and understand it, they demonstrate what I mean by fluency in standard English. At the same time, they are able to speak perfectly acceptable "Cockney" to other members of that social group. The United States and England are full of people who can move between standard English and local versions of English. This is just as well, because one leading researcher, Trudgill, estimates that only between 9% and 15% of Britons actually speak standard English as their main dialect, and that only 3% speak it with the "official" accent. While researching this article I came across an old Straits Times article, where a Singaporean mother complained that her daughter was speaking perfect standard English until she went to playgroup, where she learned Singlish from her peers. In fact the daughter was smarter than the mother; how could she have been accepted by the group if she kept speaking prestigious standard English in the informal surrounds of the playground. What a miserable childhood she would have had, since by rejecting the language of her peers she would have been rejected by them. Children in Singapore must learn Singlish or whatever else is the language of their peers, and it's the same the world over.<br><br>Another example close to Singapore is Jakarta. Anyone with basic Indonesian knows how different the native dialect of Jakartans is from Bahasa Indonesia, even though Bahasa Jakarta is still the same language3 Jakarta is the only place in Java where Bahasa Indonesia is spoken as a mother tongue.. Jakartans need standard Indonesian to talk with Indonesians from outside Jakarta, and for formal situations, even when everyone present is from Jakarta. You might think that native Jakartans get confused between the two dialects and can't speak good standard Bahasa Indonesia, yet after three years of living there, I can report that every single native-born4 Migrants from rural areas of Java are native speakers of Javanse, a completely unrelated language, and sometimes struggle with Bahasa Indonesia Jakartan I met speaks fine standard Indonesian, be they professionals, taxi drivers, maids, gardeners, drivers, security guards or whatever. I don't think too much of relying on personal anecdotes, but all the native Jakartans I've asked report the same thing. In other words, native born Jakartans speak two quite different dialects of Indonesian with ease. This would not be a surprise to people familiar with research in this area. Singaporeans easily perform the same thing.<br><br>English speakers raised in Singapore learn early in their life how to use different dialects for different situations, just as people do in all the other places on the planet with different dialects for different social needs. Many languages have different dialects for different social situations, and both Singlish and Bahasa Jakarta (known as 'slang' by its speakers) are used mainly in informal circumstances between social peers even when both speakers know the standard form of the language. The important conclusion is that usage of Singlish does not mean that Singapore speakers will be impaired in using standard English.<br><br>My reference to "Cockney" above may give the impression that Singlish is restricted to usage in Singapore by less educated people, since Cockneys are famously lower class residents of a poor part of London. In fact, as research by Gupta (see also links below) and others show, Singlish usage is widespread through all classes in Singapore, including "bank managers, doctors and teachers"5 private correspondence, groups who have excellent command of standard English. In Jakarta, Bahasa Jakarta ("slang") is also used by all classes.<br><br>Despite the negative pressure from the authorities, most Singaporeans are quietly proud of Singlish, and why not? It is a fun, energetic and dynamic dialect. If Singaporeans wish for a separate cultural identity, Singlish is likely to grow in popularity, no matter what the government does. Not so long ago the editorial pages of the Straits Times were dismayed by surveys showing that some young Singaporeans really wanted to be Westerners. Singlish is strong evidence that most young Singaporeans are actually moving in the opposite direction; they want "Singaporean" to mean more than living in an air-conditioned dot on the map.<br><br>As for the concern about international English, who could seriously deny that these same young Singaporeans are first class speakers of standard English? No country in Asia has better English skills; among its service economy rivals, only Australia offers serious competition in overall language skills. But is there a decline in English here? No. Spending some time among both older and younger Singaporeans reveals that English in Singapore is getting better with successive generations, even as Singlish seems to spread further and further into the mass media.<br><br>English recently became the first language in 2000 years to have more second-language speakers than native speakers. By using different dialects of English for both international communication and for local use, Singapore is not joining a world wide corruption. It is leading a world wide trend; globalisation means that people are becoming more protective of their identities even as they spend more time in contact with the rest of the world. This will drive language change everywhere, but it will not threaten the requirement for standard English anywhere.<br><br>Clearly, Singapore's language education is working well. In an island speaking so many languages, there is very good and improving command of standard English. It's odd to think that Singlish is a threat to this, because evidence from all over the world says it's not.<br><br>Relax, lah. Singlish is cool, it's homegrown and it's no problem.<br><br>Tim Richardson, Singapore.<br>Draft written in May 2000. Modified Sept 2000 and March 2001.<br><br>I am not a linguist nor involved in language education, language policy or anything connected to the "language industry". My views are influenced by my undergraduate studies in Linguistics, and by my own interests, observations and enjoyment of language.<br><br></div>

Long live singlish, and dun feel bad to speak it even if your english... cannot make it one.

            <div class='col-md body'>I can relate to how Singlish can be an identity for Singaporeans as I spent a great deal of time in Australia and most of my (caucasian) colleagues and classmates that have hung out with Singaporeans have mentioned to me that they can tell a Singaporean apart from other Asians when they speak. When I heard that I felt a tinge of pride and even proceeded to explain to them the meaning of certain Singlish terms, and it's usage.<br><br>However, there is a limit to how much a non-singaporean can understand. Imagine I said to my Singaporean friend "I kena damn jialat from my mother last nite leh", do you think a non-local would be able to understand that? One might say that it is a mixture of languages. "kena" is malay, while "jialat" is hokkein. So, in other words, to me, Singlish is a mix of many languages, with added lars, lors and lehs. This "language" should only be spoken with locals.<br><br>While Singlish may be something that Singaporeans are proud of, I feel that this should only arise from the fact that it is unique, and only spoken by us. Not proud because it is a superior form of communication. It may be superior between our peers, but definitely not around the globe.<br><br>Then there's this problem of Singaporeans using Singlish as an excuse for not improving their standard English. It's downright disgusting to have a Singaporean tell me, "Aiyah we're Singaporean wat, english so good for wat! Singaporeans, must speak Singlish what! How to call yourself Singaporean like that?"<br><br>Go ahead and bastardise the language for your needs and conveniences, but for goodness sake, at least know the language that you are bastardising.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>in response to singapore dinosaur's point:<br><br>i respect his ability to articulate and understand different accents. it must be the result of his wide exposure.<br><br>but my point stands: fluency in a language, be it english, french, chinese or swahili is <strong>not</strong> about snobbery. it is simply a matter of mastery.<br><br>needless to say, nobody expects one to speak exactly as one writes. just because i am capable of commiting my thoughts into writing in a perfectly grammatical fashion does not mean that i am predisposed to articulate the same thoughts in the same manner when i converse.<br><br>i'm not particularly interested in picking up foreign accents like strawberries in cameroon highlands, but i pride myself in being able to communicate with sufficient clarity.<br><br>i am not against the use of singlish as well. i use it when the situation calls for it. many of us, i'm sure, are capable of the same as well.<br><br>the thing is, i'm not exactly comfortable with such self-serving talk that singlish is an assertion of our identity by people who can barely speak the english language with sufficient clarity. gurmit singh does not speak that way outside his role as pck... why should anyone do so?<br><br>the point here, is effective communication. if the setting is such that one needs to adapt to hokkien-singlish, or cantonese-singlish or malay-singlish to allow one to be understood, so be it  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>but one needs to be able to speak with sufficient clarity without too much awkward local inflections and alien words in a more formal enviornment. most times, it is not the language that obscures the meaning in a conversation, but the thick accent that makes it very hard to understand what the other person is trying to say. and this problem is not limited to singlish. it extends to every single foreign accent which one is not accustomed to.<br><br>its not about snobbery. its about clarity in communication.<br><br>i don't think it is possible to make singlish our "national language" and to only use english for formal communication with "barbarians"... it doesn't work that way. singlish is rich because it is a local adaptation of a living language. to institutionalise it and formalise it would kill it.<br><br>and teaching it in schools would almost certainly lead to a generation of kids who can't speak singlish OR english properly  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  much like the failure of the bilingual system don't u think?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If you are able to discern when to speak and when not to speak singlish, then I think singlish is perfectly normal.  What proponents of Singlish are doing is not to glorify it, but rather calling for its continued use in informal and relaxed environments among Singaporeans.  It has become a very Singaporean thing to speak in singlish with friends, largely influenced by the many cultural differences present in Singapore.  Also, the use of Singlish is so widespread, I don't see how it is possible to effectively decrease its usage by a large percentage, especially since users of singlish only use it in private spoken communications or text messages.  People of the world speak different variations of English.  I think the very fact that English has been verbally modified to fit so many cultural backgrounds is a prove of its adaptibility and versatility. We should not discontinue its use among private communications, but it should be made clear that there are occasions when Singlish cannot and should not be used, such as when handling business dealings, something which the govt has stated as a reason for Singaporeans to give up singlish.  Notice also that much of the hype from the govt over the use of Singlish has died down, I think this a good sign of the govt, even if grudgingly, accept Singlish as part of Singaporeans' private affairs and not poke their nose in it.</div>
