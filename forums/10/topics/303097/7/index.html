As a result of the accident, the daughter made a demand upon Colonial for uninsured motorist coverage under the policy issued to her mother.<br><br>In October 1996, the insurer filed the present motion for declaratory judgment naming the Smiths as defendants.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by deathbait:<br><br><span style="color: darkred;">Replies in Darkred<br><br>Among the subjects covered in the questions were the ownership of the vehicle and whether there were others in Smith's household who were licensed motor vehicle operators.  Responding to the agent's questions, Smith said the vehicle was titled in her name and that there were no other licensed drivers in her household.  This information was "input" into the agent's computer, transmitted to the insurer's underwriting department, and reflected in an application form printed by the computer that was signed by Smith.  Based on the information Smith furnished the agent, the policy was issued effective March 8.<br><br>The insurer later learned, however, that when Smith applied for the insurance she was not the actual owner of the vehicle, but that it was owned by an unlicensed driver who did not live with her.  If the insurer had learned this fact at any time after issuance of the policy, it would have cancelled the policy.  The insurer also learned later that Shunda Smith, a licensed driver, was living with her mother at the time she applied for the policy.  If the insurer had known this fact at the time, the premium charged would have increased by about 50%.<br><br>Upon consideration of the evidence, the trial court found the insurer had met the requirements of Code Â§ 38.2-309, which provides that statements in an application for an insurance policy shall bar recovery under the policy if it is "clearly proved" that such statements were "material to the risk when assumed" and were "untrue."<br><br>On appeal, the Smiths concede that the trial court had "sufficient evidence to support its decision."  The Smiths argue, however, the insurer attempted to prove that the application form signed by Catherine Smith was "incomplete" because, they note, the form did not contain all the questions asked of her or her answers.  Nonetheless, they point out, it contained above her signature the language "on the basis of statements contained herein."  "Basically," the Smiths say, "Colonial contends that Smith made oral misrepresentations to its agent and that misrepresentation is indicated by the lack of certain information on the application."  This "missing information," according to the Smiths, "if ever requested, may have been contained in the agent's computer program but never printed on the application or insurance contract Colonial entered into with Smith."<br><br>The Smiths also rely on a "merger" theory in which they contend all misleading statements "Smith made prior to her signing the application were merged" into the contract of insurance.  According to the Smiths:  "Colonial relies on alleged statements made to the insurance agent and not on information found on the application in order to add to and alter the contents of the insurance contract of the parties."  The Smiths contend, building on their "merger" theory, that "[t]he trial court's admission of parol evidence to add to or reform the terms of the contract was legal error."<br><br>We do not agree with any of the Smiths' contentions.  Their argument demonstrates a misconception of insurance law and practice generally and the application process for motor vehicle liability insurance in particular.<br><br>In the first place, there is no requirement that an application for liability insurance be solely in writing; it may be oral, it may be written, or, as in this case, partly oral and partly written.  See Franklin Fire Ins. Co. v. Bolling, 173 Va. 228, 233, 3 S.E.2d 182, 184 (1939); North River Ins. Co. v. Lewis, 137 Va. 322, 324-27, 119 S.E. 43, 44-45 (1923).<br><br>In the second place, an application for insurance is merely an offer to enter into a contract.  Hayes v. Durham Life Ins. Co., 198 Va. 670, 672-73, 96 S.E.2d 109, 111 (1957).  The insurance policy is the contract between the parties.  Hence, this application for motor vehicle liability insurance did not "merge" into the policy contract that ultimately was issued by the insurer based upon representations in the application.<br><br>In the third place, the parol evidence rule applies to written contracts. Amos v. Coffey, 228 Va. 88, 91-92, 320 S.E.2d 335, 337 (1984).  Therefore, the rule has no relevance to an application for liability insurance because, as we have said, the application is a mere offer.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Although the written portion of the application in this case is not a model of clarity and does not contain the actual questions posed by the agent, it is nevertheless the embodiment of the discussion between the applicant and the agent.  Thus, the written form, as well as the oral testimony explaining the completion of the form, were properly considered by the trial court as evidence that material misrepresentations had been made.<br></span><br>Accordingly, we hold the trial court did not err and we will affirm the judgment below.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br><br>Source: </span><a href="http://www.courts.state.va.us/opinions/opnscvwp/1982070.doc" rel="nofollow">http://www.courts.state.va.us/opinions/opnscvwp/1982070.doc</a><br><br>It can't be done.

While informal contracts are everywhere, a written one always trumps an informal one. I don't care how many types of contracts are available. A written one was also signed. That's enough for me.<br><br>You seem to be under the assumption that there wasn't even a written contract. If that were the case, where did HDB pull out that no compensation clause? Was it oral? Where did the lady sign? In the air?<br><br>You are right that I was presumptuous to assume the daughter was there at the actual signing. But I really have to inquire here...if your stand is that there is no written contract, what the hell are you talking about?<br><br>Also, it matters not how often you don't read contracts before signing them. The fact remains that you SHOULD read them.<br><br>"You mean HDB don't profit from the $18,000? Your logic in the argument is amusing. Nevertheless a one sided logic favouring the government. "<br><br>Sure, they profit from the 18k. But as many, many people have pointed out, it is but a drop in their treasury. The PR backlash alone is worth more than that. They are risking more than 18k to gain back 18k and you know it. The lady and family on the other hand risk virtually nothing. Even if they lose this, ppl such as yourself would give them value by sympathising.<br><br>Since you were kind enough to reply with a semi serious long post, I shall continue my long rant in the next one<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You don't get to argue from thousands of directions, throwing enough dirt and seeing what sticks.<br><br>You have had these positions in the last 3 posts<br><br>1) there was no written contract<br>2) when written contract was signed, the old lady was incapable(as in totally unable) of understanding it.<br>3) there were witnesses to validate the old lady's claim that an oral agreement was struck(quite improbable, as the people who talked to her are unlikely to hold such authority)<br><br>Not only do these contradict each other, they are marginal arguments at best.<br><br>First of all, there IS a written contract. Don't even know how you're going to argue from this angle<br><br>Also, the old lady has already agreed to return the money. The family already admits the money was wrongly taken.
