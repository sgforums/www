But the old lady noticing that an extra 18k was suddenly deposited in her bank should find something amiss.<br><br>Why? In the agreement, since the clause no compensation for the stall was in, there should not be a clause stating an 18K will be reimburse into her bank, so she should not even expect any money.<br><br>With an extra 18k in bank, and a monthly letter from the bank, it is obvious that the HDB has accidentally added that money.<br><br>It is the duty of everyone to return this kind of money. It is PUBLIC MONEY."</span><br><br>This is the main point. Forget about govt past mistakes, forget about sympathy for the lady, forget every other non relevant things.<br><br>Just focus on this logic. If there is a clause stating NO COMPENSATION, then there SHOULD BE NO CLAUSE STATING 18K WILL BE PAID. Otherwise, there will be a contradiction isn't it???<br><br>HENCE, WHEN SHE REALIZE 18K WAS DEPOSITED TO HER ACCOUNT, TOGETHER WITH THE MONTHLY BANK STATEMENT, SHE SHOULD REALIZE HDB MADE A MISTAKE AND SHE SHOULD HAVE DOUBLE CHECK WITH THE HDB ONCE MORE.<br><br>In short, it wasnt really wrong for HDB to ask back the money.</div>

Suggest you ignore them, no point arguing with little boys.<br><br>To me there was a new exchange of consideration, the lady giving up the stall and the payment of $18,000 for her to give up that right.<br><br>Moreover one still has to contend with the undue influence when the old lady signed the contract, which might make the original contract voidable.<br><br>Then there is the UK Landlord and Tenant Act, which specifically provides for compensation for Landlord taking possession of their property. So was the contract under the ambit of Unfair Contract Terms Act (UCTA), because the Landlord specifically provided for an exemption clause.<br><br>e.g. If an old lady buys a brand new TV with no discount, the terms in the sales invoice states that the retailer is not responsible for the condition of the TV and no compensation will be made for damaged TV. The old lady receives the TV and it was damaged, not in working condition.<br><br>Does this mean that you can't take legal actions to recover your TV? (UCTA)<br><br>The old lady with language difficulties might not even understand the contract, which calls into question if "undue influence" was present in the contract.<br><br>Then you have the the retailer offering to pay you back $2,000 for the TV, you accepted the deal.<br><br>Then the retailer comes back to tell you that in the original contract, no compensation is provided for. Then the retailer wants to recover the money paid whilst you have already lost possession of the TV.<br><br>There was a new contract, exchange of TV for the money returned to the consumer.<br><br></div>
