This act is only reasonable for faulty goods sold with an intention to cheat money.<br>In our case, the contract drawn by HDB did state clearly no compensation made. The 18 K re-imburse was a mistake made by HDB though.<br><br>If u ever check the 1st agreement anyone sign in order to own a stall, there is a clause stating something like the HDB reserve right to collect the stalls back without any form of compensation.<br><br>So it is different from ur unfair contract term act.<br><br>The old lady is not alone! Her daughters and sons could have double check.<br>Also, if in doubts, she can always seeks legal advice through proper channel. So, there should not be any problem here.<br><br></div></blockquote>Huh?<br><br>Can you cite which section of the Act you mention that states the Unfair Contract Terms Act is only for "faulty goods sold with an intention to cheat money"?<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Unfair Contract Terms Act</strong><br>Varieties of exemption clause.<br>13. Â—(1) To the extent that this Part prevents the exclusion or restriction of any liability it also prevents Â—<br><br>(a) making the liability or its enforcement subject to restrictive or onerous conditions;<br><br>(b) excluding or restricting any right or remedy in respect of the liability, or subjecting a person to any prejudice in consequence of his pursuing any such right or remedy;<br><br>(c) excluding or restricting rules of evidence or procedure,<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">and (to that extent) sections 2 and 5 to 7 also prevent excluding or restricting liability by reference to terms and notices which exclude or restrict the relevant obligation or duty. </span><br><br>(2) But an agreement in writing to submit present or future differences to arbitration is not to be treated under this Part as excluding or restricting any liability.<br></span><br><br>Already stated very cleary, the liability is consistent with the practices in the Landlord and Tenant Act UK, where a Landlord must compensate the Tenant if he wishes not to renew the tenancy under certain conditions.<br><br>If the contract was made specifically to exclude liabilities such as compensation from Landlord to Tenant for the termination of lease (when compensation is required by Landlord and Tenant Act UK), it doesn't absolve the Landlord from such a liability by merely stating it in the contract. Like the example for the TV I gave earlier.<br><br>Do you understand the meaning of "undue influence" in the Law of Contracts?<br><br>Maybe you can explain to me what is "undue influence" under Contract Law?<br><br>Do you understand the exchange of new consideration for the new contract?<br><br><blockquote><br>Moreover in tamago's 2nd post:<br><br>Leong Sze Hian, who first heard of Mdm Lee's predicament and brought her case to the attention of the local media, says:<br><br>After sending my letter to the newspapers' forum pages, I spoke to 4 lawyers, who were of the opinion that the HDB may be estopped from claiming the return of the $18,000, because she gave up her hawker stall and livelihood as a hawker by accepting HDB's offer of $18,000.<br><br>Wikipedia:-<br><br>Estoppel is a legal doctrine recognised both at common law and in equity in various forms. It is meant to complement the requirement of consideration in contract law. In general it protects a party who would suffer detriment if:<br><br>* The defendant has done or said something to induce an expectation<br>* The plaintiff relied (reasonably) on the expectationÂ…<br>* Â…and would suffer detriment if that expectation were false.<br><br>In English law, the concept of legitimate expectation in the realm of administrative law and judicial review is estoppel's counterpart in public law, although subtle but important differences exist.<br><br>Perhaps the obstacle for Mdm Lee in bringing her case to the courts would be her signing of a Letter of Undertaking when she first took ownership of her stall in 1993. In the undertaking, she agreed that she will not seek any compensation in the event of any upgrading of her stall.<br><br>This, however, throws up the question of whether it was fair for the HDB to have hawkers sign such a document in the first place.<br><br>Perhaps those who are well-versed in the law can provide clarification.<br></blockquote>Maybe you can consult a lawyer friend to refute all the views by the other lawyers.<br><br>Maybe you are well verse in the use of calculus for optimization with Lagrange Multipliers, but as can be seen from here Law isn't your forte.</div>

How can the old lady knowing that she will be paid 18 K sign a contract stating no compensation made?<br><br>The only possibility is the 1st and most obvious clause must have"18k will be paid"<br><br>But this will contradict the 2nd clause on "no compensation made", making the contract useless for the HDB to use against the old lady.<br><br>Now, the HDB is using this contract as a basis against the old lady. Hence, the contract must be logically sound and this must mean "18K will be paid" clause must not have exist .<br><br>This means the old lady should know no money was to be given at all.<br><br>Another possibility could be as what M13 said, there is a 2nd contract on compensation.<br><br>However ,till now, I dont see EXPLICITLY in any relevant articles that there is a 2nd contract.</div>
