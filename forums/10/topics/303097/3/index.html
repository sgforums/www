There is no grey area here. She has to pay it back.<br><br>It's like if you accidentally put 18k in my account now, and then try to call me to get it back for 4 years. 4 years later, you finally corner me and demand the 18k back. Why should I be made to suffer for YOUR mistake, I ask you. Does this sound right?<br><br>Just because HDB is an organisation and not a person does not make the debt any less legit.</div></blockquote>However HDB being an organisation with millions of dollars pouring into it, should be more compassionate to the lady . Yes she should pay it back but at least they should give her more payment options rather than to demand it back in 21 days- and then it is funnier when they demand it in 3-6 months instalment . It's ridiculous considering that she does not have a job at 75 years old- do they expect business for her to pop up suddenly and she gets 3k per month to pay it off?<br><br>So if she declares bankruptcy , what then?<br><br>Out of curiosity , if she dies , does the debt pass on to her daughters if let's say her estate is zero?<br><br>Actually my granny went through the same thing in the 1980s . Telecoms back then forgot to bill her correctly for 5 years . They discovered their mistake and tried to reclaim back the money from her. She sat outside Telecoms office and made alot of noise . Every day faithfully, she will pack up her kopi and bread and sit out side there telling the world what telecoms tried to do to a poor old lady.  They called the police , the policeman also don't want to go disturb an old lady .<br><br>In the end , they agreed to let her pay 2 dollars per week until her 600 dollar bill is paid up, just so they can stop her from sitting outside their office and going around telling people how cruel the govt and telecoms is to her. My dad offered to pay it off for her but she said it was telecom's fault so they have to deal with HER ....hahaha. Oh ya she did pay it off.</div>

She was just cheesed off that Telecoms wanted payment within 30 days. In those days , 600 dollars was alot of money.<br><br>She was an old woman who can't read english. Just proves to show how much of an arrogant high horse you are riding . In those days, people were not so educated as we are now.<br><br>Anything in a letter with a dollar sign - she asks my uncle or my mother to read for her.

My grandma is not the type who get someone to clean up the mess after her.

Ask daddy and mommy for money first to sort out your debts rather than to pursue another course of action?<br><br>If it was so wrong , why did they not arrest her and throw her into jail? She didn't try to skim off not paying - she tried to get them to be reasonable (they said no to her installment when she asked nicely)  and she didn't see a need for my father to pay for it.<br><br>In the end , both parties got what they wanted - Telecoms got the bill paid up with her own choice of instalment.</div>
