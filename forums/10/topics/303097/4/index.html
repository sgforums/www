Ditto for being old. Or for being illiterate.<br><br>The rules for playing in the society is simple. You follow the rules and pay your dues. Rules are only effective when everyone follows them. Everytime someone chips off a small advantage from the system for private gain like in your grandmother's case, the system fails a little more. Worse still, everytime someone gains, someone else loses.<br><br>And what happens when the old rules no longer prevent petty theft from the system? More rules are needed. It is no coincidence that Singapore has so many minor laws to prevent seemingly useless things. Singaporeans are UGLY. We are. No amount of patroitism will change that fact. WE ARE UGLY.<br><br>And so, yes I look down with disdain at people like your grandmother who goes out of her way to gain that small bit of advantage from the system. Or the driver who thinks it's harmless to run a red light just because there is no traffic in the middle of the night.<br><br>It's these little things that contribute to the society you ppl seem to dislike so much. To the governance that seems to rule with an iron fist. I'm sorry to burst your bubble all. But the government is usually trying to save us from ourselves.<br><br>Ask yourself if you don't steal from the commons every single day. Running red lights. Jaywalking. Littering. The list goes on.</div></blockquote>Actually Telecoms could have charged her interest - if they did , she probably paid it as well. She just didn't agree with them because they refused to let her pay in instalments.<br><br>So get the story right. My grandma paid her debt up.  She was never known as a dishonest person. She was well known for being trustworthy. I suggest that you lay off her. I was quoting her story because it appeared similar to the case of the little old lady who is now forced to either pay 18k in 21 days or 18k in 3-6 months.<br><br>That old lady - what happens if she dies? Charge the debt to her daughter who has nothing to do with it in the first place?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all, lets put aside sympathy and "the govt always at fault" mentality and analyze this case proper.<br><br>The newspaper states<br>"Upgrading works were in the pipeline, and stallholders had three options: They could give up their stalls, move to a temporary market across the road or set up shop at another location."<br><br>"At her daughter's urging, Mdm Lee surrendered her stall in October 2003, in return for $18,000 in compensation from the Housing and Development Board (HDB)."<br><br>"It cited a clause in an agreement Mdm Lee had signed in 1993 that said she would not be entitled to any compensation for the stall."<br><br>It is pretty obvious that the old lady did not read her agreement. If in doubt, she can always seek legal advice.<br><br>However, if one were to think logically, when one is asked to give up his/her stall, the 1st thing that come to mind should be compensation!<br><br>So, how could she miss out such an important clause??! Putting aside the doubts on the honesty of the old lady and her daughter, if they fail to notice the clause, then, in the eyes of the law, they failed to comply to the contract.<br><br>Of course, the HDM is screwed up to allow such a mistake to occur. But the old lady noticing that an extra 18k was suddenly deposited in her bank ,she should find something amiss.<br><br><strong>Why? In the agreement, since the clause no compensation for the stall was in, there should not be a clause stating an 18K will be reimburse into her bank, so she should not even expect any money.</strong><br><br>With an extra 18k in bank, and a monthly letter from the bank, it is obvious that the HDB has accidentally added that money.<br><br>It is the duty of everyone to return this kind of money. It is PUBLIC MONEY.<br><br>I have my own reservation about the old lady and daughter honesty but that is another matter.<br><br>The HBD has to send letter like "The letter, dated Monday, also stated that payment had to be made within 21 days, "failing which we have instructions to commence legal action without further reference"."   TO PREVENT PPL IGNORING THEIR REQUEST.<br><br>Imagine if the letter is like "no legal action will be taken but pls kindly return us our money. Do u think anyone will return the money after reading this kind of letter??<br><br>The paper also states "She can contact us for assistance if she has difficulties in returning the money, <span style="color: red;">" it added." ... so things can be negotiated</span>.<br><br>Hence, it is irrelevant for ppl here to argue that the HDB is uncompromising.<br><br>I do agree that the mistake HDB made is silly, and I feel the person who make this mistake must be punish by HDB.<br><br>However, dragging the whole govt in seems a little too absurd since they do not make the mistake themselves.<br><br>Afterall, which employer dare say the employee they employ will never make any mistake.<br><br></div>
