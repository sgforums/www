            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="color: darkblue;">HDB's mistake but she's made to pay - 4 years later</span><br>By Leong Sze Hian</strong><br><br>A close friend whom I have known for about 20 years, a 75 year-old widow, has received a registered letter from the HDB, informing her that "HDB had mistakenly paid her the sum of $18,000 under the impression that she was eligible for the said sum under the Hawker Centres Upgrading Programme".<br><br>If not for the HDB's mistake, she would not have given up her hawker stall four years ago.<br><br>HDB's letter ended with "We hereby demand you pay back the sum of $ 18,000 to HDB within 21 days from the date of this letter, failing which we have instructions to commence legal action without further reference".<br><br>Since it was the HDB's mistake, the HDB should try to give her back the hawker stall which she had been renting for more than 10 years.<br><br>About a month ago, an officer from the National Environment Agency (NEA), came to her house at 8 a.m. , without any prior notice or appointment, to tell her that she had to pay back the $ 18,000.<br><br>After she asked as to whether she could have her stall to rent again, an application for hawker stall rental form was received by her in the mail, without any covering letter.<br><br>She duly completed the application form and sent it to the NEA office.<br><br>Someone from the NEA subsequently called her to say that no stall was available yet.<br><br>I feel that the HDB's action by sending the registered letter of demand to an illiterate 75 year-old Singaporean, is rather high-handed, considering the chain of events described above.<br><br>This has caused undue stress to her.<br><br>As she doesn't mind waiting until a stall is available for her to rent again, I would like to suggest that the HDB consider the possibility of delaying their legal action.<br><br>She gave up her livelihood of over 20 years as a hawker, in exchange for $18,000.<br><br>Since it was the HDB's mistake, I think they should be flexible, and try to give her a stall, before demanding a lump sum payment back from her.<br><br>If the HDB can take four years to discover their mistake, I think they should at least give more time for her to wait for a rental stall.<br><br>By the way, what if she had already spent the $ 18,000 on her medical expenses over the last four years ?<br><br>So, no stall, no livelihood, and now no more money too.<br><br><a href="http://www.todayonline.com/articles/231596.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.todayonline.com/articles/231596.asp</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>running Singapore like a company.....<br><br>"If you had a mother who's been working all her life, would you still want her to work at such an advanced age?", Ms Gina Lau asked when explaining why she had advised her mother to give up the stall at the Hougang Ave 1 hawker centre in 2003.<br><br>In return for giving up her business, Mdm Lee was given $18,000 by the Housing and Development Board (HDB) under its Hawker Centres Upgrading Programme.<br><br>(The Hawker Centres Upgrading Programme (HUP) was launched in Feb 2001 at an estimated cost of $420m to upgrade markets/hawker centres over a period of 10 years. - NEA)<br><br>4 years later, her good intentions have resulted in a controversial decision by the HDB demanding that her mother, Mdm Lee Ah Muay, return the $18,000 compensation given to her in 2003.<br><br>Ms Lau told theonlinecitizen (TOC) that business was poor in 2003 and that was another reason why she advised her mother to give up the stall. Mdm Lee made an average of $500 per month from her business of selling clothes then.<br><br><strong>Letter of demand</strong><br><br>The HDB, according to a TODAY report, said that "its earlier attempts to contact her since 2004 had failed". However Ms Lau questioned how this could be so. "Why didn't they leave any notes at my door at least?", she asked. We also understand that no phone calls were made to Mdm Lee.<br><br>In September last year, an officer from the NEA visited Mdm Lee and informed her that "HDB had made a mistake with the payout and the money had to be returned". Ms Lau questions why it took the authorities so long to find out about the mistake.<br><br>In Jan 2008, a letter of demand from the NEA was sent to Mdm Lee, giving her 21 days to return the $18,000.<br><br>Ms Lau had earlier said, according to the TODAY report, that she "regrets the advice she gave her mother" and she hopes the NEA "can help secure a new stall for her mother at the refurbished hawker centre" as her mother prefers to keep working and also that her mother's friends were all there.<br><br><strong>Compromise by the HDB?</strong><br><br>After the media broke the news, Mdm Lee and Ms Lau visited HDB officials on Friday afternoon and was told that the HDB would "put them on a priority list" for a new stall. The HDB, according to Ms Lau, has also offered them an installment plan to return the $18,000 within a period of 3 to 6 months.<br><br>TOC understands that NEA officers will visit her again on Monday (14 Jan) to discuss the issue of providing her with a new stall.<br><br><strong>Questions raised</strong><br><br>The obvious question one would have to ask is: Why was the HDB and then the NEA so ineffective in getting in touch with Mdm Lau since 2004? It is quite unfathomable that Mdm Lau would not be contactable for 4 years.<br><br>Was someone dragging his feet at the HDB or NEA?<br><br>If the mistake by the HDB was discovered, as can be inferred from the TODAY report, and dealt with earlier, the whole saga would have been avoided. Mdm Lau was still operating a stall at the temporary hawker centre from 2004 to 2005 when the original one was being refurbished.<br><br>As such, how did the HDB and then the NEA fail in their attempts to contact her?<br><br>Ms Lau told TOC that the NEA even asked her mother, in 2006, to pay her hawker licence fee.<br><br><strong>Who is in charge?</strong><br><br>As far as TOC understands, there is no such "priority list' for application of hawker stalls under the HUP. Is the HDB going to install one now? Also, why is it that it is the HDB Â– and not the NEA Â– which gave Mdm Lee the assurance that it will put them on a "priority list"?<br><br>It was the NEA which informed Mdm Lee that HDB had made a mistake in giving her the $18,000 payout. But it was the HDB which issued the letter of demand to Mdm Lee and has given her the assurance of a new stall today.<br><br>Who, therefore, is in charge of the case now Â– HDB or NEA?<br><br><strong>Legal view</strong><br><br>Leong Sze Hian, who first heard of Mdm Lee's predicament and brought her case to the attention of the local media, says:<br><br>After sending my letter to the newspapers' forum pages, I spoke to 4 lawyers, who were of the opinion that the HDB may be estopped from claiming the return of the $18,000, because she gave up her hawker stall and livelihood as a hawker by accepting HDB's offer of $18,000.<br><br>Wikipedia:-<br><br>Estoppel is a legal doctrine recognised both at common law and in equity in various forms. It is meant to complement the requirement of consideration in contract law. In general it protects a party who would suffer detriment if:<br><br>* The defendant has done or said something to induce an expectation<br>* The plaintiff relied (reasonably) on the expectationÂ…<br>* Â…and would suffer detriment if that expectation were false.<br><br>In English law, the concept of legitimate expectation in the realm of administrative law and judicial review is estoppel's counterpart in public law, although subtle but important differences exist.<br><br>Perhaps the obstacle for Mdm Lee in bringing her case to the courts would be her signing of a Letter of Undertaking when she first took ownership of her stall in 1993. In the undertaking, she agreed that she will not seek any compensation in the event of any upgrading of her stall.<br><br>This, however, throws up the question of whether it was fair for the HDB to have hawkers sign such a document in the first place.<br><br>Perhaps those who are well-versed in the law can provide clarification.<br><br><strong>Pressured to give up stall?</strong><br><br>TOC understands that Mdm Lee was given 3 weeks to decide if she wanted to give up her stall in 2003. Officers from the HDB were also sent to advise her to do so. As the documents were in English, the question of proper translation and detailed explanation by the officers is important.<br><br>Perhaps the HDB (or NEA) should explain whether officers are sent to induce hawkers to give up their stalls and how such "persuasion" is done.<br><br><strong>HDB should be penalised as well</strong><br><br>Lastly, since it was HDB's mistake Â– by its own admission Â– shouldn't the HDB be penalised for sloppy work? Why is the burden of the mistake being squarely and totally shouldered by a 75 year old woman?<br><br>HDB's manner of recovering the $18,000 through a Letter Of Demand smacks of intimidation and highhandedness. This is especially unbecoming of a government agency which obviously (for reasons stated above) failed miserably in trying to contact Mdm Lee.<br><br>Perhaps the HDB should offer Mdm Lee a discount on the $18,000 to be repaid, and thus accepts its part of the mistake.<br><br>It would be in line with MM Lee's recent comments about being a gracious society.<br><br><strong>Mdm Lee</strong><br><br>Mdm Lee, who has 2 sons and 3 daughters, suffers from diabetes, and has had to purchase a "medical chair" for $10,000, according to her daughter. She has also used the money from the payout on her medical fees the last 4 years or so. In addition, she also paid $7,000 to the HDB in 2004 for her stall at the temporary market.<br><br>But what she misses most is being active in running her business. She also misses being with her friends. When asked if she visits the refurbished hawker centre to chit chat with her friends, she said that she no longer does, except when she needs to buy some things.</div>
