World Bank President Paul Wolfowitz later told the BBC he hoped Singapore would reverse it.<br><br>Daboub said the bank had discussed the matter with the Singaporean ambassador to the United States and other high-level officials.<br><br>He said the bank and the IMF had to respect the decisions of sovereign countries but added: "We are asking them to reconsider their position and allow for more participation from civil society."<br><br><span style="color: red;">The issue would be discussed at the World Bank-IMF annual meetings on September 19-20 in Singapore, said Daboub, adding: "I think for the future it's an experience that should not be repeated."</span><br><br>Singapore has mounted its biggest-ever security operation to police the event set to draw thousands of delegates from over 180 countries.<br><br>---<br><br>Looks like we might have said goodbye to future such meetings..</div>

How much damage did they cause to the lives and businesses of ordinary citizens in those cities, just to send their farking message to some international organisation? And now they want to bring this here to Singapore. What for? So they can turn Singapore into their battleground?<br><br>They complain that we don't roll out the red carpet for them to protest here. Why should some foreigner enjoy a right denied to the Singaporean in his own country?<br><br>If even one hair on a Singaporean's head is touched, be it bystander or directly involved in the IMF summit,  then they will suffer the consequences. Its time we realised that the well-being of our citizens is worth more than the boost in reputation we may gain from holding a successful summit.</div></blockquote>That's why I hope we give them a black eye if they decide to tear up our stuff.<br><br>Peaceful sit-ins are fine by me, but the minute they get violent. Just taser them.</div>
