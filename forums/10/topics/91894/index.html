This figure is in fact given by Minister Tharman in Feb<br>2003.<br>The article can be found in New Paper 2003, Feb 4, 2003.<br>The sudden plunge in child births, alarming divorce rates (30%), high<br>suicides, lowest frequency of sex, etc are all connected. How can you<br>ask a population that is shouldering the heaviest debt burden in the<br>world to have more children? Does it make sense? ....Its like asking<br>the guy with one leg to run the marathon.<br>--------------------------------------------------------------<br>And what happens when wages fall and prices rise? Household debts go<br>kaboom! It took Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam to tell us that<br>"household debt in Singapore had surged to 174 per cent of personal<br>disposable income in 2000 - higher than in the developed economies<br>such as the US, UK and Japan." (TNP, Feb 4, 2003) Thank you very<br>much.</div>

Its probably due to house ownership. In other countries renting is more common. That probably distort the figures.<br><br>I think the debts we shd worry more abt is credit cards debts. It seems like the average age of ppl going bankrupt is getting younger because of uncontrolled spending. I think more shd be done abt it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Pretty easy to figure out why.<br><br>1) Mortgages<br>2) Auto loans<br>3) Student loans<br>4) Country club loans<br>5) Credit card loans<br><br>Singaporeans by-and-large fund the purchase of their 5 C's with credit amortized over a long period of time. Further, the penchant to leverage real estate in the rising housing markets leads to ballooning loan-to-value ratios. This all works as long as real estate is rising and people have stable jobs with wages rising at least as fast as inflation. Conversely, it is crushing when housing prices fall and wage earnings are unstable.<br><br>On mortgages and autoloans Singaporeans probably carry amongst the heaviest burdens in the world. On student loans, the fact that there is such limited space in local universtities means many people have to borrow to send their kids abroad -- however, the fees paid here are not uncomparable to those paid by foreigners in their own private institutions -- so that is probably a wash with the other first world citizens. Generally country clubs cost more in Singapore than elsewhere due to scarcity and status values - -which appear to be more important socially in Sg. So another big crimp in the debt/equity ratio. Credit cards are probably the same or slightly lower than average third world.<br><br>What's it boil down to? The crippling debt arises from mortgages and auto loans. One is a need and the other is a luxuary good. The data is a bit skewed however as large first world countries average housing prices do not reflect the average housing prices of their major cities -- which is what you need to compare Sg to, for an apples to apples comparison.</div>
