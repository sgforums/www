              can see the difficulty of this I am sure. Please note that as per your
              request in your letter dated Nov 4th 2009, the March dates are suitable.</blockquote><blockquote><em>Charge No 5 </em><br><br>132. This charge is similar to the Judge
              Belinda Ang Saw Ean charge. “You, in your blog post Singapore Dissident
              dated Nov 30, 2008 entitled “<em><strong>Justice Judith Prakash. Another Kangaroo
              Judge", </strong></em>did make the following offending statement insulting the
              judiciary of Singapore namely the "Honorable" Justice Judith Prakash:
              "Judge Judith Prakash of the Supreme Court Singapore has<strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> prostituted</span></em></strong> herself in her capacity as a judge hearing the Kangaroo T Shirt case on
              Nov 24, 2008 by being nothing more than an employee of Lee Kuan Yew and
              his son, whom he appointed Prime Minister. By her actions in sending
              these young men to prison and making them pay crippling court costs of
              $5,000.00 each, she has shamelessly disgraced herself, her office as a
              judge, disgraced the Constitution of Singapore and Singapore ." <br><br>133. This blog post was written by me after my return to California . <br></blockquote>
