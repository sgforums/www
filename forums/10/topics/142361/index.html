            <div class='col-md body'>All the promises to make changes have so far proven to be eye-wash.<br><br>The so-called openness or inclusive society is a sham as many of people's feedbacks to FU have been totally ignored by the well-heeled elites. Tax-and-recover policy of the old continue to be practised by all ministries and departments which will recover all costs despite taxes paid and all the surpluses government has been making year after year both in budget and off-budget accounts. All the goverment is seen to be interested in is to work for its own convenience and purpose at the expense of the people.<br><br>There will be unending fee or fare increases and the prospect ahead is dim with increasing retrenchments, dropping wages and problems of all in making a living. The elites are mortals who were good in covering their every action and open to temptation to work for their own benefits.<br><br>People therefore have to stay collective. By being collective such as making of petition or refusing to cooperate they will then be listened to and changes will then happen. Do not just listen blindly to all the propaganda. Stay together and be collective especially through being active citizens through forums. This is how the new world works and the right way forward.<br><br></div>

Severall callers were heard angrily asking the question : 'WHERE IS MY MONEY". If PM wants to defend NKF record, then he will have to answer to the men in the street who will continue to ask him up to the commission of inquiry and next election again and again: "WHERE IS MY MONEY?"</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Atobe,<br><br>Very wise!! It is all a matter of transparency and accountablity. By acknowledging through this case the government is not infallible, the government can save itself more embarassments should there be more NKF abuses in other quarters like GLCs or MP-supported private businesses.<br><br>To demonstrate PM's commitment to building an inclusive society, there must be not more cover-ups or justifications. The officers who clearly were over-paid or seen to be too arrogant should be checked in the public interest.<br><br>One critical issue facing NKF new board would be: Whom did Durai consult with before he sued the two parties who alleged potential abuses like Durai's first-class travels..<br><br>Did Durai consult his members of the board or get the patron's or government blessing in doing so.<br><br>Will the new board still be fending Durai in these past two cases refusing to admit mistakes or cover-ups clearly seen in Davinder's rebuttals in SPH case.<br><br>Will the new NKF board comprise people of the same kind of mentality and persist in not willing to admit those old mistakes and errors revealed in court.<br><br>If government has been informed beforehand of earlier lawsuits and given blessing to Durai's earlier rash actions against the two whistle blowers, should Khaw Boon Wan do the morally upright thing by asking the new NKF board to own up, start a clean slate and make relevant amends or apologies to these two whistle blowers who had sacrificed for the public good.<br><br>The minimum is to publish an apology as clearly NKF by their resignation has admitted the first-class travels or the golden taps. The PM has promised a new NKF which will be transparent and start afresh. If indeed so, then it should come clean and start with a correct image in order to show its willingness to admit mistakes and be transparent in future.<br><br>I am sure Khaw Boon Wan wants the new NKF board to be clean and upright. If so then it should clear the air and come out in the open to admit it has been rash in supporting the earlier lawsuits against those two persons. The new NKF should know what is fit and proper if it wants to do the right thing from now onward as promised by PM and Khaw.<br><br>May be Gerald Eee will do so to win back trust and confidence to NKF again for NKF as well as for the government officers who had been informed and given blessing to those two earlier suits.
