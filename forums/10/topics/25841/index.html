            <div class='col-md body'>I think by banning cigarettes like the way of chewing gums will be very difficult. Chewing gum is not as addictive as nicotine. It will only work in a prefect world but unfortunately we live in the real world where it involves not only a certain class of people in our society, basically a walks of live from rich tycoon, politicians, lawyer, doctors to a simple man on the streets (sadly also alike, young kids) . To convince our government to take actions to promoted better anti-smoking campaign, we as citizen need to formulate a better solution.<br><br>On the contrary the government is also concern about the taxation gain of allowing such imports into the country. If only the government are willing to sacrifice such anti society gains.<br><br>Nevertheless, it was very concerning to see more frequent now for children as young as under 12 years old to be smoking in public like MRT stations. It might be a good suggest to create an anti smoking society by tarnishing the image built up the Marlboro man &amp; Hollywood.<br><br>Smokers always associate smoking as trendy, sophisticate &amp; macho. Our little young one will in turn like to be that imaginary image built by Hollywood by taking up smoking at a very young age. They wanted to be seen as Â“the manÂ” by holding a stick of cigarette.<br><br>The government should pass a law (if they are really serious about anti-smoking) to reduce &amp; restrict smoking area in the public. Apply concept like Â“little yellow boxÂ” (same in all army camps), as long as smoker that do not smoke inside the box, MOE officer can fine them for violating the law. Make the smoking less comfortable, make the area a crampy &amp; dirty place (as it is a dirty habit). Making smoker feel less than what it really is, nothing more than a drug addict.<br><br>Hopefully by doing so, it will help redefine the ideology our young children have for smoking.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I truly agree that only an outright ban on smoking could ever have an effect on the population of smokers in Singapore, whilst the raising of taxes and banning the sales of the small packs will only make an insignificant dent, though of course making an effort to achieve only a slight margin of success is better than sitting back and doing nothing at all.<br><br>Men who do not want their girlfriends/wives to smoke claim to be 'old-fashioned', but they have forgotten the fact that even in the ages long past have women been smoking. As such, I am unable to understand what all this hubbub about women smoking is about. Equality of sexes is in our minds but not in our hearts, it appears.<br><br>Alas, in a perfect world, the effects of smoking would only affect smokers themselves. But yet, fact is that not only do people around you suffer, but companian animals get higher risks of cancer and other diseases too.<br><br>And all this coming from a smoker.<br><br>P.S. You're three times more likely to get run over by a car than to succumb to lung cancer. In the long run, everyone's chance of survival drops to zero.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>its been calculated that the negative externality of smoking far outweighs its tax revenue... the gov't pays more out in healthcare taking care of people with lung cancer, spends more money cleaning up cigarette butts and more money promoting the ill-effects of smoking (now THIS i find dumb) than it gains in tobacco taxes.<br><br>but  its just dumb to give up eating for fear of choking. u think the foreign talents they're trying to attract are gonna be vegan, hypochondriac health freaks?<br><br>smoking is not just another dirty habit. its part of human civilization. its something people do even though they know its bad for them. like junk food, and t.v violence, gaming, prostitution and pornography... u don't like it, u know its bad, but as long as its kept manageable, its a necessary evil... so hell... live with it.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm a social smoker and all my smoking frens learnt smoking mostly b4 the age of 14. This is a pretty serious problem. From my analysis I think it can be stopped if those neighbourhood shops uncle and aunties stop selling cigarettes to kids. And, those lao ah bengs should stop buying cigarettes for kids, if they wan to die, it's their business. And parents who smoke shud lock up their cigarettes. With 100% no access to cigarettes, they can't smoke even if they wan to.<br><br>Perhaps the public shud play a more active role. I always see students smoking in their uniforms in public. But nothing much we can do la. By the time police come, they are gone. And if adults interfere they will juz be labelled as kaypo. Haizz... then HOW???<br><br>Haiyah i also dunno la. I think as long as u are not underage and u are not a heavy smoker. It's alright to smoke as long as u dun litter or spit, and be considerate to non-smokers near u.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
