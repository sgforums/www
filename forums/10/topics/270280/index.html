            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote> By "Metaphorical" You know class c ward subsidy is 80% or not? Meaning your bill if $100, you only pay $20! Kan ni nia you the one sick &amp; stay hospital but gov the one pay more for you! Still not good har? Talk cock!</blockquote>Is your hospital charge subsidy based on NKF or HDB type of creative accounting ?<br><br>Please tell us whether the hospital charges said to be subsidized include land costs which were to the best of people's knowledge either acquired cheap or already paid by the people using their own tax monies.<br><br>HDB so far has failed to reply to people's (ST Forum) challenge that its so-called public housing subsidy was just a discount off market price and not a true cost subsidy at all because the government has acquired the lands at dirt cheap prices using people's tax monies to do so and made a big bundle out of it in selling such lands to HDB at full market price and yet such land profits made are not taken into account in arriving at the so-called subsidy.<br><br>So please tell your minister Lui who asked you to come here to counter our cyber posting once and for all to ask minister Mah instead to come clean and stop deceiving people on housing subsidy which is not subsidy at all.<br><br>Similarly tell minister Khaw to be upfront with the patients and not engage in the same NKF accounting by disclosing like PSA has finally been forced to do by backing away from increasing port charges by reversing the creative land costs in the port pelepas showdown whether the so-called 80% hospital charge subsidy is true subsidy or is it arrived at only after adding up land costs which up to now has not been incurred by the hospital nor the government at all.<br><br>This type of profiteering on hospital charges ought to stop if government is interested in serving the people.</div>

No wonder, ask this type stupid thing &amp; question!<br><br>Ok basically this is how:<br><br>If gov now say: ok, stop hospital now &amp; sell hospital land.<br><br>You all know how many many many moneys gov can earn or not? Joe, sg land price not cheap ok! You got see sgh hospital how big or not? If sell sgh hospital land you know how many money gov can take or not?<br><br>Like my mp say before, if gov stop do hospital business, gov can earn 2 side money:<br><br>1. sell the land got money<br>2. stop hospital meaning no need waste money!<br><br>so since gov never stop hospital for you all, of course you all must compensate gov back abit lah! Fair what like this! If no compensate, then gov better sell whole hospital &amp; land give people build shopping center &amp; earn more money! Simple as that!<br><br>ok after you compensate gov land price, if you poor people, then gov can give you discount depend you class c, b or A. If class A meaning you rich, so little discount. If class c meaning you poor so give you 80% discount. Must take care poor people mah! Simple as that!</blockquote>Like you always like to say, it is as simple as that - government has never subsidized medical cares for senior citizens or the sick or public housing since Minister Mah Boh Tan changed the housing pricing formula from development costs to market values in the 1970s.<br><br>Because by making monies he could get a better career advancement but he forgets that he did not make monies for the whole country from outside but only from the people.<br><br>How good can a government be if that government only knows how to make monies from its people and not create bigger cakes for the economy like selling more Toyota cars to the world?<br><br>So my answer to your so-called 80% subsidy is as simple as that - there is no government subsidy.<br><br>If you insist that the government will lose monies by developing hospitals instead of some other commercial complexes or there is a government subsidy of 80%, answer the following questions first :<br><br>(1) What is a government - is it a developer like Far East or Li Ka Shing definitely must buy and sell lands to make profits?<br><br>(2) What are the taxes like GST collected for - is it to keep as surpluses or reserves?<br><br>(3) Why when it comes to port Pelepas or SIA, MM Lee has to change policies and really lower land costs in order to retain PSA's position so as not to be overtaken by mass migration of major shippers.<br><br>(4) Why did the parliament pass the Housing and Development Act and Land Acquisition Act - was it not to provide low cost housing to the people?<br><br>(5) Were the lands acquired at cheap prices under the LAA by HDB and all the government departments and hospitals not for the purpose of public use including essential medical services people pay taxes for ?<br><br>(6) Why did the HDB not tell the truths about the so-called housing subsidy?<br><br>(7) If government already made windfall land profits why not plough back part of such profits to lower the rising costs of living and increase our business competitiveness for the whole country instead of squeezing people's CPF or increasing more GST.<br><br>(<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> In presenting GST increases this year, why didn't PM tell the parliament how much windfall profits government has been making ( he should be aware NKF problem is exactly of the same nature) and is still making on the land acquisitions and HDB flat sales (at market prices forgetting to mention land profits already made when flats in the first place are supposed to be built in these acquired lands without profiteering)<br><br>If minister Lui or Mah insists to counter cyber postings or engagint people in robust debates as challenged then he should give people here substantive and factual replies to the above-stated 8 questions at least to clear the air. (remember they are the talents worth millions of salaries)<br><br>With such issues put away we can then begin the build the nation. If they can satisfy people with good answers then I am sure people will accept their talents and wisdom and will not trouble them with these issues about HDB or hospitals profiteering again.</div>
