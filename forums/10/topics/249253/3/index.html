Eisenhower. He wrote in his memoir The White House Years:<br><br>"In 1945 Secretary of War Stimson, visiting my headquarters in Germany, informed me that our government was preparing to drop an atomic bomb on Japan. I was one of those who felt that there were a number of cogent reasons to question the wisdom of such an act. During his recitation of the relevant facts, I had been conscious of a feeling of depression and so I voiced to him my grave misgivings, first on the basis of my belief that Japan was already defeated and that dropping the bomb was completely unnecessary, and secondly because I thought that our country should avoid shocking world opinion by the use of a weapon whose employment was, I thought, no longer mandatory as a measure to save American lives."<br><br>Inherently immoral<br><br>A number of notable individuals and organizations have criticized the bombings, many of them characterizing them as war crimes or crime against humanity. Two early critics of the bombings were Albert Einstein and Leo Szilard, who had together spurred the first bomb research in 1939 with a jointly written letter to President Roosevelt. Szilard, who had gone on to play a major role in the Manhattan Project, argued:<br><br>"Let me say only this much to the moral issue involved: Suppose Germany had developed two bombs before we had any bombs. And suppose Germany had dropped one bomb, say, on Rochester and the other on Buffalo, and then having run out of bombs she would have lost the war. Can anyone doubt that we would then have defined the dropping of atomic bombs on cities as a war crime, and that we would have sentenced the Germans who were guilty of this crime to death at Nuremberg and hanged them?"[60]<br>A number of scientists who worked on the bomb were against its use. Led by Dr. James Franck, seven scientists submitted a report to the Interim Committee (which advised the President) in May 1945, saying:<br><br>"If the United States were to be the first to release this new means of indiscriminate destruction upon mankind, she would sacrifice public support throughout the world, precipitate the race for armaments, and prejudice the possibility of reaching and international agreement on the future control of such weapons."[61]<br><br>========<br><br></div>

The Red Army was busy preparing to invade Hokkaido, though that will be a tall order, but the Red Army already invaded and seized the Kurile Isles and taken control of Manchuria by storm. The Red Army was the only army that could deploy a sizable landing force, and that perhaps was the main reason for the Japanese surrender.</div>

It is tramautic for those who can see the remains but those killed by it are unaware of their death and experience no pain.<br><br>Of course with vaporization there are even no remains to be seen, it was as if the person simply ceased to exist.<br><br>On the other hand, being under the attack of firebombs is probably a lot worse and plenty of the deaths were slow and agonizing, either smothered by the fire using up all oxygen or being burnt to death.<br><br>Of course the aftermath of a nuclear explosion also generates similar effects for the survivors- but I am simply pointing out the vaporization effect is not the most cruel effect of the weapon.</div>
