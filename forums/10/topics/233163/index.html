The priority then was to handle the flood situation,Â” he told reporters after launching the Maal Hijrah celebrations here yesterday.<br><br>Farmer Salali Arip, 68, is forced to do extra laundry as the floodwaters soiled his garments following the second wave in Kampung Parit Ismail, Johor. Â– AZHAR MAHFOF / The Star<br>Many flood victims in Kota Tinggi interviewed by The Star said they had not received the RM200 aid.<br><br>During the press conference, Abdul Ghani publicly chided one of his state exco members when told that students at religious schools had not received their monetary aid because the authorities were going to buy uniforms instead.<br><br>He questioned why State Religious, Education, Higher Education, Human Resource, Science and Technology and Innovation Committee chairman Zainal Abidin Osman had not followed his instruction to give RM100 to every student affected by floods.<br><br>Â“You were told to give money, not clothes. I made the decision. CanÂ’t you just follow it?Â” he asked.<br><br>When contacted later, Zainal Abidin said the students would receive their financial aid next week, starting with areas where the floods had receded.<br><br>Â“The students will only be eligible for one payment even if they have been affected by the floods both times,Â” he said.<br><br>Responding to Prime Minister Datuk Seri Abdullah Ahmad BadawiÂ’s statement that there were weaknesses in the state drainage system, Abdul Ghani said more dams might have to be built to cope with heavier rainfall.<br><br>Agriculture and Agro-Based Industries Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin said a special taskforce would gather detailed losses suffered by farmers, entrepreneurs and manufacturers in flood-affected states.<br><br>Â“We want everyone who has been hit by the floods and every agro-based venture, including commercial farmers and breeders, to be included in the census,Â” he said when visiting SK Penchu near Kundang Ulu in Muar district.<br><br></div>
