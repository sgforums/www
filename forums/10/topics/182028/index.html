            <div class='col-md body'>The present system of electing MPs into parliament does not work as the elected MPs have consistently failed to solve people's problems - see the 20 major problems affecting Singapore as posted on page 11 of "Definition of True Democracy" thread.<br><br>Ministers after Dr. Goh Keng Swee and Hon Sui Sen have failed to implement new economic strategies to upgrade our economy from one that is basic industrialisation to third-wave model that is based on technology applications by the masses.<br><br>Because of this, Singapore cannot depend on elected MPs to fuel our future growth. We now need newer and more creative solutions from wider base of talents other than through elections.<br><br>The country will be more competitive if we have more people like Sim Wong Hoo, Bill Gate, Warren Buffet and Li Ka Shing. We should have a policy to induct such people as members of policy-making economic council who need not be ministers. Such council can incorporate the service of effective people like Alan Greenspan, who can be given specific role and more politically neutral functions to help run the country with competitive ideas in various economic think tanks which could push our economic competitiveness more holistically and oversee implementations of larger policies that affect economic competitiveness and entrepreneurship which the elected MPs are short of.</div>
