              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SINGAPORE BEFORE PAP:</span></strong></p>
              <p>“But we either believe in democracy or we do not. If we do, then, we must say categorically, without qualification, that no restraint from any democratic processes, other than by the ordinary law of the land, should be allowed… If you believe in democracy, you must believe in it unconditionally. If you believe that men should be free, then, they should have the right of free association, of free speech, of free publication. Then, no law should permit those democratic processes to be set at nought.”<br><em>- Lee <span class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew as an opposition leader, April 27, 1955</em></p>
              <p>“If it is not totalitarian to arrest a man and detain him, when you cannot charge him with any offence against any written law – if that is not what we have always cried out against in Fascist states – then what is it?… If we are to survive as a free democracy, then we must be prepared, in principle, to concede to our enemies – even those who do not subscribe to our views – as much constitutional rights as you concede yourself.”<br><em>- Opposition leader Lee <span class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew, Legislative Assembly Debates, Sept 21, 1955 </em></p>
              <p>“If we say that we believe in democracy, if we say that the fabric of a democratic society is one which allows for the free play of idea…then, in the name of all the gods, give that free play a chance to work within the constitutional framework.”<em><br>- Opposition leader Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore Legislative Assembly, Oct 4, 1956</em></p>
              <p>“Repression, Sir is a habit that grows. I am told it is like making love-it is always easier the second time! The first time there may be pangs of conscience, a sense of guilt. But once embarked on this course with constant repetition you get more and more brazen in the attack. All you have to do is to dissolve organizations and societies and banish and detain the key political workers in these societies. Then miraculously everything is tranquil on the surface. Then an intimidated press and the government-controlled radio together can regularly sing your praises, and slowly and steadily the people are made to forget the evil things that have already been done, or if these things are referred to again they’re conveniently distorted and distorted with impunity, because there will be no opposition to contradict.”<br>-<em>Lee Kuan Yew as an opposition PAP member speaking to David Marshall, Singapore Legislative Assembly, Debates, 4 October, 1956</em></p>
              <p><em>“</em>…you attack only those whom your Special Branch can definitely say are communists.  Then you attack those whom your Special Branch says are aiding communists.  Then finally, when you have gone that far, you attack all who oppose you.”<br>-<em>Lee Kuan Yew as an opposition PAP member speaking to David Marshall, Singapore Legislative Assembly, Debates, 4 October, 1956</em></p>
              <p>“Repression can only go up to a point. When it becomes too acute, the instruments of repression, namely the army and the police, have been proved time and time again in history to have turned their guns on their masters.”<br><em>- Opposition leader Lee <span class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew, Straits Times, May 5, 1959</em></p>
              <p>“These powers will not be allowed to be used against political opponents within the system who compete for the right to work the system. That is fundamental and basic or the powers will have destroyed the purpose for which they were forged.”<br><em>- Lee Kuan Yew speaking in Parliament on the Preservation of Public Security Act, a precursor to the ISA, Oct 14, 1959</em></p>
              <p>“I pointed to an article with bold headlines reporting that the police had refused to allow the PAP to hold a rally at Empress Place, and then to the last paragraph where in small type it added the meeting would take place where we were now. I compared this with a prominent report about an SPA rally. This was flagrant bias.” <em><br>- Lee Kuan Yew commenting on the Straits Times, 1959.</em></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SINGAPORE AFTER PAP :</span></strong></p>
              <p>“We must encourage those who earn less than $200 per month and cannot afford to nurture and educate many children never to have more than two… We will regret the time lost if we do not now take the first tentative steps towards correcting a trend which can leave our society with a large number of the physically, <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected">intellectually</span> and culturally anaemic.”<br><em>- Lee <span class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew, 1967</em></p>
              <p>“I make no apologies that the PAP is the Government and the Government is the PAP.”<br><em>- Lee <span class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew, <span class="blsp-spelling-error">Petir</span>, 1982</em></p>
              <p>“One-man-one-vote is a most <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected">difficult</span> form of government.. Results can be erratic.”<br><em>- Lee <span class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew, Dec 19 1984</em></p>
              <p>“We have to lock up people, without trial, whether they are communists, whether they are language chauvinists, whether they are religious extremists. If you don’t do that, the country would be in ruins.”<br><em>- Lee Kuan Yew, 1986</em></p>
              <p>“I am often accused of interfering in the private lives of citizens. Yes, if I did not, had I not done that, we wouldn’t be here today. And I say without the slightest remorse, that we wouldn’t be here, we would not have made economic progress, if we had not intervened on very personal matters – who your neighbour is, how you live, the noise you make, how you spit, or what language you use. We decide what is right. Never mind what the people think.”<br><em>- Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, Straits Times, 20 April 1987</em></p>
              <p>“It is not the practice, nor will I allow subversives to get away by insisting that I’ve got to prove everything against them in a court of law <span>or [produce] evidence that will stand up to the strict rules of evidence of a court of law.”<br><em>- Lee Kuan Yew, 1988</em></span></p>
              <p>“I’m not intellectually convinced that one-man-one-vote is the best. We practise it because that’s what the British bequeathed us.”<br><em>- Lee <span class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew, 1994</em></p>
              <p>“Anybody who decides to take me on needs to put on knuckle-dusters. If you think you can hurt me more than I can hurt you, try. There is no way you can govern a Chinese society.”<br><em>- Lee <span class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew, The Man and His Ideas, 1997</em></p>
              <p>“They say people can think for themselves? Do you honestly believe that the chap who can’t pass primary six knows the consequence of his choice when he answers a question viscerally, on language, culture and religion? But we knew the consequences. We would starve, we would have race riots. We would disintegrate.”<br><em>- Lee <span class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew, The Man &amp; His Ideas, 1997</em></p>
              <p>“If we had considered them serious political figures, we would not have kept them politically alive for so long. We could have bankrupt them earlier.”<br><em>- Lee <span class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew on political opposition, Straits Times, Sept 14 2003</em></p>
              <p>“If I have to shoot 200,000 students to save China from another 100 years of disorder, so be it.” <em>- Lee <span class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew evoking the ghost of Deng Xiaoping whilst endorsing the <span class="blsp-spelling-error">Tiananmen</span> Square massacre, Straits Times, Aug 17, 2004</em></p>
              <p>“Without the elected president and if there is a freak result, within two or three years, the army would have to come in and stop it”<br><em>- Lee <span class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew on what would happen if a profligate opposition government touched Singapore’s vast monetary reserves, Straits Times, Sept 16 2006</em></p>
              <p>“Please do not assume that you can change governments. Young people don’t understand this”<br><em>- Lee Kuan Yew on the results of the 2006 election</em></p>
              <p><em></em></p>

                      bulletin board “news”. The story making the rounds this week
                      about a management shake-out in the newsroom of ‘Today’ is probably
                      exaggerated. The only thing that I know is definitely correct is that
                      Rahul Pathak has quit as Deputy Editor.</span> <span style="font-size: x-small;">
              <p>However, it reminded me of a slightly older story, dating from
                      November 2003, which, given the  passage of time and corroborating
                      accounts, is in my opinion, largely accurate.</p>
              <p>This one was about how the Senior Minister thrashed the news team of
                      ‘Today’ for a report they made of one of his speeches. </p>
              At this
                                point, I suggest you read the various boxed articles, to fill
                                in the details.
              <p>As you can see from Exhibit 1, Today wrote a story about
                                the Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew disparaging the UK health
                                system.</p>
              <p>But Exhibit 2, detailing the correction issued by the
                                Senior Minister’s Office, indicates clearly where the
                                offending point was - it had to do with the phone call made to
                                No. 10 Downing Street hoping for some intervention to move Mrs
                                Lee up the queue for a brain scan (I mentioned this in my
                                article <a href="http://www.yawningbread.org/arch_2004/yax-354.htm"> Adding Value</a>).</p>
              <p>Exhibits 3 and 4 must be read with caution, being internet
                                postings, although Exhibit 3 does explain its source.</p>

              <p>3 Nov 2003<br> 'Today' newspaper</p>
              <p>by Val Chua</p>
              <p>Emotions ran high on a balmy Sunday night as the
                                      normally stoic Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew nearly broke
                                      down while recounting the ordeal his wife went through
                                      in London recently.</p>
              <p>The troubles that the couple faced - including
                                      joining a queue in a free hospital - when Mrs Lee was
                                      hit by stroke two Sundays ago, revealed how differently
                                      two systems worked.</p>
              <p>"I cannot tell you how restless and unhappy we
                                      felt," he said at a community event in Jalan Bukit
                                      Merah yesterday.</p>
              <p>"We run a (healthcare) system where you have to
                                      co-pay ... but you get the attention. There, no
                                      attention, just join the queue," he said grimly.</p>
              <p>The first sign of trouble was that there was no
                                      private hospital with CT scan facility at night in
                                      London, he told residents and community leaders.</p>
              <p>So, Mrs Lee had to go to the NHS hospital nearest to
                                      the Four Seasons Hotel where they were staying - a free
                                      facility called the Royal London Hospital - and join the
                                      queue.</p>
              <p>"We waited 45 minutes for the ambulance for a
                                      10-minute drive," said Mr Lee in his first public
                                      appearance since the couple returned on Friday.</p>
              <p>"In Singapore, within half-an-hour, you would be
                                      in SGH (Singapore General Hospital), TTSH (Tan Tock Seng
                                      Hospital) ... and within one-and-a-half to two hours
                                      flat, you'd know what went wrong."</p>
              <p>When Mrs Lee reached The Royal London Hospital at
                                      12.30am, it happened to have three cardiac arrest
                                      patients.</p>
              <p>Mr Lee was told his wife's brain problem was
                                      "not as important" as the cardiac arrest
                                      cases, he recounted solemnly. She would have had to wait
                                      till 8am the next morning for her CT brain scan if 10
                                      Downing Street had not intervened to get her early
                                      attention. High Commissioner Michael Teo had sought help
                                      from 10 Downing Street at 2am on Sunday and she received
                                      treatment at 3.30am on the night itself.</p>
              <p>"Once upon a time, it was a wonderful hospital.
                                      But after 40 plus years ... the system cannot deliver.
                                      There's no connection between those in the system and
                                      the patients," he said.</p>
              <p>But it's the way free healthcare systems work, he
                                      added, noting that Singapore must not go down that path,
                                      even though there are calls for free C class wards in
                                      public hospitals here.</p>
              <p>"It's how the system works ... They did not
                                      discriminate against us," he noted of his London
                                      experience.</p>
              <p>This contrasted sharply with how quickly Singaporeans
                                      - including national carrier Singapore Airlines -
                                      reacted to the situation.</p>
              <p>Even though doctors initially advised that Mrs Lee
                                      stay put in London for three weeks, Mr Lee decided fly
                                      her back once her condition stabilised.</p>
              <p>And then there was the big worry that she would get a
                                      spasm onboard, he recounted.</p>
              <p>But he needn't have worried. Within 48 hours, SIA had
                                      fitted out SQ321 with medical support of oxygen tanks
                                      and other fixtures for a drip.</p>
              <p>"No other airline would have done this," Mr
                                      Lee said, looking visibly touched.</p>
              <p>On board were also two Intensive Care nurses from
                                      Changi General Hospital, two doctors, as well as
                                      officials from SIA who made sure all the equipment
                                      worked.</p>
              <p>"Everyone knows his job," said Mr Lee.
                                      "Within 12 to 13 hours, we'd reached Changi
                                      Airport. It was a big relief," he said.
                                      "Twelve to 13 hours. Your heart stops beating
                                      sometimes. We landed at Changi Airport. Great relief. I
                                      had my granddaughter (Li Xiuqi) with me. She is very
                                      fond of her grandmother. She was so relieved."</p>
              <p>Mrs Lee was whisked off in an ambulance to Singapore
                                      General Hospital, where she is recovering.</p>
              <p>"I think this experience has changed my
                                      granddaughter's view of Singapore," Mr Lee said.</p>
              <p>The overseas ordeal has made him even more assured
                                      that Singapore has what it takes to succeed, despite the
                                      downturn. "It's how we respond in an emergency that
                                      determines how we fight back. And I have enormous
                                      confidence that we can fight back."</p>
              <p>The Singapore system - with its efficiency and
                                      fighting spirit - must be kept, he said.</p>
              <p>"You slacken, you choose the easy way, and you'd
                                      be finished," he said.</p>
              <p>Choking back tears, he added: "I have immense
                                      confidence that in an emergency, our people respond ...
                                      If we can do that, we can succeed."</p>

                                      helped ensure his wife was given a brain scan four and a
                                      half hours earlier than doctors had initially said they

                                      after she suffered a stroke while the couple were
                                      travelling on official business.</span></p>

                                      asked them to help ensure Mrs Lee was given the CT scan
                                      more quickly.</span></p>
              <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">"Because of 10 Downing Street, the CT scan was
                                      done at 3:30 am. And then the blood clot could be seen
                                      clearly," Lee told the weekend community event,
                                      adding the incident highlighted the problems of
                                      Britain's free health care system.</span></p>
              <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>

                                      office issued a short statement clarifying his comments.</span></p>
              <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">"Mr Lee Kuan Yew regrets he was mistaken that 10

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">"Earlier, at 2:00 am, he was told that it would
                                      be done at 8:00 am because they had cardiac patients to
                                      attend to.</span></p>
              <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">"The hospital authorities may have decided on

                                      earlier and she was scanned at 3:00 am, completing it at
                                      3:30 am."</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The Royal London Hospital is part of Britain's huge
                                      state-run National Health Service, which guarantees free
                                      health care to all but suffers long waiting lists,
                                      excessive red tape and a shortage of doctors and nurses.</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Lee's weekend comments that were critical of
                                      Britain's health care system compared with Singapore's
                                      part user-pays method also caused controversy.</span></p>
              <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">"We run a system where you have to co-pay... but

                                      the queue," local media reported Lee as saying.</span></p>
              <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">He described The Royal London Hospital as a
                                      "wonderful hospital" a long time ago.</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Lee also praised Singapore Airlines for fitting out a

                                      oxygen and a drip to bring his wife back to Singapore,

              <p>Here's the lowdown on what happened at Today newspaper
                                    after it reported on the stroke that Mrs LKY suffered in
                                    London.<br> I checked with my client at Mediacorp, which is the

              <p>LKY's press secretary summoned Shaun

                                    session at the Istana. He chided the newspaper for running
                                    provocative stories that are out of bounds.</p>
              <p>Today was asked to explain what service it does to the
                                    nation and why it shouldn't be closed down. Mediacorp was
                                    ordered to supervise Today more closely or it will be

                                    Today to consolidate operations.</p>
              <p>Today has been told it has crossed the line and the
                                    media license will be withdrawn if it writes in such a way
                                    as to provoke bad feelings which may lead to public

              <p>SM Lee Vents Anger at Newspaper for Report About His
                                      Wife</p>
              <p>Singapore Libertarians is concerned about news that a
                                      Singapore newspaper was taken to task for reporting on
                                      the incidents that recently occurred in London over the
                                      treatment of Mrs Lee Kuan Yew when she suffered a stroke
                                      there.</p>
              <p>Singapore Libertarians was informed that last week SM
                                      Lee had summoned the top brass of a Singapore daily,
                                      Today, after the paper published a story that indicated
                                      his wife had received preferential treatment in a London
                                      hospital.</p>
              <p>Mr Lee met with senior staff members of Today Mr
                                      Ernest Wong, Group Chief Executive Officer of Mediacorp
                                      (which publishes the newspaper), Mr Mano Sabnani (Editor
                                      of Today), Mr Rahul Pathak (Deputy Editor of Today) and
                                      Ms Val Chua (a journalist with the newspaper).</p>
              <p>The meeting took place around noon on 5 November
                                      2003. It was learned that the above mentioned staff
                                      members of the newspaper were reprimanded for publishing
                                      the article "SM Lee and the eye opening trauma in
                                      London." They were also warned against writing any
                                      articles that were risqué.</p>
              <p>If it is true that the meeting between Mr Lee and the
                                      newspaper staff actually took place, the incident
                                      constitutes a grave breach of journalistic practices in
                                      Singapore where newspapers are expected to report the
                                      truth freely without undue interference from the
                                      government.</p>
              <p>Singapore Libertarians is concerned about the effect
                                      this meeting has on the media in Singapore. It is a
                                      clear indication that not only has the liberalisation of
                                      the mass media not happened in this, but also that Mr
                                      Lee Kuan Yew has no compunction about putting
                                      journalists on a very short leash when it comes to
                                      reporting on his family and the PAP.</p>
              <p>The government must rectify this unethical and
                                      unhealthy situation immediately. It has to clearly
                                      separate the interests of the ruling party and the
                                      demands of the Senior Minister from the those of an
                                      independent media. Singapore's media organisations must
                                      not be used by one man or one party for their own
                                      agenda. They should have the right to perform their
                                      duties without fear or favour.</p>
              <p>We also urge the management of Today to stand firm on
                                      its principles and serve the interests of the public.</p>
              <p>In Singapore, all local newspapers, radio and
                                      television stations are owned and controlled by the
                                      government or its agencies and foreign publications are
                                      subjected to defamation suits and various laws to ensure
                                      compliance with the ruling party's views and policies.</p>

              <p>Late January, I heard this
                                story again from two sources. One was a
                                friend whom I consider a very reliable source, who in turn had
                                heard it directly from one of the persons involved. The other
                                source more or less confirmed the general outline, on top of
                                which he added that the press who were at the Tanjong
                                Pagar event listening to the speech were told by officials
                                what <strong> not</strong> to report of it. Today, however, did not abide by the
                                instruction. I haven't had confirmation if the last part is true, but
                                most of the rest of the story appear to be corroborated.</p>
              <p>This whole episode makes a sorry
                                commentary on the way our media are expected to meekly abide
                                by whatever instructions are given, and the way our ruling
                                politicians feel they can bully their way through. If you look
                                carefully at exhibit 1, you'd hardly think it a scurrilous
                                piece of journalism begging for a reprimand.</p>
              </span>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">This brings to a crunch the
                                problems that Today has faced since the very day they
                                launched. These have to do with how it can be positioned and
                                succeed as a serious newspaper when the Straits Times so
                                dominates the landscape, and when the rules of the game are so
                                constrictive.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">* * * * *</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">Let's ask ourselves, how would
                                one establish a new newspaper against the Straits Times?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">The first problem to crack has
                                to be distribution, and giving it out free the way Today has
                                been doing is probably the only way to achieve that quickly.
                                It brought immediate returns in that getting circulation
                                rapidly brought in advertisers. But now they are trapped in a
                                vicious cycle: having been given away free, how does one
                                persuade subscribers to pay for it?</span> <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">What I might have done differently would be to
                      have two versions of it: a "lite" version given free, and a
                      full version that carried a price tag. The lite version would have
                      carried abridged stories, and perhaps an index of additional stuff
                      available in the full version. Lite would be good enough for a quick
                      read on the metro or over lunch, but it would also give the reader the
                      assurance that he would get stuff that interested him if he paid a bit
                      for the full version from the newsstand.</span></p>
              <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">After a while, readers might be confident enough
                      to sign up for home delivery of the full version.</span></p>
              <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">If distribution is a big problem for a newspaper
                      start-up in Singapore, the editorial challenge is head-crackingly huge.
                      As a resource-short David against a well established Goliath, it stands
                      to reason that Today has to choose certain niche areas in which to
                      differentiate itself.</span></p>
              <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The Straits Times has pretty good foreign
                      coverage, partly because it's an area (other than sports) with the least
                      governmental interference, stories about Malaysia excepted.</span></p>
              <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Its weakest area is local politics, and therefore
                      this is where a new brand can distinguish itself. Related to that is
                      also the fact that it's the one area where the market is hungriest for
                      interesting stuff. However, to satisfy the public's appetite, there has
                      to be critical writing and the courage to carry trenchant rebuttals by
                      the government's opponents, or by independent voices.</span></p>
              <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">This can tie in with sharper reporting of home
                      news. Singapore can do with a lot more investigative reporting about
                      official cover-ups, bureaucratic bungling, errors of judgement in our
                      government-linked companies and scandals both public and private.</span></p>
              <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The third area where Today can differentiate
                      itself is the type of third-party commentaries it carries. The Straits
                      Times' choice of commentaries is characterized by safe positions argued
                      by the same names seen over and over again.</span></p>
              <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Their local op-eds try very hard for
                      "balance" (which I put in quotation marks because what is
                      "balance" in the establishment's eyes looks awfully contrived
                      in others'). I have respect for some of their columnists as they try to
                      strain at the leash, but they will be the first to tell you, I am sure,
                      that strain is sometimes what they have to do.</span></p>
              <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The imported op-eds in the Straits Times often
                      give a depressing appearance of propaganda. I mean, has it not struck
                      you why they all seem to buttress the government's preferred way of
                      seeing the world? The message seems to be, "see, all these worthies
                      are saying the same things as your PAP government about the global
                      economy, the rise of China and the evils of Muslim extremism. How can
                      you not be convinced that the Singapore government is right?"</span></p>
              <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">But then, have you seen any articles in the
                      Straits Times lately about the evils of Christian extremism? Or the
                      perils of a headlong rush to globalisation?</span></p>
              <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">There is lots of room for more argumentative
                      commentaries staking out unconventional positions, particularly about
                      domestic affairs. There are plenty of local voices wanting to be heard
                      on issues close to Singaporeans' hearts. If Today sets out to develop a
                      working relationship with those among them who can write, the newspaper
                      can find this to be rich source of free content (unlike the costly
                      syndicated columns the Straits Times carries) giving a fresh,
                      alternative, and maybe younger tone to Today. This may lay the
                      groundwork for capturing the loyalty of the new generation.</span></p>
              <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">* * * * *</span></p>
              <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">All the above is not difficult to envision, and
                      I'm not in the least suggesting that Today didn't think of them. Who am
                      I, to quote that earthy Singaporean phrase, to teach a grandmother to
                      suck eggs?</span></p>
              <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">(Don't ask. I have no idea about the origin of
                      this phrase.)</span></p>
              <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">What I hope to achieve by sketching out this
                      "business development plan", as it were, is to show that from
                      a purely business point of view, there is a reasonable way for another
                      serious newspaper to emerge in Singapore. Those who have been suggesting
                      that Singapore is too small a market for 2 serious papers are making too
                      hasty a judgement.</span></p>
              <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">At the same time, what is also obvious from the
                      above sketch is how impossible the plan is. Can you imagine any of these
                      ideas being carried out under the present government policies?</span></p>
              <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">To close, let me put the problem succinctly: How
                      do we have two newspapers when we're only allowed one point of view? <img src="http://www.yawningbread.org/images/bar_red.gif" border="0" alt="" width="5" height="11"></span></p>

And his ability to adapt to changes and environment condition with a good foresight is something we young ones should learn from him. If from 1955 till now, he did not change his believes against a backdrop of ever changing world but remain stubbornly following what he did in 1955, mostly he will be in somewhere near Koh Samui planting corns and rearing chickens.</p>

              <p>MM answered with a smile "Well, I was not so lucky as you people now, there was a war that disrupted my life and I did not had clear vision as what you people now enjoy, you can plan your goals on what you want to do in 10 to 20 years time, and you can achieve it if  u work hard on it and that the <strong>govt is still the same</strong> to help you achieve it, unlike our time, we dunno where we are going, you need the guts and a 50% of luck to pull thru it. So, I dun enjoy what you young peoples are enjoying now, at times, we cannot even predict what tomorrow would bring. But one thing for sure, at that age, I already have the heart of Singapore in me, those wars and colonisation had given me the fighting spirit for my country and the people of Singapore, and i hope you young peoples dun mess it up, believe in yourself, believe in the govt and have faith with your country, and that is Singapore."</p>

              <p>I can't even remember my polymate name, but as for MM Lee dialogue, mostly likely i will remember for the rest of my life, we were special chosen to attend his dialogue ok.</p>
              <p>If your mind is not stable, all kind of words can jumble up in your brain, for that you can ask your brain. I have no further comment.</p>
              <p>Yes, Mr Chan is still our MP, recently met him at the new NTUC fairprice opening ceremony, look scholarly, but very Hokkien type. Like to joke alot, even teased my Viet gals.</p>
