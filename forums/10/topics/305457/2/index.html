              I've started reading it and I will need some time to absorb the huge amount of information in it. I am also adjusting to the fascinating perspective on world relations.
              
              From what I've read and absorbed so far, it proposes that the current political tool for dominance is through the ownership and distribution of energy, in this case being oil and gas.

              <p>China will definitely become No. 1 superpower, surpassing the US.</p>
              <p>at it's peak, it will not be surprising for it to surpass the US, Europe, Japan and SE-Asia combined together.</p>
              <p>China will be 1st, with India surpassing US and becoming a close 2nd.</p>
              <p>and as you guys may have read in the news today, the number of male babies in recent years vastly outnumber female babies, so their males, which will overthrow ang-mohs as the ruling race, will sow their seeds everywhere and will also affect SG.</p>
              <p>20 years down the road, we'll see agencies specializing in marriages that targets PRC men and mail-order-bride SG / other country girls.</p>
              <p>what to do? The Chinese dragon has started to rouse from its sleep and there's nothing the Russian polar bear, Japanese crane, American bald eagle, Singapore lion, Malaysian tiger, Australian kangaroo, Brazilian crocodile or even the Indian elephant can do.</p>

              <p>You might enjoy this too, it's about Britain's plot to instigate a German-Soviet war, which eventually backfired and led to WWII. We learned the bullsh*it version in school, here is the real version:</p>

              <p>Thats why there is the communist system to ensure it wont happen. Most people will learn from history. And China's 5000 year history has taught alot. They now know that they can be a superpower. Thier politics , and corruption will determine the outcome as well. People will want the good life , not a 3rd world life again. </p>
              <p>A revolt will most likely come in the form of the widening gap of the rich and the poor. So it will depend on how the government will deal with it. A rising population of the old. They dont have proper welfare for the old. We'll see how it goes. But i still think they will be a superpower to be reckoned with.</p>

              <p>Thank you Poh for referring me to the article.</p>
              <p>I have not researched the matter but from a superficial examination of the material, the writer appears biased merely because his views on the rationales of the various events that took place appear based on the premise that people kept making mistakes of garantuan proportions.</p>
              <p>While such is not beyond the realm of possibility, it seems to me to be a filmsy hypothesis and I cannot help but wonder if the information presented in his arguement had not been selectively adulterated.</p>
              <p>It was a still a fascinating read and reminded me of the board game "Risk". I know people who ended friendships over that game.</p>
              <p>I thought the earlier article you recommended was much more interesting.</p>

              <p>The plot to push Nazi Germany eastwards to finish off the USSR was hatched in 1936 by british conservatives who hated and despised bolshevism.</p>
              <p>They wanted to set the two against each other and unleash a bloodbath, so that the Nazis and the Bolsheviks can wiped out each other.</p>
              <p>All this is true and real. A pity that the truth is not taught in schools. Western propaganda also tries to ignore it for obvious reasons.</p>
