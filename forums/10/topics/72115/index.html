            <div class='col-md body'>it is extremely sad that the people in RJC can be so cocky...<br>try to understand, how many of us can get into top JCs in Singapore? and to sterotype that those who doesn't make it to Top Secondary Schools or Top Junior Colleges are useless is totally a very sad thing to hear from our potential-leaders...<br>It is true that they made it to top JCs with their good results, but they have to accept the fact that every individual is different, difference in family-background, difference in terms of wealthiness, and many other difference, even genetic differences...<br>if they think that they are so high up there, only being able to see people as high as them, they should probably reconsider...<br>the good people in gahmen are always choosing people amongst these elites, it is extremely worrying to see the attitudes of some of these snobs, many whom come from respectable families... where has all the up-bringing gone? or do they have no up-bringing at all?<br><br>i am also not trying to throw all those in top schools into the same category, i have known of many friends and relatives who make it to top schools, but they are very humble and always willing to share...<br>personally, i feel that all these boils down to the education system of Singapore... why do we need to have all these ranking things? does it now still serve the initial intention of the gahmen?<br><br>Lastly, i would like to say that not all people from neighbourhood schools are bengs and lians roaming around far east, neither do all top school people are elites are our future enterpreneur, political leader, or whateva... and if they still want us to show some respect to them, they should also give us the same respect...<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ultimately, a lot of this snobbery from the Raffles people is due to the Gah'ment's policies of promoting bureaucrats into positions of power primarily on the basis of their academic performance. It's so much like the Confucian civil service exams in imperial China, and we know what happened there...the whole system became so corrupt and ineffective...ergo, Mongol invasion, Manchu conquest, Opium War, etc etc etc<br><br>"He went to the right schools, he did well in school, therefore he must be the best man to run the country." What a colossal logical fallacy, to say nothing of the fact that it's an incredibly immature and infantile way of thinking.<br><br>Imperial China already made the mistake of putting academic over-achievers in charge of the country, and look at the terrible price it paid. And now our Gah'ment's repeating the very same mistake. Didn't they study history in school? Oh, I forgot...they were all probably science students. They're always so proud of their 'technocrat' credentials, after all...</div>
