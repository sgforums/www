              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Does the PAP impose partisan loyalties amongst civil servants in its quest to 'fix the opposition'?</span></strong><br> Although the website of the Public Service Division (PSD) PSD (Role)&gt; Nurturing Talent&gt; Progressive Policies [<a href="http://www.psd.gov.sg/PublicServiceRole/NurtureTalent/ProgressivePolicy/">link</a>][<a href="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-6CfWzbj3YZA/TWoetVo2M5I/AAAAAAAAASc/tvMwBiZXJJY/s1600/Role+of+the+PSD%252C+Nurturing+Talent-+Progressive+Policies.JPG">archive</a>]
               states "Remaining completely neutral in all political matters and 
              matters of public controversy" as part of the "principles of 
              incorruptibility, integrity and propriety" that the civil service abides
               by, it remains doubtful if the PAP government really respects this 
              rule/ distinction.<br> <br> In 03May2006, during parliamentary general elections, PM Lee warned 
              voters that if even 10 opposition members were elected into parliament, 
              then he would "spend all my time thinking what's the right way to fix 
              them, to buy my supporters votes, how can I solve this week's problem 
              and forget about next year's challenges?" (<em>'PM Lee says countries worldwide respect and admire Singapore's proven system' </em>[<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krtGW-xUSH4&amp;#t=1m10s">YouTube/@1m10s</a>]).<br> <br> That same election, the buying of supporters votes through preferential 
              selection for the lift upgrading programme (LUP)  in Hougang and P.Pasir
               was offered in lieu of voters in the two opposition held constituencies
               voting for PAP MPs rather then returning their incumbent opposition 
              MPs.</p>
              <div class="quote"><span class="byline">Quote:</span> <blockquote> "Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong has expressed concern that Hougang and 
              Potong Pasir residents will lose out on upgrading if they do not vote 
              for the People's Action Party" [<a href="http://disgruntledsporean.blogspot.com/2006/03/dangling-upgrading-carrot-sm-goh-aims.html">CNA, 26Mar2006</a>] and (<em>'Upgrading should be a separate issue from the General Election' [<a href="http://www.petitiononline.com/merlion1/petition.html">'petition online'</a>]</em>), </blockquote></div>
              <p>To their honour, neither opposition ward voters gave the PAP any 
              credit in response to the blatant bullying and pork barrel politicking 
              that the PAP had engaged.<br> <br> Later, in 2009, when the MND/ HDB decided that in any case, all 
              constituencies should eventually undergo the lift upgrading scheme as 
              part of the national HDB LUP (<em>'Lift Upgrading Programme to be completed as scheduled in 2014' [<a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/413602/1/.html">CNA, 06Mar2009</a>]</em>);
               MND Minister MBT, contrary to statutory specifications regarding the 
              proper conduct of the LUP,  decided to, through the PA's overtly 
              partisan and thus illegitimate 'grassroots adviser' scheme, announce to 
              the residents of the 2 opposition constituencies about their respective 
              constituency's inclusion in the LUP via the respective loosing PAP 
              candidates of the last general election; unsurprisingly, this 
              abnormality yielded a barrage of online complaints besides opening a 
              Pandora's box about PAP impropriety wrt compliance with statutory laws, (<em>'Town Council Act (CAP 329A) states clearly that Govt must work with Town Councils (run by MPs) to implement LUP'. [<a href="http://www.temasekreview.com/2009/10/29/town-council-act-cap-329a-states-clearly-that-govt-must-work-with-town-councils-run-by-mps-to-implement-lup/">TR, 29Oct2009</a>][<a href="http://forums.vr-zone.com/newsroom/501801-govts-lift-upgrading-argument-just-got-busted-temasek-review.html">alt link</a>]</em>).<br> <br> Critical to appreciating the LUP conspiracy is the existing PA 
              'grassroots advisers' scheme'; its essence is described in an ST report 
              as: "PAP MPs are appointed as advisers to the grassroots organisations 
              in their wards by the People’s Association (PA). <span style="color: red;">In 
              the two opposition wards, the PA picked the PAP candidates who contested
               but lost in the wards in the last two polls as the grassroots advisers</span>." (<em>'‘Adviser over MP’ raises many questions'</em>: [<a href="http://www.temasekreview.com/2009/10/22/adviser-over-mp-raises-many-questions/">ST, 22Oct2009</a>][<a href="http://tinyurl.com/4v4qcmt">alt link</a>])<br> <br> It is noted at both PA website [<a href="http://www.pa.gov.sg/about-us/organisation-chart.html">link</a>] and its govt directory record [<a href="http://app.sgdi.gov.sg/listing.asp?agency_subtype=dept&amp;agency_id=0000000035">link</a>][<a href="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-cgNkdvEz4E0/TWo3x1hAtSI/AAAAAAAAASg/DU6AcUXKdYA/s1600/People%2527s+Association%252C+Role%252C+Mission%252C+Board.JPG">archive</a>], that PM Lee is the chairman of PA, with Mr Mah BT the first board member on the list, ditto many other PAP ministers and MPs.<br> <br> The MND's last public response to multiple complaints about loosing PAP 
              electoral-candidates announcing the LUP in opposition wards adds 
              complicity, with MND admitting: "Opposition MPs cannot be appointed 
              advisers, because they do not answer to the ruling party." (<em>'Advisers and MPs have different roles'</em> [<a href="http://www.mnd.gov.sg/newsroom/forums/forums_27102009.htm">ST,27Oct2009</a>]);
               by so, the MND has very much confirmed the fact that in the PA, its 
              grassroots advisers must "answer to the ruling party"- isn't this 
              syndromic of systemic partisan cronyism if not nepotism that the PAP has
               imposed throughout the ranks of the civil service if not just the PA 
              and the MND?<br> <br> There is of course no mention of any partisan political loyalties in the PA's role and mission statement on 'gov.sg', [<a href="http://app.sgdi.gov.sg/listing.asp?agency_subtype=dept&amp;agency_id=0000000035">link</a>][<a href="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-cgNkdvEz4E0/TWo3x1hAtSI/AAAAAAAAASg/DU6AcUXKdYA/s1600/People%2527s+Association%252C+Role%252C+Mission%252C+Board.JPG">archive</a>] and rightly so, :</p>
              <div class="quote"><span class="byline">Quote:</span> <blockquote> "<em>The People's Association is a statutory board promoting racial  
              harmony and social cohesion, nurturing leadership, providing community  
              services and outward bound training and facilitating communications  
              between the Government and the people. The mission is to promote active 
               citizenship and multiracial harmony, connect the citizens for community

                lifestyle activities, and to bring people closer to one another and to
                the government.</em>" </blockquote></div>
              <p>This undue and overt partisan loyalty imposed by the PAP 
              government upon the PA and other statutory boards under its executive 
              governance is thus improper and prejudicial, not to mention 
              unconstitutional (see: "'Civil  servants under the constitution hold 
              their allegiance to the president..'", <em>'Integrity of election process a hot topic during youth forum'</em>:  [<a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/429874/1/.html">CNA, 17May2009</a>])  to the fair and transparent conduct of government affairs.<br> <br> Thus, if the PM (like he said [<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krtGW-xUSH4&amp;#t=1m10s">YouTube/@1m10s</a>])
               is unable to avoid imposing partisan loyalties upon statutory boards 
              such as the PA, then he ought to resign from his post as Chair of the PA
               or else revise the constitution of the PA so that the PA can be "like 
              most stat boards, whose chairmen are usually the permanent  secretary of
               the parent ministry or some other senior civil servant" (<em>'How PAP uses taxpayer-funded grassroots for political gain'</em> [<a href="http://geraldgiam.sg/2009/10/how-pap-uses-taxpayer-funded-grassroots-for-political-gain/">G Giam, 10Oct2009</a>]).<br> <br> In conclusion, Mr Lee's cold and calculated efforts at corrupting the 
              integrity and impartiality of statutory boards to act in his fancy as a 
              wedge between legitimate opposition MPs and their grassroots/ 
              supporters, at the expense of national funds is most reprehensible if 
              not already an incursion upon the constitutional sanctity of the civil 
              service. "Civil servants under the constitution hold their allegiance to
               the president."  (<em>'Integrity of election process a hot topic during youth forum' </em>[<a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/429874/1/.html">CNA, 17May2009</a>])<br> <br> In the words of PM Lee: "..we demand high standards of integrity and 
              performance from every public servant, MP and office-holder. We assess 
              them rigorously and objectively, and apply disciplinary rules fairly and
               impartially to all. This is what Singaporeans expect from their 
              Government. And this is what we have delivered and will continually 
              strive to achieve".(<em>'Ministerial Statement by PM Lee HL in Parliament on 21Apr2008'</em> [<a href="http://www.asiaone.com/specials/nextphase/images/PMStatement.pdf">link</a>])<br> <br> But really, in the midst of this admission of culpability, what 
              assurance is there that PM Lee's systemic civil service incursions and 
              impositions, besides enhancing PAP political hegemony, will really do 
              Singapore much if any possible good?<br> <br> -------<br> <br> References/ resources:<br> - <strong>'(PSD) Maintaining High Standard of Conduct'</strong>: <em>"The Civil

              <p>No, of course, they will be some who voted for opposition.</p>
              <p>But my friends are mostly in Armed Services or police, they will have problem finding jobs that is has the same pay as their previous jobs, most have families and they will simply not risk it.outside.</p>
              <p>The serial number on voting ticket is to certified that the individual have voted but who controlled the information? The election department is under PM. Even if he is to abuse the data, will any of use know or have the power to do anything?</p>
              <p>People will vote for opposition despite that but they are some who really worry for their rice bowl. If they lose their rice bowl, who is going to take responsible for it?</p>

              <p>Choosing politicians is like choosing who is going to poison your food. The chef or the server.</p>
              <p>Breaking PAP stranglehold is like telling me I should always go for the other type of poison administered no matter if it is more lethal, more devastating than the previous. Even without listening to the description of the poison that is eventually served just because the previous poison had killed many.</p>
              <p>I advise all to vote who best represents your interest.</p>

                  <p>Utimately you are saying that all are poison and which kind suits you?</p>
                  <p>Why not have more faith in the opposition, PAP ministers are not exactly that good also, some more they are selfish and unwilling to take responsible for their own mistakes.</p>
                  <p>After this election, if PAP wins again, there's no holding back the amount of damage that they can wreck also. Many citizens have left and locals are just a minority now, how long more time, do we can afford to have?</p>
                  <p>It is true that when opposition comes on board, things will get a lot more tough, business might be forced to shed off cheap workers, possible alongside locals, gov-linked businesses will be tore to many small ones to enable them to be more competitive. Some cushy jobs will be lost.</p>
                  <p>It is a question of being a nation, a question of finding back our souls, a question of sovereignty, a question of being citizens with rights to govern this nation, not subcontract this to traitor PAP to destroy this country.</p>
