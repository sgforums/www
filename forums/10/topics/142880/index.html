Also, in line with the concerns by the government that Singaporeans in general may not have sufficient retirement funds, this policy runs contrary to these concerns. </strong></blockquote>ALL Singaporeans should be allowed to buy a NEW HDB FLAT that is said by the Government to be heavily subsidised, and will you confirm that you will also include  those earning $600,000 a month ?<br><br>If the individuals or families decide to be "CASH-RICH", and do not buy any home (Private or HDB), where will they stay ?<br><br>What good is "CASH-RICH" when your "CASH-RICH" holding is slowly depleted with the passing of each month - especially when the "OUTFLOW" is greater then the "INFLOW".<br><br>What good will "ASSET-RICH" be, when there is little CASH to live on as one gets older, and "CASH INFLOW" can no longer be proportional to the amount of "CASH-OUTFLOW" ?<br><br>Will letting the individual Singaporean decide - which way to hold their "personal reserves" - help to solve the problem of looking after themselves in their "Twilight Years" ?<br><blockquote>:<strong><br>The socialistic concerns of the early years are no longer valid today as 90% of the population already live in HDB flats. Excluding higher income families simply does not augur well for the cohesiveness and sense of belonging to this country. </strong></blockquote>Contrary to your statement that with 90% of the population already living in HDB flats, the "socialistic concerns of the early years are no longer valid today".<br><br>How many of the 90% Singapore Population living in HDB flats are actual owners of the flats - meaning those that have fully paid up for their flats - without including those whose title deeds are held by Banks, or Finance Companies, or by HDB Finance themselves ?<br><br>Those living in 1-room and 3-room flats, and some in 4-room flats will still need the continued "socialistic concern" of early years; as after last round of pay reductions and retrenchment in 2003 and 2004, many are known to be having difficulties meeting their monthly payments for Mortgage instalments, Utility Bills, Health Expenses, and children's welfare and education.<br><br>By including the wealthy into HDB's building program, will it not also provide resentment from those in the lower income bracket towards the Wealthy, who will buy the HDB flats but will hardly move out from their Private Homes; and may indulge in reselling the HDB flats for a profit.<br><blockquote>:<strong><br>High income earners and private property owners who sell off their houses due to changes in circumstances and needs should be given the choice to make rational decisions on where to deploy their funds. Many of these people have realised that ploughing their money into bricks and motars lacks sanity and that they should save for the rainy day and for their own retirements.<br><br>Singles, most of whom really do not wish to be so if not for their own circumstances, should also be allowed a buy a NEW 2-ROOM OR 3-ROOM HDB FLAT. They may be single not by choice but because of adverse physical attributes or certain handicaps, health, or other uncontrollable circumstances. We should not pressurise and penalise them unecessarily and exclude them from the benefits of being a useful citizen of this country.<br></strong></blockquote>There has never been any restriction on the spending habits of the High Income Earners or Private Property Owners. The only restriction is to prevent their "CASH-RICH" reserves from competing with those who can only afford to live in HDB flats.<br><br>There has been some changes to benefit the Singles that enable them to purchase HDB flats from the Resale Market, resulting in this group of people having to pay a higher price.<br><br>We could perhaps lower the age barrier to allow this group of Singles to purchase new HDB flats; so as NOT to inconvenience this group of Singles, who simply cannot find the opportunity to get married.<br><br><blockquote>:<strong><br>The PM mentioned that he will adopt an INCLUSIVE POLICY. It is time for him to put words into action. </strong></blockquote>"INCLUSIVE POLICY" - if we are all already Singaporeans, has there been any group of Singaporeans that is left out, and hence requiring PM LHL to coin a chic term - "INCLUSIVE POLICY" ?<br><br></div>
