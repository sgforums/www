            <div class='col-md body'>Singapore will be an exact copy of Hong Kong in the near future. Housing will be so much smaller in size. Property prices will be so expensive that it will be out of reach for an average citizen.<br><br>Hong Kong depended on a huge influx of foreign expats as well. Which also caused the extremely high living costs. And by foreign expats I mean ang mohs who get extravagant paychecks just to work there.<br><br>Now Hong Kong is already trying to cut down on such foreign expatriates. And where do you think their next stop is? A country where costs are lower, cleaner air, high pay, cheaper housing, etc. And the gahmen welcomes and encourages such an influx.<br><br>To get a working visa there is not as easy as before. I have actually heard an immigration officer in the immigration office in kowloon asking an employer who is trying to get a working visa for his employee from the states, what is it about the job that he cannot hire a local instead of hiring a foreigner.<br><br>I was quite taken back by that question as foreigners are usually welcomed with open arms in Hong Kong just like Singapore.<br><br>But from what some of my colleagues there are saying, there is actually an on-going trend to hire locals instead of turning to foreigner expats.

Forget public transport - citizens live here and we consume like eveyone else in larger countries, ie suburban lifestyle. 2 cars  in 4 car garages -waiting for kids to get driver licenses, drive everywhere, except the current government is obstructionist ....<br><br>It's a chicken and egg, catch-22 situation. Not enough people so does not justify building roads, no roads mean no one wants to go there. This ain't the American west being opened up. Government should just built or have private operators build toll roads (spell ERP), if too expensive less traffic then cannot recover costs - transfer risk to private sector. Then they bankrupt, we get free road.<br><br>Marina South is reclaimed land, so if build tall high-rise office buildings - question of stability of land right?

You didn't get my point. Yes we have space to have more people. Yes we can build more buildings. But do Singaporeans want that actually? There is already more or less no countryside in this country. Probably you have never seen countryside as most Singaporeans also would not have seen.<br><br>At least in HK you can drive for an hour or two and reach nice hills and nature. Can you do that in Singapore? No way..

Moreover so many concrete underground which are able to trap heat.<br>It is very hot to walk along <strong>Shenton Way</strong> in the afternoon with such a cramp space, vast number of people and huge concrete structure.

Housing will be so much smaller in size. Property prices will be so expensive that it will be out of reach for an average citizen.<br><br>Hong Kong depended on a huge influx of foreign expats as well. Which also caused the extremely high living costs. And by foreign expats I mean ang mohs who get extravagant paychecks just to work there.<br><br>Now Hong Kong is already trying to cut down on such foreign expatriates. And where do you think their next stop is? A country where costs are lower, cleaner air, high pay, cheaper housing, etc. And the gahmen welcomes and encourages such an influx.<br><br>To get a working visa there is not as easy as before. I have actually heard an immigration officer in the immigration office in kowloon asking an employer who is trying to get a working visa for his employee from the states, what is it about the job that he cannot hire a local instead of hiring a foreigner.<br><br>I was quite taken back by that question as foreigners are usually welcomed with open arms in Hong Kong just like Singapore.<br><br>But from what some of my colleagues there are saying, there is actually an on-going trend to hire locals instead of turning to foreigner expats. So will Singapore go through the economic saturation Hong Kong went through before it realises something must be done to curb costs and over reliance on them?<br></div></blockquote>Our PAP leaders wont learn from other ppl's mistake,that is the most deadly weak points of them.Another thing is even when they make mistakes n being pointed out,they also pretend deaf as if nothing has happen due to their arrogant attitude.Well,that is the character of all the stupid dictators in history.That is why they leave a bad name during their reign n even after their death.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>And i think Jurong Industrial park is a failure.I personally have work in one of the companies located there before.And i can tell you all,it is a living hell.I work for around 9 hours down there,but i have to take MRT n buses to reach my work place,and that consume me 1 and a half hours.Then after work,i have to take another 1 and a half hours transport to reach my home.You can imagine how tiring it is when i reach home.<br><br>When the government built this Jurong industrial park,they never anticipate that although there are plenty of land there for renting to foreign n local companies,but it will be hard for local Singaporeans living in the central areas to go all the way there n work.Becoz the travel distance from central areas to the Industrial park is too far,it is not realistic to travel so far to work down there.<br><br>So Jurong Industrial park is only beneficial to foreign workers who can rent a house near there n thus,have high mobility.Whereas we Singaporeans are mostly staying with their families n we cant afford to rent a house near there just to work down there.It is not realistic.So it is another proof of the stupidity of our government.</div>
