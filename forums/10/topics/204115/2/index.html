You drive everywhere you go - air-con comfort, cheap and super fast, able to balance going to work quickly and returning home quickly without succumbing to the tropical heat.<br><br>2. I live like 10 min by car from somewhere in Bedok South to Tampines central. When I had to take public transport - it becomes a 35 min nightmare, 10 mins walk in the hot sun and humidity, sweating crazily, feel uncomfortable, before reaching bus stop, then wait 10-15 mins for bus, then bus goes to Tampines, start-stop, jerkily, feel nauseous, then reach interchange, walk to 5-10 mins to office, if luckly then no sun or rain. So this contrasts with people who are "rich" enough to have cars in Singapore - what sort of bull**** is this?<br><br>3. Go to shopping mall, why keep walking into people, why wait for elevator cars after elevator cars and cannot get on with shopping cart and baby stroller? Because too many people.<br><br>4. Why when in mall, how come shopping carts so small, one not enough, cannot hold all the things you buy, also, no double children or triple children support shopping carts? hy wait in aisles like traffic jams???<br><br>5. How come go  to neighbourhood shop to pick up something for 50cents need to pay parking $2 per entry??<br><br>.....  alll this and more.<br><br>I lived in an American suburb, all the same amenities, things much cheaper, more space in mall, overall just much more comfortable - SINGAPORE CANNOT COMPETE.<br><br>If you advocate more population expansion - it just sucks for all of us.<br><br>Unless more investment and creative solutions are entered into the equation for increasing living space per person.<br><br>ie, rules and regulations for shop and mall sizes, toilets need to accomodate for greater crowds so that it doesnt stink just from the crowds and the cleaning crew cant keep up.<br><br>We are not just a city ----- we are a COUNTRY and Singaporeans got no choice to escape anywhere ----&gt; we make our lives the way we want it to be.<br><br>So by all means increase the population but make sure that we have truly world class living conditions .....</div>

Point is we are still a COUNTRY, and you need to work in a fashion that some of the trappings of living in a larger country are available, else it will be hard to retain people (as the current situation).<br><br>That aside, a large population in a finite space will impact on quality of life issues.<br><br>Of course US has freeway jams .... but you can choose to live in another city.

We are in a country, and do not have other cities. America has many cities. China has many cities too. Their citizens have choices to choose a high/low population density to stay in. As for us, we have Tampines, Jurong,Yishun.....They are not cities. Everywhere is filled with people. No space. Squeeze like Sardines, like Roti Plata. You can see many people squeezing in Raffles Place. Bumping on each other. You need to control your steering wheel well or else you would bump into people, like termite<br>Mr Lionnoisy you know. we are poor people with no personal transport. Please understand us.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Aug 29, 2006<br>Review current policies on babies before bringing in more foreigners<br><br>Much as I agree with the our Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong's National Day Rally speech, in which he called for the liberalisation of our immigration policy to make up for the shortfalls in our population growth, I feel we have not thoroughly exhausted our internal solutions.<br><strong>If by 2065, according to the population experts, the native born Singaporeans make up only 1.5 million out of 6.5 million people</strong>, the government needs to redouble its efforts to examine every nook and corner to find ways to increase the proportion of the local born instead of relying so hugely on foreign imports.<br><br>Such a policy is akin to our current efforts to strengthen and grow our own SMEs and not rely so heavily on MNCs.<br><br>I feel that the following areas need to be looked at further:<br><br>In the decade from 1990 to 2000, there were 169,727 legal abortions in Singapore. This represented 32.1% of total live births of 528,153 during the same period.<br><br>Given such a high attrition rate, should we not review our current overly liberal policy of sanctioning legal abortions?<br><br>In times past when abortions and contraceptives were not easily available, unwanted babies were given to orphanages and brought up to become useful citizens. Is it possible for the state to assume this function? Should not more be done to encourage unwed teenage mothers to keep the babies? Provide counselling to them instead of taking the short cut of abortion and a resumption of the same dysfunctional lifestyle followed by more abortions.<br><br>If 10% of the abortions is carried out for women under 20, and if we manage to save 5% through counselling and material incentives, there will be a net addition of about 1,000 live births in Singapore each year. We should make every potential Singaporean count.<br><br>During a recent birthday dinner with my wife's single friends, some of them questioned why the Social Development Unit excludes singles who are over 35 years from its activities.<br><br>Even though some of them are in their forties, every effort should be taken by SDU to cast its net wider to help them. It was not easy to get the SDU accepted during the initial years and since it now enjoys widespread popularity, it should open its doors wider.<br><br>Patrick Low Soh Chye<br><br>aiyo...native born singaporeans will be left with only 1.5 million in 2065<br><br></div>
