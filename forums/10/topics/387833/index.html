              <h1>Grace Fu: Hard to “predict” short term demand for housing</h1>
              <div class="date">
              <div class="dateleft">
              <p><span class="time">January 11, 2010</span></p>
              <p>Senior Minister of State for National Development Grace Fu told Parliament today that there are adequate housing, facilities and infrastructure to meet the demands of a growing population.</p>
              <p>However, there are cases where short-term demand is not met because it is very hard to “predict” such demand, such as for housing.</p>
              <p><em>“This is because there is always a lead time involved,”</em> she said without elaborating more on it.</p>
              <p>The National Development Ministry led by Mr Mah Bow Tan had come under intense criticisms from the public of late due to the shortage of public housing for Singaporeans which is exacerbated by a growing population contributed largely by the relentless influx of foreigners.</p>
              <p>The floodgates appear to open a few years ago when Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong announced an ambitious plan to increase Singapore’s population to 6.5 million people via immigration.</p>
              <p>A quick check on the HDB Infoweb reveals that the number of HDB flats built between the years 2005 – 2008 are fewer than the preceding four years.</p>
              <p>In the face of rising demand and limited supply of flats, the prices of HDB flats sky-rocketed in Singapore, reaching a record peak high in June last year.</p>
              <p>Mr Mah admitted lately that he was “caught off guard” by the spike in prices and reassured Singaporeans that HDB flats will remain “affordable” to the majority of the population.</p>
              <p>Despite repeated reassurances from HDB and government ministers, there is a prevailing sentiment on the ground that ordinary Singaporeans are being priced out of reach in the public housing market.</p>
              <p>Even for those who can afford to pay for these over-priced flats, they will probably have to deplete their CPFs in order to do so.</p>
              <p>The situation is worsened by PRs who “spoil” the market by paying higher than market prices for resale flats. For example, one Indonesian PR forked out $653,000 for a four-room resale flat in Queenstown when he could well afford a private apartment.</p>
              <p>As prices of new flats are pegged to the recent transaction of resale flats in the vicinity, this contributes indirectly to the high prices fetched by two BTO projects launched in Queenstown lately with an average price of more than $500,000 for four-room flats and $600,000 for five room flats.</p>
              <p>According to Mohamad Ismail, the CEO of real estate agency Propnex, as high as 20 per cent of the buyers of resale flats are PRs. Another agency C&amp;H Realty quoted a figure as high as 50 per cent, yet Mr Mah claimed that PRs form only a “small proportion” of the buyers of resale flats.</p>
              <p>Some PRs eventually sell their flats for a generous profit after they leave Singapore for their homeland where they can retire comfortably for the rest of their lives while locals continue to pay the high price for the ruling party’s pro foreigner policy.</p>
              <p>Being the highest paid ministers in the world, it is unforgivable for Mr Mah and Ms Fu not to foresee the rise in HDB prices with more foreigners coming into Singapore.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, the Singapore cabinet is blessed with a “forecaster extraordinarie” who does nothing much other than to “do forecasting.”</p>
              <p>Perhaps he should spend more time “mentoring” the junior ministers to ensure they don’t make such a disastrous mistake again instead of flying around the world to lecture others on how to run their countries.</p>

              <p>PAP is complacent.... They need some competition .....</p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">If you are paid a Million dollar salary and cannot forecast based on this <a href="http://tankinlian.blogspot.com/2010/01/hdb-flats-and-population-growth.html">data,</a> either you are sleeping on your job, or severely incompetent. Singaporeans should decide if PAP needs some competition to be responsive to our needs, or they prefer to listen to lame excuses such as " I was caught off-guard" or "it happens only 1 in 50 years." No competition means that they are only responsive when the elections are near.<br></span></p>

              <p> </p>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Recently, there has been a great deal of interest in
                                      the run up in property prices. The following are some statistics from
                                      the Yearbook of Statistics 2009 which can help explain why.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <p><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_XtsjYwdj2Ic/S01NtKJJCGI/AAAAAAAABB8/MJylO5Nffgs/s400/HDB_pric.JPG" alt="" width="533" height="195"></p>
              <div> </div>
              <div>From 2003 to 2008, the total population increased by 17.6% The resident population increased by 8.2%.</div>
              <div>The number of HDB flats however only increased by 1.2%.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>It
                                      is unclear why HDB has been building so few HDB flats from 2003 to
                                      2008. The numbers very clearly suggest that the HDB building program
                                      has been unable to keep pace with the increase in population. The
                                      current boom in housing prices is therefore not fueled by "irrational
                                      speculation" or HDB pricing polices. Rather it is due to a very real
                                      supply shortage in housing to meet the demands of our growing
                                      population. </div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>The danger in these type of
                                      situations is that the large price increases will bring about a very
                                      sharp market correction. In response to criticism, the HDB has recently
                                      announced that they will step up building.</div>
              <div>Large number of private developers have also launched new projects to "cash in" on the record prices.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>On
                                      the demand side, MOM has also recently implemented policies so that it
                                      is more difficult for foreigners to come and work in Singapore.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>The
                                      market will therefore almost certainly overshoot and we can be assured
                                      of a very dramatic fall in housing prices, most probably in 3Q2010 to
                                      4Q2010.</div>

              <p>Yeah  i agree, but Singapore is still run like "Father know best" and "Father is always right," although they bother to pretend to "listen" to our feedbacks.</p>
              <p>I still remember the LTA tried to implement the Taxi Stand rule in the CBD without consulting Singaporeans. Then i saw some many helpless tourist flagging for taxis but no taxi is stopping for them as the tourists do not know about the new rule. I cant help but laugh at how these elites can implement transport policy without consultation. I wont be surprised if these policy makers have never taken a taxi before...<br><br>Earlier, we tried to feedback on the overcrowding of MRT, then we forced to read propaganda about crowded Tokyo and Shanghai MRTs and how lucky Singaporeans are. But now the train frequency is a lot better. Its amazing what elections can do ...Suddenly they become so responsive to our needs when a while ago they were calling us whiners and complainers that does not know how to appreciate the "great country".</p>

              <p><br>I've said there's no way for ppl like us to call a taxi as we wish especially it's a bus lane on the left hand side of the road.</p>
              <p>It can create accidents and bus service delays.</p>
              <p>Singaporean love to complain. ppl anyohow pick up taxi passenger along bus lane, illegally park at bus lane also SBS's fault right?</p>
              <p>It's not PAP's fault, blame it on Singaporean's being spoiled w/ propesrity and dunno how to treasure why things are done in that manner</p>
