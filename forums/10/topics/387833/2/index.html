              <p>Well said.   I shall the same sentiment.</p>
              <p>Generally, Singaporeans find living in the fence set by them are acceptable and they feel comfortable with it.    Many of these people's perception are so short sighted.  They compare Singapore with countries having wars and protests against government and draw conclusion that we should not demand and ask for more since Singapore is free from these.   </p>

              <p>Bear bear,</p>
              <p>Laws is created and pass down by people, and people are born naturally to make mistake, so, there are flaws and hopes in laws and policies, it is not like they ask you to eat shit, you got eat shit, it is up to you to go about exploring those flaws and mistakes they make so that you can avoid eating shit and end up eating cakes.</p>
              <p>Just like those MIW, they need to wear all white in National Day and PAP delegate's meeting, but that doesn't mean that they cannot wear red color underwear ya.</p>
              <p>The problem with Singaporeans is that they are nurtured to be guided, lack of independency and fear of losing face and dignity. And they still can said they are very educated and well disciplined. Taking that weakness, the govt exploited them. </p>

              <p>What that call for HDB now? BTO?? Why is it so difficult to release more land to build more BTO? why control the supply when there is confirmed demand? I believe the government this is an excuse for raising HDB price in the future. Otherwise, it is a government plot to sell more land to the private developer and squeeze more money out of  you and me.</p>
              <p>With only less than 20% land in Singapore Island that probably can be inhabited, why we can't build more bridges to say Johore and Batam so that those riches and foreigners can buy land and house there to live and than return to Singapore for work?</p>
              <p>Surely we dont have so much land to cater for the 6.5 millions foreigners.</p>
