We must remain vigilant against external influences which may seek to split and divide our society."<br><br>He added, "The government will continue to review our satellite TV policy and to ensure that our regulations keep pace with technological developments and trends in the entertainment industry." - CNA</div></blockquote>does it matter to them whether we think it is valid or not?<br><br>it has always been i say u listen and do policy here...<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
