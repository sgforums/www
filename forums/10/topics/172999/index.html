            <div class='col-md body'>A mini-version of the culture in Singapore???<br><br>ST Jan 7, 2006<br>S. KOREAN graduate students just can't say 'no'[/b][/size]<br>Culture of following professors' orders blindly being questioned in wake of stem-cell scandal.<br><br>IN THIS hard-driving, Confucian-influenced society, seniority rules.<br><br>Challenging bosses is uncommon and failing to bow to superiors invites reproach.<br><br>A culture of following orders is most evident in academia, a field that has been roiled by the fraud scandal surrounding the once esteemed stem-cell scientist Hwang Woo Suk.<br><br>Blindly obeying lordly professors is seen as the surest way to success. Graduate students compete for coveted tenured faculty positions known here as an Â”iron rice bowlÂ” Â– a Chinese term meaning as a guaranteed lifetime job.<br><br>But some are now questioning the system, including a few in academias &amp; a newspaper that editorialized against the university culture.<br><br>Mr Kim Sun Jong, a former researcher at Prof HwangÂ’s lab, has told South Korean media that the professor ordered him to fabricate data for a paper on the designer stem cells published in the journal Science in May last year.<br><br>The problem, said the Segye Times newspaper in its editorial, is Â“an outdated, pre-modern lab culture of obeying seniorsÂ’ orders. While it was Prof Hwang who should have ensured truth &amp; conscience, it is lamentable the researchers couldnÂ’t restrain such misconduct &amp; instead blindly followed the ordersÂ”.<br><br>Some experts say Prof HwangÂ’s underlings at the Seoul National University had no real choice.<br><br>Â“Prof HwangÂ’s researchers followed the only logic of survival available to themÂ…even if it meant faking the research results,Â” said Korean studies Professor Vladimir Tikhonov at the University of Oslo.<br><br>MBC television network reported on Tuesday that one of the two researchers at Prof HwangÂ’s Seoul lab, who donated eggs for research, was pressured to do so for fear he would not list her as a co-author for a paper.<br><br>Influential professors at prestigious schools Â“are allowed to build their own private kingdoms, promoting &amp; demoting their underlings largely at willÂ”, said Prof Tikhonov, a naturalized Korean of Russian origin.<br><br>Listing professors as senior authors on papers even if they contributed little, fabricating receipts to cover up their personal use of research funds, &amp; running errands for them are just some of the headaches grad school students say they face.<br><br>Â“ItÂ’s hard to refuse requests for fear of retaliation,Â” said a doctoral degree candidate, who once went to his professorÂ’s house on a weekend to fix a computer.<br><br>But professors argue that such is misconduct is uncommon.<br><br>Â“I think itÂ’s just a small number of professors who make such absurd requests,Â” said Professor Cho Dong Jun, who teaches international relations at the University of Seoul.<br><br>Â“IÂ’ve never seen such a case.Â”<br></div>
