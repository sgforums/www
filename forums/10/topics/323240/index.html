              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Gopalan Nair, a former Singaporean who currently faces two charges for insulting two High Court judges, has been arrested for disorderly behaviour in public and for using abusive words against police officers. <br><br>Responding to media queries, a police spokesman confirmed that Nair was arrested on Friday night following an incident at the junction of Race Course Road and Bukit Timah Road. <br><br>The spokesman said plainclothes officers on routine anti-crime operations in the area heard a loud knock on their vehicle after stopping at the traffic light. <br><br>They saw an Indian man walking away. When the officers identified themselves and interviewed the person, he became abusive and refused to furnish his particulars, saying he is an American citizen and the Police has no right to check on him. <br><br>Despite repeated warnings to stop his verbal abuse, including a racist slur against one of the Malay officers, he continued to be uncooperative and persisted in his abuse. <br><br>The commotion attracted a crowd of over 25 onlookers, which created a risk of public disorder due to the inflammatory remarks used by the Indian man. <br><br>The police officers, after giving the man repeated warnings to calm down and not to cause a public disturbance, had no choice but to arrest him for disorderly behaviour and for using abusive words towards public servants. <br><br>The man resisted arrest by putting up a fierce struggle, during which his and a police officer's glasses were broken. <br><br>It was only back at the police station that Nair disclosed his identity. <br><br>A medical examination by a doctor was conducted and a blood sample was taken with Nair's consent to be tested for alcohol. <br><br>Nair, who is out on police bail, could face a fine of up to $5,000 or a jail term of up to a year if convicted under the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order &amp; Nuisance) Act. <br><br>Nair is currently facing two charges under the Penal Code. These charges relate to an email sent by him to Justice Lai Siu Chiu in 2006, and a posting on his blog relating to Justice Belinda Ang in May 2008. Both Justice Lai and Justice Ang are High Court Judges. - CNA/ir</span></p>
