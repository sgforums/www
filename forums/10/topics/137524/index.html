            <div class='col-md body'>Why do Sporeans send their children to Oz for study? The cost of study there is not cheap and ugly behaviour is common; see article from littlespeck.com.<br><br>The same question can be asked for holidays down under; it is not cheap and to me, it's a pretty boring place.<br><br>I guess the only thing positive between Oz and Spore is trade and defence ties.<br><blockquote>Foreign students<br>report racism<br>Foreign student arrivals drop by nearly two-thirds, here's why. The Age.<br>Jun 16, 2005<br><br>INTERNATIONAL students studying at Australian universities are suffering from "alarming levels" of discrimination, isolation and financial pressure, according to research.<br><br>A Monash University study has found that half the international students interviewed had suffered from discrimination or bad treatment; 57 per cent of female students reported discrimination.<br><br>One in 10 said they felt unsafe in Australia. Racism was most likely to occur at work or when students were seeking somewhere to live, the research found.<br><br>"I wear my headscarf back in Brunei," one Muslim student said in her interview. But in Australia, "everybody was staring at me. I wore that headscarf for three days, and then I started telling myself that it's not safe. I decided not to wear it."<br><br>The study, whose full results are revealed by The Age, was conducted by the Monash Institute for the Study of Global Movements.<br><br>It interviewed more than 200 students from 34 countries. Principal researcher Simon Marginson said the finding of students feeling unsafe was striking, and showed Australia had "a way to go" in providing a welcoming atmosphere for international students.<br><br>Professor Marginson said safety and security were key factors in student choice about where to study. And with a slowing international student market, he cautioned that the findings should be "ringing alarm<br>bells".<br><br>Almost two-thirds of students reported feeling isolation and loneliness, with females and those in regional cities more likely to suffer.<br><br>More than two-thirds work or have worked here, with 35 per cent<br>reporting financial difficulties.<br><br>RMIT vice-chancellor Margaret Gardner said similar surveys by RMIT found a sense of belonging and support were key issues for international students.<br><br>Professor Gardner said universities had made many improvements in helping international students in their transition to studying in Australia and realise more needs to be done.<br><br>The findings coincide with a new report to the Federal Government urging an overhaul of the regulations covering international students.<br><br>The report expresses concerns about students' pastoral care. It identifies home stays, financial hardship, mental illness, unlawful activities and visa breaches as areas of concern.<br><br>Student care "is emerging as an area of considerable risk to not only the wellbeing of students . . . but also to Australia's reputation as a destination for overseas students", it says.<br><br>Growth in the international market has continued to slide. The number of international students starting study in Australia is down by almost two-thirds so far this year on last year.<br><br>Too high fees<br><br>Monash University vice-chancellor Richard Larkins said Australia was "in danger of losing the race" for international students as universities in neighbouring South-East and Northern Asian became more competitive.<br><br>He warned that overreliance on revenue from overseas students could cause fee rises that would deter students from studying in Australia.<br><br>"We're probably getting very much in danger of pricing ourselves out<br>of the market," he said.<br>The Age<br></blockquote></div>

Such things as such as religion and culture practices will be observed very closely by angmohs- for the better or worse.<br><br>Sometimes you need to stand up, sometimes you just need a good firm talk with people who may view you in an unfavourable manner.

            <div class='col-md body'>Some years ago, when I was pursuing a postgrad degree at a major midwestern university in the US, some American friends and I were having dinner at a restaurant frequented by students from the university.<br><br>A few tables from us was a sizable group of Malaysian students who were chatting rather loudy in Hokkien (or some other Chinese dialect--I can't recall).<br><br>This seemed to irritate a small group of American students who were seated at an adjacent table, as one of them turned to face the Malaysians and remarked curtly, "This is the US. We speak English here." The Malaysians looked profoundly embarrassed and, after a moment of silence, resumed their conversations at a more reasonable volume in English.<br><br>Could this incident be construed as an instance of racism? I don't think so. In my opinion, foreign students are guests of the host county and should make reasonable efforts to observe and respect the prevailing social and cultural norms. I wouldn't be surprised if many of the instances of "racism" reported in the Monash University study were the result of foreign students not being able to (or not wanting to) adapt to local customs.<br><br>You all know the old adage: <span style="font-style: italic;">When in Rome...  </span><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>MG<br><br></div>

We speak English here." The Malaysians looked profoundly embarrassed and, after a moment of silence, resumed their conversations at a more reasonable volume in English.<br><br>Could this incident be construed as an instance of racism? I don't think so. In my opinion, foreign students are guests of the host county and should make reasonable efforts to observe and respect the prevailing social and cultural norms. I wouldn't be surprised if many of the instances of "racism" reported in the Monash University study were the result of foreign students not being able to (or not wanting to) adapt to local customs.<br><br>You all know the old adage: <span style="font-style: italic;">When in Rome...  </span><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>MG<br><br></div></blockquote>Many a time, i feel like telling those PRC nationals to do the same, especially when they are talking really loudly in some unknown dialect.<br><br>However, I believe the Malaysians could have stood up and told the Americans off if they wanted, citing free speech etc.I believe the latter was more pissed off with the loud volume than the language used, but they conveniently used the language as an excuse to get them to shut up.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>id have thought its the language.<br><br>ie, it just pisses me off (hopefully someone will agree with me or i'll look stupid), that some idiot is speaking some dialect (i cant even manage mandarin very well) or african for the pure reason that i dont understand it.<br><br>if anyone was speaking something i understood loudly, it really wouldnt bother me at all.  unless i was trying to sleep.<br><br>ive found the australians to be very welcoming and really friendly imo, if you open up and make an effort to actually muck about with them and adapt  (as opposed to huddling only and exclusively with other asians/whatever), they treat you fine.<br><br>if you dont, you cop shit.  then the complaining comes.  which really is quite stupid.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>That's true. When I was in US last yr for some summer job, I realised that if we(I went with a group of S'poreans) hang out with the Americans during work and after work and do things together, they weren't so suspicious.<br><br>In fact, once we opened up, they were curious about Asia and all of the other matters. They kept on asking us how was Asia, how was the Asian people like, did they do things in their own way or did Asia now resemble the US in terms of habits etc.<br><br>Of course, we Asians did have our own 'meetings' once a while and inevitably we used chinese, hokkien and teochew during those sessions. And well the angmohs became even more curious. They couldn't understand a thing and I'd believe some became suspicious that we were badmouthing them behind their backs.<br><br>But I still remember the good times I had with those guys and gas last year. Especially the late night gatherings every Sunday and Wednesday night where we roast mushmellows and talked till 12am. What a time it was.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
