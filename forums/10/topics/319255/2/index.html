              <p>u dun tok so much and flame ppl la.. in the 1st place.. hu organise the thing one.. singapore officials can do anything or not 1st..</p>
              <p>the guys din wear their life jackets and nobody force them to dun wear the life jackets, and nobody can force them to wear the life jackets too can? the incident took place AFTER the race.. </p>
              <p>how is anyone even supposed to do anything AFTER the race? they are in the boat, with nobody ard them, who's to say anything? can anyone even do anything to them?</p>
              <p>the problem is there wasn't even guidelines there.. the law can force u to wear seatbelts, the police can catch u for not wearing seatbelts.. but if u know the risks and still take it, the police is to blame? much less in this case.. there wasn't even anything..</p>
              <p>last but not least.. if anyone is to blame, are u pointing fingers at the cambodian organisers? what good can a singapore safety committee in pointing fingers at them?</p>
              <p>and excuse me, did i from the start say shit happens? u find out in any of my post above can?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and i cannot even comprehend what the fuck ur last paragraph means and where ur delusions abt me not giving a shit abt them.. so take all ur shit abt greed and happiness and fuck off..</p>
              <p>it is sad enuf that they died.. and u want a committee to come out and say someone is to blame for what? issit even consoling?</p>
              <p>and if ur fucking memory can even fucking recall, there was an incident of a lamppost breaking and killing a boy in tampines some time back.</p>
              <p>that guy was my friend.</p>
              <p>so fuck you.</p>

              <p><br>After the race is still in the race environment. So what if the race ended?</p>
              <p>A race ended and someone aye-nerlysed a puppy. does that mean that puppy not aye-naerlysed? what has it got to do with the race being ended?</p>
              <p>Its called human life. Its called safety.</p>
              <p>What have these got to do with a race having ended?</p>
              <p>Are you a joker?</p>
              <p>You could not even reply me .</p>
              <p>You show your low EQ by blowing up. By using words like those, I wonder who taught you that. Only you will know. ssshhh. no need tell me. I know. you keep it to yourself.</p>
              <p>Look at what an ugly porean you showing the world you are. </p>
              <p>sad. i pitty you. </p>

              <p><br>Then why not you erase the words RESPONSIBILITY and ACCOUNTABILITY from Webster, Oxford dictionary and the entire world? </p>
              <p>No need to try. Just figure of speech. U know you are never gonna be capable of doing that.  In a well you may get away with what you want. Being protected by a thug. But elsewhere, you will not achieve the same. For sure. U also know this very well.</p>
