            <div class='col-md body'>If u think the biggest problems right after SG independence were<br>communists,communalists, unemployment,lack of housing,u are wrong.<br><br><blockquote>......What was the biggest problem he faced when he and his People's Action Party began to piece Singapore back together in the 1960s? Surprisingly, Lee (Kuan Yew)said it wasn't the economy, national security nor public schools, but rather the omnipresent, oppressive, lawless, marauding drug gangs who roamed the streets, terrorised the citizenry and kept the decent people of Singapore indoors at night.<br><br>The British had largely ignored the gangsters during their reign. As a result of this debilitating carte blanche, the problem mushroomed into a living nightmare. Roaming gangs controlled the streets not only by night but also during the day, and the threat of being an innocent but dead bystander in a drug gang gun battle or drive-by was real. It was impossible to build a peaceful society with that kind of arrant misconduct, insisted Lee.<br><br>I (Tom Plate)asked him what he did to combat the gangs.<br><br>'We had the army arrest them and put them in jail.'<br><br>'So, how did the trials go?' I said, reasonably.<br><br>'We didn't have trials,' the senior statesman replied directly.<br><br>'What?!' I tried to seem unruffled but I think I failed. My Americanness was shining through too obviously.<br><br>'You see, Tom, we inherited the British system of justice which requires the first-person testimony of one gang member to convict another one. But the gangs would kill off anybody who talked, so what developed was a revolving door system in which an arrest would be made and there'd be a trial which hinged on the testimony of a witness who then would be killed by agents of the indicted gangsters, and out the door would go the criminals, back onto the streets.'<br><br>'Why couldn't the police protect the witnesses?'<br><br>'They weren't strong enough.'<br><br>'So what did you do?'<br><br>'We let the army round them up and put the gang members in jail,' Lee said.<br><br>'So, where are they today?'<br><br>'By and large, they are still in jail.'<br><br>'But that's preposterous!'<br><br>He looked me in the eye clearly and evenly, and said directly, without a trace of apology: 'Mr Plate, haven't you noticed? The streets of Singapore are safe.'<br><br>He had me there. Years later, my spunky wife Andrea put this to me: I want to go away for a week, by myself, without obnoxious you or pain-in-the-neck child around me. I need a week all to myself. What, in your view, is the most interesting and safe place for a woman alone? Easy, I answered, Singapore. She went and mainly loved it. She went several times again, and again mainly loved the place, though she has been developing the very strong view that the former prime minister ought to lighten up a little and let his people enjoy themselves more. Then the place might be near-perfect. ....</blockquote>-<strong><a href="http://luminosita.livejournal.com/275384.html" rel="nofollow">--http://luminosita.livejournal.com/275384.html<br></a></strong>by<br><strong><a href="http://www.asiamedia.ucla.edu/author.asp?Author_ID=57" rel="nofollow">Tom Plate is a UCLA professor, columnist and regular contributor to </a></strong><blockquote>The South China Morning Post, Mainichi Shimbun, The China Times, The Korea Times, The Khaleej Times, The Seattle Times, The San Diego Business Journal, and The Straits Times.
