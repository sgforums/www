I'll be surprised if they don't try the same thing if we ever had to face the situation of a drug trafficker from Country I arrested on our soil. While I agree that the Bush administration is tougher on them now, they can still pretty much run free and kick up lots of dirt if need be.<br><br>And unfortunately, I'm not sure whether the MIW will have the confidence to stand firm this time. We did after all bend backwards slightly in the case Michael Fay. We cut his sentence from six strokes to four strokes.<br><br>Sure, it doesn't add up to a full acquittal, and all it means is that Fay has fewer scars on his a**. However, it does show that the powers-that-be in our administration can and does bend over at times. I believe we have more interests in Country I and the US than in Australia.... which, I fear, may leave an impact on how we dispense justice in this country.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by fudgester:</div><div class="quote_body">Well, we all saw what stunts the US media pulled on us in the case of Michael Fay. I'll be surprised if they don't try the same thing if we ever had to face the situation of a drug trafficker from Country I arrested on our soil. While I agree that the Bush administration is tougher on them now, they can still pretty much run free and kick up lots of dirt if need be.<br><br>And unfortunately, I'm not sure whether the MIW will have the confidence to stand firm this time. We did after all bend backwards slightly in the case Michael Fay. We cut his sentence from six strokes to four strokes.<br><br>Sure, it doesn't add up to a full acquittal, and all it means is that Fay has fewer scars on his a**. However, it does show that the powers-that-be in our administration can and does bend over at times. I believe we have more interests in Country I and the US than in Australia.... which, I fear, may leave an impact on how we dispense justice in this country.</div></blockquote>Fay was caned under a Democrat controlled Congress and White House.That's one factor that is slightly different.<br><br>Perhaps the reality today is that no nation ever has full control of herself.That's international politics for you.And nations look long-term, and never for short-term gains.<br><br>That's why the powers that be should never have treated the citizens differently and make such a huge gulf from domestic law and international legal engagement.<br><br>It's not an issue simple enough for all of us to argue, for we lack the knowledge required.</div>
