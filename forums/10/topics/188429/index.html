            <div class='col-md body'>Well i found out about this from another forum,and i find it disturbing.Work so hard in this land we call home and when deemed too old to be useful to the nation and it is expensive to maintain old folks to retire here,such old folks will be asked to retire via cheaper options that result in them not to be even on home terrorities so that the govt will not have a heavy burden to support them? What kinda rubbish policy is this to counter rising health care cost?<br><br>Source:<a href="http://asia.news.yahoo.com/060417/5/singapore203544.html" rel="nofollow">http://asia.news.yahoo.com/060417/5/singapore203544.html</a><br><br>Government shortlists potential sites to build retirement village<br><br>SINGAPORE : The government has shortlisted a few potential sites for the construction of a retirement village, and the National Development Ministry is currently studying the details.<br>The sites are on a 30-year land lease.<br><br>And one of them will be picked to test market demand for such villages.<br><br>In an exclusive interview with MediaCorp's Channel 8, Health Minister Khaw Boon Wan said in the past, the idea of building retirement villages was put on the back burner as Singapore's problem of an ageing population was not as serious as that in Europe and America.<br><br>The Singapore market was also too small for retirement villages to be commercially viable.<br><br>But the prospects have since changed.<br><br>With a rapidly ageing Singapore population, Mr Khaw said in five years' time, retirement villages will become economically viable.<br><br>One obstacle is the high costs of land in Singapore.<br><br>"My personal view is, our land is expensive. But we have nearby neighbours in Johore, Batam and Bintan. The elderly want to reach their doctors within half to one hour. So retirement villages in neighbouring countries is possible, barring the cross-border hassle. It is best to find cheap land on short leases," said Health Minister Khaw Boon Wan.<br><br>- CNA /ls<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>During my younger days, I've seen many elderly tourists from US, UK, Aust., Japan, Taiwan, etc touring and enjoying their golden age. They gave me a vision that while we work hard during our younger days, we retire in grace and enjoy our fruits of labour.<br><br>In this realistic sg, I came to graps that it's not true. What await us is, we have to work like hell to pay up our home loan, our medical expenses and we cannot affort to retire unless we die. We cannot even fall ill.<br><br>The jobs that are left for us to earn and pay our loan are cleaners, newspaper vendors, food court worker or worst still, pick drink cans, cardboards and newspaper. Now even thinking of having a "death" village abroad.... How ungrateful the gov.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br></div>

Ask ourself, how many children really lived and take care their parents? I am. You?<br><br>When one get old, healthy is ok. However, when they are less mobile..problem will arise. I had involved in taking  care of my late mum many year back who was bed ridden for 2 years..It wasn't that simple..money, time and stress.<br><br>I only hope that the program is to use the retiree CPF only as the children may have their own unsolved problem. Else maybe have to think of some kind of insurance again..<br><br>Regardless of poor or rich, as long as they are singaporean, I think they deserved to be taken care of. Don't you?<br><br>Don't accuse when there is no solid proof. I think he is clear, personally. No offence.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> Happy labour day.<br></div></blockquote>When I get a job, I'll definitely support my parents, that's for sure. Cause I have no other burdens to worry about. No gf, wife or anything.<br><br>Yes, what you said may be logically and economically correct, but what happened to old Confucius values of filial piety and all that? You're saying if a children has problems, then they can "cut away" the responsibility of supporting the parents, just like cutting down CPF costs?<br><br>True, they do deserve to be take care of. The children shall be the one taking care, not the govt. Again, this is another instance of the govt being the people's nanny and deciding things for the citizens, even though they keep saying that people shall be independent-thinking which I am propagating.<br><br>In my point of view, this is yet another incident of an issue that is economically, logically and technically correct, but yet it is devoid of morals and ethics. Being the technocrats that they are, all they can ever think of are measures that are measured by the value of the dollar. Whether it's a win-win situation as one might call it. Though I hate to say it, I do have to admit they're really doing a pretty good job despite the difficulties but it just ain't right to me.<br><br>As for the accusations, well, we're just hypothesizing the reasons behind. Although we will never know the reasons behind everything being "done" for the citizens. There's a great deal of business done at the back that we do not know of.<br><br>Happy holiday to you too.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

I understand your meaning..confucius teaching is definitely right..I wouldn't doubted about it.<br><br>However, it's up to individual to carry it out. What happened if the childrens are really poor too? I don't think you as a kind father would wanted your children to suffer because of you too? It's a blessing these days to have good children around.<br><br>If the children is rich, of course, you make them pay when you retired. (Chinese saying "Young Er Fung Lao" may be outdated thinking for old people as you can see what is happening in China after 1 kid program..<br><br>Modern couples are to work to support 9 peoples besides themselves.<br>2 grandparents, 2 parents and 1 own children. Hence will our kids have this issue when their time is up.<br><br>Believe confucius teaching for the good of mankind. Practise it make life more perfect.
