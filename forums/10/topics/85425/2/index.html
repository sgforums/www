            <div class='col-md body'>If you read Gregorsamsa's post carefully. he mean to say that we need to think about those who already bought a hdb flat when the price is very high. For these people, if the hdb flat price drops now, they will be in a situation where they can't sell their house even if they want to (E.g. Flat sell for $200,000 but owe bank $300,000).<br><br>Of course, we can say they dumb enough to buy flat at that price. But what done is done. We need to take them into consideration too. Cannot be so heartless one.<br><br>I say let the price drop slowly now. Maybe HDB should start increasing their "subsidises" over time so that it eventually matches the building cost rather than the open market valuation. As it is, this using of market valuation when deciding HDB price is ridiculous. But to do that, direct HDB purchase should cut down to one time only. After that, no privilege interest rate or direct purchase from HDB anymore. Afterall, each one of us needs only one shelter, not two.</div>

There is another book The Millionaire Next Door which I find very useful also. The basic ideas in the book are similar to Rich Dad Poor Dad. MUST READ. Available at popular bookstores.<br><br>Rich Dad is based on Roberts personnal experience. Millionaire next door based on research done on ordinary Americans. Has a lot of examples also.<br></div>

If cannot agree on role, then surely cannot agree on what it should/should not do. So, got to give definition of HDB role first. Can discuss in other thread you created if you want.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>some how i believe what im going to say will make some sense.<br><br>20-30 yrs ago, we were poor, so when they decided to take away the land you were squatting on, you hated the Govt. Some of them reconciled, and subscribed to the Public housing program.<br><br>So somehow, we became very very rich in one generation. And like what people of rich nations do, we dabble in the property market, causing property prices to inflate.<br><br>fast forward it now, our incomes are dropping. But we know one thing for sure, we need flats. people who get married need flats. So no matter what, property prices rerspond much slower to the loss of income.<br><br>ye sthe economy is recovering, but please let us observe the US recovery, itys going to be a jobless recovery like it or not. This is because, i believe, firms have more or less obtained the optimal size. to quote my brother or The Economist, we are victims of our own productivity.<br><br>So right now we have property prices that do not reflect the current times? can you tell me why? furthermore, property prices have actually risen of late.<br><br>lastly, i think everyone just wanna know why HDB price is so expensive when it is suppose to be public housing. i think the answer should be, because they can. Also if they can make money off you, why not?Some say, like the CPF, it is meant to trap you into working till yourr death like the indenture system. and if prices are so low, there are too many various outcomes that might occu which the scholars might not be able to handle.<br><br>hope to hear from you guys/r</div>
