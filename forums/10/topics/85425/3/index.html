            <div class='col-md body'>Somewhere along the lline, our system of government got changed.<br><br>Government's principal dutes and responsibilities include (a) creating jobs, (b) housing, (c) education, (d) security and (e) medical needs etc as contained in parties' manifestos and election campaigning speeches.<br><br>Due to limitations caused by our own unique one-party system, we must have forgotten these prestine duties and responsibilities to the people. Over time, our economy is now run so as to be be efficient, be rich, build reserves etc resulting in high costs.<br><br>There is no careful examination of how government charges for lands or services. The argument that land costs is chargeable has to be re-examined in this light. Lands were acquired by government cheaply or at little costs under Land Acquisition Act. It does not need to amortize lands like the private landlords. Charge the highest rates for commercial usage by all means. But where the people or tax payers are concerned lands have been paid for using tax payers' monies. Charging land rentals for hospitals, utilities and other essential services needs re-thinking to avoid a double-charge somewhere.<br><br>If Singapore is to become competitive again, the first thing to do now is to debate openly on such major policy decisions. Right or wrong, such policies must be agreed upon before anything else will work.<br><br>If government wants to be competitive and efficient, it is necessary to resolve all such issues with people before levying near-market (called subsidised) prices for housing and essential services. More ideas of others are necessary to make for change.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

The HDB is on 99 years leasehold. The flat will not be yours after 99 years. So, don't bet on inheriting a HDB flat, chances are you will be chased out of the flat before you die.</div>

Or to price it nearer to the building cost? To a layman, subsidy means they are selling below cost which is not the case.<br><br>(2) What to do now (and in future) given they already have people buying at the previous unfair prices? Contninue the same process of letting the price soar and fall illogically (while making their disgusting profit and claimed to have subsidized the flat)?<br><br>I like to point out that the property market is not a complete free market due to inability of increasing or decreasing supply flexibly. The pre-text of free market is that both supply and demand can be changed easily. Also, you should not allow a basic necessity to be subjected to market forces, especially when this market force is not one of logical conclusion but of illogical emotions. Can you accept the food or transport prices going up and down all the time?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>airship911 of discuss_singapore@yahoo.group raised some important points which HDB never addressed:-<br><br>1. When HDB flats price is not set based on cost but on a household<br>income afforability based scheme described as:<br><br>"HDB flats are priced below their respective market values, to<br>enable 90% of Singaporeans to afford at least a 3-room flat and 70%<br>of Singaporeans to afford at least a 4-room flat. Those with higher<br>income can consider buying the larger HDB flats."<br><br>One has to ask what is the justification of such scheme? Why "70%<br>of Singaporeans to afford at least a 4-room flat"? Why not "80% of<br>Singaporeans to afford at least a 5-room flat"?<br><br>Why the government choose an affordability based pricing scheme<br>instead of a cost based pricing schem? What is the rationale behind<br>the decision?<br><br>2. Does the government realize that this affordability based scheme<br>is taking more money than necessary for cost recovery from the<br>people's savings that they need for children education, medical<br>care, and retirement?<br><br>3. Does the government realize that this affordability based scheme<br>turn previously well affordable HDB flats into back breaking<br>financial burden for those hard hit by the economic restructuring<br>and could not find jobs with the matching pay?</div>

It causes sluggishness of the economy. If by justification and presentation, we continue to pretend there is no problem, we might only postpone solutions and aggravate our problems.<br><br>There is a need to address the fundamentals.
