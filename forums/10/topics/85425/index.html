            <div class='col-md body'>hey,<br><br>lets all not end up govt bashing but rather have some futile discussion.<br><br>i think the only comparision for expensive housing is hong kong as in in many earlier threads. however i feel that the comparison is always flawed because its dependent on the district. Its like if we build HDB in bukit timah, obviously it would be very expensive.<br><br>to further elaborate my answer, the HDB pricing its flat high is a form of control, as well as a convenient money spinner, whichever comes first..<br><br>i think there was  a need for the government to raise money when it first started out.  however as we all know,  there is always an agenda.. While the HDB stated aim is " to provide affordable homes and building of communities. ", my mum and dad, lower-middle blue collared people, have been paying ther mortgage even up till now, with a sizeable mortagage.<br><br>The hidden agenda, which was stated in my brother's social studies text, is to ensure that that people work hard enough till the end of their lives. therefore there is no escape from the daily grinding of millstone..<br><br>The plus point of having such high HDB prices is first, higher government revenue. the next, it is like COE, it creates commercial spin offs. people have to have their own places and so have to take loans and stuff, demand creates  its own supply. thus we have an economy of sorts.<br><br>With such high HDB prices, we are some sort stuck. Lets assume the Govt would ever devalue the HDB pricing, what we have is a generation or few generations of people whose life and money spent  on financing the house see it disappear. its like devalutaion of assets. and so , would people still financing their mortgages be given a cash back from the Banks or HDB because of such a devalution? its a catch 22 situation.<br><br>Lastly today is Day 2 since the forums posting but we have yet to recive a reply from the officials. you might think that its a B -grade movie being played out, but i would like to hear the government's official stand.  if they think we are idiots then i mean someone will have to be put to the sword.<br></div>

HDB direct purchase is always priced at prevailing valuation price of neighbouring similar estate minus some $?0, 000. So, the only way to change it is to crash the housing market. Well.... not sure if everyone wants that to happen. And the government can "influence" the market by releasing more/less land for housing as well as to the extreme of taking back lands. Not sure if all these means anything to anyone anyway.<br><br>Blah... the common folks cannot control those things... only thing they can control is to refuse to be control by the system through making the decision to buy or not to buy an overpriced flat. Sadly, many may be encouraging this increased in housing price through the action of buying above valuation.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>here is trheir reply:<br><br>What goes into pricing of HDB flats<br><br>I REFER to the letter, 'How does HDB price its flats?' (ST, July 12), by Mr Douglas Chow Tuck Kheong.<br><br>HDB sells flats with a market subsidy in order to enable the majority of Singaporeans to own a basic flat. The market subsidy is provided by pricing new flats below the price of comparable resale flats.<br><br>The price also takes into account location, design and other specific attributes.<br><br>Affordability is assessed by looking at the debt-service ratio of buyers. Last year, buyers of three- and four-room flats used, on average, less than 20 per cent of their monthly income to service their monthly loans.<br><br>This is well within the 40 per cent guideline used by financial institutions in credit assessment, as well as international benchmarks of household expenditure on housing.<br><br>We wish to inform Mr Chow that the construction-cost figures he worked out relate only to buildingworks. The total construction cost of flats includesother costs, such as that for piling works, and consultancy and project-management fees.<br><br>TAY BOON SUN<br>Senior Public Relations Officer<br>for Director, Corporate Development<br>Housing &amp; Development Board</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>"..The letter, "How does HDB prices it's flats?" (ST July 12) has only accentuated my bewilderment at the way HDB flat prices have inflated over the past decade as a result of presumably uncontrollable market forces.<br><br>Beginning with an index of <strong>41.8 in 1993,</strong> the HDB resale-price indexs has escalated to <strong>105.2 in the second quarter of this year</strong>, according to the latest flash estimate (source: HDB website)&gt;  This represent an increase of <strong>152 %</strong>.<br><br>In contrast, the <strong>average monthly nominal earnings per employee </strong>in Singapore had <strong>increased only 68 % from $1918 in 1993 to $3213 in 2003</strong> (MOM website).<br><br>Hence, the rate of HDB resale-price inflation is <strong>more than double</strong> that of <strong>wage increment </strong>over this period of time. This living cost-to-income disparity is magnified when the effective long-term housing-loan interest rate is taken into consideration...<br><br>(Quote ST Forum 23/7/04)</div>
