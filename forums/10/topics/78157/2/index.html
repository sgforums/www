They may seem small now, but when one day a big one happens (touch wood), then u will find even 100 billion to be too little.

If the rest of the world do then I feel tat they should be more tranparent for the public to scrutinise. However if most countries do not divulge out the details of the account to prevent foreign investors to attack, then I guess tis is the correct way to make it remain as state secrets.<br><br></div>

HDB flats can make you lose money these days if you bought at the wrong time. you can end up paper lost also even if u r buying new flats. my neighbbour bought 2 year back 240K for 5 room at jurong west area when newly launch. now even years later the area is only 70% occupy and price reduce to below 200k for premier flats for my unit. even at that price, is still alot of money.<br><br>buy within our means. stop paying huge money to the HDB who already are loaded and pay their employees heaps of retrenchment benefits only to be re-employ by sister company.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>"...we live in an executive flat in Jurong West, which we moved into three years ago.  We bought the flat for<strong> $425,000</strong> from HDB.<br><br>Early this year, HDB set up a showflat in our area. Similiar to my unit, the flat is being sold for only <strong>$310,000.00</strong>.<br><br>I was shocked and annoyed:  my flat had <strong>depreciated by $115,000.00</strong>- 27 % - <strong>in just 3 years</strong>!  The rate of depreciation is too drastic, even with the economic downturn over the last few years.<br><br>HDB flats are supposed to be subsidised and the prices should therefore be reasonable and affordable for Singaporeans.<br><br>Does the substantial reduction in pricing mean theat HDB is selling at a loss or had it <strong>overpriced its flats earlier?</strong>"<br><br>(Quote ST Forum 23/7/04)</div>
