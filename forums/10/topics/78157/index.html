            <div class='col-md body'>I wonder is there any safety nets/plans to help fellow Singaporeans who cannot service their loans due to change of economic, technology &amp; employment climate.<br><br>What about those who just got their flat and those intended to get one.

            <div class='col-md body'>S$14,000,000,000 is  what HDB made, not the total worth of HDB flats !  This sum excludes the vast assets HDB owned courtesy of the Land Enactment Act.<br><br>This figure  S$14 billion was finally released (after much pressure from public)   and casually mentioned in  StraitsTimes. This HDB secret had been kept in the vault for more than 30 years, Government previously defying countless public and other political  parties requests  to open the books.<br><br>From here you easily see the Government disguises itself as caring but actually schemes to make more money from its people.<br><br>See how GLCs are continously buying up multi-billion companies outside Singapore - those purchases do not provide jobs for unemployed singaporeans.  It only help workers overseas . And our Government love to help foreigners more than Singaporeans.  Thats why so many PRs in here.<br><br>Btw where do you think they get so much money to invest wildly?  <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>CPF OF COURSE</strong></span>!   The minimum sum law is to ensure we all dont take out our savings - so they can continue to use them to make money.   Make money to share with us? <span style="text-decoration: underline;">NEVER</span>.<br><br>Just look at our huge reserves for eg.  Even in  difficult economic situation like now, our government has broken the promise of using part of reserves to help Singaporeans during a crunch. Many Singaporeans are living in dire straits right now - does the Government really  care?<br><br>Instead of caring for us - ministry of finance  is helping to save overseas companies and workers.</div>

But if you only lament about the state of SIngapore and not do anything about it, can you change anything? Be proactive and take charge. Yes, one can never hope to beat the PAP machinery, but at least we should try instead of being reactive to things around us</div>

BTW the earlier fact about $50 for needy people is renting the whole apartment not a room only.<br><br><blockquote>Even if you can afford to buy OVERPRICED HDB apartment, bet you will be working your whole life just to service your housing loan.

That's why HDB has S$14 billion in the vault - OUR MONEY! </blockquote>Well.... Gov have 100 billion in foreign reserves too... tat is our money as well. Maybe we should complain about it too... So the question come whether should singapore have a reserve or not ?<br><br><blockquote>Question - why didnt government control HDB prices to ensure Singaporeans dont get burned in the pockets? If HDB can come out with all sorts of laws governing HDB houses - they could easily pass a law to cap HDB prices to ensure we have more cash for our retirement. </blockquote>Answer is... if they do reduce the money for HDB, they had to increase tax in other forms to cover up their loss. They can easily write a law saying every singaporean get a million each... but wat is the repurcussion or effect ?<br><br><blockquote>HDB started as a scheme to help Singaporeans housed affordably.
