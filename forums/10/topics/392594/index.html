              <p>There is a lot of different in people coming in beggar country and people coming from full meals onboard country. On the other hand, those from beggar country will agree on anything, the mentality is get it first, talk later, and those from full meals on board ones is talk first, work later.</p>
              <p>Let compare apple to apple, look at my 2nd homeland taiwan, japan and korea, quite similar to singapore, also low birth rate and aging population, they did allow foreign workers into their industrial, but only on certain industrials and very minimal, tightly control and after 2 years, they change them. Unlike ours, their foreign workers infusion needs the agreement from their unions and public consent. For us ah nehs, ah bangalas, ah tiongs and ah tiong mei mei can come and go as they like. But these countries are also doing well, they got local cleaner, local delivery men, local bus drivers, local workers and local management.</p>
              <p>The differences is their local are paid well to perform a job, about $3 to 4 for a cleaner job, treated as professionals, do their duties well and loyal to the companies and their country, as a cleaner, she must make sure all in tip top conditions so as to be proud of her archievement and her country image, at all  time she will provide good service. She is productivity, innovative and also friendly. You see in japan and korean, they mean business in their job. But in Singapore, you paid peanuts employ peanuts, you get foreign monkeys with no motivation to be productive, no innovation, and certainly no care about anything as this is not their country, no loyalty as they are only here maybe 2 years contract then go home. And that is why our productivity and our quality went down.</p>
              <p>Now, if you paid our cleaners $3k per month, tell me what will happen??? still go MC, still dun want to work??? so you got to be reasonable here about our workforce ya, it is not that singapore grumble so much, it is because our salary is being crushed down by foreign workers, who will take on anything rather than staying at their beggar country with nothing much to earn.</p>

              <p>And why shouldn't they be asking for those things?  Just because the market has been entirely spoilt by foreigners doesn't make the concerns of a Singaporean any less valid.  </p>
              <p>Take overtime for example.  The conditions of a job should be based on an agreement between employer and employee.  One puts in a set amount of time, the other pays a set amount of money.  Shouldn't a company pay more money if more time is needed?  By not paying overtime a company is effectively stealing employees' time.  We've been conditioned to think otherwise.</p>
