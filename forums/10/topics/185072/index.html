The rising tide of opposition is related to the fact that some strata of society feel they have lost out. But the Opposition cannot win unless they can convince Singaporeans they can do better running the economy...<br><br>Which is why I am surpised we haven't seen more economists and successful entrepreneurs among the Opposition Party candidates...</div>
