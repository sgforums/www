            <div class='col-md body'>if Indon can amass 300k soldiers, basically means they got no more soldiers left in Indonesia itself already, so why not just whack Indon mainland?  Indonesia will probably lose like siao 'cos MAF can whack any part of Indon without ANY resistance...<br><br>After that, UN will step in, US will send seventh fleet over to 'maintain peace' etc... M'sia newspaper will make remarks about how good MAF is...<br><br>I doubt Indon will actually touch Malaysia lah, but then again Indon leadership is VERY unpredicatable, though Ms Megawati dun seem too bad so far... if you got another fella like Wahid come into power, then maybe got chance they'll go for excursion in Malaysia <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>but then again, it mostly depends on the generals in TNI, TNI got ALOT of power in Indon and they are dumb but not dumb enough to go whack M'sia...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The deciding factor here is logistics. TNI does not have the logistics to move sufficient manpower and equipment from all over to concentrate on Kalimantan quickly enough to catch anyone off guard. By the time sufficient numbers are built up(if they can be at all), diplomatic intervention might have defused the situation already.<br><br>Also, I don't think TNI can spare the manpower. Ambon, Aceh and West Papua is already tying up a lot of TNI military and logistics assets.<br><br>However, on a pure fantasy scenario alone, should the original situation be able to be played out, (ie assume no trouble in West Papua, Ambon and Aceh to tie up TNI assets), I would say the TNI would steamroll the MAF by sheer weight of numbers alone. The MAF might have superior weapons as Innocent Malaysian said, but individual superiority can only bring you that far if you don't have sufficient numbers on the ground.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>not really, actually, if they fight a fast war, the Malaysians have a very good chance of winning compare to TNI, esp. if the Malaysians get there in time... that will be the main factor for both sides i guess, racing to see who gets there first to strike first. TNI will have the advantage of surprise if they can get a few 'elite units' (if they have any good ones) to strike first but Malaysian weaponry will change that.  If there is a prolonged war, the original shifting troop problem is not so evidently present anymore and only then can Indon just steam roll in, but with only 300k troops (virtually the whole standing force of Indon without reserves) this is not a sure win situation.<br><br>I would say that the odds of Malaysia winning are 6-4, not totally certain victory but likely...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>In the unlikely scenario that Indonesia attacked Malaysia in Borneo, and with factors like not having their build up of their troops detected, then it would be very likely that the whole of Borneo will fall. This takes into accounts that the TNI will commit only 1/3 of its force meaning that it will be less than the 300,000 troops, less advance weaponary and a weak Indonesian navy and air force.<br><br>This is because as you could see in the map, there is a South China Sea dividing the two territories and MAF do not have the capability to project their force across the South China Sea. In my opinion, only the US has the ability to project their ground force far away and even that it has some difficulties doing it. If China can launch their ground troops successfully into Taiwan, it would have taken back Taiwan. Remember the Gulf War whereby it takes months just to get the ground troops into place. In history, only during the World War II have ground forces been projected successfully during the Allies attack into Frace and it took so many countries naval and merchant ships to do so.<br><br>So Borneo may fall but how long can Indonesia hold on to it is another question altogether.[/img]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i wish to point out the following:<br><br>1... indonesian military numbers stands at 1 million men... although 700,000 of the above are little more the mere patrolmen with probably one pistol or a rifle... it must be understood that indonesia would not be entirely undefended in other areas should it choose to move 300,000 of its elite forces to kalimantan....<br><br>2.... couple with the millitary... i must stress that indonesia also possess a sizeable paramilitary force.<br><br>3.... it should not be too difficult to conduct a conscription to get additional man into the milltary for a potential redeployment of forces into kalimantan for a nation that populous...<br><br>4... moving forces within one's national border is a national sovereign rights... as such... i doubt the international community would bother to make much noise... in fact... malaysia itself would find it difficult to challenge the indonesians over such a basic right... remember the time when malaysia move 100,000 men to johor for exercise??? singapore was obviously alarmed but the world international overall... said nothing at all...<br><br>5... majority of the MAF forces are in peninsula malaysia... while those in East malaysia are mainly composed of less well equipped units. thus we must consider the disposition of malaysian units, equipment and its ability to re-enforce its eastern units should the need arises.<br><br>6... while indonesia would probably not depoy its maximun 300,000 force in kalimantan... likewise... it must be realise that MAF would not move all its forces eastward in view of the proximity of sumatra to KL...<br><br>7... another factors needs to be considered is the nearly 1million indonesians currently working legally and illegally in malaysia, especially peninsula malaysia... the TNI's ability to get them involved by resorted to crime, sabotage, forward intelligience, a 'second' front and others must be taken into account.<br><br>8... furthermore... indonesia while suffering from separatism... many of these separatist forces are not  really in my view overstretching the TNI's forces... rather... when u face a guerrila force... conventional forces seems unable to contain them.... but its does not mean that IF TNI goes into east malaysia... the separatist will get all they wanted.<br><br>9... indonesia do posses submarines and other warships... though not as advance as RMN... i still belive that their presence would significantly impede MAF's ability to send forces by sea to east malaysia... likewise in the air... TNI-AU would definitely attempt to hit every C130  RMAF sends... in any event... RMAF airlift ability is limited and its sincerely doubtfull they can send sufficient forces by air to reverse the severe disadvantage they are facing on the east malaysian front...<br><br>10...on the other hand... i sincerely questions RMAF ability to do the same against indonesia (TNI sending more forces to kalimantan by air or sea)in view of the distance that needs to be covered... the lack of ATA refuelling plus the inability of RMAF to loiter over any area far from malaysia for a useful amount of time...send RMN ships deep into indonesia water to cut off such indonesian reinforcement without sufficient air cover is neither a good option either....<br><br>11 lastly... we have to consider the extremely long and highly porous joint border between east malaysia and kalimantan and the ease of TNI to penetrate those lines and rush for all the RMAF airbase, MAF camps and RMN base... they could even send elite units into malaysia first and lie waiting outside each MAF camps and base to keep them in check or pin them down until the TNI main force comes to annihilate them.<br><br>12.... finally... if TNI decides to keeps its 300,000 force near malaysian borders in east malaysia.... wat is malaysia's options...<br><br>12a. will MAF send additional forces to defend a line that is indefensible while putting its capital and peninsula malaysia at higher risk in view of the potential indonesian charging across the melaka strait?<br><br>12b or will MAF simply give up east malaysia and consider the security need of KL instead?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Honestly, if there is any invasion by the Indonesians against the Malaysians .. it will not be a clean army to army fight.

            <div class='col-md body'>A good reply, tripwire, but still does not answer me on why would Indonesia pick Sabah &amp; Sarawak? After all, its all jungle .. they take it over, international arbitration, and malaysia gets most of it back? In fact, an invasion can happen today and we won't know of it? What would it benefit?<br><br>The we come to the folks of Sarawak &amp; Sabah. Unhappy they may be to be part of Malaysia, I am sure they will prefer it to being part of indonesia.<br><br>Then comes logistics. Yes. MAF may be having trouble going into Indonesia .. but depending on what sort of battle is taking place? I really think that any invasion is going to be a man-to-man battle (Indons will win as 300k soldiers is definately overwhelming force) So I think MAF will be just ferrying troops and ammo over there. And send ship .. there will not be much need for trACked vehicles as the terrain there is jungle and mountainous (4WDs will be ideal)<br><br>I don't think any battle between 2 muslim nations is going to be just soldiers .. there will be bombings, insurgency etc. Question will be which State in Malaysia wants to join Indonesia and which state in indonesia will side with the Malaysians?<br><br>I know little about the confratasi but my thought was that was to prevent Malaysia from claiming sabah and sarawak into their union. I am not sure if any of the current issues Malaysia and Indonesia have will turn into a full scale war nor its strategic intention.<br><br>Japan invaded SEA for resources. So did Germany when it kicked off WW2. Vietname and Korea was wars to unite their country under one banner. Konfrontasi was to prevent East Malaya from joining the union. Konfrontasi II will have to have some similar impetus. If we can think of a plausible scenario, then we can figure out WHERE it should be held.</div>

Unhappy they may be to be part of Malaysia, I am sure they will prefer it to being part of indonesia.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow">  my point is that... since the east malaysians are harldy patriotic towards KL... chances of them uprising against TNI is lesser though not remote and to many of them... its merely a change in masters....<br><br>Then comes logistics. Yes. MAF may be having trouble going into Indonesia .. but depending on what sort of battle is taking place? I really think that any invasion is going to be a man-to-man battle (Indons will win as 300k soldiers is definately overwhelming force) So I think MAF will be just ferrying troops and ammo over there. And send ship .. there will not be much need for trACked vehicles as the terrain there is jungle and mountainous (4WDs will be ideal)<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> i sincerely belive that such a move of logistics across to east malaysia would not go smoothly and TNI-AL and TNI-AU would make sure of that ... lastly... without additional troops... more rifles and ammos is hardly gonna stop the TNI rush for every major towns in east malaysia and other key strategic location and positions... such logistic support is equivalent to attempting to stop a raging fire with a water gun...<br><br>I don't think any battle between 2 muslim nations is going to be just soldiers .. there will be bombings, insurgency etc. Question will be which State in Malaysia wants to join Indonesia and which state in indonesia will side with the Malaysians?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> i dont think the states would be in any autonomous position to take any sides... this is because the respective states do not control the armed forces or their own local militia forces... furthermore.. the geographical delineation ensures that any rebellious elements would be met with swiftly and harshly.... by forces from its own nations.. while help or reinforcement from the other side would not be forthcoming anytime soon enough to make a difference.<br><br>I know little about the confratasi but my thought was that was to prevent Malaysia from claiming sabah and sarawak into their union. I am not sure if any of the current issues Malaysia and Indonesia have will turn into a full scale war nor its strategic intention.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> anything is possible.....reasons dont always come into the picture.<br><br>Japan invaded SEA for resources. So did Germany when it kicked off WW2. Vietname and Korea was wars to unite their country under one banner. Konfrontasi was to prevent East Malaya from joining the union. Konfrontasi II will have to have some similar impetus. If we can think of a plausible scenario, then we can figure out WHERE it should be held.</div></blockquote>as i said... the purpose is to depict a senario between MAF and TNI over east malaysia... and i have given the reason why east malaysia was chosen (presumably by TNI) for military and strategic reasons.... the questions are... how will MAF prevent the fall of east malaysia....</div>
