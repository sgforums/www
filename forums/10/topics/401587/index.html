              <div class="art-PostContent">
              <p>The case of relief cabby Mr Teo Kian Seng, who was charged in court
                  yesterday for “threatening” PAP MP Lee Yi Shyan had sparked an outcry
                  in cyberspace with many netizens wondering why the MP felt fit to make
                  a police report in the first place.</p>
              <p>Mr Teo allegedly told Lee in Mandarin that he hoped “history will
                  not repeat itself” in a referral to the torching incident involving PAP
                  MP Seng Han Thong last year at a Meet-the-People session on 1st of
                  March.</p>
              <p>It was reported in the Straits Times today that Mr Teo had gone to
                  see Lee over a summons received by his mother for leaving clutter along
                  the corridor of her flat.</p>
              <p>Mr Teo’s mother, who is currently in her 80s, has been working as a
                  “Garang-guni” woman for many years in order to pay for her medical
                  expenses.</p>
              <p>She might have no choice but to leave her “barang” along the
                  corridor due to the nature of her work and lack of space in her own
                  home.</p>
              <p>It is not unusual in first world Singapore to see the elderly
                  scavenging for used cardboards and newspapers in the streets for a
                  living.</p>
              <p>Despite its huge foreign reserves, Singapore has few social safety
                  nets for its citizens who are expected to be self-reliant and not
                  depend on the state for support.</p>
              <p>It is not known if Mr Teo is the sole bread-winner of the family and
                  if his mother will be in financial distress should he go to jail.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>The Straits Times reported that Assistant Superintendent Raj Kishore
                  Rai had told District Judge Low Wee Ping that “the prosecution was not
                  ready to accept Teo’s plea as the victim was an MP.”</strong></span></p>
              <p>Why should an MP deserve preferential treatment from the police?</p>
              <p>The authorities should assess the likelihood of Mr Teo acting on his
                  very subtle threat thoroughly before taking action against him.</p>
              <p>He probably said it in the heat of a moment under some sort of “provocation”.</p>
              <p>The odds are stacked heavily against Mr Teo who does not have the
                  financial resources to afford a good lawyer to fight the case for him,
                  not to mention the financial losses he has to suffer as a result.</p>

              <p>I think that guy is just an uneducated person who do not know much about politics. He even mistook seng hang tong as the MP for Hougang instead when he issued the threat.</p>
              <p>Something else (most likely livelihood issues) must have triggered the deep anger in him for him to make such a remark.</p>
              <p>I wonder if he was one of the 63.68% who voted for PAP in that GRC  (East Coast GRC) way back in 2006. If he had voted for them I wonder how he's feeling now.</p>
              <p>This is a good lesson for apolitical Singaporeans. Politics do have a direct repercussion on our lives. Many people think that it is possible to dissociate politics completely from our daily life, which is flawed.  </p>

              <p>instead of helping him further, they set the police on him. That's what we call in chinese "gan jin sha jue" right? Means drive u up the wall and finish u off.</p>
              <p>Now what happens to his elderly mum? She is still sick and has to continue picking up cardboards. Quite a tragedy. I wonder if anyone can find the link or contact no. as to how we can donate to her.</p>

              <p>2. is there a growing resentment towards the ruling party that ppl feel frustrated that they could not challenge the regime? thus resort to using threats or volence?</p>
              <p>3. a threat nevetheless is wrong. i strongly urge singaporeans to cast your vote wisely that is only the time, where u can challenge the system and make a difference.</p>

              <p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-27515" title="yishyan" src="http://www.temasekreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/yishyan1.jpg" alt="yishyan" width="162" height="167">During
              a visit to Sai Kung last Sunday to promote his reform package to the
              people, Hong Kong Chief Executive Donald Tsang was greeted by hundreds
              of disgruntled citizens who heckled, abused and accused him of “selling
              out” the people.</p>
              <p>Not only must he put up with a torrent of verbal abuse including
              vulgarities in Cantonese from the crowd, he also have to guard himself
              against flying eggs and slippers thrown at him from nowhere.</p>
              <p>One protestor ran towards him swearing to “do him in” and was
              stopped by the police before he could reach Tsang. Despite the
              cacophony, no arrests were made. The police simply stood by and watched.</p>
              <p>Had the scenario occurred in Singapore, riot trucks will be called
              in immediately and the protestors arrested and brought away forcefully
              by our Singapore Police Force.</p>
              <p>Last week, a 52 year old relief cabby Mr Teo Kian Seng was charged
              in court for “threatening” his PAP MP Lee Yi Shyan. One would have
              thought that he must have done or said some horrible things to scare
              the wits out of the newbie MP, but all he did was to remind Lee that he
              hoped he would not see a “repeat” of the torching incident of Seng Han
              Thong last year.</p>
              <p>How this can be construed or misconstrued as a “threat” by the MP
              and the Singapore police is anybody’s guess. The poor man had gone to
              see Lee at his Meet-the-People session in Bedok over a summons received
              by his elderly mother for leaving her “garang-guni” along the corridor.</p>
              <p>The media did not report what transpire in the conversation between
              the two men, but surely Mr Teo would not have uttered those regrettable
              words for no good reason.</p>
              <p>Either he was provoked into doing so or he must be so peeved by
              Lee’s attitude that he had a slip of tongue. One thing for sure: the
              exchange between Mr Teo and Lee is unlikely to be a pleasant encounter.</p>
              <p>In all likelihood, Mr Teo probably said the “threatening” sentence
              out of anger or frustration and bears no malice or ill-will for it was
              not mentioned if Mr Teo had raised his voice or behaved in a hostile
              manner towards Lee.</p>
              <p>An understanding and magnimanous gentleman would have forgotten the incident and let it pass instead of lodging a police report.</p>
              <p>In most cases, the police will not even bother to investigate and
              will simply refer the complainant to the Magistrate’s court, but of
              course when it involves a PAP MP, they are especially “efficient”.</p>
              <p>The PAP MPs should realize that they are bound to encounter rude,
              unpleasant and unruly residents during their grassroots work. There
              will be people who are unhappy, peeved and angry at the government and
              they will naturally become their immediate targets to vent their
              frustrations on.</p>
              <p>During his visit to Tainan county last year in the aftermath of the
              Typhoon Morakot, Taiwanese President Ma Ying-Jeou was mobbed by angry
              villagers who threatened to beat him into a pulp. The unfortunate scene
              was telecast “live” on Taiwanese TV.</p>
              <p>Elsewhere in Asia, it is relatively common to see lawmakers being
              heckled, abused and even beaten physically by disgruntled citizens when
              they are out in the public.</p>
              <p>While violent behavior should not be condoned and deserved to be
              prosecuted, more discretion should be exercised by the authorities in
              the dealing of cases like Mr Teo’s which lie in the “gray” zone.</p>
              <p>The role of an MP is to serve as an intermediary between the people
              and the government and to be an official channel for feedback from the
              ground, whether positive or negative.</p>
              <p>Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew wrote in his memoirs that he and his
              entourage was jeered, heckled and jostled by opposition supporters when
              he was campaigning for the PAP in strongholds held by the Barisan
              Sosialis and he was even pushed into the drain on one occasion.</p>
              <p>The present generation of new PAP MPs are indeed “strawberry” MPs
              who appear unable to differentiate between real threat and mere
              paranoia.</p>
              <p>Facing and dealing with unhappy Singaporeans are part and parcel of
              their work as MPs. If the PAP MPs are so easily “threatened”, then
              perhaps they should seriously reconsider their positions as
              representatives of the people in Parliament.</p>
              <p>It is so much easier being a MP in Singapore compared to Hong Kong,
              Taiwan, South Korea and other Asian countries and it is a shame that
              PAP MPs still get paranoid over such trivial incidents.</p>
              <p>That is the kind of MPs we get when they do not have to fight tooth
              and nail for every single vote from the people and are whisked into
              Parliament either through walkovers or GRCs.</p>
              <p>Under the PAP’s uninterrupted rule for more than five decades, the
              term “MP” has taken a new definition altogether. Instead of serving the
              people as they should be, they are now behaving like little emperors
              whom the people must kowtow to and beg on their knees for help.</p>

              <p>Either he was provoked into doing so or he must be so peeved by Lee’s attitude that he had a slip of tongue. One thing for sure: the exchange between Mr Teo and Lee is unlikely to be a pleasant encounter.</p>
              <p>In all likelihood, Mr Teo probably said the “threatening” sentence out of anger or frustration and bears no malice or ill-will for it was not mentioned if Mr Teo had raised his voice or behaved in a hostile manner towards Lee.</p>
              <p>An understanding and magnimanous gentleman would have forgotten the incident and let it pass instead of lodging a police report.</p>
              <p>In most cases, the police will not even bother to investigate and will simply refer the complainant to the Magistrate’s court, but of course when it involves a PAP MP, they are especially “efficient”.</p>
              <p>The PAP MPs should realize that they are bound to encounter rude, unpleasant and unruly residents during their grassroots work. There will be people who are unhappy, peeved and angry at the government and they will naturally become their immediate targets to vent their frustrations on.</p>
              <p>During his visit to Tainan county last year in the aftermath of the Typhoon Morakot, Taiwanese President Ma Ying-Jeou was mobbed by angry villagers who threatened to beat him into a pulp. The unfortunate scene was telecast “live” on Taiwanese TV.</p>
              <p>Elsewhere in Asia, it is relatively common to see lawmakers being heckled, abused and even beaten physically by disgruntled citizens when they are out in the public.</p>
              <p>While violent behavior should not be condoned and deserved to be prosecuted, more discretion should be exercised by the authorities in the dealing of cases like Mr Teo’s which lie in the “gray” zone.</p>
              <p>The role of an MP is to serve as an intermediary between the people and the government and to be an official channel for feedback from the ground, whether positive or negative.</p>
              <p>Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew wrote in his memoirs that he and his entourage was jeered, heckled and jostled by opposition supporters when he was campaigning for the PAP in strongholds held by the Barisan Sosialis and he was even pushed into the drain on one occasion.</p>
              <p>The present generation of new PAP MPs are indeed “strawberry” MPs who appear unable to differentiate between real threat and mere paranoia.</p>
              <p>Facing and dealing with unhappy Singaporeans are part and parcel of their work as MPs. If the PAP MPs are so easily “threatened”, then perhaps they should seriously reconsider their positions as representatives of the people in Parliament.</p>
              <p>It is so much easier being a MP in Singapore compared to Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea and other Asian countries and it is a shame that PAP MPs still get paranoid over such trivial incidents.</p>
              <p>That is the kind of MPs we get when they do not have to fight tooth and nail for every single vote from the people and are whisked into Parliament either through walkovers or GRCs.</p>
              <p>Under the PAP’s uninterrupted rule for more than five decades, the term “MP” has taken a new definition altogether. Instead of serving the people as they should be, they are now behaving like little emperors whom the people must kowtow to and beg on their knees for help.</p>

              <p><br>Hello, the key word used here is threaten, Singaporean threaten his MPs, it is an offence.</p>
              <p>In Hongkong, they dun threaten their temporary govt, they only scold, throw rotten eggs and cry foul on their right being abused. That's the differences ya.</p>
              <p>The court of Singapore are not stupid, and certainly not the prosecutor who is the govt lawyer, he choose his key word "threaten" well, not only MPs are the one seeking protection and unjust, even a man on the street, being threatened can sue the other party.</p>
              <p>So, i suggest, if next time you dun like your MP, throw rotten eggs instead of use threatening words ya...</p>
