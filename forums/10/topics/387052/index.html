              <p>Over the past few weeks i saw several post from ministers on why they should get elected or if they are elected they will lower Cost of Living in Singapore or a political system that work only for Singapore......</p>
              <p>It make me wonder if our Minister is running for Election or Quid pro quo with the people?</p>
              <p>like some forumner mention if they can reduce cost after election that means that can reduce cost of living in Singapore NOW?</p>
              <p>To be honest i don't think there is a consensor among singaporean as to what this election is all about?</p>
              <p>If the lay men is just worry about pocket it is all down hill from here for the next couple of years. No matter who you elected.</p>

              <p>you mean like after 40 years in power.....</p>
              <p>Singapore is probably at a cross road in terms of direction?  So why is singaporean willing to deal with this quid pro quo message send by minister? </p>
              <p>I just think that at some point Singaporean need to step out from the practical perspective of cost of living and ask questions?</p>
              <p>Is the government a fair representative of the people voices?</p>
              <p>Is the government doing enough to protect its people interest?</p>
              <p>after 40 years is more than just nation building mode.....what is the point of nation building if educated Singaporean are leaving and struggling in debt?</p>

              <p><br>CrossRoad implies that at some point there are changes in the enviornment or regions and nationhood need to come together and make a decision.</p>

              <p>The collapse of the Soviet Union at the end of the 1980's was a great blow to the hopes of revolutionaries. Why did it collapse?</p>
              <p>The immediate cause of the Soviet collapse was economic.The United States was able to profit from its imperialist exploitation of other countries, while socialism could only lose economically in that competition. By the end, the ruble collapsed as Soviet consumers turned to imports to satisfy their needs. . And, needless to say, there were no quality goods to export in order to balance imports. <br><br>Economic factors were linked to political and psychological factors. As the Soviet economist Latsis said at the time, "the gloomy background of the worsening market situation ... has a depressing effect on people." Their gloom deepened as a result of policy failures. Another factor was the lack of honest information, the secrecy and propaganda that is central to the culture of war. As contradictions mounted the Soviet people became more and more cynical about the propaganda of government-controlled media. It was common to hear the Russian people say that you could find truth anywhere except in Pravda and the news anywhere except in Izvestia.</p>
              <p>Economic indicators were routinely suppressed or falsified to the point that when the final economic collapse was imminent there were no published figures to indicate the points of weakness.</p>
