              <p>It is the basic tenet of meritocracy that the best jobs and the highest pay go to the one with the best skills. Many tibetans lose out because they do not value education as highly as the Han Chinese. It is in the interest of the elite lamas to convince the people that a religious education is more important. Despite that, more tibetans are educated than ever before and the economy of tibet has imrpocved tremendously. The Chinese government has also put in millions to improve the infrastructure in Tibet. What has the lamas done over the hundreds of years they have been in power? </p>

              <p>Don't you even pause to think why the bosses would employ cheaper workers with lousier skills? Perhaps because the 'lousier skilles' of the cheaper workers are sufficient for the job to be done? Perhaps the cheaper workers can pick up their skills and be on par in a short time? Meritocracy is about people who are best value for money. It is about those with the best skills at the lowest cost who can bring the greatest value to your business.</p>
              <p>In any case, this argument does not hold in tibet, where the better qualified workers are the Han Chinese who have re-located to Tibet. Over there, the foreign workers have the better skills. </p>

              <p>u have a sweeper who happens to be a degree holder.. u pay him the price that u deem a sweeper should get regardless of his qualification.. right or wrong?</p>
              <p>den he works at that price.. u happy, he happy..</p>
              <p>den now ah tiong comes in.. he says 'hey, i can be sweeper too.. but u dunid to pay me a sweeper's pay, u pay me lesser than that can liao..'</p>
              <p>den now u see this ah tiong cheaper, u gian.. u fire the degree holder, but then.. ur ah tiong duno how to empty the dustpan, duno where to sweep, duno how to use the broom, end up u haf to sweep for him..but what's ur defense for hiring him? cheaper and willing to learn?</p>
              <p>now where is ur meritocracy?</p>
              <p>why not today, u hire a completely illiterate ah tiong to be a nuclear
              power plant engineer and u tell ppl "he's cheaper and he will learn"?</p>
              <p>in the 1st place, when the degree holder came for the job application to be a sweeper, he ask for 3k/mth, u give him? no right? duh right? u give him a sweeper's pay right? so anything lower than that? what do u call that? value for money? or simply greed and to put it nicely, "cut cost"?</p>
              <p>and where did u even infer that "by my logic", we need someone to be degree holder to be sweeper?</p>
              <p>if today an olvl qualification sweeper is replaced by a CHEAPER degree holder to be a sweeper, good! why no good? meritocracy what..someone better than u is cheaper than u leh.. that is value for money leh.. but are how many of the ah tiongs replacing the sgreans today are better? they are just cheaper, not better, how do u even justify ur value for money? again HOPING that they can learn faster rite? hope only right? "hope" that is fueled by the fact that they are cheaper right?</p>
