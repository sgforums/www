If the PRCs are insulted, then they should defend themselves.</div>

Even their own government and people are wagging a warning finger at their own citizens...<br><br>I mean, if they are commendable and are generally nice people, I wouldn't hesitate to compliment, however, it is sadly not the case with China and their people...<br><br>As for this matter of a raving mad Caucasian, I hope there will be more of such incidences... because ultimately it reflects on the way people were moulded by the government, and the government's open policy to foreigners influx....<br><br></div>

There is no difference between Caucasians, Chinese, Indians, Malays,....only the good the bad and the ugly. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
