At that moment, an elderly Caucasian woman came up and offered to pay the fare for that person.<br><br>She did this while raising her voice and commenting that Singaporeans will never help anyone but themselves and that all Singaporeans were money-minded.<br></blockquote><blockquote><br>Everyone just sat there without saying a word. If we Singaporeans do not stand up for ourselves in the face of such blatant tyranny, who will? The ironic thing is that I am Eurasian and my girlfriend is German and I was the only one who said something when she went on her racial tirade.</blockquote>I disagree with her bigotry and racist remarks, but doesnt the fact that no one else stood up only goes to further support her point? The fact that Salleh is the only one that stood up, makes him the exception and not the norm?<br><br>Its a rather sad fact that no one else stood up.</div>
