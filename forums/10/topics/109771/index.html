And many american are very unhappy with secretary Donald Rumsfield right now.  I for one want to see him go.  I am also extremely dissatisfied at the current administration.  Bush has angered many americans, yet somehow he got re-elected.  It angers me so much that americans would put their seal of approval on his actions by re-electing him.  And I wholeheartedly agree with the UN's decision to not support the war in Iraq.  I hope after the Iraqi election this next month the new Iraqi government will ask us to leave and get out of there.  I don't want any more of my fellow countrymen to die for such a worthless cause (oil).  Besides, I don't like this image of america stomping on everyone that doesn't agree with Bush's wacko right-wing agendas.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It is difficult to define what is illegal in the realm of international relations.  Laws are more concrete when written for use inside of a country's borders, "laws" meant to be used on an international basis are less strict and are more of an agreement between states.<br><br>A lot of people can say the US-led invasion of Iraq was "illegal" because it did not have the UN's blessing, however even though I do not agree with the war I do not think it is illegal.  The point I was making above is merely that what one country views as illegal on a foreign-policy standpoint might be legal in another state.</div>

When an old dog bites its master - u kill it - that is why they are so keen on overthrowing Saddam because he refused to bow to them anymore.  They are now installing a puppet type of iraqi government ,which could be just like the old saddam regime , as long as the government bows to them each time - they won't care about the said actrocities.<br><br>And if you read the news, the "weapons of mass destruction" cannot be found in iraq at all. That was the excuse used to invade an oil rich country.<br><br>Afghanistan was an excuse to show their military might can help their people suffering from the 9/11 disaster. Well , George bush jr cannot be seen doing nothing so there u go - afghanistan and then linking a Sunni muslim iraqi president Saddam to a shiite muslim terrorist like Osama . That's a joke. It is like saying the IRA will cease to exist in northern ireland today.<br><br></div>
