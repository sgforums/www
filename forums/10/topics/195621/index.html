            <div class='col-md body'>I used to regard that Israel is just and is the Victim..<br><br>But recent years, I have change my opnion.. and realised that I has been duped by media conditioning... I'm not advocating that all palestinians actions are correct. Then recently, I realise what else can they do ?? The US gives 30% of their billions dollar foreign aid to them, which mostly are for military,  and Vitoe any known UN security council resolution (which stands at 81 now)... couple this with the extensive US media propaganda machine.. really what else can they do ???<br><br>Their lands were, indeed, occupied, dispite what we are reading in the news paper. The map of 1948 and the map know cliam by the Israel and US are very different. The Israelis are actually expanding settlements in the west bank... despite their road plans with the US. The 14 month cease fire by HAMAS are actually one sided only - Israel did not.. Israel continues to bomb the common Palestinians for retaliations discriminately...<br><br>Here's a good article about the west current situation.<br><br><blockquote><strong>Every road out of Bethlehem is blocked by mounds of dirt and a checkpoint.   Imagine driving along as you have always done, between Hampstead, say, and Regent's Park, when you come upon a barrier of earth thrown up the night before.   Soldiers stand at the barrier in full battle gear, yelling at you in a strange language or a pidgin version of your own.   They tell you to get out of your car - you're not allowed to drive here any more.   If you're allowed to carry on, you will do so on foot.   They yell at you to line up and they take their time checking your papers, questioning you - Where are you going?   Why do you want to go there?   Prove to me that your daughter/best friend/dentist/music teacher lives there.   A few metres away you can see the new highway that cuts across your old road.   Cars are speeding along on it, driven by men and women of that other people, the people that the soldiers belong to.<br><br>We stand at one of these checkpoints, my son taking photographs of the pedestrians waiting to be allowed to walk to the next village.   Two soldiers leave the checkpoint and stride towards us, raising their M16s to the level of our heads and shouting: "No photographs! Give me your camera.   You! No photos."<br><br>"Where's the notice that says no photography?" we call.<br><br>"Everyone knows.   Give me the camera.   I can shoot you.   You take photo of me..."<br><br>"We took photos of the people waiting."<br><br>"You took photo of me.   I can shoot you..."<br><br>"What's the problem?   Are you ashamed of what you're doing?   Show me the paper that says we can't take photos."   This is Tony, our Palestinian guide.   He's a film editor with an international press agency and has a US passport.<br><br>"I don't need no fucking paper.   I can shoot you, that's my paper."<br><br>"Show me the paper."<br><br>"This is Israel, I do what I like.   I can shoot you.   Here I do what I like."<br><br>"This isn't Israel.   This is the West Bank."<br><br>"West Bank?   What is this West Bank?"   The soldier turns to his friend questioningly.<br><br>My son tries to chip in but I stamp on his foot.<br><br>"Look: in there, is Palestine.   You do what you want.   Here is Israel.   In your country, can you take pictures of secret soldiers?"<br><br>After a bit more of this Tony gets out his mobile and phones the army.   The soldiers take off their shades and turn into unhappy young men: "You think I like to do this?   You think I like to stand all day wearing this, and this, and this?   This I have to do so my mother is safe in Tel Aviv."   We suggest it might be a happier situation all round if they did this on the green line.   "Green line?   They can creep under the green line.   Look: we give them everything.   They always want more.   We give them land, we give them water, we give them electricity.   They want more..."<br><br>"But you are stealing these people's land.   What about the settlements?"<br><br>"That is for the politicians.   We don't know about that.   It is the politicians."   They go back to the checkpoint.   We keep the camera.   Tony has to take our photos to the army censor for clearance within 48 hours.</strong> </blockquote><a href="http://www.thewe.cc/contents/more/archive/december2003/now_the_landscape_itself_has_changed.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.thewe.cc/contents/more/archive/december2003/now_the_landscape_itself_has_changed.htm</a><br><br></div>

In the process, the Israeli built Concrete Wall had displaced more legitimate Communities - (mostly Muslims) - from the land that the Muslims have owned for generations.<br><br>Israel had built the Great Concrete Wall based on military defensive strategic and tactical considerations, and not on politically recognised border lines.<br><br>The political history of this region, and the intransigence of the attitudes from all sides towards each other will cause the Biblical prediction to come true - when the brothers begin to fight with each other, the House will come down.<br><br>The Jews and the Arabs both recognised Abraham as their Father, and this is according to both Biblical and Koranic records, as well as in the Jewish Torah.<br><br>They are brothers living in a divided House.<br><br>If they cannot resolve their differences, and with outside interference and support - (Iran's future Nuclear Bomb and a hostile Iranian attitude that swears to the destruction of Israel), surely the House will collapse.</span><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It is just regrettable what is going on there. It is just another mark on what is an ongoing cycle of violence brought about by an ongoing cycle of events. I believe the most immediate solution is the creation of a peace kepping force to the region, to serve as a buffer between Israel and the Palestinians and the Lebs. It is essential that the world does not allow this proxy war to result in full scale confrontation between Israel and what are the real players in this poker game - the Syrians and the Iranians. With the state the global economy is right now, a war would sky rocket the price of oil, and bring the world to the brink of yet another global reccession.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>uhh... one more thing:<br><br>"The Palestinian people does not exist. The creation of a Palestinian state is only a means for continuing our struggle against the state of Israel for our Arab unity. In reality today there is no difference between Jordanians, Palestinians, Syrians and Lebanese. Only for political and tactical reasons do we speak today about the existence of a Palestinian people, since Arab national interests demand that we posit the existence of a distinct 'Palestinian people' to oppose Zionism.<br><br>"For tactical reasons, Jordan, which is a sovereign state with defined borders, cannot raise claims to Haifa and Jaffa. While as a Palestinian, I can undoubtedly demand Haifa, Jaffa, Beer-Sheva and Jerusalem.

            <div class='col-md body'>Look at it this way: Israel is a marked nation the moment it was created. It is not a war between nations. It is a war between religions, and beliefs. Zionists vs Muslims. Israel has no choice but to act the way it is acting now. When the Arab nations waged wars against Israel in the past, weren't they wrong? Let's face it, they do not want a non-Arab nation in the Middle East. Israel had to strike to defend its own integrity.</div>
