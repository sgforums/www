              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Monday, 21 September 2009, 3:19 pm | 1,662 views </span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Gilbert Goh<br></strong> </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">It must be tough for the authorities to figure out a sustainable manpower deployment strategy when it comes to the complex issue of aiding local businesses to make profits through the hiring of foreign workers.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">Not only is this a time bomb for social cohesion but also a serious political issue in view of the coming General Election. The government has failed to convince the nation that having so many foreign workers in our midst has really “added spices” positively.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">Without empathy for jobless and desperate citizens, it would be very difficult to understand why foreigners are seen more as job snatcher than anything else.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">In 2008, foreign non-residents (non-PR, non-Singaporean) account for 1.2M people of the entire population. These foreigners snatch popular jobs such as clerks, receptionists, administrators and salesmen. Their actions only affirm the perception that foreign labour in Singapore is hardly foreign talent. </span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">Employers also prefer to hire foreigners, as they are cheaper and more willing to put in extra hours without grumbling. To a foreigner from a third world country, living and working in Singapore is almost a Godsend.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">Many foreigners also found work in the coffee shops and factories. Surprisingly, these workers are also given Permanent Resident (PR) status after a while. A S-Pass worker can apply for PR status after one year and normally it will be granted within month of the application. After two years, he will offered a Singapore citizenship.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">R-Pass holders earn below $1,800 a month and are not eligible for PR status. R-Pass holders include construction workers, domestic workers, shipyard workers and many who work in the conservancy and landscaping sector. Due to quota on R-Pass workers, some errant employers may “pass off” a R-Pass-qualified worker as a S-Pass one without paying the minimum $1800/month salary.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">As many as 200,000 able-Singaporeans have left the country in recent years and not many are considering to return in the near future. A recent survey suggested that 79% of overseas Singaporean students prefer to work abroad than to return to Singapore. More are expected to leave the country in the near future. </span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">To balance out the population exodus, the Government allows companies to import foreigners from neighbouring countries such as China and India without upsetting the racial proportion. </span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">Singaporeans find it difficult to comprehend the Government’s lax foreign labour policy. Some have eventually migrated to other countries in anger that they were replaced by foreign substitutes. They further question whether their loyalty for their country is ever reciprocated at all when there is no protection whatever on their livelihood.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">It is hardly surprising that economics is the motivation behind Singaporean workers to shun many opportunities in the service sector. Such jobs pay close to S$1000 a month and after CPF deduction, take home pay is reduced to a puny sum of S$800 a month.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">If the worker is the sole breadwinner of a family of four, the sum remains insufficient even if top-up from the Workfare Income Supplement Scheme (WISS) is included. WISS tops up a low-wage worker’s salary to the tune of $1,200 a year. To qualify, the Singaporean worker must be at least 35-year-old and earns a montly salary less than $1,500.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">On the other hand, employers in labour intensive industries need to re-evaluate if it is still feasible to hire cheap labour. In recent times, many small cleaning companies mushroomed all over Singapore that bidding for cleaning projects has dropped so low that these companies cannot afford to pay their employees a decent salary without suffering a loss.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">The authorities may need to re-look into their policy on government contractual bidding for cleaning projects to impact this particular industry sector. Moreover, dependence on labour intensive industries also works contrary against Singapore’s high-falutin aspiration to be a highly industrialised and knowledge-based economy.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">In Australia, many blue-collared jobs offered a chance for many locals to earn a decent wage. </span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">For example, the construction sector mostly hires local Aussies and very often, even an apprentice is paid a salary of S$3000 a month before taxes. The implementation of minimum wage policy and skills training courses have allow local workers to be adequately compensated for the menial work performed.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">Blue collared workers can command as much salaries as any white collared ones due to the niche skills that such jobs required and also many Aussies shun these jobs due to its harsh working environment. Unlike Singapore, there is no easy back door to hiring undervalued foreign workers in Australia.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">Local employers should increasingly look at semi-automating their work flow to lessen their dependence on undervalued foreign labour. I have seen how a team of twenty Indian foreign workers line the road during road works in our country with half practically standing around doing nothing.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">This is not the best way to deploy manpower even if they come cheaply. In Australia, even the driver of the garbage collection vehicle assists in the daily garbage collection task. And there are 2 additional person in labour team. It is all very professionally done with minimal human efforts.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Singapore cannot afford to contnue its dependence on undervalued labour to advance the economy. More can be done to streamline our operations in order to boost our efficiency. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Local workers can then be better compensated when they take on better-valued jobs. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Productivity is also raised in the process.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">The current dependence on foreign labour will not bear fruit if we want to advance our economy . Not only will it bring forth social unrest but it will seriously jeopardise the employment opportunities of the local work force.</span></p>

              <p> Is it not obvious for a Taiwanese 'hum' when asked to return to Taiwan - that you will be finished in Singapore ?</p>
              <p>It has always been a risk to be over dependent on foreigners - why should locals get addicted to Taiwanese 'hum' which will later jack-up their self-worth at the expense of the locals developing a taste and having to pay an artificially high price to get back the Taiwan 'hum' ?</p>

              <p>Obviously, the Taiwanese 'hum' will want those cheaper labor working in the Marine, Construction and other physical jobs, as all these are the ones to boost the Taiwan 'hum' Bar business.</p>
              <p>Is it any surprise that the Taiwan 'hum' will also appreciate the foreign maids - as they provide the part-time lady GRO services on their off-days at the Taiwan 'hum' Bar ?</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p> Is it not obvious for a Taiwanese 'hum' when asked to return to Taiwan - that you will be finished in Singapore ?</p>
              <p>It has always been a risk to be over dependent on foreigners - why should locals get addicted to Taiwanese 'hum' which will later jack-up their self-worth at the expense of the locals developing a taste and having to pay an artificially high price to get back the Taiwan 'hum' ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Obviously, the Taiwanese 'hum' will want those cheaper labor working in the Marine, Construction and other physical jobs, as all these are the ones to boost the Taiwan 'hum' Bar business.</p>
              <p>Is it any surprise that the Taiwan 'hum' will also appreciate the foreign maids - as they provide the part-time lady GRO services on their off-days at the Taiwan 'hum' Bar ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> The difference between a PR Taiwan 'hum' and a sandwich is just the base material - where the 'hum' has a hard shell, while the sandwich has a soft bread - and both open up one side only.</p>
              <p>Is the PR Taiwan 'hum' admitting to be useless even as it attempt to be a Pro in SG ?</p>
              <p>Which Singaporeans have bought their certificates, or is the Taiwan 'hum' admitting that it is a common practise to purchase certificates in Taiwan ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>How many business expatriates do you know are in Singapore to be so confident in your claim that they "dun constitute alots" ?</p>
              <p>How many of these "business expatriate are rich class and invest here" ?</p>
              <p>If you are here only to regurgitate statements that are drummed into your brain, you are simply wasting your time here.</p>
              <p>Does anyone need a Taiwan 'hum' to remind Singaporeans of our own nightmare ? </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Taiwan 'hum' may need the foreign "physical strength" - what does it know about Singapore's physical strength ?</p>
              <p>Economy wise, it will be better for these expatriates - with a colonial mentality - to go.</p>
              <p>Population wise - it will be a relief when all the foreingers do finally go, as they are already inflating the numbers and the costs of living.</p>
              <p>Is Taiwan poorer than Singapore - that led the Taiwan 'hum' to migrate over  too ?</p>
              <p>It is pathecticall obvious that the 'hum' from Taiwan will advocate for more "toms and dicks to come into Singapore</p>

              <p>Job A - Hard Labour $1,000/month.</p>
              <p>No one wants to work, construction firm authorised to hire from China/India. Accepted.</p>
              <p>Job B - Regular Sales Job, $1,500/month</p>
              <p>Singaporean A asks for $1,400 but isn't hired because company hired someone from China/India for $1,000/month with a lousy degree.</p>
              <p>Would you accept this? Don't tell me make do with it, if you were Singaporean A, let's say fresh Dip/ITE/A graduate with no where else to go, Would you take $1,000/month and you need to pay for your own bills and stuff?</p>
              <p>Let's say you still bum out staying with your parents so you don't need to worry about rents, hmm let's see..</p>
              <p>Transportation - 6 days about $4 per day comes up to $24, 4 weeks come to $96</p>
              <p>Food - $12 per day if you eat cheaply, 30 days about $360</p>
              <p>That's already $456 gone means you have left with $544, unless you're a real bum I don't think you want to stay with your parents the rest of your life?</p>
              <p>Savings $200 gone, down to $344.</p>
              <p>If you're a big ungrateful unfillial child, would you not give your parents any allowance? Considering your low paying job, $200 for both might be just nice. $144 left.</p>
              <p>Unless you are a zombie with no life, I don't think $144 for entertainment can be sufficient. Don't tell me it's sufficient or live within your means when reality, you wouldn't</p>
