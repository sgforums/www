Subsequent Forum letters also raised the matter of how the return on CPF funds is calculated, and what constitutes a fair return.<br><br>The interest members receive for their CPF money should reflect what they could earn by investing in the financial markets, in investments which have comparable risk and duration. All CPF balances are guaranteed by the Government and hence free of risk. Hence the Special, Medisave and Retirement Account (SMRA) interest rates will now be pegged to long-term government-bond yields. Furthermore, the first $60,000 of each person's CPF balances, to be held for the long term, will attract an extra 1 percentage point in interest. This means that they will always earn at least 3.5 per cent interest.<br><br>No commercial bank or fund manager offers more generous terms on such investments. Members seeking higher returns can take out their funds to invest through the CPF Investment Scheme (CPFIS). However, 83 per cent of CPF members who invested their OA savings in the CPFIS from 2002 to 2006 realised less than 2.5 per cent returns - the base rate of the OA. Half of all members who invested experienced negative returns, losing some part of their capital sum.<br><br>The CPF Board invests members' savings in special securities issued by the Government, which pay the CPF Board the same interest rates that its members receive. The Government pools the proceeds from issuing these securities with the rest of its funds, and invests them professionally for long-term returns. This is completely de-linked from the CPF Board and CPF members. Were this not so, CPF members would be exposed to the investment risks and could not receive guaranteed minimum interest rates.<br><br>Up to now, both GIC and Temasek Holdings have earned returns that exceeded CPF interest rates, on average over the years. But this does not mean that the Government is making use of the CPF as a 'cheap source of funds', or earning a 'spread at people's expense'.<br><br>First, the Government does not need more funds to invest. Even if it did, it could raise funds more cheaply by issuing treasury bills and government securities, instead of using CPF funds.<br><br>Second, Temasek and GIC achieve higher returns on average only by taking on more investment risks. Hence these returns are volatile - they can be low or even negative in some years. Furthermore, we cannot assume that GIC and Temasek will do as well in future. The past two decades have been an exceptional period for global financial markets. Looking ahead, we cannot rule out protracted market downturns, lasting several years. Most CPF members have small balances and will not welcome these risks. Neither will older members waiting to withdraw their retirement funds.<br><br>Third, Singaporeans benefit when GIC and Temasek investments do well. Every year, the Government draws part of these investment returns to fund the annual Budget. The revenue is spent on worthwhile investments and social needs, including subsidies for housing, education and health care. And from time to time, the Government distributes accumulated budget surpluses to citizens through CPF top-ups and other schemes.<br><br>The Government does not rule out the possibility of introducing private pension plans for those with balances above $60,000 and a higher capacity to take risk. However, it would be unwise for members with low balances to take excessive risks on their basic retirement savings.<br><br>The current arrangement thus enables all CPF members to earn fair and risk-free returns on their retirement savings, while benefiting from the good performance of GIC and Temasek through the annual Budget. This is the right way to help Singaporeans save for their old age, and enjoy peace of mind in their golden years.<br><br>Jacqueline Poh (Ms)<br>Director (Special Duties)<br>Ministry of Finance</blockquote></div>

Members seeking higher returns can take out their funds to invest through the CPF Investment Scheme (CPFIS). However, 83 per cent of CPF members who invested their OA savings in the CPFIS from 2002 to 2006 realised less than 2.5 per cent returns - the base rate of the OA. Half of all members who invested experienced negative returns, losing some part of their capital sum.</blockquote>What is the probability that one could lose money in such a strong bull market over the recent years? I think they have made used of the word Â“realizedÂ” i.e. members who sell their investments may have achieved bad returns. Most CPF members who invested in equities have probably enjoyed good Â“unrealized returnsÂ”. Is it a case of using selective data to advance their arguments?<br><br><blockquote><br>First, the Government does not need more funds to invest. Even if it did, it could raise funds more cheaply by issuing treasury bills and government securities, instead of using CPF funds.</blockquote>Can the govt raise $70 Billion without spiking the interest rate? It would be easy to borrow $1 or 2 billion without giving higher yields. We are taking about $70 billions of funds. It would eventually reach a point where there are no takers for the low interest bonds and interest rates have to be raised to attract more funds.Singaporeans are not going to sell their stocks or homes to just to earn the current low measly bond rates.<br></div>

Why is the govt willing to believe a group people who would not be disciplined to save without being forced, would make good retirement plans and achieve good returns?

It is like saying,"Here I have given you these benefits, you should be content with it." The term "entitlement" is surely an SAF term, where soldiers are taught not to take benefits for granted. This however, runs very differently where a country accountable to her stakeholders (well, the citizens) are concerned.<br><br>Hence your statement of "entitlement" is true but only to a limited extent.<br><br>Regarding the 16% CPF contribution by employers, should we be thankful to the govt when all the money eventually comes from employers and in the civil service's case, money from Singaporeans?<br><br>Yes we should be thankful that the govt has planned the scheme this way but should we be blindly grateful for eternity then?
