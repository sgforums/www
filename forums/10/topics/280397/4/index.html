Government will contribute in his lifetime through <strong>subsidised housing(?)</strong>, and now through the <span style="font-style: italic;">various incentives</span> - <strong>Workfare, the WIS Scheme, plus all the cash top ups(?) </strong>that take place from time to time."<br><br>Mr Mah adds that, on its part, the Government has over the years <strong>helped build up Singaporeans' nest egg(?)</strong>, and <strong>helping them acquire their biggest asset</strong> which is to buy their own flats<strong> through subsidised housing.(?)</strong><br><br>The proposed <strong>lease buy-back scheme </strong>is another way in which the Government <strong>hopes(?)</strong> to offer Singaporeans <strong>a steady retirement income(?)</strong>.<br><br><strong>He says: "The scheme will also have a connection to the CPF Longevity Insurance Scheme. Because one part of the lease buy-back scheme will also involve a Longevity Insurance. So I want to ride on the Scheme that will be finalised by the CPF Board. The house is a very very major asset. But once you're able to unlock it, people will realise that it'll also contribute significantly to their retirement. (?)</strong><br><br>"<strong>It will not be totally adequate(?)</strong> because obviously there has to be <strong>other schemes(?) </strong>in place as well. This is why I <strong>hope(?)</strong> that the <strong>lease buy-back </strong>scheme, plus the <strong>CPF minimum sum </strong>scheme, together will ensure that there's <strong>adequacy in retirement(?)</strong>."<br><br>Mr Mah says the lease buy-back scheme will be <strong>an attractive one offering various options catering to differing needs.(?)</strong><br><br>Residents could continue to live in the flat <strong>without disruption to their lives(?)</strong>.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Mr Mah says: "The Lease Buy-Back Scheme will consist of three components. On the upfront, a cash component. Second component which pays a certain sum of money up to a certain age. And a third component which is an insurance component which pays a certain sum of money after that age.<br><br>"And so if, for example, that age is 85 - if you live beyond age 85, you will be assured of a payment after 85. Before age 85, you'll be assured of a payment from the second component." </span>The scheme has three components and the exact amounts will be finalised early next year.<br><br>Mr Mah also launched the North East CommunIty CONnectors Network which aims to equip the elderly with Life Needs, Life Skills and Life Style. - CNA/ch<br></div>

Well, I'm only 18 this year but I feel that this will affect my future someway or another.</div></blockquote>Besides understanding how annuity works it is also important that you know what it means for CPF members which you would eventually become one once you starting working for others. From NMP Siew Kum Hong's blog:<br><br>27. But for present purposes, it is worth discussing what a compulsory annuity would mean for CPF members. It represents an unprecedented inroad into members' ownership rights over their CPF funds. Prior to this, members have been restricted in what they can do with their funds, but they are not forced to spend on anything. Schemes like MediShield, ElderShield, the Dependent Protection Scheme and the Home Protection Scheme are all optional, although some are opt-out.<br><br>28. The compulsory annuity, even if limited to some but not all members, would be a very different animal. Members will be compelled to purchase an annuity, from which they may get nothing.<br><br></div>

Plain and simple.<br><br></div></blockquote>Correct. i think NMP Siew Kum Hong said it very well:<br><br>30. All this represents a sea-change in the nature of CPF members' rights over their CPF balances. It means that CPF members do not really own their CPF funds, because the Government is able and willing to impose policies to compel members to use their funds in a certain way, even against their strongly-expressed wishes.<br><br>31. This week, it is a compulsory annuity. But if we take that first step, will it prove to be a slippery slope of encroachment onto CPF members' rights? What will it be next week, next year, next decade? An increase in the annuity amount? Some other compulsory scheme?</div>
