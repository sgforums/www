            <div class='col-md body'>I don't think it's that simple.    I really feel that they think they are doing good, that they think they deserve every cent of their pay and more.<br><br>This is actually more dangerous.<br><br>The PAP have been in power so long, controlling the media, the courts, etc, that they actually believe that they are as good and infallable as the make the local papers and radio say that they are.<br><br>With the amount of tax payers monies they pay themselves each month, they put themselves outside our day to day problems.  They are no longer in touch with the people they are suppose to govern.   I feel this puts their ability to effectively govern us in question.<br><br>With their current structure, we are no longer, "One nation, one people".   We have become masters and slaves.<br><br>Someone posted this on Reach (have to paraphrase here cause they removed that topic already):<br><br>"This is a sign that they have been in power for much too long.   Another benchmark in the PAP reign.<br><br>1. Banning chewing gun.  To a simple mind it is only gum, but think of the power you wield to ban something like that.<br><br>2. Their ridiculous paycheques.  Second stage, abuse of power for personal gain.<br><br>3. Forced annuity.  Now they are taking liberties with my personal monies.<br><br>What is alarming is that they do not even question their right to my personal finances.  They have already taken it forgranted that they have every right to my personal monies and finances."<br><br>So I totally agree that it's time to remove them, but not for the reasons you state.<br><br>For the good of Singapore, it's time to vote in a government who can look at us as a country with living breathing people in it, rather than a business entity with cash cows to make their bank balances look good while we ourselves are stretched to breaking point.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by qlqq9:</div><div class="quote_body">They will never put themselves in the positions of the common folks and they will never change for the better.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by mancha:<br><strong>The problem lies in the mindset of the PAP, who think "subsidy and welfare" are sacrilegious.<br><br>People who live till 85 years old should be [b]rewarded</strong> by the government, with monthly cash grant.<br><br>The present system of draw down with the retirement fund will serve almost all Singaporeans, as most will not outlast their cash. Only the present old folks may not have enough savings, but the young now are building up their savings, and will have more than sufficient when they get are old. The percentage point increase in interest rate is of much help. Majority of them too will not outlast their retirement fund.<br><br>Therefore it would make sense to "reward" those who lived past 85 years old, and have run out of cash/assets/family support. Also of those few who reached 85 years, all of them could terminate at any moment. Just a matter of tomorrow, next week, or very soon. Therefore the payout would not be catastropic. Our nation can afford it. Our people would agree to it.<br><br>In the present system, housewives are left out of the equation. They are deemed as unemployed, without a CPF account, therefore no savings and no retirement fund. Their best bet is to outlive their husband and inherit his CPF money.<br>Housewifes infact serve the most important of social functions, that of homemaker and mother to the future generation.<br><br>Each and everyone must work and save, and welfare is a dirty word, that mindset must change.[/b]</blockquote>LHL has many times stated clearly that he is not giving welfare - not making Singapore a welfare state.  ON the contrary, ng eng hen said that gahmen is not shirking responsibility.<br><br>The selfish, self-centred gahmen depend the nation for their world class salary, benefits, pension and so on and on, on the other hand they don't want us to rely on them.  Isn't this ironic?  If they don't want us to rely on them why depend on us for votes for them?<br><br>Whatever they are doing and planning to do benefit themselves but do little or no benefits to the nation at all.</div>
