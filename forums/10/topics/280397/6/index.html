This too will change.<br><br>It will be replaced with the return on 10-year Singapore Government Securities plus one percentage point.<br><br>However, for the next two years, the Government has assured CPF members that these accounts will get at least 4 per cent.<br><br>The other changes are: CPF members will, over time, get the monthly Minimum Sum payouts only at age 65, not the current 62; and they must buy a longevity insurance that will give them a monthly sum at age 85 until they die.<br><br>The changes are to bolster Singaporeans' retirement savings and ensure they have enough for their old age.<br><br>But the last two measures - the delay in the Minimum Sum payout and the compulsory longevity insurance - have caused concern.<br><br>Dr Ng acknowledged that most people are not sure if they would live that long.<br><br>They also worry about the cost of the longevity insurance or annuity, despite Government assurance it will be a small part of their Retirement Account.<br><br>To allay their fears, he has asked the committee looking at how best to introduce annuities to 'seriously consider' giving people the option to decide whether to get their insurance payout earlier or later.<br><br>It is almost three weeks since Dr Ng announced the CPF changes on Sept 19.<br><br>While he feels there is 'general acceptance' of them among Singaporeans - whom he says are 'very sensible people' - there is one thing he would have done differently.<br><br>He would put in 'bold print' the link between the extra one percentage point interest and annuities, and that the extra CPF people get will be more than enough to pay for the longevity insurance.<br><br>This approach would have satisfied nine out of 10 Singaporeans, who 'trust the Government to take care of them, and prefer more reassurance than explanation'.<br><br>This message was in Dr Ng's speech, but it came after he had painstakingly laid out the rationale, details and consequences of the changes.<br><br>Said Dr Ng: 'We were trying to be pure and we were trying to explain to them that we were changing the interest rate system and how it was being done.'<br><br>This explanatory approach is preferred by the other 10 per cent who want to be 'involved in the process'.<br><br>Both approaches are necessary, he said, adding that the exercise was a learning experience.

            <div class='col-md body'>Guys and Gals,<br><br>I suspect the MAJORITY (I may be one of them  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> ) are appreciating the marvellous things and policies being implemented to their hard-earned  CPF money such that there is no complain from them by way of petition. At least not in any obvious manner whatsoever.<br><br>Silence means Acceptance has been signed-off ? I think.<br><br>We thus cannot even say that the <strong>MAJORITY is APATHETIC</strong>. How can they be when its their hard-earned blood and sweat money earned over long periods of time (major part of their living hours at least 70%) that is being 'good goodly' affected by the changes in the policies?  I really think the MAJORITY  (maybe me included  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> ) should identify the great talent that came up with this idea and world class bombastic solution (that is solid until the cannot solid the anymore already liao lor) and thank him or her (nowadays , you never know. Many women talents hor) with the bottoms of our bottomest bottom heart .<br><br><strong>So, I feel that the MAJORITY has once again endorsed the changes and ACCEPT it as good for them</strong>.   When they die &lt;85, their remaining money goes to a pool not taken out at their time of death, which is inevitable, for one and all , regardless of any ding dong. no matter how power you are the ful. Without this MAJORITY (maybe me included  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> ) how can the rulers be the rulers?<br></div>
