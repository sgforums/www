In fact, there have been more frequent articles in the papers on young &amp; generally healthy individuals dropping dead or simply dying while sleeping.<br><br>Where are the stats that SPECIFICALLY proves, that the current &amp; newer generations will &amp; are going to live a longer life?<br><br>Logically, when CPF first began, &amp; when they (PAP) started building our Nation, didn't they factored in the likeliness of an ageing population?
