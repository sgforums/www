While many Chinese people have learned through various costs of the basic common sense, there are often intended to have no intention to stay in the mind of a back door, a new light on Singapore, how much a little emotional, almost to regard it as a distant relative. Many Chinese people a kind of vague feeling that Jews around the world toward the Jews, and that the Chinese should also have the whole world toward the Chinese.</div>
              <div dir="ltr"> </div>
              <div dir="ltr">Singapore is predominantly Chinese country, with China without borders, no conflict of interest. The past, China to seek "extreme left", "export revolution" has affected the relations between the two countries is not difficult to understand. Now China does not "class struggle as the key link", and go all out to engage in economic reform and opening up welcome foreign investment, with China, while Singapore has also adopted the same language and Simplified Chinese characters, it should be not only familiar with Western and familiar in China, of course, "China's reform and opening up and economic development of the beneficiary, so they unwittingly put Singapore as a friend in Singapore has always been tolerated no longer tolerate, preferential re-discount. Since the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries in trade, investment and regardless of the amount of substantial growth, China has also through the hiring of Singapore prominent figure when the Chinese national policy advisor to the cross-strait "Wang - Koo" meeting place of the election in Singapore, Singapore, etc. to the full face; more in the Southeast Asian financial crisis at their own disadvantage, persist in not devaluing the renminbi, to help Southeast Asian countries and stable currency and thus direct assistance at critical moments in Singapore. you know, the financial industry is one of the pillar industries in Singapore. sacrifice their own financial stability in China, Singapore, the largest gains.</div>
              <div dir="ltr"> </div>
              <div dir="ltr">China has done in Singapore has gone beyond common sense in international relations "will never sacrifice their own interests for others," the basic principles of treatment of the Singapore as a friend. What about Singapore is how to deal with China? - Singapore has long claimed that he want to be the last one in Southeast Asia countries to establish diplomatic relations with China, even after establishment of diplomatic relations with Taiwan to maintain its military cooperation. And his word. <br><br>- Lee Kuan Yew, Goh Chok Tong's speech on various occasions that China's growth have rattle the world's biggest challenges in the future stability in Asia depends on how to deal with the rise of China to the group. Lee also said that as a descendant of the Chinese people, he knows a strong endurance of the Chinese people, but know that the Chinese people are also very explosive and very vengeful. East and Southeast Asian countries had to sin in the history of China. Once China becomes powerful, these countries inevitably met with China's violent retaliation, it must let the Chinese always be second-rate country.</div>
              <div dir="ltr"><br>- Singapore has been pushing the United States is an important balancing force in Southeast Asia (balanced Who?) After the U.S. withdrawal from bases in the Philippines, Singapore, immediately raised the U.S. military can supply in Singapore, and now Singapore has become the only U.S. military foothold in Southeast Asia. - China first proposed and the ASEAN cooperation. Singapore to balance China's power and vigorously promoted India - ASEAN cooperation. India would have no place in Southeast Asia are Singapore, come in dead lift. Singapore is in Southeast Asia and India, the first joint military exercises countries. Time is 2000, when India's nuclear test is still in a short time in isolation. India's nuclear tests, nuclear tests by India Association of Southeast Asian Nations not only did not condemn, but to give tacit approval or support. Of which played an important role in Singapore. Indian Foreign Minister's nuclear test is the first visit to ASEAN countries, Singapore. - In China and the ASEAN Free Trade Association in the process of the ASEAN countries, Singapore is always a reminder to be united, to note that China is a competitor himself and so on.</div>
              <div dir="ltr"><br>- Chinese people in Singapore and discrimination were common occurrences. Chinese women athletes to the Singapore Tourism collectively store owner was an insult for no reason, Singapore newspaper public opinion against a "customer is God", "customer is always right" business principle, wantonly degrading, mocking the Chinese, for that rogue shopkeepers defense.</div>
              <div dir="ltr"><br>... ... Have gone through a "FD" (SARS) scourge of fact, China should be grateful to Singapore Cai Dui. Because, first, it helps a lot of Chinese people are clear on one basic question: Who are the enemies of China, who is a friend of China; to second, the basic knowledge of international relations make up lesson lessons from dealing with people, understand What is to be mindful of what is must not be taken seriously and what should be understood from the negative side; third-, to help China get rid of a big burden since then can concentrate on only for China's own interests and no longer hesitant to indecisive. Through the "FD" (SARS) disaster, the Chinese people of Singapore for at least Triple conclusion can be drawn: one is not a thing, two malicious, Triple not polite. All of these are the "FD" (SARS) occurred before the outbreak of The thing is that many Chinese people have relatives and friends in Singapore as the critical moment, when you come forward to help people ride out the storm happened. When China suffered "FD" (SARS) when the disaster, Singapore has done?</div>
              <div dir="ltr"><br>- April 6 to respond to Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong, the Washington Post "blocking China," the call, simply refuse to visit China. "Lianhe Zaobao" Forum, proudly said, "Goh Chok Tong, the move to be praised and welcomed by Southeast Asian countries." - May 2, when Goh Chok Tong, interviews to the media openly questioned China's ability to control SARS, claiming that China will spend 2 to 3 years to control SARS, in the meantime, foreign investment should be withdrawing from the Chinese should not be "all their eggs in one basket. " - Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit in anti-SARS begins with China, Singapore proposed that it is ASEAN's own meetings, no need to please others. Goh Chok Tong said after the triumphant spread to other ASEAN countries leaders to see his attitude was his refusal to take the lead in China's proposal, Southeast Asian countries like they are heroic. Singapore, these actions are not simply unfriendly, nor is it insignificant gesture, but a very vicious intentional injury, is Chenrenzhiwei added insult to injury in an attempt to stroke home the Chinese deadly hostilities. Because the goal of the consequences of these actions are: one, lifting sdf starting a new global anti-China wave, re-blocked in China, the complete destruction of China's reform and opening up and developing economic environment. Second, the mobilization of foreign investors withdrawing from the Chinese, the Chinese economy as large as possible the difficulties, to push for Chinese economic collapse. Triple and undermine China's people toward the Chinese go-vern-ment disaster the country's confidence and let the Chinese go-vern-ment of the command did not work, resulting in Chinese society, as did the total collapse of the former Soviet Union.</div>
              <div dir="ltr"><br>Essential to stabilize the situation in China today, some people can say such judgments are alarmist, is making a fuss, is nonsense, and so on. But do not forget, precisely because Singapore is predominantly Chinese country, precisely because China has always regarded Singapore as a friend, in the eyes of many people in Singapore a better understanding of the situation in China, more objective and non-biased, more authoritative. Therefore, Singapore's attitude toward China in many countries a greater impact. When disaster sudden panic overwhelmed when a rumor is enough to kill, just like the stock market crisis a little sign of trouble was enough for the stock market collapse, and made the same as the strength of people who go bankrupt. Similarly, in the sudden outbreak of SARS crisis, many countries around the world not to take prospective measures, are hesitant when the Singapore took the lead in a high-profile anti-China take the lead in the blockade of China, its influence is far more than usual, but also far beyond its strength, it seems " a top-10000 "in posture. If it is not Chinese go-vern-ment decision and to take decisive measures to stabilize the ground, if not to unite the Chinese people rose up disaster be effective, if not the Chinese people through their own efforts under control of the situation, if the international community really think that China is already crumbling , then there will certainly be a large group of speculators herd echoed the call of Singapore, that Singapore's SARS crisis in one fell swoop using the goal of bring down the Chinese really possible. Singapore at a critical moment, the critical key to the direction of China's knife stab, a fact that is absolutely true, no doubt. The reason why China did not ***, not because Singapore's mercy, not because Singapore is not fine art knife, simply because the Chinese go-vern-ment and the Chinese people's strength, strong and united efforts beyond Singapore's expected, and therefore not be able to succeed. Now Singapore Jianshibumiao, desperately trying to pull themselves back lick the feces, so the mobilization of a variety of instrument of public opinion which insists that the crucial moment of the eyeful Xiongguang interpreted as a look of tenderness. No wonder it is a time of overwhelming the backside of the article, what "Singapore is an independent sovereign state, there is no need to consider the interests of China", "no ill will," "The primary had to be so," "the rule of law, so that a line must be , "" has always been friendly to China, "" are the Chinese national, not demanding "(strange, when Singapore was under the knife to the Chinese how even when the group of people are letting go a fart, which will be remembered" with a Chinese "to the ), and some even falsely accuse the Chinese also took the opportunity, but also take "freedom and democracy" and other similar accusations against China, such as "I have argued for Singapore," "Why should we punish Singapore", "China should reflect on themselves" and so on. (Attempted murder is also a plausible explanation and is really nerve thicker than the bottom, the bullet had not hit the first thorough.) At the same time not forgetting the things that little tricks to fool people. Similarly, an anti-example, in the ASEAN SARS summit meeting with Chinese Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong jiabao.wen news on the Chinese-language newspapers in Singapore reports that Mr Goh Chok Tong's visit to China for the lifting of explanation and apology, no mention was made in the English newspapers regarding an apology. The surface, let the Chinese people see this feel a little better, but in fact there is no the slightest sense, because English is the official language of Singapore's real.</div>
              <div dir="ltr"><br>Singapore Zhefan performances by the Chinese people feast for the eyes, from beginning to end I watched a drama of civilization in international relations, from the tread to the fawning, from the good deed goes unpunished to Sipilailian, from the audacity to play the fool charge leng really human gestos everything evil. This teaches people how to watch others live materials are usually money can not buy. Relying on this, the Chinese people also thank the good of Singapore. Many Chinese people still do not understand: Why Singapore should be an anti-China? What are they going to offend China, where it it? (I am afraid that that year the American Indians have had similar doubts: Why are these white people to kill Indians, and even surrendered were spared? What offended the Indians in the end of it? This is hardly surprising, Indians probably do not know what "banditry.") which is full of oriental philosophy, people's minds do not understand Western philosophy to pursue the conduct of persons in key. Do you think not offend, not offensive, in respect of goodwill, peace and harmony in the real world happens not eat you employ this strategy.</div>
              <div dir="ltr"><br>Southeast Asian countries have their own long history, tradition and culture, with the exception of Singapore exceptions. It was originally not a country but a part of Malaya, Malaya because of anti-Chinese relations Yi Jiaochuai out. Although the ethnic Chinese majority, but the identity of Chinese traditional Chinese culture has always been the bottom, the state's "ruling elite" had no not received full well the United Kingdom and the West elite education, "Higher Chinese." These people are the so-called "yellow banana" - yellow white heart, though long a Chinese sample, the most eye-it actually look down on Chinese culture and Chinese people, the most line is none other than the white tails wagging, to the Chinese Deng Yanjing. (This is with the Chinese gang "XXXX elite" considered as half - one speaks of.) Therefore, although the Chinese majority, the mainstream thinking of what it is hybrid, neither fish nor fowl, the result that the place has not only failed to resources, but no history, no tradition, nor cultural characteristics, the whole a man-made hybrid monster. Geek geek go, people have inherited the spirit of the British Empire, but the spirit of superiority, never forget that year his control of the British Empire was once the largest military bases in Asia. At that time although it must be respectful of the whites, but Asian countries can boast of all "natives", that is what scenery. But only for the decline of the British Empire, and Singapore also followed the scenery is gone, but another way of living. When China's economic rise, before Singapore was "not in the mountains tiger, monkey king said," the financial industry, export processing industry, tourism, shipping industry is on the table got become Asia's "a little dragons," life's pretty scenery. However, as China's economic rise, Singapore's ability to that point soon after the house would not work.</div>
              <div dir="ltr"><br>Other Southeast Asian countries because each has its own history, tradition and resources, so with the Chinese economy have their complementarity, the face of China's economic rise are able to both see the challenges they see an opportunity to adapt to them had not much difficulty. While Singapore is different. China sooner or later you are capable and competent, but sooner or later, do better than you. Use the same language, the same advantages of Western China's economic development in the wind to catch the common prosperity of Singapore, the ship would not be difficult, but this one in Singapore would have to lay down two foul Explorer shelves, and truly the most psychologically equal treatment of the original look down on China people. As for the contempt of the Chinese people are accustomed to these "elite" who run it comparable to their lives as worse. Lee Kuan Yew on the need for China to always be second-rate countries, saying only true expression of Singapore's ruling "elite" who his ideal goal (China is the second-rate and Singapore are world class, superior). No wonder so many countries in Southeast Asia, except Singapore, shouting "China threat" theory of the most energetically. No wonder the city was so energetically they want Western naval powers invited back to their bases by offering to re-dawdle. (Really ** from the good, not forgetting the Bank.), But only under the situation of the United States against the United States finally agreed to defray the maintenance of military bases in Singapore. Therefore, fear of China, Singapore is actually the world into chaos, never forget exacerbate the tensions around China, it was a moment please, the U.S. military to, while pulling the Indian army, the emergency had nothing to call out a pass China threat theory, the purpose is simply to increase their own military bases in worth.</div>
              <div dir="ltr"><br>In short, Singapore's prosperity is built on the past, China's poverty and backwardness, a sign of weakness of the foundation. The rise of China broke the interests of these vested interests, and they refused to adapt to the situation, put themselves into a vested interest in the prosperity of China, it is necessary to try to stop, destruction, or at least slow down the rise of China. This is such a vicious anti-Chinese in Singapore the most fundamental causes. It is not with the Chinese, Debu offend irrelevant. Damage from Singapore, China should also have to give the necessary time to fight back properly, must not be soft, but can not be soft-hearted. The reason is very simple, because it conforms to China's national interests, and does not charge the number of air power, easy to do rational, helpful, with restraint.<br><br>First of all have to recognize that China's hostility in Singapore out of fundamental conflicts of interest, unless the Chinese voluntary subjugation of bankruptcy, or Singapore can never satisfied. That is, the tree wants calm, but the wind will not subside, the Chinese want to avoid is also inevitable.</div>
              <div dir="ltr"><br>Second, we should understand that the destruction of laissez-faire attitude to Singapore a great danger because of its impact is far more than in Singapore itself. Singapore has always been triumphant trumpet leaders of other ASEAN countries of Singapore's attitude to China to determine their own policy toward China. If this argument is true, then prove that anti-China forces in Southeast Asia, Singapore is at least the roots, back to Singapore can quell these anti-reflux. If this argument is false, then to say that Singapore is "held hostage P Eye upstairs - Self-self-lift." Of this charlatan must be thoroughly stripped of his deception of the capital, lest someone else cheated. People think that China regards Singapore as a friend, that Singapore can work with this anti-China with impunity in Singapore is a trickster's largest capital. You do not fight back, it will be Singapore's stupid idea it was believed that this danger is even greater in China. In this world is a villain in power, not only has never been good deed goes unpunished, but also special position of vulnerability would be adding insult to injury. But the villain is not difficult to deal with because it is another feature of bully: harrying one, emitting a pile; pick up one of the honest group. So, to deal with villain must be an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, answered the virtue must be rewarded, pay bare the blame must be reported. In short to deal with bad people must use a small coin. With the gentleman to deal with bad people is to eyedrops to swallow their own blind. China to Singapore is easy enough to pick up, they do not have a gun cannons do not have to yell, stay calm and collected you can call it steal sheep. In fact there's nothing confidential, simply, it is never again to Singapore as what a friend, business-like it wants to. Do not look at a simple word, the past, China did not know how far back this burden, to eat the number of hidden losses. Far did not say that when the Asian financial crisis, China's own stability and the Asian financial disadvantage, in addition to Hong Kong is mainly to Singapore, for fear of economic collapse is a more desperate cry China threat theory. Similarly, the better the interest of China to do for fear of the impact of Singapore and China is also dragging its feet. For example, in cooperation with Thailand to build the completion of the Isthmus of Kra canal project, which again is technically and financially not very difficult, once achieved will certainly get rid of the dangerous reliance on the Malacca Strait, but also reduce the risk of being manipulated by others, the economy on China and Thailand are useful and no minuses, but is bound to the disadvantage of Singapore's shipping industry. China has always been hesitant about this project can not but say, one of the main concerns of Singapore's response.</div>
              <div dir="ltr"><br>As another example, the development pipeline through Myanmar, land transportation proposal is not that no one considered that the project can further reduce China's external dependence on shipping to countries in Southeast Asia, but China still have not hands-on, one of the major considerations is clearly unwilling to and Singapore are strained. Now in Singapore at their own initiative with China fell out, from China to consider these economic development projects no longer need to for the sake of Singapore, and completely Dry crunchy just for the sake of China's own interests, who can never expect to again have said that Triple Road 4. To China, this is actually a big relief, is that not a good thing? Again, China with Southeast Asian countries it wants to only deal directly with state to state, must have been no adoption of the "ASEAN." "ASEAN" actually became a Singapore dancing and raise his status stage, in addition to favorable outside of Singapore to China and other countries does not have much benefit. China quietly from the "ASEAN" crowded out, to deal directly with the countries concerned, the actual demolition of the Singapore Taiwan, reducing the chance of this charlatan fraud. This is to whom no harm, except to Singapore Chuanxiao Xie. In addition, if China has completed the Isthmus of Kra canal project or land transport projects in Myanmar, the United States using Singapore as a base the feasibility of blocking China would be adversely affected, the importance of the U.S. to use bases in Singapore, is also reduced accordingly. As a result, Kang also sold in Singapore to sell a good price has not. If you sold, that's primary purpose is to deal with China so much as it is to deal with the surrounding Muslim countries. Those countries will naturally do not understand this point. As a result, would like to clean up Singapore's state has its own people, do not need to do what the Chinese say.</div>
              <div dir="ltr"><br>It is precisely because Singapore is predominantly Chinese country, but also the vanguard of anti-China, China to Singapore as a breakthrough against international anti-China forces in side-effects is rather small. It thinks superior and always finding fault with others, the international community truly speaks for its people can not shed a few muddy water and sacrifice their own interests for it to take the fire millet almost no country can say that. Therefore, Singapore will not be counter to the "China threat theory" provides the number of shells, but which can be taught a good lesson to those relying on anti-Chinese food "elite": Do not look at you all day long anti-Chinese people applaud someone pay for, no one really poured sp Li You! China to do so beneficial to China, the state benefits on the parties, only to Singapore disadvantage. If anyone on this I complain, it was just Yongde Zhao logic of Singapore's favorite answer: "Singapore is a sovereign and independent country that can not because the Chinese at the expense of Singapore's interests." Similarly, China is a sovereign independent country, China can not sacrifice the interests of Singapore. This is Singapore's most elite disdain the essence of Chinese culture, one of: eye for an eye, but also treat the person's body. That's it, Qiyou it zai! ! !<br></div>

What you can do, others can freely do as well.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And in future, direct your comments more productively  towards the CCP for their failure to elevate the lives of a billion people in the countrysides, or their horribe rule of law and total disregard for human rights issues.</p>

              <p>There is absolutely no reason for aircraft carriers for defensive and peaceful measures as your country claim, and no reason for a million strong armed forces. You must start to disarm, including your nukes if you are truly sincere about peace and <strong>redistribute your wealth</strong> to every chinese citizen.</p>

              <p>The nosy X-rated fraud is dumb to the fact that despite accusing so many Singapore Citizens to be Communists based on LKY's false accusation - it is easy to conclude that LKY and The PAP are the real Communist in Singapore, even as they will cleverly disguised themselve in the cloak of Capitalism</p>
              <p>Since 1965, the "<strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">yoke of communism</span></strong>" as designed by LKY - has prevented true democracy to be enjoyed by Singaporeans</p>

              <p>Can respect and equality come from ignorance of history, skewed personal views, and deliberate zenophobia ?</p>
              <p>If at all, it will be misdirected zenophobic nationalistic pride that will result in tragic misunderstanding that is totally unnecessary and worsen by the arrogance that stem from the basic insecurity and inferiority.</p>
              <p>Quiet confidence serves the strong better then any grandstanding efforts of those who needs loud attention to demand respect and recognition.</p>

              <p> Is it not churlish of a poor loser who is stupid enough to walk into a trap that it so willingly set for itself ?</p>
              <p>In any business venture, does the losers always demand reimbursement for the losses incurred due to their poor personal business acumen ?</p>
              <p>If you are referring to the Singapore Government's investment in the Suzhou Project - there were other Singaporean Private Investors already in Suzhou then, and had their own private industrial parks running long before the Singapore Government had intended to impart to the Mainland Chinese their supposed talent and experience.</p>
              <p>It was these Singaporean private small scale investments that gave the Singapore Government the idea that a bigger scaled model can be achieved with the typical Singapore style input - and with the approval sought only from the Central Government while ignoring the authority of the Provincial Government.</p>
              <p>It was the typical arrogant style of the PAP in dealing only with those in power that led to the failure of the Suzhou Industrial Park.</p>

              <p>With China forming a large contributor to the Singapore trade index, can Singapore afford to antagnonise and isolate China - when we are already in hostile waters with our immediate neighbors ?</p>

              <p>Singaporeans should be thankful that the X-rated pseudo-intellect has only a pen to plagiarized the ideas and politics for its insatiable vain hunger at grandstanding itself with any opportunity that it can find for itself.</p>
              <p>Only the X-rated pseudo-intellect will believe that "<span style="color: #0000ff;">its pen-is mightier than swords</span>" and obviously it has been chopped a few time previously, that require it to assert its X-rated verbage to compensate for its insecurity.</p>
