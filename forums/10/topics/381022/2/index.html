              <p><br>MCP is the Malayan Communist Party that has its roots in Malaya and was founded as early as in 1930, and had then sought to have independence from British rule.</p>
              <p>Its members were mostly Chinese and was supported by the British Government in the fight against the Japanese Occupation Force in Malaya during WW-2.</p>
              <p>After the War, it was the remaining disciplines force to ensure law and order, and the distribution of limited food rations. The MCP organised civilian self-help organisation before the return of the British Colonial Government, administrators and the defeated British Military</p>
              <p>Immediately after WW-2, the MCP continued in its fight towards  the independence of Malaya from British Rule.</p>
              <p>The MCP never was interested to fight for the independence of Singapore - even as during that period, the people in Malaya and Singapore had always seen themselves as one entity, and that Singapore was part of Malaya.</p>
              <p>Despite the accepted reality amongst the people in Malaya and Singapore, the British Colonial Government had insisted on treating these two territories as separate entities.</p>

              <p>No insults intended by me but you ARE the self-admitted piece of shit here. You called yourself that and even prove yourself so with the shit your write. I'm only rightly addressing you and what you represent.</p>
              <p>I wouldnt have bothered much with you, like others who avoid shit, except for the despicable whitewashing of history you are attempting to do here. You talk alot, but did you notice that you had NOT given any source to back up YOUR STATEMENTS AND WILD ALLEGATIONS of facts that happened?</p>
              <p>No, you merely resort to insults again, twist and turn, to bluff your way thru yet again. How much had you and your outlaw leader been paid by the commie bastards to poison the minds of my fellow citizens with your incredulous tales?</p>
              <p>Go on, let's see how many 5 years old Singaporean you think exists here and would agree with you.</p>

              US is concerned about China's rise as for Singapore I guess it should be terrified!!! Why? because the world has only seen the beginning of the rise of China..just the beginning! and it already scares nations.

              <p>Is it not pathetically ironic that the X-rated pseudo-intellect will indulge in distractions as it avoid to give any reply to a detail post that debunked its precocious efforts to make itself the "representative Singapore voice" to debunk a misguided post from an ill-informed kid from China - as seen on Page 1 of this thread ?</p>

              <p>If the X-rated pseudo-intellect is correct - that "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">Afterall, shit is often distracting People will just tend to avoid then to have shit of their shoes. it's foul odour turns one away</span></em>" - should it surprise anyone that the X-rated pseudo-intellect will have a unique desire to be infatuated with 'shit' that it had claimed everyone will avoid except for itself ?</p>
              <p>It must be the bankrupt intelligence of a X-rated pseudo-intellect to indulge in the habit of boasting its intimate knowledge in the various characterisitcs of the shit to impress its wider audience that it believe exist to appreciate all its efforts ?</p>

              <p>Is the X-rated pseudo-intellect attempting to plagiarize the style of PAPa "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">to repeat a lie often enough, to make it become the truth</span></em>" ?</p>
              <p>It confirms again the inability of the X-rated pseudo-intellect to be circumspect to pick the right time and occassion to use what it hopelessly attempt to plagiarize but simply have no intelligence in knowing how to execute with the same finesse.</p>
              <p>It must be a pathetically remarkable feat that a X-rated pseudo-intellect has been seen by its wider audience to be repeatedly beaten by one that it deride as "a piece of shit" ?</p>
              <p>The repeated pathetic performance displayed by the X-rated pseudo-intellect can only reveal that its intelligence is worst then any shit can be.</p>
              <p>Is it any wonder that the X-rated pseudo-intellect does not have the ability to honestly recognise who its adversary is, but will delude itself with its own arrogant pomposity that can only result in itself being beaten repeatedly ?</p>
              <p>If only the X-rated Fraud had shown more respect towards History, and pay attention to the "<strong>Art of War</strong>" written by <strong>Sun Tzu</strong> - the X-rated Fraud would have shown more respect towards others that it intend to confront.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>For one who talk alot in claiming others for talking alot to white wash history - one will have to sit out and find out what further hot gas that the X-rated pseudo-intellect intend to inject to distract attention further away from what its final efforts will take to <strong>blacken</strong> the supposed <strong>white-washing</strong> of History.</p>
              <p>For one who claims that I have not back up my "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">statements and wild allegation of facts</span></em>" - it is amazing that alot has been said by the X-rated pseudo-intellect but it will not even want to engage to show which part of my "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">statements are wild allegation of facts</span></em>" that had been white washed.</p>
              <p>It is even more amazing that so much has been said by a X-rated Fraud that will associate itself with "shit" and talk to "shit" with its remarkable intimate familiarity with "shit", but has no ability to produce any substance of its own to prove what has been posted is "bullshit" that managed to "bluff" the X-rated pseudo-intellect.</p>
              <p>Can the X-rated pseudo-intellect produce any facts of its own to debunk what it had claimed to be "shit" ?</p>
              <p>It will be a long wait, as it has an acute constipation of ideas from a bankrupt mind that leads it to plagiarize the ideas, phrases, words, and statements from others ?</p>

              <p>It is not surprising that a X-rated pseudo-intellect has such low intelligence that it will allow itself to be insulted and so easily bluffed - why will the X-rated pseudo-intellect not take up the challenge of exposing where the bluff lie, and how the low intelligence of a X-rated pseudo-intellect could allow itself to be twisted and turned around ?</p>
              <p>It is not surprising for one who has been left to stand in the corner <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">alone</span></strong> for half its life due to its precocious low intelligence - will suffer from some psychological deficiency and lack of confidence; and will consistently delude itself with the existence of a larger audience, and to delude itself as a protector of fellow-citizens.</p>
              <p>Sadly, no one will acccept such a self-deluding arrogant character who will dare to be so presumptious as to take on the role as Public Defender when no one even called for one.</p>
              <p>Sadly, no one will want to associate itself near an exposed X-rated pseudo-intellect with a proven track record at being a Fraud - which any society will call it as "Shit".</p>
              <p>Is it any wonder that the X-rated pseudo-intellect will have such intimate knowledge in all things about "Shit" ?</p>
