              <p><strong>"manipulating others, backstabbing, namecalling" - are you
              referring to LKY ?</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Are you volunteering your opinion of yourself without any
              prodding ?</strong></p>
              <p>you know who i'm refering to so if you don't want to knowledge my views i can't help it, one can only bring the camel to the water.</p>
              <p>if it makes you happy you can continue to pretend what i said is what you want to be. but end of the day you know who or what i mean.</p>
              <p>i just happened to have a honest opinion of myself, is there any particular reason  i must wait for prodding to express my opinion? oh? are you saying you didn't "prod" at all?</p>
              <p>so i'm being sensitive when you quoted me and start going about commenting on how only the low principled would reject your views?</p>
              <p>so the following statements not meant to refer to me when you quoting me lah</p>
              <p>"How could anyone expect you to see any point in going back to

              <p>am i the only one thinking this way?</p>
              <p>or suddenly you want to be like andrew? say one thing mean another?</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>

              <p><strong>Is it not obvious that somethings are never meant to
              be as you have described ?</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Was there any relevance in your reply to his statement in the
              purpose of the "seat holder" <em>"to help the despots
              wayang-wayang"</em> ?</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Your reply was at a tangent that in all practicality never meant
              to be a reply.</strong></p>
              <p> ok, so my direct reply that quoted his reply is suddenly "never meant to be a reply" because you failed to see how pointless i see his view on "to help the despots wayang-wayang" since i used a pointless comment in comparison instead of just directly telling him its pointless?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>As I have said - the seat holder has been allowed to keep
              his seat by the good grace of the despots.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Do you seriously think that a "high principle and high
              ambitioned" person will be allowed by the despots to see the light
              of day ?</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Read my statement instead of making another reply at a tangent
              that make your reply irrelevant.</strong></p>
              <p> i think you should read my statement instead, regardless of what you and your friend here think i rejected that view liao.the main thing/point/relevance of my reply was my view, not yours.you rejecting my view doesn't make my view irrelevant it only means you don't accept my view.</p>
              <p>seriously don't quote this part if you still want to argue, you yourself of all people knows what it means to reject another's views no matter what's being said. we'll just end up saying the same things over and over again. and chances are i'll just copy and paste.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><br></strong></p>
              <p><strong>I got quite used to his colors and style, and have rarely
              immersed into his thread until I find some replies that offend my
              senses.</strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>I had expected better stuff from the honesty of
              an old bread that knows it stinks.</strong></span></p>
              <p> of course, you two happen to share identical views, you don't even need to point that out.</p>
              <p>and finally a cheap insult, not bad this time you managed to push it back to the third post. why? since you still post this way it can't be you've gain some manners, are you mellowing with age? haha sorry but even though you expected better of me i expected much worse from you. you usually ignore everything else and start aiming for user nicks and old posts. 5 years ago you say stinky bread now still no change.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><br></strong></p>
              <p><strong>As much as you have been tracking my posts, I have
              been studying yours too.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>The reason for taking replies apart is to give justice to the
              efforts made in making the specific contents of the replies,
              without doing so, can you possibly cover the various issues that
              are commonly lumped together ?</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Not so clever in attempting to make relevance out of two
              hypocritical statements.</strong></p>
              <p> eh, i didn't track your posts, its normal for readers to be naturally attracted the rudest and most aggressive posts. its more common for the nasty ones to be remembered then the nice ones.</p>
              <p>and considering i'm not as prominent as you in those areas, am i supposed to be honored you've actually taken an interest to the point of studying mine?</p>
              <p>if you feel insulted with that you can always go back quote me again then twist the words around to say thats not what you mean like how you usually do in the past.</p>
              <p>my point was made very clearly, but you like to take it apart to make it lose its meaning. refer to my first reply at the top. you want accept, if not reject. don't quote, change the meaning and say something irrelevant and out of context.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>You should be surprised if you have not learnt from
              observation that I usually return the compliments to those who
              believe in their own smart abilities.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Are the principles of a smart ass any higher ?</strong></p>
              <p> actually my observations only told me you're rude.&lt;--- honest opinion not trying to rile you, really.</p>
              <p>when i first came into SC (5years ago) i thought you made sense, then i saw how your arguements were taken apart and you started to target those you couldn't win in debate by commenting on nicks and grammar.</p>
              <p>then i realise you guys really do exist.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Why make life hard for yourself ?</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Life is hard enough, it becomes harder if you try to be
              stupid.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Yes, we certainly do look at things differently - as the
              person who is not hungry will look at a coconut as a hard
              shell.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Should it get pass you that creativity appears when stupidity
              ceases ? </strong></p>
              <p> yeah lah, same story everytime right? repent and see the light . as long as i accept your views i'm one of the good guys lah, enlightened lah. once people not on your side, they're silliporeans, peasants ignorant lah and so on.</p>
              <p>memory quite vague lah but rougly 5 years ago i think i replied to you saying what i replied to your friend here.</p>
              <p>you behaved just like PAP but only difference is you're not on their side. the same people who use "high principled" people as examples like to have low principled ways.</p>
              <p>on one hand like to complain about low principles, then say ends justify the means then used against you not happy again.</p>

              Yew<br> <br></span>The general rule is first to deal with the allegations
              in the pleadings, namely Plaintiffs Statement of Claim and Dr.
              Chee’s defense. Dr. Chee has to show that Lee is without any
              respect in the community, that people consider him no better than a
              rascal and someone who will shamelessly use crooked means to amass
              wealth.<br> <br> In the first instance, Dr. Chee’s attack on Lee’s character should
              be based on the pleadings. For instance if he says he was the Prime
              Minister of Singapore, to show that he got the position by
              dishonest means.<br> <br> In this case, since Lee’s position is that the people would believe
              that just as the NKF, Lee is corrupt, prove that Lee in fact had
              control over NKF and since he did nothing to stop the corruption
              there, he was clearly complicit in it. Moreover his government is
              no different from NKF since there is no accountability and the
              newspapers are state controlled and a mouthpiece for
              propaganda.<br> <br> Other than specifically trying to disprove Lee’s claim of
              respectability, defamation law permits a defendant to raise even
              extraneous evidence of lack of reputation.<br> <br> Therefore Lee’s rigging elections to remain ion power, his misuse
              of the law to eliminate opposition politicians, his purchasing Jade
              condominium at a discounted price, his paying himself $3.7 million,
              his refusal to permit transparency for Tumasek and GIC are all
              matters that you can validly go into.<br> <br> In other words, once a person sues another for defamation, his
              entire life including everything private and public is fair game to
              be attacked. Lee’s lawyer cannot raise objections as to relevancy
              since his entire life can be exposed.<br> <br> As I do not have the benefit of the Statement of Claim and Dr.
              Chee’s defense, I am writing with the benefit of only Lee’s
              Affidavit in Chief.<br> <br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Dr. Chee to Lee Kuan

              Para 8 of your Affidavit you claim that you were the first prime
              minister of Singapore in 1959, a post you held until 1990. Are you
              relying on that fact as a basis for claiming a

              that the average ordinary citizen of Singapore looks upon you as a
              dictator having retained power by unjust means in effect by abusing

              7 of your Affidavit, you refer to the NKF saga with the criminal
              implication of Mr. TT Durai. Let me ask you, is not TT Durai a
              member of the Peoples Action Party? Are you denying that it is
              common knowledge among Singaporeans that he is a member of your
              party, just as every other appointment in public or private office

              willing to admit that the public assume even today that you are
              aware of the goings on in NKF because you are involved in all

              admit that it is commonly perceived that you either knew or you
              condoned the corrupt activities of the NKF since you have your
              tentacles all over the island? Therefore do you not admit that
              people may justifiably think, just like the NKF, the Singapore
              government too may be corrupt, thereby tarnishing your

              to pages 8 and 9 of your Affidavit, Para 20 with reference to the

              the political elite must be paid top dollar no matter how obscene
              those amounts are and regardless of who suffers as a result of

              Yew</span>:<br> <br> <em style="font-weight: normal; font-style: italic;">Is not what I
              said in that paragraph “ It is about a system engineered over the
              decades by the PAP that ensures that it and it only has access to
              public information and by fiat decides what is allowed and what is
              not” true?<br> <br> Is it not true that people have no access to any independent
              opinion other than the Internet; that you own and censor all
              newspapers in Singapore? Are you therefore not seen as a dictator
              rather than a democratic leader of country?<br> <br> Do you not admit that people fear you and are unable to question
              whether or not you commit fraud embezzle and criminal breach of

              words “Singaporeans must note that the NKF is not an aberration of
              the PAP system, It is instead a product of it” entirely true, since
              just as how the government is run without any transparency, so was
              the NKF run, entirely in secret with no
              transparency.<br></em><br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Dr. Chee to Lee Kuan

              how much money there is in it, how much money is in GIC as in every
              public organization.<br> <br> Since the lack of transparency is so striking, is it not reasonable
              to assume that just as TT Durai, you too have been stealing public
              moneys in addition to the $3.7 million that you pay

              really knows what is going on with the books of these
              organizations?<br> <br> Since they are public institutions, are not the people entitled to
              know?<br> <br> By keeping these things secret, are not the majority of
              Singaporeans entitled to assume that you are stealing the monies in
              them?<br> <br> Therefore are not reasonably minded people entitled to assume that
              you are in fact a thief?<br> <br> And so are your entire family members whom you have placed in

              you have won which has any merit?<br> <br> Do you admit that it is generally perceived in Singapore as well as
              the whole world that the Singapore judiciary is beholden to you and
              do your bidding by eliminating your opponents in return for huge
              mind boggling salaries?<br> <br> Do you not admit that by your actions the integrity of the

              striking?<br> <br> Power concentrated in one man, yourself?<br> <br> You make sure that no one can challenge your authority by
              defamation actions?<br> <br> By banning protests? Introducing GRCs?<br> <br> In these circumstances, is it not reasonable for Singaporeans to
              think that just like TT Durai, you too could possibly be a thief,
              stealing the money of Singaporeans because if they question you,
              you will sue them?<br> <br></em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Dr. Chee to

              your Affidavit, do you not admit that with the control of the
              press, you can trumpet your so called successes and hide your
              failures; so that there is no way that anyone can ever know whether
              corruption and criminality goes on behind the closed doors?<br> <br> In these circumstances, are not the people entitled to assume that
              corruption is going on, because if you are not corrupted, why then
              do you fear transparency and a free press?<br></em><br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Dr. Chee to Lee Kuan

              to page 11, reference the CPF protest; is not the protest entirely
              within the rights of Singapore citizens which permit freedom of
              speech and assembly under the Constitution?<br> <br> And in any case are not the questions raised by the protestors
              entirely true, since National reserves are not transparent, HDB and
              GIC do not provide any figures of the monies in them, are not the
              words “be transparent now” entirely legitimate since there is no
              transparency, and NKF CPF reference is true, since just like NKF,
              CPF refuses to publish any figures?<br> <br> And principally because you refuse to publish figures, are not
              people entitled to assume that you and your family are stealing,
              just as TT Durai did?<br> <br></em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Dr. Chee to

              with respect to the judgment of VK Rajah in relation to the
              protestors court action, is it not true that the judge was entirely
              wrong in his judgment, since Singaporeans have a legitimate right
              to peaceful protest under the Constitution and by your questioning
              this right, should not Singaporeans assume that you are doing
              nothing more than silencing dissent?<br> <br> Do you not agree that the average Singaporean believes that every
              judge including the Judge in this court Belinda Ang as well as
              every other judge in Singapore including VK Rajah was acting at
              your behest and obliged to do your bidding by deciding cases in

              entitled to raise the NKF issue as part of the elections of 2006
              since the NKF is an organization under the control of your
              government?<br> <br> In fact, do you not agree that in any other respectable democracy,
              the government would have resigned and admitted responsibility of
              the wrong doing in the NKF?<br> <br> But instead of doing that, you are instead suing anyone who

              damages against anyone just because they needed time for trial
              preparation and the conduct of the proceedings?<br> <br></em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Dr. Chee to

              because you perceive me as a threat?<br> <br> Will you admit that it is only you and your government that has
              such an opinion of me?<br> <br> In fact will you not agree that all true democracies in the world

              us from exposing the truth about the NKF and had we done so, it

              recover monetary damages, I doubt very much if they will get a
              penny.<br> <br> Indeed I am sure that the purpose of these proceedings is not for
              money but to try to silence me from further criticism.<br> <br> I would like to tell this court as Your Honor is yourself aware
              that both you and the entire population of Singapore and indeed the
              whole world knows that this Plaintiff remains in power by silencing
              the opposition by abusing the law.<br> <br> Your Honor knows that this is one reason why the educated and

              regime and will continue to strive to bring democracy to this

Past events show how easily it is for troublemakers to make use of gatherings to incite racial and religious riots, resulting in loss of lives and property. Indeed events in the last two years around the world, demonstrate the disruptive forces that can be unleashed due to racial and religious strife.

              <p> </p>
              <p>Below are rules that I extracted. I have also reproduced text by
              forumer. Since this thread is still open, I have the following
              observations.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">1. Anybody
              who wish to express their opinions on any issue except religious
              speeches, and speeches that would cause feelings of enmity, hatred,
              ill-will or hostility between different racial or religious groups,
              could simply type in their views.<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">My observation: this type of language (below)
              does not cause feeling of enmity, hatred, ill-will or
              hostility</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"><br> However any topics related to those stated above will be closed in
              24 hours and repeated offenders will be put into consideration for
              banning.<br> <br> Reason why this is done so:<br> Singapore is a small, compact, multi-racial and multi-religious
              country. Past events show how easily it is for troublemakers to
              make use of gatherings to incite racial and religious riots,
              resulting in loss of lives and property. Indeed events in the last
              two years around the world, demonstrate the disruptive forces that
              can be unleashed due to racial and religious strife. Regulation of
              public talks is therefore necessary and continues to be
              needed.<br> <br> 2. All Statements here <strong style="font-style: normal; font-weight: bold;">Must</strong> be
              backed with facts and not baseless allegations.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">or the forumer is writing

              <p><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"><br> <br> 3. Any topics that eventually ends up as a flame war will be closed
              after 3 warnings. A 24 hour grace period will be given after the
              last warning to allow users to give reasons on why the thread
              should remain open.</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">the topic is not a flame war,
              or 3 warnings have been given...</span></p>
