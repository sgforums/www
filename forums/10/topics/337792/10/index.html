              <p>as mentioned we all see things differently, just like we can't see the point with going back to jail every few months for no reason.</p>
              <p>your asking what's the point is like asking why the pork seller isn't trying to take over temasek. whats the point of selling pork when you can be ceo?</p>
              <p>one of the "seat holders" did actually say he's there to serve the people of his area, and at this point of time they are the most important to him, not planning how to topple the pap govt. his decision was to at least make sure the people who voted him in aren't let down.</p>
              <p>whats the point of you questioning why people aren't noble enough when you choose to hide here?</p>

              <p>Will Singaporeans sit up and consider the following, if CSJ did not brazenly confront the despots with his affidavit that was filed in the High Court ?</p>
              <p>Was it not due to the fear of a prolonged session in open public hearing that resulted in a shortened hearing procedures by 3 days instead of the planned 5 days hearing, and with the daily hearing shortened to only half a day ?</p>

              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cross Examination of Lee Kuan Yew<br><br></span>The general rule is first to deal with the allegations in the pleadings, namely Plaintiffs Statement of Claim and Dr. Chee’s defense. Dr. Chee has to show that Lee is without any respect in the community, that people consider him no better than a rascal and someone who will shamelessly use crooked means to amass wealth.<br><br>In the first instance, Dr. Chee’s attack on Lee’s character should be based on the pleadings. For instance if he says he was the Prime Minister of Singapore, to show that he got the position by dishonest means.<br><br>In this case, since Lee’s position is that the people would believe that just as the NKF, Lee is corrupt, prove that Lee in fact had control over NKF and since he did nothing to stop the corruption there, he was clearly complicit in it. Moreover his government is no different from NKF since there is no accountability and the newspapers are state controlled and a mouthpiece for propaganda.<br><br>Other than specifically trying to disprove Lee’s claim of respectability, defamation law permits a defendant to raise even extraneous evidence of lack of reputation.<br><br>Therefore Lee’s rigging elections to remain ion power, his misuse of the law to eliminate opposition politicians, his purchasing Jade condominium at a discounted price, his paying himself $3.7 million, his refusal to permit transparency for Tumasek and GIC are all matters that you can validly go into.<br><br>In other words, once a person sues another for defamation, his entire life including everything private and public is fair game to be attacked. Lee’s lawyer cannot raise objections as to relevancy since his entire life can be exposed.<br><br>As I do not have the benefit of the Statement of Claim and Dr. Chee’s defense, I am writing with the benefit of only Lee’s Affidavit in Chief.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Dr. Chee to Lee Kuan Yew</span>:<br><em></em><br><em>In page 4, Para 8 of your Affidavit you claim that you were the first prime minister of Singapore in 1959, a post you held until 1990.

control of the press, you can trumpet your so called successes and hide your failures; so that there is no way that anyone can ever know whether corruption and criminality goes on behind the closed doors?<br><br>In these circumstances, are not the people entitled to assume that corruption is going on, because if you are not corrupted, why then do you fear transparency and a free press?<br></em><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Dr. Chee to Lee Kuan Yew:<br></span><br><em>With regards to page 11, reference the CPF protest; is not the protest entirely within the rights of Singapore citizens which permit freedom of speech and assembly under the Constitution?<br><br>And in any case are not the questions raised by the protestors entirely true, since National reserves are not transparent, HDB and GIC do not provide any figures of the monies in them, are not the words “be transparent now” entirely legitimate since there is no transparency, and NKF CPF

questioning this right, should not Singaporeans assume that you are doing nothing more than silencing dissent?<br><br>Do you not agree that the average Singaporean believes that every judge including

its merits?<br><br></em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Dr. Chee to Lee Kuan Yew:<br></span><br><em>Am I not entitled to raise the NKF issue as part of the elections of 2006 since the NKF is

preparation and the conduct of the proceedings?<br><br></em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Dr. Chee to Lee Kuan Yew:<br><br></span><em>In Para 100 page 41, you state that I have a deep

you admit that it is only you and your government that has such an opinion of me?<br><br>In fact will you not agree that all true democracies in the world have an opinion of me which is just the opposite?<br><br>Here refer to the various commendations and awards and accolades of appreciation and respect showered on Dr. Chee by the rest of the world as an honest decent man, highly determined to bring justice for Singaporeans.<br></em><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Dr. Chee to Lee Kuan Yew:<br></span><br><em>Is it not true that in relation to the NKF, just as Singaporeans

the peoples money?<br></em><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Dr. Chee to Lee Kuan Yew:<br></span><br><em>Is it not true that you commenced action against me and the SDP just before the 2006 elections during the campaign?<br><br>Is it not reasonable for the ordinary man to assume that you did it in order to intimidate voters away from the SDP and to distract us from concentrating on elections?<br><br>Is this not what the ordinary man on the street will think?<br></em><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Dr. Chee to Lee Kuan Yew:<br><br></span><em>Do you not agree that the injunction that you obtained stopping us from referring to the NKF during the election rallies of 2006 was an attempt to silence us from exposing the truth about the NKF and had we done so, it would have badly hurt your chances at the elections?<br><br>Would not people think of you as a coward using unfair means to win elections?<br></em><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Dr. Chee to Lee Kuan Yew:<br></span><br><em>Are you aware that Singaporeans have the benefit of the Internet?<br><br>Are you aware that overwhelmingly both within and without Singapore you are seen as a bully willing to tolerate not even the slightest criticism by harassment intimidation false criminal charges and defamation actions?<br><br>Therefore do you not accept the fact that even if you are corrupt no one will know because no one can find out?<br><br>Do you not consider the salary you take of $3.7 million a year and several more millions both admitted and not admitted are seen as nothing less than corruption, plain and simple?<br><br></em>Here show the voluminous Internet articles and letters all calling this man a thief and a crook.<br><br>Here Dr. Chee should throw the whole kitchen sink at Lee Kuan Yew by producing every shred of document both in Singapore and the world which refers to him as a tyrant and a bully and a cheat. Lee’s reputation is in issue and therefore anything that you can find as to his bad character should be thrown at him. If the Judge were to object, then state your protest.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Dr. Chee to Judge:<br><br></span><em>Your Honor knows that this hearing is to decide the quantum of damages to be awarded to the Plaintiff.<br><br>Your Honor also knows that this entire exercise is one in futility since I have already been bankrupted and I am unable to pay.<br><br>Even if Your Honor were to award a trillion dollars against me, it will make no difference.<br><br>If indeed these proceedings are commenced by the Plaintiffs to recover monetary damages, I doubt very much if they will get a penny.<br><br>Indeed I am sure that the purpose of these proceedings is not for money but to try to silence me from further criticism.<br><br>I would like to tell this court as Your Honor is yourself aware that both you and the entire population of Singapore and indeed the whole world knows that this Plaintiff remains in power by silencing the opposition by abusing the law.<br><br>Your Honor knows that this is one reason why the educated and capable in Singapore continue to leave the country in droves and Singapore is losing its best people.<br><br>One thing both you and the Plaintiff can be certain is this.<br><br>I refuse to be silenced in my work of exposing this totalitarian regime and will continue to strive to bring democracy to this country.<br><br>Your Honor can decide whatever Your Honor wants to do. </em></p>
