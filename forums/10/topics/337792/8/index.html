              <p>I wonder why any other political party other than the PAP is
              called the "Opposition".</p>
              <p>The term Opposition is correct only during the election
              hustings. The other party is The Opposition party in a contested
              ward.  After the votes has been counted, any party in
              Parliament should be deemed to be FOR Singapore. Therefore the
              PAP, the SDA, and WP are for Singapore.</p>
              <p>The majority party that has the right to govern, is
              the ruling party and any other party should be "The Other"
              party instead of the opposition party.</p>
              <p>e.g. Prof. S Jayakumar is of the ruling PAP, while Mr Low Thia
              Kiang is with the other party, the WP.</p>
              <p>Are they to oppose nilly willy, just oppose anything for the
              sake of opposing?</p>

              <p>True, but there has to be reason to oppose it.  I think what he was trying to say was, unreasonable opposition of issues doesn't gain the opposition parties any points with Singaporean voters also.  If the oppositions appear to be hindering the decision process for no good reason, they will lose electoral support. </p>

              <p>Malaysia is forecast 3.5% growth in 2009 i think.</p>
              <p>In a sense, why we did poorer when compared to M'sia would be slow down of export to the US, as well as general slow down of re-exports to US.  I think US foreign investments into Singapore will also reduce cos they are gonna be experiencing 0 or negative growth in 2009 as well.</p>
              <p>If the US moves into recession, we will follow behind rather quickly... a bit helplessly i admit. </p>
              <p>I'm not an economist, but given Singaporean' kiasu nature,  if the government were to tell us a storm is coming, everybody will tighten spending even more.  And if the real economists are to be believed, that will be more destructive than constructive to our economy.</p>
              <p>Hopefully, Obama's policies would also serve to excite the US economy by giving the middle class more leeway to spend, and drive up demand again.  If so, we might be able to benefit from it. </p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>I hope your reference to "PAP's dominance" is not made as if it is due to their popularity, as almost half of the Singapore population did not vote, and of the half that actually voted - only 66.6% of the valid votes went to the PAP.</p>
              <p>This 66.6% that was supposed to have voted for the PAP represent about 35% of the Singapore Eligible Voting Population.</p>
              <p>The "PAP's dominance" can be traced to the political history of Singapore in which the PAP has consistently fenced in the "Opposition Parties" using unethical methods that no First World Countries will even try.</p>
              <p>To describe a list of the unethical methods will simply derail this thread.</p>

              <p>For once I can agree with your thoughts as expressed in this paragraph.</p>
              <p>Just before the "one and only" Referendum was conducted in Singapore - (to have Singaporeans determine if Singapore should merge with Malaysia) - Dr Lee Siew Choh, Sec-Gen of the Barisan Sosialist Party, had insisted that more time should be given for all the issues to be clearly publicised and debated.</p>
              <p>Dr Lee Siew Choh had made a major issue concerning the Ballot Paper - (in which three proposals were offered for Singaporeans to pick their choice) - was seen as a "no-brainer" - as picking anyone of the given choices will simply endorse the PAP a.k.a. LKY's intention to merge Singapore into Malaysia since the choice for a clear "NO" was non-existent.</p>
              <p>With the entire process being rushed through, it resulted in a rushed marriage between Singapore and Malaysia that had to end up in separation after two years.</p>

              <ul>
              <li><strong>Option A</strong>: All Singapore citizens would automatically become citizens of Malaysia, and Singapore would retain a degree of autonomy and state power, such as over labour and education. Singapore would also get to keep its language policies, such as to retain using all four major languages, <a title="English language" href="/wiki/English_language"><span style="color: #002bb8;">English</span></a>, <a title="Mandarin Chinese" href="/wiki/Mandarin_Chinese"><span style="color: #002bb8;">Mandarin</span></a>, <a title="Malay language" href="/wiki/Malay_language"><span style="color: #002bb8;">Malay</span></a> and <a title="Tamil language" href="/wiki/Tamil_language"><span style="color: #002bb8;">Tamil</span></a>. </li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
              <li><strong>Option B</strong>: Singapore would become a <a title="Federation" href="/wiki/Federation"><span style="color: #002bb8;">federal</span></a> state like that of the other eleven states, with no more autonomy than the other states would, thus ceding control over issues such as labour and education policies to the federal government in <a title="Kuala Lumpur" href="/wiki/Kuala_Lumpur"><span style="color: #002bb8;">Kuala Lumpur</span></a>. This also meant that there would be less multilingualism - only English and Malay would be used for official purposes, and possibly education. Only those born in Singapore or descended from the Singapore-born would become citizens of Malaysia. There would also be proportionate representation in Parliament from Singapore. </li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
              <li><strong>Option C</strong>: Singapore would enter on terms no less favourable than the Borneo territories, <a title="Sabah" href="/wiki/Sabah"><span style="color: #002bb8;">Sabah</span></a> and <a title="Sarawak" href="/wiki/Sarawak"><span style="color: #002bb8;">Sarawak</span></a>, both whom were also discussing merger with Malaysia. This was to ensure that Malaysia would not discriminate along racial lines, as that would mean discriminating against Sabah and Sarawak, which were predominantly <a class="mw-redirect" title="Bumiputra" href="/wiki/Bumiputra"><span style="color: #002bb8;">Bumiputra</span></a> as well. </li>

              <p>Andrew, it is not that the Oppostion Parties do not know how to write on economic subjects - it is that the controlled broadcast and print media do not give publicity to any such plans from the Opposition Parties.</p>

              being opposition when people have to dig up what you have to say to

              <p><br>The only way not to get sued is to stay silent, and be good obedient, docile members sitting on the opposite side of the government bench in Parliament.</p>
              <p>JBJ was outspoken in speaking the truth of all that was wrong - and for that he was verbally abused in some of the most creative language that only LKY's legal mind is capable of, and was further financially cruxified in the meanest possible ways simply to prevent JBJ from gaining a national platform to embarass LKY and his government from executing plans to run Singaporeans to the ground.</p>
              <p>Singapore is what it is today as a result of less JBJ around.</p>
              <p>For more then 21 years, Chiam has been in Parliament - what has he achieved ?</p>
              <p>Is Chiam's new political party any more credible than the SDP that he led and whose general membership even lost faith in his leadership - (and threw him out of the SDP even without CSJ instigation or involvement in the entire episode - even as some<em> narcissist </em>will intentionally and misleadingly propagate otherwise, simply to fulfill a "<em>Drama Queen's whorish attention seeking wet dreams</em>") ?</p>
              <p>The WP - with Sylivia Lim and Low Thia Kiang pulling the strings - is walking a fine line by not being more forceful and pressing on issues that clearly outraged Singaporeans - as seen in their moderate response in the NKF and Mas Selamat scandals, when Ministerial responsibility was clearly and shamelessly being absolved by the Government.</p>
              <p>All the achievements that Chiam and Low can claim are the housekeeping results in managing their respective constituencies.</p>
              <p>What are their achievements on national issues beyond their success in representing the parochial interests of their respective constituents to the various Miinistries ?</p>
              <p>They could not even get pass the HDB in planting their own trees on Tree Planting Day in their own Constituencies, let alone in being accorded the full rights and respect that are so quickly given to the PAP Members of Parliament by the various government institutions in the Opposition held Constituencies.</p>
              <p>Both Chiam and Low could not even get the HDB to allow any MP's office in the void deck of HDB flats, so as to conduct their "meet-the-people" session - when PAP Members of Parliament have been allowed to build enclosed offices in the void decks.</p>
              <p> Can both parties build any credibility under such circumstances, when they volunteer to moderate their own efforts to build their own public profile ?</p>

              <p>In the wards, who would be the "Opposition" to Mr Low Thia Khiang, and Mr Chiam See Tong?</p>
              <p>Both the incumbent ruling party and the other parties should be working together towards the betterment of Singapore. That is something your delusional ego cannot accept.</p>
