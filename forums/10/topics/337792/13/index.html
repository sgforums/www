              <p><br>Might be idiotic, but i'm not the only one who thinks so. If your curses worked so well LKY would be long dead, and don't talk so much, do something about it. Why not you go be like your hero CSJ or something and go curse them in public instead of just sitting behind your com typing nonsense?</p>

              <p>and so on. if i am the defense lawyer, i will just say hearsay all the way. If you think LKY has falsely imprisoned people, prove it. if you think LKY has abused the law, prove it.</p>
              <p>If this type of questions without basis is all that the judge is going to hear, than he should cut short the hearing.</p>
              <p>your hard headed appraoch to discredit the court has blind your eyes to the actions of CSJ, and the duties of the court, and what the judge needs to do to maintain order.</p>

              <p>Was it not true that LKY had no evidence in proving his accusation that Chia Thye Poh was supposed to be a Communist, and locked him up for 32 years - with the ISD agents bringing CTP on tours round the city to view the progress that Singapore has experienced with him locked up refusing to sign the papers admitting to LKY's false accusation ?</p>

              <p>'blah blah' ? That is the immature talk of one younger than a
              kid learning to walk.</p>
              <p>Can one so young be savvy enough to discern any
              improvements in anything ?</p>
              <p>When facts are available, can hearsay exist - can you
              discern the nuances ?</p>
              <p>Only a dull mind will be bored with the idea
              of improving the status quo, and will prefer to look for
              negatives in anything that is new, instead of developing the
              positive for a new future.</p>
              <p>Given your preference for the status quo, can your dull
              mind absorb any improvements in anything, when your views and
              attitudes are as unrealistic as your attempts to be
              politically savvy ?</p>

              <p>Do you think that LKY will allow CSJ to prove it ?</p>
              <p>Why did LKY not confront CSJ and offer him the opportunity
                  to prove what he has stated in his Affidavit ?</p>

              <p>as powerful as LKY is thought to be in singapore he still cannot openly attack anyone. either unable to or unwilling to. i'm leaning more towards the latter.</p>
              <p>its human nature to perceive reality differently.</p>
              <p>he has his own ideas of how things should work and he's in a position to do so. if this is all a game, CSJ has shown himself to have a chronic inability to play within the rules.</p>
              <p>EDIT: its silly to talk about fairness when you're not the one setting the rules. he should have first tried to explain clearly how he is going to link what he is going to say in court is related to his defence then reword his questions in a non threatening manner .</p>
              <p>instead he abbandoned everything and attacked in front of the referee forgetting he's playing football, not rugby.</p>
