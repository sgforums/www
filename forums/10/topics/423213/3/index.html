              <p>I think in terms of resources, we are limited, and we have to plan properly how to best defend this manure hell hole. In terms of the need to balancing economic and defence, currently, economic is suffering so I think the government have to think alot harder and to think about everyone's rice bowl.</p>
              <p>If the country is doing well economically, lots of jobs, people who signed army professional, after 6 six years can go back to civilian live easily while those currently in army will be happy to see family, friends at least having some job and have some measure of success in whatever area they are in, be it marriage or starting a business.</p>
              <p>Economic is just as important as defence, the government will ust have to movtivate people with the required and the rest will have to follow. If course, counting in dollars and cents is predictable and safe, but people are the one using these things not money using people.</p>
              <p>A government that cannot gain trust of the people, can only count in dollars and cents as such a government have no access to citizens hidden potentials. Potential that can turn a seeming winless war into victory.</p>
              <p>I think I would like to also add that this balance between defence and economic is the real total defence. The government have to juggle all this, afterall, they are millionaire ministers, paid because they sworned they are the best in the world.</p>

              <p>The Gurkha Contingent serve not as a deterrent force but an independent force to quell racial riots. It also serve as an independent force to protect important figureheads of the nation. They are not an army, they are like a independent private police. The need, the number of soldiers, the effectiveness is another story altogether. So far, there was no abuse of the usage of such force.</p>
              <p>My question for people who are for the abolishment of the Gurkha Contingent is this: How much money, effort must be spent to recruit an independent force within the nation that is capable of looking at the job only without discrimination? Is anyone confident of getting an anti-riot force that does not judge by the color of the skin?</p>
              <p>As for National Slavery, abolishing it or reducing it to a year may not be a good suggestion. It is obvious that CSJ is looking at strengthening foreign ties but like all deals, both sides must reach a common ground. If we reduce arms, we must expect the region to perform similar acts together. This will strengthen bonds. However, to go straight and perform seppuku by reducing time served is obviously a poor hindsight.</p>
              <p>Look at the recent use of arms in the region and everyone will recognise that Singapore is still in a region where arms is used to quell unrest and political instability.</p>
              <p>Are we safe enough to justify the "immediate" reduction in serving time such that it is halved? If the serving time enough to train combat fit soldiers ready and drilled for any repercussions?</p>

                  SAF is critical to Singapore's peace and
                  security:
                  (LKY said )
                  â€œ... on our National Day, Aug 9, 1991,
                  the Malaysian and the Indonesian
                  armed forces held joint exercises at
                  Kota Tinggi with parachute drops.
                  Hence, we mobilised our forces, in
                  addition to forces parading for the
                  National Day celebrations. I did not
                  believe they wanted to invade us, but
                  they wanted to intimidate and con us,
                  so that we know our place at the
                  bottom of the pecking order in the
                  region.â€�
