              <p>Apparently, you have not heard of LKY meeting with Dr M. This was prior to Newater technological discovery.<br><br>LKY warned Dr M that if Singapore supply of water is shut down, he will go in and restore the supply - not walk in, not invite in, not ask to go in. But to go in forcefully - read 'invasion'.</p>

              <p>Security and external relations<br><br>E7. Ministry of Defence (MINDEF)<br><br>The
                   best defence of the nation is good relations with its neighbours. Our 
                  defence policy will be founded upon building international friendships, 
                  replacing the hostile and confrontational stance of the past. Amity 
                  among nations will replace the need for high spending on armaments and 
                  we will focus our efforts to increase economic and social/cultural 
                  cooperation, the sharing of expertise and technology, and the pooling of
                   resources. We will thereforce reduce our defence force to one that 
                  allows us to enjoy a peaceful and secure environment and unimpeded 
                  access to our lines of communication.<br><br>A significant reduction in 
                  defence spending is made. An immediate moratorium on the purchase of new
                   armaments will be established. We will allocate resources to study the 
                  feasibility of scaling down our defence force to a fully professional, 
                  non-conscript body. As part of this study, we will look into the 
                  immediate reduction of NAtional Service to one year and the feasibility 
                  of transferring surplus manpower to civilian sectors such as hospitals 
                  and environmental clean-up units.<br><br>Mindef will pay full-time NSmen
                   the minimun wage of $1,200 as basic allowance. These men have been 
                  called to serve the nation and they risk their lives in doing so. They 
                  shall not be exploited.</p>
              <p>....................................................................................................................................</p>
              <p>Here's
                   the full paragraph in the SDP Shadow Budget 2011 on page 26. It is a 
                  PDF format and I can't copy and paste. I typed it with my snail speed 
                  fingers.</p>
              <p>I went to the chinese link that you gave, but I surrender when I saw the amount of Chinese texts.</p>
              <p>German
                   philiospher Luwig Wittgenstein has said that languages are like word 
                  games. In the 1920s, if I remember correctly, academics are very 
                  concerned with the problems of languages, meanings and stuff like that. 
                  There are loopholes or mistakes that can be exploited, for example, 
                  English to Chinese and so on.</p>
              <p>The folks at SPH are well versed to 
                  emphasie what words will acheive their aims. They can't do a complete 
                  news blankout of opposition parties as people nowadays are more 
                  discerning, but they can still tweak certain words to influcence our 
                  thoughts. It will be subtle and not easily found out.</p>
              <p>My family 
                  still has subscription to the Chinese and morning newspapers. I normally
                   just skim through the headlines and do a quick read up if needed. 
                  Mostly I will try to find pictures of pretty girls to start me up 
                  instead. I am always wary of their reporting style. The most famous of 
                  them being Chua Mui Hoong (Political Editor) who is formerly from ISD.</p>
              <p>PAP did not spend these few decades acquiring independent 
                  newspapers and grouping them all under SPH for nothing. I don't think it
                   really brings in money nowadays, SPH, if I'm not mistaken dabbles in 
                  other stuff to earn most of their revenues. PAP believe that it is a 
                  valuable tool and time and time again, during elections PAP have the 
                  upper hand.</p>

              <p>while i was in NS, a Warrant Officer once asked me. Do you think NS should be gone? i said no for various 'society/character' reasons. not impt.</p>
              <p>he then asked me who are we most likely go to war with? i said Msian and Indo. Then he asked me. Who will most likely win the war. i replied cfm them. coz the amount of soldiers is enough to flatten us.</p>
              <p>then he told me one scenario. imagine u are a man with a wife and daughter at home. a few robbers forced and broke into ur house. they also raped your wife and daughter. he asked me what would i do? try to fight off the robbers to prevent this even though u know u cant stop it? or sit or do nth while they are being raped?</p>
              <p>he then said even if u tried and cannot fight off the robbers, ur wife and daughter will still come treat ur wounds after the incident and will bring the family closer. if u did nth, its over, no more respect. thought over it. quite true.</p>
              <p>so... i think NS is essential. but i do think the expenditure abit too high.</p>
              <p>btw i dont rmb CSJ saying he wan abolish NS.</p>
