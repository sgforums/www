              <p>1 kg 60cents. The collectors will compress the cans to make it easier to carry and also can carry more, so sometime, on the road you see ah peks or ah ma throw cans on the road for cars to run over it, dun be alarm ya, i used to use my Honda to compress for them.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The can metal will be send to each town collection areas, then lorries will collect them all back to somewhere in jurong for selling again to recycle firms. By that time the price will be 1kg = 80 or 90 cents depend on the price of Metal of the day.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>One of my customer is a towkay in can collection, he has 8 lorries/pick up, morning he use his lorries to ferry workers in jurong as a transport business, afternoon, he deployed his lorries to collect and bought back all the cans to his run down warehouse office in penjuru, , then he repack them nicely with his workers, and sell it at the recycle firms. He said he is 54yo now, long ago, in his 20s, he was a playboy and lost all his money his family pass down to him, he got very less education, i think only Sec 2. So, in order to support his mother and sisters, he collect cans and cardboard at nights and wkends to supplement his daily job as a lorry driver then. Slowly, he realised the potential to start a business, registered a business, gone thru up and down, get married to a Hanian gal at 38 yo, got a son and two pretty daughters, two condos, a BMW, an office cum warehous and bought another warehouse to rent out.

              <p>In The Singapore Story, Lee Kuan Yew pointedly explains that the</p>
              <p><em>three and a half years of Japanese occupation were the most important of my life. They gave me vivid insights into the behaviour of human beings and human societies, their motivations and impulses. My appreciation of governments, my understanding of power as the vehicle for revolutionary change, would not have been gained without this experience.</em></p>
              <p>First of all, he observed "a whole social system "built upon <a href="http://sgforums.com/forums/10/topics/lky10.html"><span style="color: #000000;">assumptions of British military and cultural superiority</span></a>" crumble suddenly before an occupying army that was absolutely merciless. The Japanese . . . were hated by almost everyone <span style="text-decoration: underline;">but everyone knew their power to do harm and so everyone adjusted</span>." People who accepted the Japanese as their new masters prospered, whereas those who did not lost money and status.</p>
              <p>Second, he learned that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">fear of brutal punishment can deter crime</span>:</p>
              <p><em>The Japanese Military Administration governed by spreading fear. It put up no pretence of civilised behaviour. Punishment was so severe that crime was very rare. In the midst of deprivation after the second half of 1944, when the people half-starved, it was amazing how low the crime rate remained. . . . As a result I have never believed those who advocate a soft approach to crime and punishment, claiming that punishment does not reduce crime. That was not my experience in Singapore before the war, during the Japanese occupation or subsequently. </em></p>
              <p>"I learnt more from the three and a half years of Japanese occupation," he states again a few pages later, "than any university could have taught me". A third lesson, in particular, remmained with him his entire life -- <span style="text-decoration: underline;">that power can make people change their ways of thinking and acting</span>:</p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #000000;">I had not yet read Mao's dictum that "power grows out of the barrel of a gun", but I knew that J</span></em><a href="http://sgforums.com/forums/10/topics/lky11.html"><em><span style="color: #000000;">apanese brutality</span></em></a><em><span style="color: #000000;">, Japanese guns, Japanese bayonets and swords, and Japanese terror and torture . . . could make people change their behaviour, even their loyalties. The Japanese not only demanded and got their obedience; they forced them to adjust to a long-term prospect of Japanese rule, so that they had their children educated to fit the new system, its language, its habits and its values, in order to be useful and make a living.</span></em></p>
