              <p>Kwek Leng Beng is definitely richer than that. I still think that he is still the richest in Singapore. 1.1Bil is an under statement. They only have figures for his listed companies he owns. Over the years, he has been investing privately in overseas properties and businesses. He was approached to partner in the IR, but in the end he refused because one of the requirements is to declare all his overseas assets.</p>
