            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Gentlemen,<br><br>I believe this talk about war with Singapore definitely presents a "<strong>CLEAR &amp; PRESENT DANGER</strong>" to Singapore. The Malaysian Government has definitely gone overboard in distracting its' citizen in their economic woes and trying to gain some votes for their up coming national elections.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">"A good neighbour doesn't threaten their neighbour with force when they fight over a pot of flowers on their corridor."  </span><br><br><strong>A gentle reminder </strong>: For those who are familar with the background which started the Gulf War, the Malaysian Government are behaving very similarly to the Iraqi Government except this time instead of cruel oil, it's WATER. The Iraqi Government had claimed that the Kuwaitis had occupied the Bubiyan Island which belongs to them and stole oil from the oil field. And the rest I guess every body know what happened.<br><br>The Malaysian Government may not be as crazy as the Iraqi. Let's not forget that we do not know what is in their mind exactly. The next thing they would claimed is that Singapore used to be part of the Johore Sultanate and wish to reclaimed their rights on the Island.<br><br>We definitely have to step up our vigilance against Malaysia but not over-reacting. We cannot let what happened to the Kuwaitis happen to us.<br><br>I think we (the citizens of Singapore) should show that we are united behind the Government of Singapore on their stand. We should show our protest by STOP visiting Malaysia, STOP importing their produce, STOP all forms of investment in Malaysia etc. (I believe the Singapore Government cannot and will not make such request on their citizens as it will be seen as a provoking act leading to war.)<br><br>We should not let the Malaysian Government dictate our lives.<br><br>And for all the NSMen, please treat your In-Camp Training seriously as we have a CLEAR &amp; PRESENT DANGER !!!!</div>
