The source can be gotten from the AVA on checks conducts on fresh product imports. We are also quite dependent on their skilled labour. Most Malaysian chinese cross over here everyday to work in the production lines and construction site. These jobs will be left blank and everything will come to a standstill. Business operator willpull out and we will suffer unless we want to take up these less disirable jobs in Singapore context. I used to work in a production line during school holiday, it quite monotonous.<br><br>On one hand, we want to boycott north products, on the other hand, we need to have fresh and cheap daily necessity to substain our needs, so it doesn't works this way.  We all product are import from other country, we will pay a premium price over it.  In an event of war, our Navy also had to protect these merchant ships as well. Our resources will be stretch. I use to patronise JB Giant once a fortnight in 1996 for a year. After these incidence, I cut down on my trips and totally none in 2002. Lately, I have visited JB again and I notice that the situation is quite the same. It shows that our people are not at all bothered by the current issues or have to choise but to continue to do their business over there. Thus we are still independent as neighbors. Boycott of M products and War is definately not the answer unless we are push to a corner.</div>

(BcusÂ’ they had intruded into our waterways, which undermine our sovereignty and test our patience. The government and commoner (we) canÂ’t take it anymore. It a good scenario to paint the picture as close to reality as possible.<br><br>(No hard feeling!) OK smoking gun, youÂ’re my best spy that we have had. I shall send you to gather intelligence cusÂ’ we need to know what they operational level. You gather enough intelligence to sent thru before your were caught. You were tortured badly enough to confess that you are a Singapore spy. Now we have really conducted an act of war and Malaysia, is using this opportunity to wack us. Oh! BTW, you are already dead from the torture, they will make sure of that anyway. (They donÂ’t even spare their Anwar, you are nothing) The first tank rolls in before the bridges are demolished. We fight a forward defense strategy by subdue, and secure all critical installations. We hold our ground in JB. In the process, we had lost hundreds if not  thousand of soldier in FIBUA. ThatÂ’s only a start.<br><br>For those who have died, they were lucky. For those who are maim, they will be dependent on the people back here to see them thruÂ’ the psychological and physical damages they will suffered for the rest of their live. For those who are badly injured, save the ones who got more chance of surviving, resources are stretch. For those who lost their love ones in the war, they will be screaming for justice and blood. For those who re-unite with their maimed loves ones, they were lucky to have them back, but not fully intact, the eye balls are still rotting in JB drains. For those who survive the forward defense action, they will still be defending their ground. It will only cost 25 cents a bullet to end their live if it hit the right spot, staying alive will be an art, being alive is uncertain.<br><br>Malaysia recovers from the on slaughter and regroup. It do or die as their country is invaded. (Who wouldnÂ’t). Jihad after Jihad, they sent into JB and occasionally, into City Hall MRT Station. HowÂ’s that to you, terrorize by such act? You wonÂ’t know that you are sitting beside a going to be bomber singing Â“Knocking on Heavens DoorÂ”. Well, Malaysia artillery started harassing our boys in JB. They will also shoot into Woodland area and further. One to one exchange, they lose JB, we lose our city but JB is just one the many they have got. The exchange is worth to them. We lose our morale but harden as well cus we just heard that Woodland Ave 5, 10 blocks of flats just toppled and hundreds are still buried alive. You canÂ’t communicate back to see if you loves have escape the disaster.<br><br>By the way to relate a personnel experience. When I was in NS back in old days during 1986, my corporal who was involved in the grenade accident (many years back then in Tekong) told us that when his deceased friendÂ’s Mum came to camp to receive his personnel effect, he overheard that the mum said in a conversation Â“I gave you a good good son and you return him to me like thatÂ” It was very sad. It is only a grenade exercise gone wrong and still not a war.  Imaging if hundred of mums say the same thing while, let say you are signing their death certificate and wiping their records from the computer as they do not need to pay income tax anymore. How about that?<br><br>To end it nicely, actually, you are suppose to play daddy in two months time but now, there is not even a body to bury. Â“PapaÂ” in the child vocabulary will come in only when he attend kindergarten few years later. When his friends ask where your dad, he will reply, what is dad? Can eat or not? His mum will say that in his early days, he was very brave and he died fighting a war. But all is not lost, we receive a state flag to worship.<br><br>So shall we still go for war when the diplomatic channel is still open and an ICJ to mediate? The current issues is just one of the many that Malaysia want to harass to garner votes before a major election although it is done in a poor taste. Please only start worrying when Singapore say pull out our Diplomat KL in 24 hrs time</span>.[/</span>b]<span class="large"></span></div>
