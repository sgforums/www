            <div class='col-md body'>Taking the whole of Malaysia is not an option, and I doubt either side would come to a point to resort to mass gender genocide in which every body must have gun (not that they have that many guns anyway).<br><br>However, what any basic commander knows is, how Singapore intends to fight a war is to use technology as a force multiplier, allowing less units to be more effective. At the break of a war, Singapore would certainly go for disabling the C3 network of an enemy and the main staging areas for delaying or distrupting the enemy counterassualt. If done well, the enemy's readiness and effectiveness drops massively unit a point it becomes so disorganized that it's no longer effective as a fighting force. Modern wars are fought by information and technology, less frequently by numbers. Air superiority must be achieved and doing so will massively distrupt the enemy further. When command is sparodic, supplies are low and morale is constantly bombarded, any army will be very ineffective.<br><br>So what would probably be the land "ambitions" of Singapore? Probably enough to create a "buffer" state and then sue for peace, if the Malaysians have no aready considered that option. That buffer state would probably consist of JB and not much more, enough to push the artty back so that they are shelling their own land, and to get counterbatteried or airstuck. In a 1 to 1 battle of attrition, Singapore artty will win out with much to spare, and that's not factoring the advanced technology.<br><br>So I propose that Singapore main tatics will lay on a few fronts, force multiplication via technology, preemptive or aggressive reactionary action, and limited land gains to bring the war away to enemy soil. Which has been pretty much any small country reaction reaction to larger foes, be it Germany versus Europe or Israel versus Arab Nations...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If you just hand out guns to every civilian and ask them to defend their country, you'll get a black hawk down type of incident when a train army invades, assuming they do not bombard them first. 1000+ dead for just 18 soldiers killed.

That's why most basically sane countries, (even malaysia) will not resort to this, they will prefer to keep it between thier armed forces, unless their PM is some power hungry dictator who only cares for his own skin and wealth at any cost, which he is not.<br><br></div>

If the main core of the MAF is seriously distrupted and destroyed in the JB battle instead of running rear to guard the rest of the states, the SAF should have little trouble, if they wanted, to move in into the rest of the country. However, there is little to be gained in such a manuver, taking JB would in a sense be holding a knife at point at KL's throat, and you dun have to drive it all the way in the prove that you're serious and are more then ready when push came to shove.<br><br>On the issue of arming every single Malaysian male with military weapons, not very likely. Firstly, they do not have anywhere near enough guns, and secondly, what you will get is more of a defensive rabble that is thrown together and will die together under the assault of a trained attacker who not only uses guns, but shells, missiles and other weaponary against which their popguns have no defence. Of course, should it come to this point, severe unintended damage to the civillian population and facilities will be unavoidable and I doubt both sides will think of trying anything like that unless threatened with total destruction. Of course idealogy figures into here too... Would people die for Mahathir or any other PM? Rethoric quickly dissappears in the face of shells and bullets, and I wonder how fast will their tune change. I predict civillians just staring as SM1 tanks roll into and past their streets.</div>
