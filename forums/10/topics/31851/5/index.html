            <div class='col-md body'>actually for US case , 2500 to 1 million is possible. But jus , wat type of war they want?<br><br>1 million can be crease to less than 500000 by a drop of a nuclear bomb , then that 500000 can be further crease into less than 100 000 within one week by the use of biological warfare....<br><br>but the problem is , US wants the war to be rather conventional as she jus want to overthrow the current lraqi govt.( same as afganistan ) So in this case i dun think it is wise for 2500 to fight a million. Technology is there to boost the strength of the 2500 but i believe in terms of fighting off a million , either the war is going to be ridiculously expensive or extremely bloody.<br><br>In history of warfare , there is a case where 250 000 soldiers fighting off an army of 1 million in the persian area. Anything is possible. There is even a legend where 3 men fight off an army ( i forgotten which legend liao ) , with the technology and the strategy , sometimes table can turn.....</div>
