If it is too long, I apologise. if it is deem to be nonsense, dismiss and ignore it.<br><br>From onset, I had been talking about restrain and with careful choise of word of discouragement on talks of wars, I hope I had managed). I did not sing along with you all guys about what tactic (Physical) to handle Malaysia. It is still absoultely unnecessary and it is also not my style to use perjorative on such subjects. Doing so only invite undue attention. It is an invitative to treat which can be seen from the previous exchanges between all "Cmain to be singaporean " posters against the two "claim to be Malaysian". My objection to join the crowd does not make a lesser Singaporean and there is no need to describe a word for me, I'm "flattered" anyway for such invitation.<br><br>If everyone have read the recent reports from Saturday (25 Jan 03) till todate, think deeply enough and understand it. It is trying to clarify our position to Malaysian Govt and public (if they could get hold of our ST) and let them judge from themselves, there is nothing to hide. Hoping that they could comprehen it and reflect upon the causes and effects and the tense situations both countries are in. The facts speak for itself. It will be most unfortunate if we ourselves read the papers, talk amongst ourselves and critise "North" of being whateverso and ampify explict details on how to "hammer" them back, we are no different from them and have just joint the same group of Northen press and their people who enjoy punching during past time. But I would say they are smarter, they have mentioned that" can't compromise, then go to war. But this is not a solution....". They stopped short of it. Alas, we continue from their statement and state how to sink RMN Boats with vivid details. We had just played into their hands. (Can be read on today's ST on how provacative Young PAP Forum was, I have not surf the net to verify it yet, but I believe there will be hot headed peoples who like to write such stuff).<br><br>Because Singapore Govt is being quiet during the past "I think since 1998 or whatever) on the spate of falsehood hurled by the northen people, it does not necessary means that Singapore are afraid and helpless. SG Govt had a bigger picture in mind, secure water requirements. Trust me, you can survive w/o food for two weak but you can survive w/o water for seven days. Because the situation is not favorable to us, it is still not lost as there is still an abritration clause to follow, which is as good as a judgment pass in Court.<br><br>Because SG Govt is also answerable to her people on the developments but was not able to disclose the details, they sealed their lips until concrete results are obtained in order not to jeapodize the negotiation, which is a correct ethic. When we tender for a contract, we do not go around disclosing the tender details. Tenderers will feel uncomfortable and opt out.<br><br>Because SG Govt feels that there is little hope to acheive a win-win situation with Mal Govt and their majority of people and us were not well informed but only hear the negative side of the story, the disclosure of letters was still to clarify the position we are in and let the world judge for themselves. ST is a well read publication although it may be a "controlled" media (I unreserverly apologise if I had make wrongly statement, don't sue me, pls).<br><br>Because I refuse to bend my principle to join in the foray, I was also classified as a coward and was opposing all other people posts. Well, some nameless shit net hero was even afraid to at least "PM" me and have the cheek to brand me. I have served my dues as a Singaporen and is still continuing to do so as a NS Men. When duty calls, no question ask. If the intent of this thread is "Either you are with me or against me", I will still choose the latter.<br><br>In the course of my reading, I had still not come across on which MP, Ministers, etc, that we look into war, whether as alternative or next step if the Arbitration will to fail. If there is a provided condition which a settlement must be met for still for a win-win situation, I believe SG Govt will still pursue it. By discussing talks of war (and explict details), it is dangerous, callous and play feelings into others and into the hands of the northen press, which will amplify more on us and said we are irresponsible. My opinion as stated since I joined in early January  03 had always been consistence with the reports in ST, loose talk of war is still totally unnecessary and it is classified as unconstructive. " Chue Kong Lan Pan Song". That's also the reason why I was acting as a bystander since the last few days. So is Malaysian press, waiting for an opportunity.<br><br>When the first bullet is exchange, the relationship between Singapore and Malaysia will never be the same again and history will be in the making. (To whose favour, nobody will know for sure)<br><br>This is my opinion. Thank you for your time.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>What it appears to be, is that even with the facts straight in their faces, they still sprout absolute denial of basic logic and contuine on irrational accusations of "insensitivity" and "disrespect". Okay, we're sorry we're so disrespectful as to expose their political boo boos and argumentative flaws, prehaps they could try doing the same to us (see if they can even find any sticking point) instead of crying fowl at every thing that makes them uncomfortable...</div>

From the beginning of your post till now, you had not tell anything new to the post as people all know that war bring great pain and damage to people, even for those who had not reach puberty understood that absolutely. While I guess that this is the stye of your kind who live a prosper life and wish to keep everything that you own now and not be disturb, that is fine with me even if you want to dig a hole and keep everything that you own inside and hide the rest of your life in it.  But please don't despair the others. When the war come, what do you think that we will use to fight? Technology? Or patriotism? Have we all forgotten who we are? Have we all forgotten what our country had given us? Is it worth fighting for? You ask yourself that.<br>You see Mr Quad, your option is not welcome here but still it is a forum for everybody included people like you. And you should be glad that people actually spend time to reading your contribution so in return, please don't go around jumping and crying just because people call you a crowd, they don't do that for no reason. And if you want to reply, please get to your point where people pointed out and not you create another new one thinking people will be deceive by that.<br>Your engineering of reply is quite creative, but if I were you, I'll copy and paste those fact from the newspaper achieve, they are much better writer  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Group together my fellow citizen and be as one, I'm sure nobody in Singapore will start a war first but if it come to us, we must stand together side by side and defend our country, we must tell them that we are not homeless kids, we have a home, and Singapore is our home. We will be with it till the end.<br>May God be with us.<br><br></div>
