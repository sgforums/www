They're simply playing with fire &amp; still seems to enjoy every moment of it.<br><br>Anyway, would also like to 'thanks' those idiots for 'highlighting' to us again &amp; again the importance of Singapore's defence &amp; our national unity.<br><br>I believe many of our citizens are more aware &amp; getting much more serious about our national security - as we're facing more obvious threats from the Twin Terrors,namely, the Terrorist + the M'sian Politicians. The intention of these 2 groups are the same - both possess the thoughts of harming Singapore.<br><br>Nobody like to see war...but somehow i feel that perhaps the only 'good' thing abt war is the 'opportunity' to kill &amp; destroy those who have the thoughts of harming us. It's like having a war with terrorist; although lives will be lost, it's also very harmful if nothing was done to destroy them.<br><br>So let's not be too afraid to kill - if the situation really requires us to defence our rights. Should see that as an opportunity to express our anger towards the opponent's politicians, &amp; we'll be more motivated to fight. And the opportunity to personally kill the opponent's politicians should be the ultimate aim.<br><br>Hope the bloody m'sian politician read this. U're thinking of war? Good.

EIther they don't understand the meaning of sports or they are enjoying bashing at Singapore as a form of SPORTS !!!!! Dumb Malaysians !!!!!!  </span><br><br><span class="large"><strong>Malay Mail Highlight: SPORT HIGHLIGHT</strong></span><br><span class="large">What if war broke out between Malaysia and Singapore: Bombs away![/b]Haris Hussain and Marhalim Abas</span><br><br>ITÂ’S 4am.<br><br>The early morning calm is suddenly shattered by the deafening screams of low-flying jets.<br><br>Seconds later, Kuantan air base is rocked by multiple explosions, followed by Â“secondariesÂ” as MalaysiaÂ’s air assets in aircraft shelters and revetments are obliterated.<br><br>Klaxons blaring, pilots are scrambled to whichever aircraft that are still air-worthy, but itÂ’s useless. The runways had been cratered.<br><br>In the ensuing confusion, reports start streaming in. It seems that this is not an isolated case.<br><br>Butterworth checks in and reports that its entire complement of F/A-18D Hornets are now smoking, twisted hulks out on the tarmac.<br><br>And the entire Third Division which has overall command over Johor and Malacca had also been annihilated.<br><br>The National Power Grid had not been spared, plunging the entire country in darkness, adding to the chaos and confusion.<br><br>Reports also indicated that the Ministry of Defence building in Jalan Padang Tembak, Kuala Lumpur, had been hit by at least six GBU-31 1,000-pound JDAMs (Joint Direct Attack Munitions).<br><br>Even the KLCC had been struck with such ferocity that only the Maxis Tower was left standing.<br><br>On Bukit Nanas, only a blackened stump is left of what used to be the Kuala Lumpur Tower.<br><br>Down in Johor and Malacca, the situation is much worse. A torrent of armoured vehicles, including tanks, are hogging all the roads linking Johor Baru to Muar and Kota Tinggi, disgorging armed soldiers who took over all the towns.<br><br>Senai airport, captured in a pre-dawn attack was being used by the helicopters and planes taking part in the on-going offensive.<br><br>On the North-South Expressway, main battle tanks and armoured fighting vehicles together with towed artillery with fighter jets and attack helicopters providing close support were going north, destination unknown.<br><br>Reports of troops landing from helicopters were coming in from all over Johor, from Mersing to Muar.<br><br>By noon, Johoreans find themselves under Singapore military rule.<br><br>If you think the scenario described above are wild imaginings of The Malay Mail writers, think again.<br><br>The scenario, in less graphic form, was written by a British scholar, Tim Huxley, in his book Defending the Lion City: The Armed Forces of Singapore.<br><br>It was published in 2000 as part of a series which examine the military capabilities of Asian countries by Australian publishing company Allen &amp; Urwin.<br><br>HuxleyÂ’s book, which is available at local bookstores, offers a fascinating look at a little-known but effective military organisation.<br><br>Among others, it brought up issues that were almost never discussed - including sensitive questions of war plans with SingaporeÂ’s neighbours.<br><br>Drawing on Israeli and other foreign experts and using only their countryÂ’s limited resources, the Singaporeans have moulded a technologically sophisticated and large military that is capable of striking far from the island State.<br><br>Given the countryÂ’s absence of natural resources and lack of strategic depth, said Huxley, itÂ’s a remarkable achievement.<br><br>He said while the Singapore military has not yet been tested in real combat, few observers doubt its professional ability.<br><br>In the second chapter of his book, Huxley points out that Malaysia was the most likely adversary to Singapore, with Indonesia second.<br><br>He gave a detailed picture of how the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) capabilities were tailored to meet such adversaries.<br><br>Huxley wrote: Â“While it is clear that the SAF is sufficiently flexible in terms of its organisation, equipment and doctrines to be useful in wide national security contingencies, its capabilities have been refined with specific contingencies in mind Â— above all, the possibility of war with or in Malaysia.Â”<br><br>Singapore defence planners have also planned a war with or in Indonesia.<br>Huxley said such plans have been played in SAF staff college exercises since the 1960s.<br><br>He said that from the Singapore viewpoint, a war with Malaysia could be triggered due to communal conflict in Malaysia which resulted in the disruption of water supply from Johor.<br><br>Singapore, according to Huxley, have not dropped plans for a pre-emptive strike.<br><br>Huxley further states: Â“To make intervention possible, the SAF would need to disable the Malaysian Armed Forces (MAF) with a brutal and fearless pre-emptive offensive or at least retain such capability as to execute such an attack after absorbing an initial (Malaysian) onslaught.<br><br>Â“Probably in conjunction with electronic attacks on the MAFÂ’s communication and sensors (such as radars), the SAF would first attempt to establish air superiority by devastating the Malaysian air force - in the first few hours of any conflict - before mounting further air strikes against other military targets.<br><br>Â“SingaporeÂ’s army would then seize the initiative on the ground with commandos - infiltrated by air and sea - and helimobile Guards unit securing the Malaysian side of the Causeway in Johor Baru and the Second Link bridge in Gelang Patah.<br><br>Â“Combined armed forces, most importantly, armoured battle groups equipped with tanks and other armoured fighting vehicles, would then cross into Johor and rapidly advance into the Peninsula.<br><br>Â“They would be supported by Guards battalions and transport helicopters, strike aircraft and attack helicopters.Â”<br><br>The Singaporean Navy will also play a vital role by landing troops on JohorÂ’s coast while keeping the sea-lanes around the island from any blockage by the Malaysian navy.<br><br></div>
