This however, makes it easier for the EU to carry out certain programs than ASEAN since their members have all attained a certain standard of development.<br><br>One day, like the honest comments of these two children, we can openly say that we are a Thai, Malay, an Indian, Vietnamese, Sumatran, Javanese, Achenese, Chinese, Filipino Â– all these names of our birth origin as a source of identity, without the need of feeling politically racist or nationalistic.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Sorry, I dun understand this paragraph.  We already openly refer to ourselves by our race where appropriate, and by our nationality if it is more fitting to the occasion.<br><br>War between Singapore and Malaysia will be disastrous for both countries, and also for this whole ASEAN region.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Agreed.<br><br>We should be better than those hot headed guys with goatees that are only good at waving placards and shouting slogans and making wild rhetoric in public places.<br><br>Let us not show our cards too early, but play it cool.<br><br>Towards this end, I respect our Ministers for their levelheaded responses in the Press and in Public, when questions are raised as to our response to the MalaysianÂ’s wild behaviour and provacative rhetoric.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Hopefully, Sg ministers continue that way.  Malaysian leaders however, do not reflect the opinon of all their people.  It would be interesting to hear the view of a Malaysian able to keep his/her cool and with a keen eye on the issue.<br><br></div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i find that the prize should be given to Mazohyst and Atobe for voluntarily crease fire and somemore make friends.<br><br>BTW , back to the topic.<br><br>Is Singapore or Malaysia , that being viewed by the international circles as SEA's powerhouse?<br><br>Malaysia's attitude to Singapore is like a big brother to a small brother . However Singapore attitude is like '' we are here in SEA for good , we will run on our belief ......so get off my back!''<br><br>Malaysia thinking is that '' y singapore always restrict our rights " , where Singapore reply that '' UR rights SUX "<br><br>Malaysia media thinks that the media in Singapore is controled by the government. I think that the media in Malaysia is blindly following the government. And the government in malaysia is blindly following religon and race.<br><br>With two different thinkings living side by side , im sure more problems will arise. Malaysia's Govt now is playing the pple's feeling , where Singapore is standing firm. Unless one back off or the ICJ quickly settle the dispute , i dun think the dispute could end so easily. IF singapore will to wack and invade malaysia , due to some reasons. The result will be like current west-bank and Gaza Strip. Both party will lose out eventually.</div>
