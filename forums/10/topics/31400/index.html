Therefore Singapore will have an early warning if any hostile war ships coming close to us.<br><br>2. the radar system which we have over there can easily scan through some part of Malaysia and Indonesia, which it can aids in our defense.<br><br>3. from the light house to singapore, if by a normal war ship with a 30 knots speedÂ… it take ard 90min b4 they can visually see usÂ…. And it take at least 60min b4 a naval warship can perform their NGS towards us (distance for them to fire their gun in an effective range... and we are toking abt those war ships which is NEAR to us malaysai or indonesia lah!!!)Â… so, we still have ample of time to react if such crisis happen!!Â…<br><br>anyway, thatÂ’s what I knowÂ…. any comment???   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br></div>

You seem to think that people actually want to know all that... As for how I live my life, I don't think its any of your business... I don't need some pompous ass who thinks he knows everything about everything and how the world should be run telling me what to do. As for your attempts to appear knowledgable... who are you trying to impress? Your need to show off your knowledge only shows you've got an inferiority complex, and thus you write all that crap to show how smart you are. Perhaps you could try and address your own insecurities before trying to tell everyone how they should do things...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Based on the latest singapore govt rebutting over malaysia's claim on pedra branca...<br><br>IT would seem that... in the view of singapore... pedra branca was never a part of johor sultanate and ( in my opinion) pedra branca could actually be UNCLAIMED or formerly part of indonesia prior to the anglo dutch treaty of 1824.....<br><br>Thus there is no need for the brits to first obtain authorisation from the johor sultanate prior to passing it to singapore since the island of pedra branca was 'occupied' or gained from indonesia due to the treaty of 1824...<br><br>As such...  since pedra branca was never a part of johor sultanate... there is no validity in malaysia's claim...<br><br>AND even if pedra branca was part of johor sultanate... so is singapore... IF malaysia (which later incorporated johor into its federation) can claim rightful claim to pedra branca... SO can singapore!!<br><br>In fact... if not because of the treaty of 1824... singapore can even claim the riau islands base on mahmoods founding of the johor riau sultanate....<br><br>AND if not because of the separation agreement of 1965 that sent singapore onto independence... singapore can also claim JOHOR!!<br><br>Finally... when i spoke to many malay friends... they told me that the current sultan of johor was NOT of real royal blood... but was actually the descendants of a temengong (or was it a laksamana?)..... so technically... does he have the DIVINE power to sign johor into the malaysian federation is also open to question......<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>more and more dirty linen is coming into the public ... isnt it?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
