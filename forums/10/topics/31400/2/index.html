The Hussein line, which Raffles collaborated with to sign the 1819 treaty got SO degenerate and SO seriously in debt that his pension was given over as collateral to an Indian money lender in return for cash advances... that was why he kept fighting for a more substantial pension from the brits. (not to mention that the brits actively encouraged him to gamble  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> )<br><br>He eventually got SO degenerate that the brits found it convenient and desirable to ignore them.

They rather deserved it in those days... they were forward looking, very wealthy, because they were involved in trade and commerce while the Kampong Glam "sultan" just sat around, fucked bum (no REALLY!!!
