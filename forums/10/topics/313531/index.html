              <p>From the early days of democracy, civilizations have progressed and the
              many tyrannies of authoritarian regimes of the past overthrown with
              freeing of millions from persecutions and genocides.<br> <br> This historical perspective of democracy - free election, enshrining of
              rights of choosing of government by one-man-one-vote system,
              accountability and responsibility of government to the people etc - is
              enough for people all over the world to choose democracy.<br> <br> But authoritarian regimes are clever and artful hypocrites. They try to
              justify their selfish rule by all sorts of artful devices one of which
              is to take over control of the media with all kinds of excuses so as to
              use the media to play down on democracy and play up on their selfish
              policies and at the end claim false victories of their leadership or
              talents.<br> <br> Singapore is one such authoritarian rule which uses artful devices like
              taking over of the press and state media to justify their authoritarian
              rule causing rich-poor divide and impoverishment of the lower and
              middle class citizens.<br> <br> Only a few elites in power and the rich are able to benefit from people
              taxes and surpluses which were constantly used for their own purposes.<br> <br> Consequences of such authoritarian selfish rule - rising costs of
              living to the ordinary citizens who are now driven to the wall so to
              speak with hundreds of thousands hardly able to keep up paying the
              state-controlled housing and large nos facing prospect of hardship
              despite the media claiming all the good news on behalf of the governing
              elites.<br> <br> People are now losing their retirement and all their savings paying all the non-stop taxes and fee increases.<br> <br> Yet some of the citizens are unaware and are giving in to propagandas
              listening to the comparison bad news to forget or drown in their
              miseries.<br> <br> We the active citizens have no choice but do our share of duty to stay
              the course and not let the governing elites get away with untruths and
              untruths and get them to notice that people are asking for fair play
              and justice and equity and not any more nonsense.<br> <br> That is not a small mission. It will require fiery passion on the part
              of all active citizens to come here and share our thoughts and decide
              what our society finally is to be.<br> <br> The buck stops here. Ball is at our feet.</p>
