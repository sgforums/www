              <p>Hey, lau Uncle, me also visit their kampong places, and till
                      now, many still contact me when they come to singapore or when i go
                      there, i also can contact them, we also stay at their houses, and
                      they also come and stay at our houses, live like we do, attend our
                      school, exchange programme is only about 2 weeks.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>From Pri 3, I started to go china shanghai during my
                      school holidays and so on in Upper pri, sec sch, etc etc . Now i
                      can travel on myself, and for example, it is good for us as we can
                      also communicate in the nets, on the other hand, it is good for our
                      business, as we grew up, we share business and culture talks that
                      help us alot in our daily business.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We must learn to live in a compassionate way, i hv seen the slum
                      places in most of these countries where the disparity of rich and
                      poor is damn far apart. That brighted our insight that we 
                      alway have an open arms instead of a close one and more important
                      we should appreciate what our govt had done for us.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Me live in Indian Mumbai slum places before, thai kampong,
                      vietnam padi field etc etc, in India, i met my pal in school, she
                      was wearing slipper, i chose to be her pal, because i want to
                      know more about poor human life, imagine for the whole week, i got
                      only rice, shit squatting with people collecting my shit, wake up
                      with dirty dogs, go to school walking 5km of dirt road...and 1000
                      slum people keep looking at me. Omg, what an experience. But we
                      will young, and the best of part of young is there no feeling of
                      poor or rich, just enjoy life whatever it takes. I played cricket
                      with backstreet indian boys too.</span></strong></p>
              <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span></strong>

              <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span></strong>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">And when they cannot manage to come to singapore, i begged my
                      grandmother to sponsor them, and when they arrived and visit my
                      school and my joo chiat house, OMG!, they thought they are in
                      Heaven, today she is a determine beautiful lady like me, cos she
                      saw the differences, she is determine to help and to get out of the
                      slum. She travelled alot to do her works (IT programmers), my
                      grandma sponsor here too, and when she visited us with her mother,
                      she will kneel and bow down to the floor to greet my grandma in the
                      morning, afternoon and night. That is the spirit of friendship in
                      an international arena. Thru sisterhood or brotherhood, together we
                      strife the comadarieship.</span></strong></p>

              <p><br>long time no see Fishbuff :) Im in SINGAPORE as i speak muahahaha very nice food ...jealous anot brother hahaha joking lar actually i got sick of eating my 12th chicken rice le .... i met Mid9sun over drinks recently too and a bunch of forumners that was fun. One day I'll meet u fish be it here or au.</p>
              <p>Regarding the hogwash about migration and all that. People will at the end of the day do what is best for them no matter what they profess in forums and shout boxes. It is a matter of choice ... you either have the choice or don't and even so you either take it up or don't.</p>
              <p>There are clear advantages (there are disadvantages of course but others will fill the gap) of having a foreign PR or migrating to a better country. Here are 2 examples.</p>
              <p>Holding foreign PR and SG citizenship. SG government likes to give u ang pow $ and foreign govts like to give you $ if you are unemployed and medical subsidies. Use the $ from SG govt and use the subsidised medical subsidies in foreign countries. Retrenched? Foreign countries gives u monthly $ if u are unemployed and SG gives you ang pow $..... whats the problem lol.</p>
              <p>Loan $ from SG at 2.5% interest rate ( damn low sia ) ..... in some way where you go find out yerself lol (have to convince bank)..... deposit it in foreign country bank fixed deposit 5% (meybe more lazy to check nowadays haha) ... u earn 2.5% excl forex charges.</p>
              <p>If i had a choice ferget the ang pow $ lar.... better SG govt give subsidies and help the elderly ba.... ang pow $ lol.... used to subsidise my hotel bill meybe ba</p>
