              <p>yes, exchange program is good experience, better than being bogged down in a single countries for years, and having limited views on just the host country and home country.</p>
              <p>People who gets bogged down for a few years tend to get full of themselves, and think they are better than others for no good reasons...</p>
              <p>However, they are also losing in the aspect of experience in their home country, which will change very quickly, while the experience they gain may not be relevant and is misguided in the home country anyway...</p>

              <p>Hey, lau Uncle, me also visit their kampong places, and till now, many still contact me when they come to singapore or when i go there, i also can contact them, we also stay at their houses, and they also come and stay at our houses, live like we do, attend our school, exchange programme is only about 2 weeks.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>From Pri 3, I started to go china shanghai during my school holidays and so on in Upper pri, sec sch, etc etc . Now i can travel on myself, and for example, it is good for us as we can also communicate in the nets, on the other hand, it is good for our business, as we grew up, we share business and culture talks that help us alot in our daily business.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We must learn to live in a compassionate way, i hv seen the slum places in most of these countries where the disparity of rich and poor is damn far apart. That brighted our insight that we  alway have an open arms instead of a close one and more important we should appreciate what our govt had done for us.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Me live in Indian Mumbai slum places before, thai kampong, vietnam padi field etc etc, in India, i met my pal in school, she was wearing slipper, i chose to be her pal, because i want to know more about poor human life, imagine for the whole week, i got only rice, shit squatting with people collecting my shit, wake up with dirty dogs, go to school walking 5km of dirt road...and 1000 slum people keep looking at me. Omg, what an experience. But we will young, and the best of part of young is there no feeling of poor or rich, just enjoy life whatever it takes. I played cricket with backstreet indian boys too.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And when they cannot manage to come to singapore, i begged my grandmother to sponsor them, and when they arrived and visit my school and my joo chiat house, OMG!, they thought they are in Heaven, today she is a determine beautiful lady like me, cos she saw the differences, she is determine to help and to get out of the slum. She travelled alot to do her works (IT programmers), my grandma sponsor here too, and when she visited us with her mother, she will kneel and bow down to the floor to greet my grandma in the morning, afternoon and night. That is the spirit of friendship in an international arena. Thru sisterhood or brotherhood, together we strife the comadarieship.</p>
