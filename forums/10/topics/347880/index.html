              <p>don't know why the topic on "dozens leaving Australia for good" was locked. in that thread, a question from fishbuff1 was directing at me and I feel compelled to reply.</p>
              <p>"have u consider moving back to malaysia since u are a malaysian?"</p>
              <p>I am not a malaysian. I was born in Malaysia, part of my education was done in Singapore, I served NS and now a reservist. I was officially granted singapore citizenship according to the constitution of Singapore. so there is no question about moving back as a malaysian.</p>
              <p>We moved to Singapore because my father decided on where his new home should be, and he sold everything he had to move here. there was never any consideration that we might want to go back to Malaysia. and when my parents moved to Malaysia, they never thought they would want to go back to China.</p>
              <p>In today's situation, one can easily find out what is life in another country. many young couples are even taking up jobs in many other countries to try out what life is like out side singapore. these are not migration, singapore remain their homes.</p>
              <p>To migrate means to uproot and move to another place and build homes there. That is what my parents did when they left malaysia.</p>
              <p>I have been to Australia, America and Canada and many other countries many many times, on business and on leisure trips. I enjoy the countries, different life styles of different people in different countries. Singapore is too small and certainly cannot give me the kind of variety in lives. No four seasons, natural scenary.....but Singapore is my home.</p>
              <p>Migrating is no trial and error, it is a decision, once made, no return, no regret. may be my children may want to move out of Singapore and live somewhere else, that is their choice.</p>

              no, not true. migration is not a decision of no return. i know of someone who migrated to u.s. but came back to sg after a few years.
              
              on the other hand, one of my relatives who has been residing in hk for 20 years but was posted to work here last year, says that she still prefers hk.
              
              i would say to migrate or not is to each his/her own.

              <p>My family's migration to Singapore was my dad's decision. I came as a small kid. I have enjoyed my stay in Singapore, the schools, the society, and even NS. I was given a chance to denounce Singapore citizenship, but I accepted (and then went NS).</p>
              <p>My jobs has given me the opportunties to travel to many countries. Just before 1997, the hongkongers were desperately looking for a new country; indonesians chinese left Indonesia for good after the last racial riots; many taiwanese were desperately looking for new place to live when China (PRC) responded to ah bian's policy on taiwan independence; malaysian chinese are constantly looking to migrate to a place where they don't have to be second class citizens. All these happened within my life time, and I have always asked myself, discussed with my wife and friends, should we move out of singapore? my final answer is, you can locked in, NO.</p>
              <p>What I am saying is that migrating is a major decision that warrant lots of deliberation and discussions within the family. If we were not sure, we could, thank God, afford to go and try out for ourselves what life would be like. Migration is not a habit, not tradition. It is a conscious decision, to say yes or no.</p>
              <p>My parents couldn't call China home; they also cannot call Malaysia home (he speaks only hainanese and mandarin); he finally settled in Singapore where he calls home. I call Singapore home. But if my children would later find another place to build their home, it is their decisions.</p>
              <p>I agree with you whole heartedly, there is no need to put up a falsefront, it is not a shameful thing to migrate or not to migrate. Just dont talk about migrating but leave their CPF here, just in case; and there is no need come here to justify their decision by putting Singapore down. Actually, those who stay in Singapore are not necessarily patriotic to Singapore, they just have no where to go.</p>

              <p>well, im particular of being called a "quitter" by someone that
                  is not native to singapore.</p>
              <p>im a 3rd generation singaporean and <span style="color: #ff00ff;">it irritates me alot to
                  hear how foreign-borned nationals who took up recent SG citizenship
                  and jump onto the bandwagons of PAP suckups to dennounce the exodus
                  of singaporeans to other countries.</span></p>
              <p>that is why i distinctively remember your posting quite
                  "fondly".</p>

              <p>cant u see they like to play along...until they get their green card and Work permit to other countries like Australia, USA ect.</p>
              <p>If i am the PAPA, i will impose sanctions on them if they revoke their PR and try to fly off to countries without giving birth to children in sg to serve NS.</p>

              <p>don't know why the topic on "dozens leaving Australia for good" was locked. in that thread, a question from fishbuff1 was directing at me and I feel compelled to reply.</p>
              <p>"have u consider moving back to malaysia since u are a malaysian?"</p>
              <p>I am not a malaysian. I was born in Malaysia, part of my education was done in Singapore, I served NS and now a reservist. I was officially granted singapore citizenship according to the constitution of Singapore. so there is no question about moving back as a malaysian.</p>
              <p>We moved to Singapore because my father decided on where his new home should be, and he sold everything he had to move here. there was never any consideration that we might want to go back to Malaysia. and when my parents moved to Malaysia, they never thought they would want to go back to China.</p>
              <p>In today's situation, one can easily find out what is life in another country. many young couples are even taking up jobs in many other countries to try out what life is like out side singapore. these are not migration, singapore remain their homes.</p>
              <p>To migrate means to uproot and move to another place and build homes there. That is what my parents did when they left malaysia.</p>
              <p>I have been to Australia, America and Canada and many other countries many many times, on business and on leisure trips. I enjoy the countries, different life styles of different people in different countries. Singapore is too small and certainly cannot give me the kind of variety in lives. No four seasons, natural scenary.....but Singapore is my home.</p>
              <p>Migrating is no trial and error, it is a decision, once made, no return, no regret. may be my children may want to move out of Singapore and live somewhere else, that is their choice.</p>

              <p>if you find somewhere you belonging to , then it's your home, even you migrate to America, though you are not called native American, but you are American indeed,</p>

              <p>Currnetly, the US trade is about $15 trillion and China is about $1.5 trillion. In about 25 years times, China will surpass the US as the number 1 economy in the world.<br><br>Seriously, your children will be better off working and living in China.</p>
              <blockquote><em>I agree with you whole heartedly, there is no need to put up a falsefront, it is not a shameful thing to migrate or not to migrate. Actually, those who stay in Singapore are not necessarily patriotic to Singapore, they just have no where to go.</em></blockquote>
              <p>I knew of a Sri Lanka refugee, family members all died in war. Air-lifted to start a new life in Finland. <br><br>Long story shortened, he slogged to get three master degrees and he told me this - many countries offered him citizenship, US, britain, finland, etc and he can walk into any country to apply for citizenship. <br><br>But he choose Singaporea and I was curious. Apparently, he chose here for practical reason - love. He married a Singapore Indian air stewardess.<br><br>My point is this - if anyone wishes to migrate - be prepare to have financial, business or academic resource to do so. If you have it, you can be like my friend - a global citizen of the world. <br></p>
