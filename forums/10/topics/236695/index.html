At 6 o'clock, it's already jammed up. I think you're going to have a lot of social problems, a lot of people are going to be very unhappy," said one Singaporean.<br><br>"May not have enough of space unless you develop more reclaimed areas," said another.<br><br>"I'm slightly worried, but in the future if we want anything we will have to work for it."<br><br>"I think its not too healthy to have such a large population. Perhaps we should have quality population."<br><br>Such concerns should be addressed, says one sociologist, otherwise they will build up to become tensions within the society.<br><br>Associate Professor Pauline Straughn, Sociologist, NUS, said: "We should then therefore look towards this positively but be mindful that it has to be treated with great sensitivity. You want to assure Singaporeans that they are not going to be displaced or replaced, rather this would complement their quality of life and this will work towards ensuring a more stable Singapore. We have to be mindful that you have to keep in dialogue with Singaporeans, continue to engage them."<br><br>Professor Straughn says that even as the government grows the population and embarks on urban planning for the future, it must be mindful that the hardware must be complemented by the software, especially when it comes to caring for the elderly population.<br><br>Professor Straughn says: "As we progress, these changes must be sympathetic to older Singaporeans who may not be able to change as quickly. When we start to build high-rise, how do older Singaporeans adapt to it? It's not a matter of leaving an old home and going to a nice new one, but it's also a displacement of friendships, community ties, of familiarity."<br><br>Professor Straughn adds that it's also important that as Singapore attracts more foreigners here, it should also take measures to retain its citizens.<br><br>Professor Straughn said: "I think that it's also important that we look at quality of life, from other aspects like what could make somebody choose Singapore as home and stay as home. We have to ensure that to sustain the growth in Singapore, to sustain good harmonious relations within our country, within our society, we also look into nurturing relationships, into quality of life.<br><br>In terms of housing for the future, property analysts expect Singapore's landscape to change with more taller buildings to make up for the lack of land, as well as changes in flat size.<br><br>Chris Koh, Director, Dennis Wee Properties, said: "In the area of housing, not so tight control of height restrictions and we see apartments going higher. Now you have 2 apartment per level but to house a bigger population, you'll probably be down to 3 apartments on that level so therefore I will admit that the apartment may be smaller."<br><br>The government has said it will also look into rejuvenating old estates to create more space for public housing. - CNA/ch<br></div>
