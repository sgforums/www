I don't advocate the downfall of PAP, rather a credible and sizable opposition to control their arrogance, and keep them down to earth.

They really did a good job.<br><br>If the entire govt disappears, I do believe there will be some chaos, no matter how you look at it. We WON'T die, but we will suffer to some extent</div>

This is very true --&gt; "We can't keep on relying on one party forever, we have not try it and we already fear the effect and result. That is why the PAP are attacking these weak spot, saying if we don't choose them, we will have a horrible ending".    This is the reason why they are becoming more and more arrogant and more into constant increasing of the cost of living here.<br><br>"In the end, nothing seem to improve, I see alot of shops closed down due to high rent, PUB ".   One of the HDB shop owner pointed at the rubbish container placed by HDB.  She said they the shop owner did not ask for it but HDB simply placed it there to collect rent.  They don't need the rubbish container at all.   Govt earning $$$$ at the expense of the shop owner who struggle to make a living.  So sickening and uncalled for!!  She told me many of the other shops closed down because the rental from govt is too high for them to go on their business.

And I thank them for that.<br><br>But right now, I'm a bit more concerned about issues of the present and the future. They can harp all they want about their glorious past, but if they can't convince me that they can help bring a properous future to my country, then I have to question them about that.<br><br>To use an analogy.... If you did very well for your PSLE ten years ago, then I congratulate you for it. But right now I'm a lot more concerned about your most current grade point average.</div>

If the PAP want mandate from our citizens... then stop all the GRC vote and let everyone of us get a chance to vote.See if the PAP can get more than 50% of vote to carry on their rule anot.Alot of my friend support workers party because they told me it's their only way to stop a dynasty from been born.Well, but too bad they can't give their vote to the Opposition because they are staying in somewhere which was a walkover.And because it's a walkover... the PAP claim that they got the full support from most Singaporeans which i think is not true at all.That's why i think let every vote count to see if most Singaporeans support PAP policies or not!!!!!<br>Everyone.... stand up for what is right!!!!!!!!!</div></blockquote>Do you know what you are asking?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  Is it a case of winner takes all? What if PAP get more than 50%, will there be any oppositions in the parliament? if they don't get all, whose policies will be implemented?<br><br>Besides, in a national poll like this, many people will vote to maintain status quo. Honestly not many people want to make a completely change to the current situation, especially in the absence of a workable alternative.<br><br>If there is a call for all singaporean to write a note to the politician they support, how many do you think will write to the opposition, how many would even take the trouble to write? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br>Lets be practical, just support your local opposition, before, during and after election, even if it is just moral support.
