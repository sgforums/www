Do anything get changed at all in the current government?<br><br>If you're posting during your office hours, you're stealing your employers' time, not to mention unauthorised usage of his equipment.

All infered from some article or experiences your had came across? Did anyone really go do a survey or something to support your suggestion against removing pap? Did anyone really sit down and think about the consequences?<br><br>If you can't even convinced the majority here to your views, how the hell do u think u can do one tiny thing to change the government?<br><br>Really let's break it down.<br>If the opposition parties will to replace pap people tmr, what's going to happen to the economy?<br><br>Clue1 : US election bush vs gore.<br>Clue2: If Sim Wong Hoo were to be replace by some unknown, with all the staff reminding the same, what will happen to creative's share price?</div></blockquote>Relax man! This is not consider complaint, it just a discussion forum.  It is just how pple voiced out their doubts &amp; thoughts here.  keeping silence is very stressful &amp; presurrized leh. Haha<br><br>I do see some change, I see PM donate a little bit of the money from the 2% GST collected from public and donated under his name. Maybe they are sending spy to view our threads. I do see hougang vote increase from 50 something to 60 something in percent.<br><br>Did anyone mention steal employer time to type this, u forgot there are time off, tea break, lunch time plu self-employed? hehe..... do u see 1000 posting in one thread under one user name? So now, I see ur posting, is it mean u r   posting during your office hours, you're stealing your employers' time, not to mention unauthorised usage of his equipment. Just kidding<br><br>If I have million dollar salary like the MP, I can recruit pple to do survey.  Transportion cost is another factor I consider but it getting higher in Singapore. All expense pay by Who? Any recommendation? I try to benchmark my salary with Bill Gate but reject by my boss who say he himself only have $5000 to spent per month due to high rental, pub, corporate tax etc<br><br>Like I say, everyone come here to discuss, joke and voicing out doubts, isn't it fun?</div>
