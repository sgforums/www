              <p>oil price has dropped - Malaysia has cut its oil price 6 % or
              so.</p>
              <p>meanwhile we have heard YOUR Electricity bills will hike by 22
              %.</p>
              <p>meanwhile Transport operators have already hiked fares.</p>
              <p>Guess what reason they used?</p>
              <p>that said, I still think we should all keep absolutely
              quiet as 1st world citizens of the educated kind. Why I say this?
              Since I watched BlogTV last night, somehow my mind has
              changed.....accept....HIKEs....part of ....life......</p>
              <p>Best entertainers in BlogTV includes: that CEO , FD, and our
              very handsome Metro-Sexual dude.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans should not utter a word about hikes now and in the
              future, whatever has been lined up. You think no more
              right?  </p>
              <p>I call for the bombastic leaders salaries to be hikes by 22 % as
              well during year end in addition to their bombastic bonuses.</p>
              <p>I call for all to avoid protesting. We should remain status quo
              - no protest till eternity. Must slog to support the rich get
              richer and let the poor get poorer if they want to. You break your
              rice bowl, that is YOUR problem.</p>
              <p>Listen to the MSM news everyday .</p>
              <p>Read the MSM news everyday.  Buy it at 80cents, no
              90cents, a pop.</p>
              <p>Watch the MSM news by Melissa and Melvin everyday.</p>
              <p>Repeat what is said during your sleep.</p>
              <p>When you wake up, I think you may or may not feel good.</p>
              <p>I am lucky, I feel good every morning.</p>
              <p>I think incompetent sporeans should gentlemanly give their jobs
              to foreigners.</p>
              <p>I think sporeans should embrace our new immigrants and FTs and
              their family tree that comes along.</p>
              <p>I think sporeans should not question about TRANSPARENCY or lack
              of it.</p>
              <p>I think sporeans should continue to throw money into the stock
              market else who is gonna earn from stocks or how to save rich
              people stuck money in stocks?</p>
              <p>I think sporeans should spend and spend, Pay And Pay, work and
              work and trust our leaders.</p>
              <p>I think Protest is wrong.</p>
              <p>I think voicing up for others is not required as we are
              pragmatic people - Where got time?  People lose their
              rice bowl, that is THEIR problem.</p>
              <p>I think people especially the young should stop thinking of
              Opposition. Erase this word from your dictionary.</p>
              <p>I hope the people can consider skipping the election as in let
              the ruling continue for eternity but we remain on paper as
              democracy and have election once every few blue moons. Reason :
              save tax payer money.</p>
              <p>I hope Activists can replace some if not all of the needs for
              Opposition who , ask yourselves, have done what ..... ?</p>
              <p>I no no.</p>
              <p>How to migrate har? erm....i mean I like to understand the
              process. My fren ask me.</p>

              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">That hits the nail. They sell so much propaganda about how they are the best and they deserve the massive amounts of public money they take, their relatives, sons, daughter-in-laws are the best and having an opposition is bad, that is what they tell you in their propaganda....</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><br></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">So how come Singapore is number one Asian nation in a recession? So how come Temasek and GIC is apparently losing one hundred billion dollars? So how come the Singapore dollar cannot rise?</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><br></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">.... when the despots attack Dr Chee Soon Juan, do not turn a blind eye to the victimization, do not say, let them attack "them" as long as they do not come after "me". When they attack Dr Chee Soon Juan, they are attacking every Singaporean.</span></span></p>

              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">You are wrong. We might curse them for losing all that money bailing foreign banks, but actually we love them.</span></span></p>

              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">We might not agree with them that they should raise electricity bill by 21% at a time of recession and curse their descendants but we understand why they must do it.</span></span></p>

              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">We might curse them to have have a difficult and suffering death, unlike JBJ that died quickly and peacefully, but actually we are their friends.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><br></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">We might curse their children and grandchildren for persecuting dissidents and oppositions and generally persecuting people that criticize them, but in reality we understand perfectly, like you, why they must act so dishonorably to cling on to power.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><br></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Yup! You are wrong to say we hate them, just because we curse them to the third generation does not mean that we hate them, just because we hope that they get their retribution in the form of cancer,  does not mean that we despise them, we love you PAP!</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">(This post is an example of the kind of logic that says "Increase in GST is to help the poor; foreigners flooding the country to lower your wages is for your own good; allowing prostitutes to go online and extend their one month stay automatically is the moral thing to do.")</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">There is no need to enlighten you, in spite of our curses, we are on the same side as you.</span></span></p>

              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">I dont know, is there a story reverse of "The Good Samaritan" in the bible where people support evil doers and what happened to them?</span></span></p>

              <p>hmm... can't seem to understand why peops are still willing to vote for them during elections, despite of what they have done all these years... Maybe singaporeans are just so rich to let them suck money...</p>
              <p>Am not really that anti PAP, but i feel that there shld more oppositions in the parliament. Or else it seems like quite autocratic...</p>

              <p><br>Me too goldfish.</p>
              <p>Actually, I have given up. Before, I was hopeful like you. not anymore.</p>
              <p>I think , at the earliest, in 50 years time (so far i find the existing reasons not complete), someone reputable and highly regarded or respected would have come up a Thesis explaining clearly beyond any doubt the Reasons why the Majority singaporeans are like this :</p>
              <p>1. Any hike, they accept, tho some may kpkb in kopi shop but the real effect is they never vote them out.</p>
              <p>2. Sporeans don't voice up for others affected by hikes, especially those not affected by the hikes as they are more educated and paid better such that these hikes are petty hikes to them. In fact, for the well-off, the higher the ERP, the better in the sense that being able to continue owning a car, an expensive car and using the roads full of many more ERPs can be a good ego booster. According to Maslow's hierarchy of needs, people  would strive to satisfy their Self Esteem before they reach the Self-Actualisation level.</p>
              <p>3. The special and truely one-of-kind opposition. They basically inch forward at best. I do not see them progressing in huge leaps. with the rise of Activist groups and new opposition parties, it is likely that votes for opposition will not be split thinly and more may not find a strong need to vote for opposition due to the good job done by activists. see where am i driving at?</p>
              <p>I learnt that Politics is really more complex than meets the eyes. Power + Influence + Wealth + ... = extremely powerful force.</p>
              <p>So, I only have 1 thing to look forward to : a thesis to fully explain the singaporeans mentality clearly. this could earliest come in 50 years time.</p>
              <p>I can better understand why some resign from the inc.</p>
              <p>dun flame me, just what i truely feel.</p>

              <p>what is law? who enacted the law? whose majority in the parliament. as long as laws that discrimnate the growth of opposition does not abolish, you will never be able to enjoy the benefits of a full democratic society.</p>
