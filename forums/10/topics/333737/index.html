              <p>I used to be one of those who critisize PAP and how they always sue opposition parties. They are wrong if they use bankrupcy as a way to remove opponents but it is true that if the opposition are strong/'worthy' enough, they would not be able to be sued in the first place.</p>
              <p>Still, i still critisize and mock PAP when it comes to cases about complacency which they quote for the missing of Mas Selamat and other shocking news. Furthermore, i cant see reasoning for building not one but at least 2 casinos in Singapore. Pls lar, if they are able to see the negative impacts and even have money n time to prepare for Singapore to have addicted gamblers, why even start all this gambling in the first place?</p>
              <p>What's with th ERP thing? Honestly, i encourage cutting down the usage of cars than enabling ERP. Really pity those people who are forced to pay ERP charges everyday due to their jobs or other requirements in their life. Quite meaningless to reduce jams in CBD (look at the pathetic shops which lost their customers) and see loads of cars encountering traffic jams at other busy roads elsewhere in Singapore.</p>

              <p>oil price has dropped - Malaysia has cut its oil price 6 % or so.</p>

              <p>meanwhile Transport operators have already hiked fares.</p>
              <p>Guess what reason they used?</p>
              <p>that said, I still think we should all keep absolutely quiet as 1st world citizens of the educated kind. Why I say this? Since I watched BlogTV last night, somehow my mind has changed.....accept....HIKEs....part of ....life......</p>
              <p>Best entertainers in BlogTV includes: that CEO , FD, and our very handsome Metro-Sexual dude.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans should not utter a word about hikes now and in the future, whatever has been lined up. You think no more right?  </p>
              <p>I call for the bombastic leaders salaries to be hikes by 22 % as well during year end in addition to their bombastic bonuses.</p>
              <p>I call for all to avoid protesting. We should remain status quo - no protest till eternity. Must slog to support the rich get richer and let the poor get poorer if they want to. You break your rice bowl, that is YOUR problem.</p>

              <p>I think incompetent sporeans should gentlemanly give their jobs to foreigners.</p>
              <p>I think sporeans should embrace our new immigrants and FTs and their family tree that comes along.</p>
              <p>I think sporeans should not question about TRANSPARENCY or lack of it.</p>
              <p>I think sporeans should continue to throw money into the stock market else who is gonna earn from stocks or how to save rich people stuck money in stocks?</p>
              <p>I think sporeans should spend and spend, Pay And Pay, work and work and trust our leaders.</p>
              <p>I think Protest is wrong.</p>
              <p>I think voicing up for others is not required as we are pragmatic people - Where got time?  People lose their rice bowl, that is THEIR problem.</p>
              <p>I think people especially the young should stop thinking of Opposition. Erase this word from your dictionary.</p>
              <p>I hope the people can consider skipping the election as in let the ruling continue for eternity but we remain on paper as democracy and have election once every few blue moons. Reason : save tax payer money.</p>
              <p>I hope Activists can replace some if not all of the needs for Opposition who , ask yourselves, have done what ..... ?</p>
              <p>I no no.</p>
              <p>How to migrate har? erm....i mean I like to understand the process. My fren ask me.</p>

              Kindly allow me to share my 3.33 cents worth of comment on 
              WHY THERE IS NO OPPOSITION IN SPORE.  OOPS, I MEAN SUCH A WEAK OPPOSITION....WEAK AS IN NOT STRONG.
              
              THE ANSWER  :
              
              The Majority DOes not WANT one.
              
              PERIOD.  (disclaimer : not that woman period)   
              
              ;)
              
              Everything is HK liao. 
              really really HK liao.
              Trust me. Though you can try to bet against me. 
              You will not win. Majority will ensure they NEVER will win anything.

              <p><br>I am convinced no one dares to voice up.</p>
              <p>Lets not protest at all.</p>
              <p>Lets just let Activist groups like Online Citizen do the talking.</p>
              <p>The benefit of this is that the Opposition's role could be diminished.</p>
              <p>Rationale :</p>
              <p>1. Already , based on solid-gold Historical Evidence of the last 43 years, Opposition has weak presence and it can really not do much compared to the ruling party (and you can justify with A-Z reasons but wont change the facts). Does this not prove that :</p>
              <p>   A.  The Majority does not want them or feel there is a need for them?</p>
              <p>   B.   The Majority given all the numerous Opportunities, Chances, choose not to vote the Opposition time and time x 43 times again.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2.  Activist groups are free to voice up and as long as they do so with care and use facts, they should be able to do more voicing up for the people than can the Opposition. I like to use evidence of the recent Hong Lim park activities to justify what I say.  The anger, frustration and steam of the people can be reduced drastically with Activist groups.  As long as Activists continue to show they are more EFFECTIVE than Opposition in addressing people's concerns, I am fully convinced in time, maybe the next election, the opposition may be shocked to find that their 33.3% becomes much less if not near zero.  It is Opposition's responsibility and parsar to win the People's votes and they should not keep using excuses (valid or not) to complain why they unable to voice up more or win more votes or cannot do this and that.  As we admit, no one owes us a living. So, to work as opposition, they must overcome any and all obstacles. Else, they can only blame themselves for unable to overcome the obstacles whatever that may be. The People will not just vote for you when you cannot prove yourselves.</p>
              <p>3. Activists can do many things Opposition can do. Eg. They can talk to ministers and MPs and anyone. they can sign petitions and ask for repeal of laws. They can ask for conservation of nature, buildings or anything. they can effect changes. they may not get it, just like Opposition may not get things approved also.</p>
              <p>4. PRAGMATISM Personified : Unlike any other country citizens, sporeans are super unique. Only they themselves know why. I am sure many are still oblivious and do not even understand themselves in terms of what kind of democratic citizen they are compared to all the rest of the world. Sporeans do not speak up for one another. How to characterise how they value Justice and Righteousness?</p>
              <p>I used to want to support opposition. I lost all hope and realise that things are much more complicated than meets the eyes and complex.</p>
              <p>All I see is this trend of Activist groups slowly taking over the role of the Opposition by being the Effective Force that voices up for the People.</p>
              <p>If my prophesy comes true in the next election, I foresee the Ruling party dominance to extend to 100% by winning back the 2 or 3 seats AND at the same time more and more ACTIVISTS become established. To some ruling party supporters they may be happy as it means all and any policies will be passed without opposition.</p>
              <p>I also foresee those opposition supporters who possess world market value and demand to resort to giving up their citizenship voluntarily.</p>
