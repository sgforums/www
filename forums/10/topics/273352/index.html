            <div class='col-md body'>Sex Slaves for NATO/KFOR Troops<br><br>PRAGUE, May 19 - WeÂ’ve reported in several of our prior TiM Bulletins that drug use and trade<br>were blossoming in NATO-Â“liberatedÂ” Kosovo, with KFOR troops, especially American and British<br>soldiers, being the main targets for the Kosovo Albanian drug pushers (see Â“Drugs and Prostitution<br>Blossom within KFORÂ”).  This Â“Standstill at the BondstillÂ” (name of the large American base in<br>Kosovo) should come as no surprise, given the longtime ties between the CIA and the KLA (see<br>Â“CIAÂ’s Ties to the KLAÂ”).<br><br>Well, add to it now the trade in sex slaves, especially with women from Eastern Europe.  ThatÂ’s<br>another example of Â“progressÂ” that the Â“international communityÂ” has also brought into this Serbian<br>province, along with its KFOR troops.  Nor is this a new phenomenon.  It merely follows the pattern<br>established four years ago, when the NATO troops similarly occupied Bosnia.<br><br>HereÂ’s an excerpt from a May 19 report by the Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty that the TiM<br>received from Prague:<br><br>Â“Sex-slave trade in Eastern European women -- one of the major crime scourges of<br>post-communist Europe -- is becoming a serious problem in Kosovo.  As a former war<br>zone, Kosovo is a prime location for the burgeoning trafficking trade. Porous borders,<br>the presence of a large clientele in the form of international troops and aid workers,<br>and the lack of a working criminal justice system offer excellent conditions for the<br>sex-slave trade.<br>East European women make up much of the Â“work forceÂ” in Kosovo's underground<br>brothels. Their native countries are close by and are home to well-established<br>organized-crime networks.<br><br>In the past six months, United Nations peacekeepers and police have rescued women<br>from Belarus, Moldova, Ukraine, Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, and Albania. The police<br>say that most of these women and girls -- some as young as 15 -- were transported from<br>their home countries to Macedonia, which borders Kosovo to the south. There, they<br>were held in motels and sold at auction to ethnic Albanian pimps for $1,000 to $2,500.<br><br>The women were stripped of their passports and held in unsanitary conditions in bars or<br>motels. They were then forced to engage in unprotected sex with local police and<br>international peacekeepers for no payment. They were told that before they could keep<br>any of their earnings, they first had to pay the pimps for their purchase price and the<br>cost of their travel. If the women resisted, they were beaten.<br><br>The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, or OSCE, has provided<br>support for women victims released from brothels by UN police and NATO-led<br>peacekeepers. Rolf Welberts, the OSCE's human-rights director in Kosovo, says his<br>organization has assisted some 50 women. He believes the number of women still held<br>in bondage is much higher: "We're talking about women from Eastern Europe who are<br>brought into Kosovo to serve as prostitutes, or when they arrive they're submitted to<br>conditions that they didn't know about -- meaning passports taken away, money<br>withheld, and so on. It is a form of slave trade."<br><br>Welberts says that "internationals" -- foreign (KFOR) soldiers and aid workers -- are<br>very often brothel patrons. The same phenomenon also exists in Bosnia-Herzegovina,<br>where the presence of peacekeepers and aid workers initiated a major trade in<br>trafficked women from Eastern Europe that continues to thrive today.<br><br>Human Rights Watch -- an international monitoring organization -- documented that<br>women from Belarus, Moldova, Ukraine, Romania, Hungary, and Albania were lured<br>into Bosnia by promises of legal work and safe passage. When they arrived, brothel<br>owners seized their passports and subjected them to slave-like practices. They were<br>often sold from one brothel owner to another, with the women forced to work without<br>wages.<br><br>Human Rights Watch says that international officials were aware of the (sex)<br>trafficking problem in Bosnia, but did little to combat it. The organization says that<br>some officials were actively complicit in the abuses, participating in the forced<br>prostitution of the women or patronizing the brothels.<br><br>Jill Thompson -- an adviser on trafficking issues for the OSCE's Warsaw-based<br>human-rights office -- estimates the number of trafficked women throughout the former<br>Yugoslavia in the tens of thousands.Â”<br><br>Other articles<br><br><a href="http://www.fortunecity.com/rainbow/chocolate/98/prostitution.html#Sex%20Slaves%20for%20NATO" rel="nofollow">http://www.fortunecity.com/rainbow/chocolate/98/prostitution.html#Sex%20Slaves%20for%20NATO</a></div>

And if we walked back to your village, where I have been more than once, I could ask the Thai authorities, why they take the rice lands of the Akha people?<br>Thailand just doesn't get it, and neither would it appear, does Singapore.<br><br>Now an interesting situation is coming to light in the case of Ms. Wongsa. It appears that Singapore "allows" women to come into the country to "solicit". They make no note of who they are or if they are trafficked from what we can tell. Apparently Singapore needs people to come into the country to meet the needs of Singapore men who can't get enough in their own country. And then when Singapore is done with these women, they send them home, or send them home early if they don't work out.<br><br>We have contacted the Singapore Embassy and Ambassador in the US, the ICA in Singapore, an MP in Singapore, Amnesty International and a number of individuals and agencies regarding this case. We are asking that her case be reviewed and that Akha women are not made to pay the price for either trafficking or unethical Agents who put them in these situations. We are asking that she be released and NOT deported from Singapore.<br><br>Please contact the Singapore Embassy regarding this case.</strong><br><br>above article was taken from site quote by ts.<br><br>so wat if these girls come willingly to earn money from sex then claim to be victims when they are caught ? would that mean they can get away without being punished ?<br><br></div>

Changi Prison ID S12369. She is now to be transfered to Portsdown Prison.<br><br>We request her release!<br>We Request She NOT Be Deported!<br>Ms. Amue Athu Released from Prison in Singapore, Destination Unkown.<br>Our message to Ms. Wongsa:<br>We keep fighting for you, so people know how Akha women get trafficked, how the enlightened systems all ignore what has happened to them, ignore the brothels, ignore the traffickers, business as usual. And if we walked back to your village, where I have been more than once, I could ask the Thai authorities, why they take the rice lands of the Akha people?<br>Thailand just doesn't get it, and neither would it appear, does Singapore.<br><br>Now an interesting situation is coming to light in the case of Ms. Wongsa. It appears that Singapore "allows" women to come into the country to "solicit". They make no note of who they are or if they are trafficked from what we can tell. Apparently Singapore needs people to come into the country to meet the needs of Singapore men who can't get enough in their own country. And then when Singapore is done with these women, they send them home, or send them home early if they don't work out.<br><br>We have contacted the Singapore Embassy and Ambassador in the US, the ICA in Singapore, an MP in Singapore, Amnesty International and a number of individuals and agencies regarding this case. We are asking that her case be reviewed and that Akha women are not made to pay the price for either trafficking or unethical Agents who put them in these situations. We are asking that she be released and NOT deported from Singapore.<br><br>Please contact the Singapore Embassy regarding this case.</strong><br><br>above article was taken from site quote by ts.<br><br><span style="color: red;">so wat if these girls come willingly to earn money from sex then claim to be victims when they are caught ?</span> would that mean they can get away without being punished ?<br><br>[/b]</blockquote>How do u tell if the girls are here willingly or conceded into performing acts aginst her own will?<br>The problem of tackling human trafficking is due to the cultural and language barriers.<br>These girls are taught by their 'owners' to fear law enforcement so that they can shut off their every contact with the outside world.<br>Little do these gals know that the law enforcement are the only ones who are able to pull them out of their plight.<br>Of course apart from this,the traffickers threatens their family back at hometown.<br><br>There are few questions that when asked can shed some light on wheather they enter the trade willingly or by forced.<br>1: Do they have their passport at hand?<br>2: are they allowed to move freely at will?<br>3: Do they keep their wages or are their wages held fr their debt bondage?<br><br>Victim Identification<br>A victim of trafficking may look like many of the people you help every day.
