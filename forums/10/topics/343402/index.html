              <p><em><strong><a name="s1"></a>Jobs Credit</strong></em></p>
              <p>C.2. To sustain jobs for Singaporeans, we will introduce a Jobs Credit which will encourage our businesses to preserve jobs as much as is possible in the downturn.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>Jobs Credit will have broadest impact</em></p>
              <p>C.6. The Jobs Credit that an employer receives will comprise 12% of the first $2,500 of the wages of each employee who is on the CPF payroll. It will be given in four quarterly payments, with each payment being based on the workers who are with the employer at the time. This will therefore provide incentive for employers to retain their local workers. For example, for a worker whose wage is $2,500, an employer will get $900 a quarter, or $300 a month.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Whoever contrive this initiative is either overtly optimistic or he was born yesterday.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> Goes to show that PAP lack the practical economic machinations to bring us out of recesssion, thus the reliance on global economic factors. This initiative will only bring about higher profits for the businesses, it will not save jobs.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">e.g.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">If you are a company operating with a profit before the downturn with a headcount of 100 staff (say each $2,500 /month). Hit by the economic downturn, your profits drop, you are at breakeven (no profits or losses) with your newly required headcount of 50.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">1) Would any rational businessman keep all the 100 staff to take advantage of the job credit? That is to pay an extra 50 X $2,500 X 12 = $1,500,000, so he could get back a job credit of 50 X $300 X 12 = $180,000. He stands to lose $1,320,000.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Or</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">2) Would he just retain his required staff strength of 50 and earn extra profits of $180,000?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"> </span></p>

The Package consists of five components as follows: </span> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Arial;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">1) Keeping jobs, building for the future  ($5.1 billion)</span></strong></span> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Arial;"><strong>Jobs Credit:</strong> The Government will introduce a Jobs Credit scheme to help employers keep their workers by providing every employer with a cash grant to reduce their costs of employing Singaporean workers during the crisis. An employer will receive 12% cash grant of the first $2,500 of the wages of each employee on CPF payroll, given out in four quarterly payments from March 09.  </span> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Arial;"><strong>Enhancing the Skills Programme for Upgrading and Retraining (SPUR): </strong>To help Professionals, Managers, Engineers and Technicians (PMET) to retrain, the Government will increase the subsidy rate for PMET courses from 80% to 90%, same as that for rank and file level courses. It will also bring under SPUR, selected tertiary courses at UniSim and the three publicly funded universities. </span> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Arial;">EDB will also introduce a $100 million programme where EDB will co-share manpower, training and related costs with companies, focusing on engineering and technical jobs, and fund on-the-job training opportunities for fresh graduates. </span> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Arial;"><strong>WIS Special Payment: </strong>The Government will give lower-wage workers a temporary additional WIS Special Payment of 50% of their existing WIS payment to supplement their pay and encourage them to stay employed. The eligibility criteria will also be relaxed to allow those with less regular employment to qualify. </span> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Arial;"><strong>Expanded employment in public service sector</strong> by over 18,000 jobs over the next two years in areas such as schools, healthcare, Home Team and Mindef, as well.</span> </p>

              <p>I rem him saying for the property taxes ... A reduction of 40% for commercial and industrial properties and hopefully this will be credited back to the tenants.</p>
              <p>If I read the financial reports of the companies correctly , quite a part of the rental fees are actually long term contracts, giving reduction in propoerty taxes will only give the owner more money. I guess those whose contract is ending can move to the others to ones get the 15% rebate then.</p>
              <p>Sadly that I do not see much in assisting new startups year after year .</p>
