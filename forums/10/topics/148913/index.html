            <div class='col-md body'>Following the speech as reported on Channel NewsAsia, this 2005 National Day Rally speech seems to be <strong>light weight in content</strong> compared to those published through the last FORTY YEARS - when first made by LKY, and followed through by GCT.<br><br><strong>PM Lee wants Singapore's service culture to be improved :</strong> - this call reflects the <strong>failure</strong> in GCT's effort to build a <strong>"Gracious society"</strong>.<br><br>After FORTY YEARS of continuous cacophony from the Ruling Party that range from cajoling to scolding the Singapore vassals and minions to obey and perform all the tasks that the Ruling Party has "set up" - the Singapore vassals and minions are now deeply "SET UP" into the MATRIX.<br><br><strong>PM Lee says Singapore needs to foster innovation to grow economy :</strong> - he said human imagination and enterprise were what Singapore would need to move on and stay ahead; that is how the Republic has gone "<span style="color: blue;">from mosquito coils to semiconductors</span>" and "<span style="color: blue;">from bee hoon to Biopolis</span>".<br><br>Singapore certainly need human imagination and enterprise to take back the initiative and private enterprise that was destroyed by the Ruling Party over the last FORTY YEARS.<br><br>Singapore has moved from "mosquito coils and bee hoon" to "semiconductors and Biopolis" - but <strong>who</strong> are the owners of the "semiconductor plants"; and who are the developer and owner of "Biopolis" - as well as holding stakes in the various Biotech researches that reside in the Biopolis ?<br><br><strong>PM Lee announces help for lower income, older Singaporeans :</strong> - <span style="color: blue;">"To help narrow Singapore's income gap, lower income families will receive Central Provident Fund Housing Grants to help them buy their own homes" .<br><br>"HDB flat ownership will be more affordable for lower income families with this new housing grant" . </span><br><br>Giving with the Left Hand, and taking back with the Right.<br><br>The grant is given to purchase HDB flats that will be "designed for affordability " - but will the affordable HDB flats be liveable flats ?<br><br><span style="color: blue;">"A concern for older Singaporeans is also the cost of health care - the Medishield age limit will now be raised from 80 to 85".<br><br>"In providing for themselves, Singaporeans must not retire at 55 and live till 80, but should keep on working longer".</span><br><br>Giving with the Left Hand, taking back with TWO Right Hands - keep on working beyond 55 and pay tax, while the continued income pays for the Medishielf.<br><br>Is the Government topping up into the Medishield, or is the worker encouraged to work continuously to top up his own Medishield protection ?<br><br>Will the Medishield be sufficient to look after anyone up to 80, let alone raising it further to 85 ?<br><br>Looking at the 'orbituary page' - how many lower income Singaporeans get the opportunity to pass on after 85 ?<br><br><span style="color: blue;">"One way to narrow the income gap is to help lower income families build up their assets, like subsidising home ownership and savings".<br><br>"The basic principle which we applied in helping low income Singaporeans, which has worked well for us and we must keep - it is we go for workfare, not welfare. That means if you work if you are prepared to help yourself, if you are going to strive I will help you to succeed".</span><br><br>The Principle of this Self-help Assistance Program has been ongoing for the last FORTY YEARS, and yet the number of lower income Singaporeans is growing, with the annual shrinking of the Middle Income Group.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">"Mr Lee also highlighted a subgroup amongst the lower income families who face multiple problems.<br><br>All races are represented but amongst the groups the Malay community is over-represented. But it's a problem which we have to address, tackle, and to help these people get their lives in order, most important to get their children to be sorted out so that children start off straight in life.<br><br>To get lives together, these families will receive help, like providing them with stable jobs and keeping their children in school.<br><br>Children will also receive more help to break them out of poverty". </span><br><br>Similarly, this sub-group of Lower Income Singaporeans seems to be sliding deeper into the quicksand of poverty.<br><br>The same "Principle of Assisted Self-Help Program" has been on-going for the last FORTY YEARS, and the beneficiaries from sub-group remain largely from the Malay Community; and with the numbers from the Chinese and Indian Communities also growing in size.<br><br>After FORTY YEARS of persistent effort, and with the problem growing, is the program designed to fail ?<br><br><strong>Singapore needs to reinvent itself into vibrant global city : PM Lee</strong> - <span style="color: blue;">"the city must reflect the spirit of our people - <strong>well conceived, vigorously executed,</strong></span><strong> <span style="color: red;">restrained</span></strong><span style="color: blue;"> but high quality, every aspect thought through, constantly being improved and remade in search of excellence. A city in</span> <strong><span style="color: red;">our image </span> </strong> <span style="color: blue;">- a sparkling jewel, a home for all of us to be proud of, a home that belongs to all of us"</span> .<br><br>Are Singaporeans empowered to reinvent Singapore, when we cannot even be allowed to fly the Singapore Flag - until and except with the approval of the Government a.k.a the Ruling Party ?<br><br>Can Singaporeans be allowed to Stand-up and contribute to Singapore - WITHOUT the need of any Suitability Certificate or be conscripted by Law ?<br><br>Unfortunately, the eloquent call to reinvent is not directed at Singaporeans, but only to Singapore  - a.k.a Singapore Inc., a.k.a the Ruling Party, a.k.a the First Family.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The speech by LHL was overall, rather superficial. There was very little mentioned to address the rising costs of living, creation of jobs, or any adjustments to salary and CPF contributions in the upcoming years.<br><br>With his emphasis on improving society and cultural contribution as well as the marina bay project, he has failed to focus on the fundamental heartland issues. In fact, his speech falls short on most expectations. No doubt lively, but mostly livid to the general population.<br><br>Let's hope elections come before the end of Dec 05 (as i predict it will)...then maybe we can inflict some real displeasure on the ruling party and give them a serious wake-up call.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The speech featured an over-animated and an over-excited Prime Minister, which to be honest, a bit 'unexpected' due to his infamous privately dour, over-serious and unchrismatic nature.<br><br>I thought the way he acted was actually quite phony. While on first impression, it may be quite impressive; but for us, who have seen LHL in action and in speech, its very unsettling. Its like he went through a transformation of sorts just to rebuke the rumour that he's actually a dour fella with very little humour and chrisma.<br><br>I'm not convinced by his new persona and neither am I convinced by his sugary words in his NDP rally. At first, his over-animated actions was amusing- but for a short while. After a while, I nearly fell asleep.<br><br>In the end, I switched off the TV half way thru and took a bus to see the Chelski football match with my fellow Arsenal kakis in the pub. Nonetheless, TV Mobile proceeded to bore me further during my trip to the pub in the end.</div>
