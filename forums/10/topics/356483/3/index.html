              <p><br>In the arm of God ?</p>
              <p>Did your God lost an arm to the PAP - and maybe get a finger back later ?</p>
              <p>Should we be happy that we got a rebate of $100 per person when the Government collect 7% GST from our average personal expenses of $1000 per month x 12 months = $12,000 ?</p>
              <p>At least during happy hour, we get a 2 for 1 rebate from most Bars that truly will make anyone happy.</p>
              <p>If you are sober enough, you should also note that GST is not the only tax that is payable, as there are a multiple layers and types of taxes paid by Singaporeans for all that the Government allow Singaporeans to have.</p>
              <p>Do we get rebate on the ERP paid, or the COE and Road Tax that were supposed to provide revenue to maintain and build new roads ?</p>
              <p>Most private and commercial vehicle owners are seeing more ERP gantries being installed and planned around and inside the city and main business district.</p>
              <p>In our utility bills, we pay a surcharge for the number of toilets in the house, and at the bottom of it all, there is also the 7% GST on the surcharge item that form a tax on taxable item.</p>
              <p>Yes, the PAP Government take good care of us by building nice hospitals and increase "medical subsidies" at the same time as they increase the itemised prices for the various medical services that Singaporeans need as Singaporeans get older.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>How many Singaporeans make even 10% of the Ministers' monthly wages compared to the larger percentage of Sinagaporeans struggling to make enough to pay for their daily family meals, children's education, utility bills; or even to live by themselves in their old age ?</p>
              <p>Our million dollar Ministers are happier to donate US$100 BILLION to failed foreign banks then to provide even US$1 Billion a year as annual payment into a "Growth Fund" to look after the future of all 3.5 million Singaporean - and we are not even talking about social welfare.</p>
              <p>If the PAP Government can invest US$1 Billion dollar annually into an insurance policy for all 3.5 million Singaporean Citizens, in fifty years - this Growth Fund will be of significant size for Singaporeans to be truly looked after by this PAP Government.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p><br>In the arm of my God, not PAP, who is PAP, nothing but normal mortal peoples like you who can fall for greed, lust and power. Face the facts, that what makes a man to churn the world. Unlike Angels, we are always watching and resting in the Arm of God.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Gst can be control by you, accept for utilities bills, you dun go for expensive and shops that charge Gst, eat in hawker centres, travel by MRT or cycle, buy your groceries and essential items at NTUC Fairprice or you nearest provision shops who dun charge Gst, in this way, you gain, be smart hor.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you look at Gst, it mostly target at the rich and business peoples, we are suppose to reduce it as much as possible, but unfortuntely, most singaporeans like to spend lavishly in posh cafe, restaurant, cars, travels, luxury goods at high class shopping centres, etc etc..not only they get to pay Gst, they also hv to pay service charges.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Tho i do not get the rebate, i dun think it is merely 100 dollars, should be more than that...dun bluff mei mei hor.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Nobody is left untreated in hospital, be it you are rich or poor, everybody would hv a roof above their head,...be it studio apartment or paid back 39 years scheme, or extension of CPF life etc etc, all these are mend for old age prepareness, we are living longer than others, these is due to advance medical technology and better lifestyle.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In this world, all citizens will complain about their govt, no doubt about it, some even when to protest, street fight, killings, unrest and chaos. But ours is at peace, no war. Yes, of course our older generations still tends to complain here and there about govt just to relieve their frustration, that is normal. My grandma always said PAP never do this and that, but overall, she knew that PAP is afterall, done a good job, not great, but at least much better than our surrounding countries. As i travelled around the world, peoples envied Singapore and it govt, and envy always come with jealousy.</p>

Unless you are game for a fight to form or join an opposition party, or reunite the opposition parties into one big party such as the Foam Party or NDP party or Countdown Party at Orchard, I will join in and fully support you. But if you choose to continue cursing n cursing that is up to you, nobody is listening accept me. An all i can do is ask you to "Take your Medications" Angel of God</p>

              <p>If the GST is designed to target only the rich then it should be levied on all luxury items only, and all utility bills that fall below $300 should not have any GST.</p>
              <p>If the GST is designed not to affect the poor - then businesses providing essential services and foodstuff should not be levied with GST, as all businesses will pass on the GST cost to the consumer.</p>

              <p>Your arguments is hopeless flawed when you only tie yourself into this corner and not look at the GST impact - and the impact of other Government Revenue collecting policies - that affect every Singaporeans without consideration to income levels.</p>

              <p>If the GST is designed to target only the rich then it should be levied on all luxury items only, and all utility bills that fall below $300 should not have any GST.</p>
              <p>If the GST is designed not to affect the poor - then businesses should not be levied, as all businesses will pass on the GST cost to the consumer.</p>
              <p>Who is talking about all the posh places and luxury items ?</p>
              <p>Your arguments is hopeless flawed when you only tie yourself into this corner and not look at the GST impact - and the impact of other Government Revenue collecting policies - that affect every Singaporeans without consideration to income levels.</p>
              <p>You do not get any rebate simply due to the fact that you are underage, and pretend to be a Bar Owner (-cum-Hostess??) </p>
              <p>You seem to remain in a state of drunk stupor in your make-believe world as an angel to the drunks in your escapist Bar.</p>

              <p>Yes, everyone in the Third World will complain about their government.</p>
              <p>At least in those Third World countries, their Government acknowledge their Third World status, and are more modest in the claims of their own talent and self-worth.</p>
              <p>Compared to our self-proclaimed First World Leaders - who insist that they are worth the $3 Million annual wages that they pay themselves from the blood monies that they extract from ALL Singaporeans - we are left to struggle in Third World conditions.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>You see, before i start posting at sgforums, that was about 18 yo, I kind of think that Singapore is a wonderful place to live in, i had never know about oppositions or what the F is opposition, i thot PAP is the only govt that will rule for forever. Then I chanced upon my Uncle Posts and i start to realise and begin to appreciate about oppositions and their plights, so pitiful and sad, so i decided to have fun with him and others who oppose PAP so as to brighten up their if possible, well, it didn't turn up very well, perhaps as an Angel, i failed my mission misearably.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As the younger generation or so call the Y generation, there is alot of Y and Y questions being ask about politics of singapore when i go out with my gangs, sometime, i used my Uncle quote to tell them that we are blind by PAP, there is room for improvement by getting more oppositions into the parliament is not neccessary that the PAP is no more in govt, but these oppositions can keep a watch over PAP, and when that happens, our govt will be more efficients and effectives. I urge all oppositions to reach out to the younger generation like me, forgo the oldies, they are useless, many young ones are still living blindly without a thot of politics, that is where PAP wins. UNDERSTAND!!</p>

              <p>Humans are supposed to have been made in the image of God, and even if God is not mortal - he should also be having two arms.</p>
              <p>Are you sure you are an angel accepted by God, as only one arm is extended to you while most are warmly embraced in his arm<span style="color: #ff0000;">s</span> <span style="color: #000000;">?</span></p>
              <p>Only a "Fallen Angel" will get involve in the trade of indulging human into their worst habits and bring out the worst in the human race - wine, alcohol, women and songs.</p>
              <p>Should we need to wonder why you are so happy with only one-arm embrace from God, who will even give some grace to a "fallen angel" ?</p>
              <p>Maybe it should be fat hopes for a fat angel believing to be a perfect angel ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Another drunken wishful thought that GST can be controlled by normal Singaporeans ?</p>
              <p>Is anyone talking about expensive items ?</p>
              <p>The $1000 monthly expenses are the basic necessities that include utilities, travel costs, groceries, and daily meals at the cheapest possible places.</p>
              <p>Are you dreaming that you are living in the 19th Century when $1000 is equal to todays $100,000 that allow you to indulge in expensive things ? </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If the GST is designed to target only the rich then it should be levied on all luxury items only, and all utility bills that fall below $300 should not have any GST.</p>
              <p>If the GST is designed not to affect the poor - then businesses providing essential services and foodstuff should not be levied with GST, as all businesses will pass on the GST cost to the consumer.</p>
              <p>Who is talking about all the posh places and luxury items ?</p>
              <p>Your arguments is hopeless flawed when you only tie yourself into this corner and not look at the GST impact - and the impact of other Government Revenue collecting policies - that affect every Singaporeans without consideration to income levels.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You do not get any rebate simply due to the fact that you are underage, and pretend to be a Bar Owner (-cum-Hostess??) </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You seem to remain in a state of drunken stupor in your make-believe world as an angel to the drunks in your escapist Bar.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Yes, everyone in the Third World will complain about their government.</p>
              <p>At least in those Third World countries, their Government acknowledge their Third World status, and are more modest in the claims of their own talent and self-worth.</p>
              <p>Compared to our self-proclaimed First World Leaders - who insist that they are worth the $3 Million annual wages that they pay themselves from the blood monies that they extract from ALL Singaporeans - we are left to struggle in Third World conditions.</p>

              <p><br>Atobe, this gal is just here for fun and to disturb the peace in discussing about the PAP.   If you read her posts, you will know that she is fickle in what she posts about PAP.   One moment, she speaks so ill of them and the next moment she is full of praise for them.    She has no credibility.  All she wants is to seek attention.  She is a spoilt brat!</p>
