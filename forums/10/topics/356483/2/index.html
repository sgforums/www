              <p>For starters, I think it might not be a gd idea to classify
              Singaporeans arbitrarily into two opposing camps - those who
              ardently support the PAP, and those who ardently oppose the PAP and
              support the opposition. Such a mode of classification stifles our
              political process, as it ignores those who are proactively critical
              of policies out of sheer objectivity, as compared to those who
              support or criticize the government from a purely partisan basis. I
              belief that there is many others who see themselves apart from this
              rigid dual paradigm, but rather see themselves as Singaporeans
              concern with the state of our own community, who are critical of
              the government upon certain issues they find out of necessity and
              objectivity to be critical, or to applaud the government or the
              opposition for that matter, when certain policies are enacted that

              <p>Thank you, your post points out exactly what I feel the spirit of opposition should be. To not just be a noisy, disturbing voice in the crowd. To not be blindly opposing for the sake of it but to genuinely know the direction to head with real country interests at heart.</p>

              <p>I started this thread simply to point out that it's not about opposing PAP for the sake of it or purely for dislike itself. People genuinely concerned for people's welfare or the good of the nation should not brand or link themselves with extremists or people who blindly oppose for the sake of it.</p>

              <p><br>In the arm of God ?</p>
              <p>Did your God lost an arm to the PAP - and maybe get a finger back later ?</p>
              <p>Should we be happy that we got a rebate of $100 per person when the Government collect 7% GST from our average personal expenses of $1000 per month x 12 months = $12,000 ?</p>
              <p>At least during happy hour, we get a 2 for 1 rebate from most Bars that truly will make anyone happy.</p>
              <p>If you are sober enough, you should also note that GST is not the only tax that is payable, as there are a multiple layers and types of taxes paid by Singaporeans for all that the Government allow Singaporeans to have.</p>
              <p>Do we get rebate on the ERP paid, or the COE and Road Tax that were supposed to provide revenue to maintain and build new roads ?</p>
              <p>Most private and commercial vehicle owners are seeing more ERP gantries being installed and planned around and inside the city and main business district.</p>
              <p>In our utility bills, we pay a surcharge for the number of toilets in the house, and at the bottom of it all, there is also the 7% GST on the surcharge item that form a tax on taxable item.</p>
              <p>Yes, the PAP Government take good care of us by building nice hospitals and increase "medical subsidies" at the same time as they increase the itemised prices for the various medical services that Singaporeans need as Singaporeans get older.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>How many Singaporeans make even 10% of the Ministers' monthly wages compared to the larger percentage of Sinagaporeans struggling to make enough to pay for their daily family meals, children's education, utility bills; or even to live by themselves in their old age ?</p>
              <p>Our million dollar Ministers are happier to donate US$100 BILLION to failed foreign banks then to provide even US$1 Billion a year as annual payment into a "Growth Fund" to look after the future of all 3.5 million Singaporean - and we are not even talking about social welfare.</p>
              <p>If the PAP Government can invest US$1 Billion dollar annually into an insurance policy for all 3.5 million Singaporean Citizens, in fifty years - this Growth Fund will be of significant size for Singaporeans to be truly looked after by this PAP Government.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>You see, before i start posting at sgforums, that was about 18 yo, I kind of think that Singapore is a wonderful place to live in, i had never know about oppositions or what the F is opposition, i thot PAP is the only govt that will rule for forever. Then I chanced upon my Uncle Posts and i start to realise and begin to appreciate about oppositions and their plights, so pitiful and sad, so i decided to have fun with him and others who oppose PAP so as to brighten up their if possible, well, it didn't turn up very well, perhaps as an Angel, i failed my mission misearably.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As the younger generation or so call the Y generation, there is alot of Y and Y questions being ask about politics of singapore when i go out with my gangs, sometime, i used my Uncle quote to tell them that we are blind by PAP, there is room for improvement by getting more oppositions into the parliament is not neccessary that the PAP is no more in govt, but these oppositions can keep a watch over PAP, and when that happens, our govt will be more efficients and effectives. I urge all oppositions to reach out to the younger generation like me, forgo the oldies, they are useless, many young ones are still living blindly without a thot of politics, that is where PAP wins.
