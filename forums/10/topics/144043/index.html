It was supposed to close in 1991 but it didn't, preferential treatment under affirmative-action NEP continued. Mahathir cried because some malays had apparently abused the treatement. NEP succeeded to a certain extent. But, NEP continues with special rights to the malays. till when?? as long as UMNO stays in power, i guess.<br><br>Today, Abdullah's speech affirms the rights of the malays, and "says other ethnic groups have not been denied their rights." It is no longer a program to give the malays a head start or a leg-up, the rights of malaysian have been redefined or reaffiremed, the rights of the malays and the rights of other ethnic group are not the same, though they are all malaysian. Aren't we glad we got kicked out of malaysia?<br><br>Why double standards? no reason, jsut some were born special than the others. But lets call a spade a spade.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Huge discrepancy in wages is not good for social cohesion and security. I agree with the spirit of Malaysia's policy but not the way it is implemented. As rightly pointed out, decades after its implementation, there is no significant change apart from making a handful of very rich Malays. As a group, the Malays still lag behind economically..<br><br>Singaporeans must also be concerned about the widening gap between the elite and the non-elite (euphemistically known as the heartlanders). The NKF saga provoked a huge response partly because we suddenly realize that the poor, good-hearted people running charities like the NKF aren't that poor nor noble after all.</div>
