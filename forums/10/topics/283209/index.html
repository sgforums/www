            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The AdministrationÂ’s plan for Iran</strong><br>By Seymour M. Hersh<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"> 09/30/07 "The New Yorker" -- - October 8, 2007 - - In a series of public statements in recent months, President Bush and members of his Administration have redefined the war in Iraq, to an increasing degree, as a strategic battle between the United States and Iran. Â“Shia extremists, backed by Iran, are training Iraqis to carry out attacks on our forces and the Iraqi people,Â” Bush told the national convention of the American Legion in August. Â“The attacks on our bases and our troops by Iranian-supplied munitions have increased. . . The Iranian regime must halt these actions. And, until it does, I will take actions necessary to protect our troops.Â” He then concluded, to applause, Â“I have authorized our military commanders in Iraq to confront TehranÂ’s murderous activities.Â”<br><br>The PresidentÂ’s position, and its corollaryÂ—that, if many of AmericaÂ’s problems in Iraq are the responsibility of Tehran, then the solution to them is to confront the IraniansÂ—have taken firm hold in the Administration. This summer, the White House, pushed by the office of Vice-President Dick Cheney, requested that the Joint Chiefs of Staff redraw long-standing plans for a possible attack on Iran, according to former officials and government consultants. The focus of the plans had been a broad bombing attack, with targets including IranÂ’s known and suspected nuclear facilities and other military and infrastructure sites. Now the emphasis is on Â“surgicalÂ” strikes on Revolutionary Guard Corps facilities in Tehran and elsewhere, which, the Administration claims, have been the source of attacks on Americans in Iraq. What had been presented primarily as a counter-proliferation mission has been reconceived as counterterrorism.<br><br>The shift in targeting reflects three developments. First, the President and his senior advisers have concluded that their campaign to convince the American public that Iran poses an imminent nuclear threat has failed (unlike a similar campaign before the Iraq war), and that as a result there is not enough popular support for a major bombing campaign. The second development is that the White House has come to terms, in private, with the general consensus of the American intelligence community that Iran is at least five years away from obtaining a bomb. And, finally, there has been a growing recognition in Washington and throughout the Middle East that Iran is emerging as the geopolitical winner of the war in Iraq.<br><br>During a secure videoconference that took place early this summer, the President told Ryan Crocker, the U.S. Ambassador to Iraq, that he was thinking of hitting Iranian targets across the border and that the British Â“were on board.Â” At that point, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice interjected that there was a need to proceed carefully, because of the ongoing diplomatic track. Bush ended by instructing Crocker to tell Iran to stop interfering in Iraq or it would face American retribution.<br><br>At a White House meeting with Cheney this summer, according to a former senior intelligence official, it was agreed that, if limited strikes on Iran were carried out, the Administration could fend off criticism by arguing that they were a defensive action to save soldiers in Iraq. If Democrats objected, the Administration could say, Â“Bill Clinton did the same thing; he conducted limited strikes in Afghanistan, the Sudan, and in Baghdad to protect American lives.Â” The former intelligence official added, Â“There is a desperate effort by Cheney et al. to bring military action to Iran as soon as possible. Meanwhile, the politicians are saying, Â‘You canÂ’t do it, because every Republican is going to be defeated, and weÂ’re only one fact from going over the cliff in Iraq.Â’ But Cheney doesnÂ’t give a ratÂ’s ass about the Republican worries, and neither does the President.Â”<br><br>Bryan Whitman, a Pentagon spokesman, said, Â“The President has made it clear that the United States government remains committed to a diplomatic solution with respect to Iran. The State Department is working diligently along with the international community to address our broad range of concerns.Â” (The White House declined to comment.)<br><br>I was repeatedly cautioned, in interviews, that the President has yet to issue the Â“execute orderÂ” that would be required for a military operation inside Iran, and such an order may never be issued. But there has been a significant increase in the tempo of attack planning. In mid-August, senior officials told reporters that the Administration intended to declare IranÂ’s Revolutionary Guard Corps a foreign terrorist organization. And two former senior officials of the C.I.A. told me that, by late summer, the agency had increased the size and the authority of the Iranian Operations Group. (A spokesman for the agency said, Â“The C.I.A. does not, as a rule, publicly discuss the relative size of its operational components.Â”)<br><br>Â“TheyÂ’re moving everybody to the Iran desk,Â” one recently retired C.I.A. official said. Â“TheyÂ’re dragging in a lot of analysts and ramping up everything. ItÂ’s just like the fall of 2002Â”Â—the months before the invasion of Iraq, when the Iraqi Operations Group became the most important in the agency. He added, Â“The guys now running the Iranian program have limited direct experience with Iran. In the event of an attack, how will the Iranians react? They will react, and the Administration has not thought it all the way through.Â”<br><br>That theme was echoed by Zbigniew Brzezinski, the former national-security adviser, who said that he had heard discussions of the White HouseÂ’s more limited bombing plans for Iran. Brzezinski said that Iran would likely react to an American attack Â“by intensifying the conflict in Iraq and also in Afghanistan, their neighbors, and that could draw in Pakistan. We will be stuck in a regional war for twenty years.Â”<br><br>In a speech at the United Nations last week, IranÂ’s President, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, was defiant. He referred to America as an Â“aggressorÂ” state, and said, Â“How can the incompetents who cannot even manage and control themselves rule humanity and arrange its affairs? Unfortunately, they have put themselves in the position of God.Â” (The day before, at Columbia, he suggested that the facts of the Holocaust still needed to be determined.)... </span><br><br><a href="http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article18484.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article18484.htm</a></div>

More importantly, it is far more homogeneous and is spared the kind of tribal rivalry that makes Iraq difficult to govern in the best of times.
