              <p>Yes he is married and have several children.</p>
              <p>I read an interview before.</p>
              <p>He said he support himself and his family by selling his books.</p>
              <p>He will go out on a street and hawk the books to passer-bys.</p>
              <p>Actually u can catch a glimpse of this activity several times on YouTube videos of him.</p>
              <p>Erm....Im not sure whether he has other sources of funding....my feeling is maybe he has. Maybe there are sympathizers and supporters who sent him financial aid. But this is only my speculation, he didnt say it.</p>

              <p>Anyway as for hero, I keep my reservations about that. This guy feels he is a freedom fighter. To qualify as one, you would need someone or some group to free. Who is he trying to free, Singaporeans? I am a Singaporean, born, raised, educated, served NS and work in Singapore. I dunno, but I do not feel enslaved or repressed. Anyway, time and again, even b4 he was declared bankrupt, neither himself nor anyone from his party had won in elections. So talking about support.... erm. Does the ppl he seeks to "free", actually needs him to "free" them?</p>
