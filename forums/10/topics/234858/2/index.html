Give up Singaporean citizenship - your passport is invalidated - you effectively lose PR status in another country. Officially you become stateless and an illegal migrant.<br><br>Permanent residency is not citizenship although it forms a shield to allow you the same rights to seek jobs or health services as citizens of the country. You cannot vote for the government or hold a passport of the country as a permanent citizen or gain further benefits  . You have to renew every 5 years on a valid passport in Australia.<br><br>Bearing in mind , once you surrender Singaporean citizenship and withdraw your cpf - you will find it VERY hard to get back in unless you have what they view as talent!</div>
