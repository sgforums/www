                                  affluence, have been indulging in a spending binge that appears out of
                                  line with economic realities</span>.</strong><br> <br> The splurge, which followed signs of a mild recovery in recent weeks,
                                  resulted in a strong price run-up in stocks, properties and cars,
                                  taking many economists by surprise.<br> <br> It was so strong that people were ironically fearful of an asset bubble
                                  building up during a weak economy. This apparent over-indulgence
                                  appears to ignore repeated warnings from government leaders and
                                  economists that more job cuts are in store and the recession could
                                  return.<br> <br> One of its sovereign wealth funds, Temasek Holdings, said that as far as it was concerned, Singapore is still in crisis.<br> <br> Despite these, expensive restaurants are once again packed with weekend diners and private clubs, once quiet, are again buzzing.<br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>Most of the big spenders are young professionals,
                                  married and singles, and the wealthy. Their buying has caused prices of
                                  resale public flats and private condominiums to soar.</strong></span><br> <br> And despite the downturn, car usage in Singapore – one of the costliest
                                  in the world – has risen at the expense of public transport.<br> <br> Analysts have, however, pointed out that the consumer splashing is
                                  unlikely to last and is only one aspect of life in a recession.<br> <br> It is confined largely to the upper-middle class and irrationally
                                  exuberant professionals, who appear unfazed by the severity of it all.<br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>Growing up in a golden era with years of news
                                  screaming about more good times ahead, many Singaporeans seem oblivious
                                  to their country’s vulnerability to world turmoil.</strong></span><br> <br> <span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="color: blue;"><strong>The bigger story is of a
                                  struggling middle class (some two-thirds of the population) that is too
                                  badly affected to be able to buy luxury items.</strong></span></span><br> <br> When I mentioned it to an old friend, a businessman and former human resource manager, he said the wider picture is different.<br> <br> <span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="color: blue;"><strong>For the majority of workers, jobs have been lost and take-home pay diminished.</strong></span></span><br> <br> Almost all Singaporeans, rich and poor, have lost out in the recession, the worst being the poorer class.<br> <br> “I admire these people very much. Mostly old and little skilled, they
                                  struggle on silently. No time to talk about their plight, just carry on
                                  working,” he said.<br> <br> During the past two years, almost every Singaporean had to dip into his
                                  own savings to sustain himself, like the government did with its
                                  reserves in an effort to protect jobs.<br> <br> <span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="color: blue;"><strong>The picture is different for the rich, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">whose number has been growing substantially through immigration.</span></strong></span></span><br> <br> The crisis has decimated fortunes, but the bulk of high-asset owners
                                  have enough financial muscle (again like the country itself) to ride
                                  out the storm or even prosper from it.<br> <br> It is largely the spending habit of this group that fuelled the recent indulgence.<br> <br> Years later, if writers looked back at the current severe downturn to
                                  ask what lasting impact the global crisis had on this society, one
                                  answer would be the <span style="font-size: large;"><span style="color: blue;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">erosion of the middle class</span>.<br> </strong></span></span> <br> The trend was first detected in Japan, and to a lesser extent in Hong
                                  Kong and Taiwan, as these middle-class societies prospered.<br> <br> The theory, known as the M-shaped society, was enunciated by Japanese
                                  strategist Kenichi Ohmae. He observed that in Japan’s “M-shape” class
                                  distribution, very few middle-class people may climb up the ladder into
                                  the upper class, while the others gradually sank to the lower classes.<br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>These people suffered a deterioration in living
                                  standards, faced the threat of unemployment, or their average salary
                                  was dropping, he said. Gradually, they could only live the way the
                                  lower classes lived: taking the bus instead of driving their own car,
                                  cutting their budget for meals instead of dining at better restaurants,
                                  and spending less on consumer goods.</strong></span><br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>Kenichi said all this might take place while the
                                  economy enjoyed remarkable growth and overall wages rose. However, the
                                  wealth increase may concentrate in the pockets of the very few rich
                                  people in society.</strong></span><br> <br> <span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="color: blue;"><strong>The masses cannot benefit from the
                                  growth, and their living standard goes into decline. For many
                                  middle-class Singaporeans, these sound uncomfortably like home.</strong></span></span><br> <br> The government, which relies on middle-class voters to keep itself in
                                  power, has vowed to make the closure of the economic gap a national
                                  priority.<br> <br> It is a doubly tough job given the economic crisis which is widening –
                                  rather than narrowing – the differences. Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew
                                  seems to find this gap an inevitable feature here.<br> <br> Singapore has the second-highest income gap with a Gini score of 42.5
                                  among developed economies after Hong Kong, according to the UN
                                  Development Programme report,<br> <br> (The Gini Coefficient index measures the income gap between the poor
                                  and the rich in any country with zero denoting absolute equality.)<br> <br> Lee was speaking at a forum with undergraduates when he rejected a
                                  minimum wage for workers to narrow this gap, saying it was more
                                  important to keep jobs.<br> <br> “Never mind your Gini coefficient,” he said. “If you don’t have a job
                                  you get zero against those with jobs.” In other words it is better to
                                  have a job with lower pay than no job.<br> <br> Such remarks would obviously be more acceptable, albeit grudgingly, to
                                  the previous generation of poorer citizens than the current one.<br> <br> It was such logic that helped turn Singapore into the richest country
                                  in South-east Asia, with a per capita GDP income rising steadily in
                                  four decades to S$53,192 (RM130,048) in 2008.<br> <br> But in today’s high-cost city with Singaporeans finding it harder and
                                  harder to cope with the crisis, his words have neither helped nor
                                  dispelled many concerns.</div>

              <p>First, the plight of the races had been used as being marginalised here in SIngapore. Then proven not true.</p>
              <p>Then the poor and 'homeless' are used to attack the deficiencies of our society. That had also been proven not true by our society's funding on social spending and donations.</p>
              <p>Now, the middle class is used to stir up pessimism. Is there no end to it all? Why all these attacks? Are they blind that we and the world are in a middle, or at least at the tail end of a crisis? I would agree that the middle class had suffered by a drop in standard of living. Crisis does that to all, and as usual, the rich, who grew rich by saving, will always be able to weather the storms. But look at their depleted amounts - even though still huge by middle class standards, it is a substantial fall to their portfolios.</p>
              <p>So why the pessimism as if the middle class were intentionally shortchanged?Can Seah or anyone else offer anything better than derogatory pessimistic remarks with what our society are so hardworkingly and tirelessly doing by getting out of this crisis which is not of our making?</p>
              <p>As in any crisis, having a job is paramount and critical. Everyone worries about making the wrong life choices. But the most critical mistake a person can make with life choice decisions is to do nothing and rot at home. Get a job, earn some money and the chance to move up will be there. Restructure your loans or debts. No employer will turn away talents, than sit around at home and rot.</p>
              <p>And it is my fervant hope that employers, the minority of them whom are selfish, start behaving socially responsible to spread their wealth and not hoard it, or society and the wider circle of responsibly rich will be doomed and hated, held responsible for taking advantage of the crisis, by the less priviledge in this meantime.</p>

              <p>That's just a comment, everyone can gives comments in everything, but coming to responsibility, it is different.</p>
              <p>Yes, i agreed that economy is not as booming as the earlier years, so what, during that time, people also grumble and comment on high cost and low pays, now that economy is uneven with uncertainties, people still do the same, except now they got more basic with regard to the poor economic to support their comments.</p>
              <p>My take is simple, all things changes, be it up or down, left or right, good or new....we must learn to adapt and survive, keep complaining and doing nothing to upgrade oneself and yet blaming foreigners competition here is not going to send money down from heaven to you. Be realistic, go out, look for a job, learn a trade, upgrade your skill, retrain your profession, strive to lead and dun let age, foreigners and paid affect your road to success. If you all keep grumbling and cursing, in another 10 years time, you life will be the same or even worst..so start now. 10 years is enough for you to get a degrees or skills.</p>

              complaining and doing nothing to upgrade oneself and yet blaming
              foreigners competition here is not going to send money down from
              heaven to you. Be realistic, go out, look for a job, learn a trade,
              upgrade your skill, retrain your profession, strive to lead and dun
              let age, foreigners and paid affect your road to success. If you
              all keep grumbling and cursing, in another 10 years time, you life
              will be the same or even worst..so start now. 10 years is enough
              for you to get a degrees or skills.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">You are illustrating a macro problem with a micro view. This is not an individual problem.  Solving unenployment and ensuring a certain quality of life of the population is the responsibility of the government. </span><span style="color: #0000ff;">Lets keep to the topic, recession. A recession will inadvertably result in higher unemployment. People will be retrenched, money supply would drop, economy would shrink etc. Your take as above would not solve any problems, the solution would probably lie with govt policy (e.g. like england's policy that locals must be given preference for jobs, diverse economy, minimium wage etc etc. etc.).  <br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Just a thought about your talk on adaptation with sight on foreign immigration. If sg is attacked, would you surrender without fighting and adapt and assimilate into their culture? or would you prefer to fight for your motherland? (its similar in that thats where your interests lies)</span></p>

              <p>Just while away your time at regional centres like Tampines, Woodlands and  Jurong, and see the people spending. And assess for yourself the  if the people thronging the malls are the upper class, middle class, or third class, or even yuppies.</p>
              <p>No need for statistics, just go and open your eyes.</p>
              <p>There is money changing hands, circulating. That means business can be viable, that means goods and services are being produced, that means people have employment, that means people have money.</p>
              <p>Go and see who is spending.</p>
              <p>Don't swallow any selective crap of others, whether the crap is agreeable to you or not. </p>

              <p>those who have jobs, they are not affected by the recession. only those who do not have jobs or about to be retrenched, quitted or sacked, are the ones affected.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>even if your earning 1.6k a month, if you are not overspending and spend within of what you earned, you are not affected what.</p>
