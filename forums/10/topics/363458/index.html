              <p><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Kuan Yew still keen to know about welfare of Chinese in Malaysia </strong></span><br> <br> <strong>The Malaysian Insider, 9 Jun 2009, Shannon Teoh</strong><br> <br> KUALA LUMPUR, June 9 - It's been nearly 50 years but <span style="color: red;"><strong>the
              man who cried when Malaysia kicked Singapore out of the federation is
              still curious about how the Chinese in Malaysia are doing.<br> </strong></span> <br> It was telling that former Singapore prime minister<span style="color: red;"><strong> Lee Kuan Yew's first diplomatic meeting in his week-long visit to Malaysia was with MCA leaders last night.</strong></span> <strong><span style="color: blue;">He only met Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak </span></strong>today.<br> <br> The 90-minute meeting between Singapore's minister mentor and five MCA
              leaders led by president Datuk Seri Ong Tee Keat saw an exchange on
              various issues that continue to concern the Chinese in Malaysia.<br> <br> It is no secret that education and economic policies are a constant
              thorn in the side for MCA, who are now struggling to regain the support
              of the Chinese electorate, where eight out of 10 are said to support
              the opposition.<br> <br> Ong told reporters that Lee exchanged notes on the "competitiveness of the Chinese and the political situation in Malaysia."<br> <br> The Malaysian Insider understands that education systems were also on
              the agenda and the presence of MCA's education pointman and Youth chief
              Datuk Wee Ka Siong would have made for very current discussions on
              government scholarships and classes conducted in Chinese.<br> <br> Ong also called the meet a "learning experience" and a source told The
              Malaysian Insider that the 86-year-old statesman's knowledge of
              Malaysian history could put some Malaysian leaders to shame.<br> <br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Lee regaled his guests at his
              presidential suite in Mandarin Oriental with tales from the past,
              including his encounters with his counterpart the late Tunku Abdul
              Rahman, who was Malaysia's first prime minister until 1970.</strong></span></span><br> <br> The conversation was mostly in English and Lee was his usual astute
              self but there were some light-hearted moments involving health secrets
              which left the MCA leaders "hoping to be as fit as Lee when we are his
              age."<br> <br> Another highlight of Lee's week-long visit will be the mainly Chinese island of Penang.<br> <br> He will meet leaders of two majority Chinese parties - DAP which now
              controls the state with Lim Guan Eng as chief minister and Gerakan as
              represented by Tan Sri Koh Tsu Koon who is now in Najib's Cabinet.<br> <br> ------------------<br> <span style="color: navy;"><strong>More at <a href="http://singaporenewsalternative.blogspot.com/">Singapore News Alternative</a>:</strong><br> <br> 1.

              <p>Dr. Chee don't have a face and charisma of a reliable leader.</p>
              <p>So how would the people place their confidence with someone who doesn't look like a leader but insists on trying to be one?</p>
              <p>But yes, he's stubborn cos he really looks like a very stubborn person.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Even if people really need to support a rebel, they are at least wise enough to cast their votes at the better-looking one.</p>
              <p>For example, John McCain and Obama...one is old and chui-looking, the other is tall-dark and handsome.</p>
              <p>Of course Obama will win the elections lor.....</p>

              <p>The conversation was mostly in English and Lee was his usual astute self but there were some light-hearted moments involving health secrets which left the MCA leaders "hoping to be as fit as Lee when we are his age."</p>

              <p>LKY is very good, he go into MCA very well prepared by getting the right info and read the right pages, that's what i call a good presenter and leaders. Unlike most of our opposition leaders and supporters keep cursing and shouting, but nothing get moving..see already also want to cry for them.</p>
