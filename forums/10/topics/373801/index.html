              <h1>A New Path for Japan</h1>
              <p>
              </p><div class="byline">By YUKIO HATOYAMA</div>
              Published: August 26, 2009<p></p>
              <p>TOKYO — In the post-Cold War period, Japan has been continually
              buffeted by the winds of market fundamentalism in a U.S.-led movement
              that is more usually called globalization. In the fundamentalist
              pursuit of capitalism people are treated not as an end but as a means.
              <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Consequently, human dignity is lost.</strong></span></p>
              <p>How can we put an end to unrestrained market fundamentalism and
              financial capitalism, that are void of morals or moderation, in order
              to protect the finances and livelihoods of our citizens? That is the
              issue we are now facing.</p>
              <p>In these times, we must return to the
              idea of fraternity — as in the French slogan “liberté, égalité,
              fraternité” — as a force for moderating the danger inherent within
              freedom.</p>
              <p>Fraternity as I mean it can be described as a
              principle that aims to adjust to the excesses of the current globalized
              brand of capitalism and accommodate the local economic practices that
              have been fostered through our traditions.</p>
              <p>The recent economic
              crisis resulted from a way of thinking based on the idea that
              American-style free-market economics represents a universal and ideal
              economic order, and that all countries should modify the traditions and
              regulations governing their economies in line with global (or rather
              American) standards.</p>
              <p>In Japan, opinion was divided on how far the
              trend toward globalization should go. Some advocated the active embrace
              of globalism and leaving everything up to the dictates of the market.
              <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Others favored a more reticent approach, believing that efforts should
              be made to expand the social safety net and protect our traditional
              economic activities.</strong></span> Since the administration of Prime Minister
              Junichiro Koizumi (2001-2006), the Liberal Democratic Party has
              stressed the former, while we in the Democratic Party of Japan have
              tended toward the latter position.</p>
              <p>The economic order in any
              country is built up over long years and reflects the influence of
              traditions, habits and national lifestyles. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>But globalism has
              progressed without any regard for non-economic values, or for
              environmental issues or problems of resource restriction.</strong></span></p>
              <p>If we
              look back on the changes in Japanese society since the end of the Cold
              War, I believe <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>it is no exaggeration to say that the global economy has
              damaged traditional economic activities and destroyed local communities.</strong></span></p>
              <p>In
              terms of market theory, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>people are simply personnel expenses.</strong></span> But in
              the real world people support the fabric of the local community and are
              the physical embodiment of its lifestyle, traditions and culture. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>An
              individual gains respect as a person by acquiring a job and a role
              within the local community and being able to maintain his family’s
              livelihood.</strong></span></p>
              <p>Under the principle of fraternity, we would not
              implement policies that leave areas relating to human lives and safety
              — such as agriculture, the environment and medicine — to the mercy of
              globalism.</p>
              <p>Our responsibility as politicians is to refocus our
              attention on those non-economic values that have been thrown aside by
              the march of globalism. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>We must work on policies that regenerate the
              ties that bring people together, that take greater account of nature
              and the environment, that rebuild welfare and medical systems, that
              provide better education and child-rearing support, and that address
              wealth disparities. </strong></span></p>
              <p>Another national goal that emerges from the
              concept of fraternity is the creation of an East Asian community. Of
              course, the Japan-U.S. security pact will continue to be the
              cornerstone of Japanese diplomatic policy.</p>
              <p>But at the same
              time, we must not forget our identity as a nation located in Asia. I
              believe that the East Asian region, which is showing increasing
              vitality, must be recognized as Japan’s basic sphere of being. So we
              must continue to build frameworks for stable economic cooperation and
              security across the region.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The financial crisis has suggested to
              many that the era of U.S. unilateralism may come to an end. It has also
              raised doubts about the permanence of the dollar as the key global
              currency.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>I also feel that as a result of the failure of the Iraq
              war and the financial crisis, the era of U.S.-led globalism is coming
              to an end and that we are moving toward an era of multipolarity. </strong></span>But at
              present no one country is ready to replace the United States as the
              dominant country. Nor is there a currency ready to replace the dollar
              as the world’s key currency. Although the influence of the U.S. is
              declining, it will remain the world’s leading military and economic
              power for the next two to three decades.</p>
              <p>Current developments
              show clearly that China will become one of the world’s leading economic
              nations while also continuing to expand its military power. The size of
              China’s economy will surpass that of Japan in the not-too-distant
              future.</p>
              <p>How should Japan maintain its political and economic
              independence and protect its national interest when <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>caught between the
              United States, which is fighting to retain its position as the world’s
              dominant power, and China, which is seeking ways to become dominant? </strong></span></p>
              <p>This
              is a question of concern not only to Japan but also to the small and
              medium-sized nations in Asia. They want the military power of the U.S.
              to function effectively for the stability of the region but want to
              restrain U.S. political and economic excesses. They also want to reduce
              the military threat posed by our neighbor China while ensuring that
              China’s expanding economy develops in an orderly fashion. These are
              major factors accelerating regional integration.</p>
              <p>Today, as the
              supranational political and economic philosophies of Marxism and
              globalism have, for better or for worse, stagnated, nationalism is once
              again starting to have a major influence in various countries.</p>
              <p>As
              we seek to build new structures for international cooperation, we must
              overcome excessive nationalism and go down a path toward rule-based
              economic cooperation and security.</p>
              <p>Unlike Europe, the countries
              of this region differ in size, development stage and political system,
              so economic integration cannot be achieved over the short term.
              However, we should nonetheless aspire to move toward regional currency
              integration as a natural extension of the rapid economic growth begun
              by Japan, followed by South Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong, and then
              achieved by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and
              China. We must spare no effort to build the permanent security
              frameworks essential to underpinning currency integration.</p>
              <p>Establishing
              a common Asian currency will likely take more than 10 years. For such a
              single currency to bring about political integration will surely take
              longer still.</p>
              <p>ASEAN, Japan, China (including Hong Kong), South
              Korea and Taiwan now account for one quarter of the world’s gross
              domestic product. The economic power of the East Asian region and the
              interdependent relationships within the region have grown wider and
              deeper. So the structures required for the formation of a regional
              economic bloc are already in place.</p>
              <p>On the other hand, due to
              historical and cultural conflicts as well as conflicting national
              security interests, we must recognize that there are numerous difficult
              political issues. The problems of increased militarization and
              territorial disputes cannot be resolved by bilateral negotiations
              between, for example, Japan and South Korea, or Japan and China. The
              more these problems are discussed bilaterally, the greater the risk
              that emotions become inflamed and nationalism intensified.</p>
              <p>Therefore,
              I would suggest, somewhat paradoxically, that the issues that stand in
              the way of regional integration can only be truly resolved by moving
              toward greater integration. The experience of the E.U. shows us how
              regional integration can defuse territorial disputes.</p>
              <p>I believe
              that regional integration and collective security is the path we should
              follow toward realizing the principles of pacifism and multilateral
              cooperation advocated by the Japanese Constitution. It is also the
              appropriate path for protecting Japan’s political and economic
              independence and pursuing our interests in our position between the
              United States and China.</p>
              <p>Let me conclude by quoting the words of
              Count Coudenhove-Kalergi, founder of the first popular movement for a
              united Europe, written 85 years ago in “Pan-Europa” (my grandfather,
              Ichiro Hatoyama, translated his book, “The Totalitarian State Against
              Man,” into Japanese): “All great historical ideas started as a utopian
              dream and ended with reality. Whether a particular idea remains as a
              utopian dream or becomes a reality depends on the number of people who
              believe in the ideal and their ability to act upon it.”</p>
              <p><em>Yukio Hatoyama heads the Democratic Party of Japan, and would become
              prime minister should the party win in Sunday’s elections. A longer
              version of this article appears in the September issue of the monthly
              Japanese journal Voice.</em></p>
