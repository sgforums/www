              <p><br>Congratulations to the "zwei-siao-HOG" for finally being brave to mention the words that it fear most when it is confused between "nationality" and "country of origin" - and finally is willing to declare the very words that reveals its "nationality" and "country of origin"</p>
              <p>If only the "zwei-siao-HOG" has more pride as a pseudo-Bavarian-HOG it would have at least admitted to its own infatuation with the "fecal waste matters" that only a "Turd from Turdistan" - like itself - can be truly "zwei-siao" enough to be besotted with.</p>
              <p>Can anyone one else be as creative as a "zwei-siao-pseudo-Bavarian-HOG" in its intimate knowledge of the "fecal waste matters" ?</p>
              <p>Who else can be more knowledgeable and more wanton to murder CSJ and keeping CSJ's 'little Dickie' in its mind and displaying it teasingly from its mouth repeatedly ?</p>
              <p>It is so pathetic to see the proud "zwei-siao-pseudo-Bavarian-HOG" is reduced to the art of plagiarizing, when it has run out of its vitrolic creativity by spitting uselessly into the wind only to have its phlegm repeatedly blown back into its face.</p>
              <p>The Tommies have left Singapore since the 1970s, is there any use to harp on them -when it was not the Tommies being referred to - but a particular Tommy which is a blue eye boy of old dirty Harry ?</p>
              <p>Obviously, your creativity has been bankrupted by your self-inflicted frustration when you insist to spit your phlegm into the wind, only to have the phlegm blown back into your eyes repeatedly.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">It is open knowledge that CSJ cannot be trusted with political power</span></em>." ?</p>
              <p>Only a dumb self-inflated <a rel="nofollow" href="http://blog.jarofjuice.com/2008/03/attention-seeking-syndrome-the-early-experiences/">‘<strong>A.S.S.</strong>’  </a>- that is as bad as the X-rated Fraud with a pseudo-intellect will make the hot gassed statement.</p>
              <p>The only open knowledge seen todate is the wind that blows into the cavities of the small and void cranium at the top of your skull, and create the vast echoes as the wind is trapped inside the small closed spaces.</p>
              <p>How did a "pseudo-Bavarian-HOG" - that is known for all its "zwei-siao" ways - come to its own conclusion about "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">political power</span></em>" being exercised by CSJ ?</p>
              <p>Has CSJ ever exercised "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">political power</span></em>" ?</p>
              <p>If any "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">political power</span></em>" that has been exercised by CSJ - it can only be seen within the SDP, in which the SDP Constitution was made even more DEMOCRATIC.</p>
              <p>The SDP Constitution is open and more democratic to every one of its members, and will put the PAP to shame with Its straight jacket rules of LKY's PAP, which has all the powers centred in the CEC, and with limited power vested to the Cadre Corp that is formed by members that are vetted and accepted by the CEC - who will entrust the Cadre to elect CEC members according to instructions, and with the PAP General Membership sitting as observers on the sidelines.  </p>
              <p>Surprisingly, Chiam's SPP has similarly adopted the PAP's organisational methods to prevent the general membership to vote him out of the Party again - considering the smack from his previous SDP members had given him in their vote of no confidence to his leadership.</p>
              <p>It will not be a surprise to the closed mind of a "zwei-siao-pseudo-Bavarian-HOG" that CSJ has adopted a more open and democratic SDP - in which he can be similarly voted out of office by the general membership of the SDP.</p>
              <p>Despite such a possibility, the SDP is organised without the compartmentalising of powers that serves the insecure personalities such as LKY and CST.</p>
              <p>Yet, CSJ managed to retain the confidence of the general membership by his own examplary willingness <em><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">to walk the talk</span></strong></em> - to challenge the illegal Laws pushed by LKY through his rubber stamping one party dominated Parliament.</p>
              <p>It is obvious that the "zwei-siao-pseudo-Bavarian-HOG" is bitter towards CSJ for leaving a bitter taste in its mouth after its fulfilling its desires with CSJ's dickie.</p>

              <p>If it is "ALL TALK ONLY BULLSHIT EVERYDAY" - you seem to be doing very well so far to be able to grasp all that is said, and to have kept your interests fixated everyday - you must be preserving loads of it for your slow digestion ?</p>
              <p>Why will you think that I will be as deluded with your kind of vanity - that you will allow yourself to think that anyone will be interested in my post ? </p>
              <p>The only one that is not skipping my posted replies seem to be your self-defeating interest to be anxious to what is coming up next.</p>

              <p><br>Congratulations to the "zwei-siao-HOG" for finally being brave to mention the words that it fear most when it is confused between "nationality" and "country of origin" - and finally is willing to declare the very words that reveals its "nationality" and "country of origin"</p>
              <p>If only the "zwei-siao-HOG" has more pride as a pseudo-Bavarian-HOG it would have at least admitted to its own infatuation with the "fecal waste matters" that only a "Turd from Turdistan" - like itself - can be truly "zwei-siao" enough to be besotted with.</p>
              <p>Can anyone one else be as creative as a "zwei-siao-pseudo-Bavarian-HOG" in its intimate knowledge of the "fecal waste matters" ?</p>
              <p>Who else can be more knowledgeable and more wanton to murder CSJ and keeping CSJ's 'little Dickie' in its mind and displaying it teasingly from its mouth repeatedly ?</p>
              <p>It is so pathetic to see the proud "zwei-siao-pseudo-Bavarian-HOG" is reduced to the art of plagiarizing, when it has run out of its vitrolic creativity by spitting uselessly into the wind only to have its phlegm repeatedly blown back into its face.</p>
              <p>The Tommies have left Singapore since the 1970s, is there any use to harp on them -when it was not the Tommies being referred to - but a particular Tommy which is a blue eye boy of old dirty Harry ?</p>
              <p>Obviously, your creativity has been bankrupted by your self-inflicted frustration when you insist to spit your phlegm into the wind, only to have the phlegm blown back into your eyes repeatedly.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">It is open knowledge that CSJ cannot be trusted with political power</span></em>." ?</p>
              <p>Only a dumb self-inflated <a rel="nofollow" href="http://blog.jarofjuice.com/2008/03/attention-seeking-syndrome-the-early-experiences/">‘<strong>A.S.S.</strong>’  </a>- that is as bad as the X-rated Fraud with a pseudo-intellect will make the hot gassed statement.</p>
              <p>The only open knowledge seen todate is the wind that blows into the cavities of the small and void cranium at the top of your skull, and create the vast echoes as the wind is trapped inside the small closed spaces.</p>
              <p>How did a "pseudo-Bavarian-HOG" - that is known for all its "zwei-siao" ways - come to its own conclusion about "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">political power</span></em>" being exercised by CSJ ?</p>
              <p>Has CSJ ever exercised "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">political power</span></em>" ?</p>
              <p>If any "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">political power</span></em>" that has been exercised by CSJ - it can only be seen within the SDP, in which the SDP Constitution was made even more DEMOCRATIC.</p>
              <p>The SDP Constitution is open and more democratic to every one of its members, and will put the PAP to shame with Its straight jacket rules of LKY's PAP, which has all the powers centred in the CEC, and with limited power vested to the Cadre Corp that is formed by members that are vetted and accepted by the CEC - who will entrust the Cadre to elect CEC members according to instructions, and with the PAP General Membership sitting as observers on the sidelines.  </p>
              <p>Surprisingly, Chiam's SPP has similarly adopted the PAP's organisational methods to prevent the general membership to vote him out of the Party again - considering the smack from his previous SDP members had given him in their vote of no confidence to his leadership.</p>
              <p>It will not be a surprise to the closed mind of a "zwei-siao-pseudo-Bavarian-HOG" that CSJ has adopted a more open and democratic SDP - in which he can be similarly voted out of office by the general membership of the SDP.</p>
              <p>Despite such a possibility, the SDP is organised without the compartmentalising of powers that serves the insecure personalities such as LKY and CST.</p>
              <p>Yet, CSJ managed to retain the confidence of the general membership by his own examplary willingness <em><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">to walk the talk</span></strong></em> - to challenge the illegal Laws pushed by LKY through his rubber stamping one party dominated Parliament.</p>
              <p>It is obvious that the "zwei-siao-pseudo-Bavarian-HOG" is bitter towards CSJ for leaving a bitter taste in its mouth after its fulfilling its desires with CSJ's dickie.</p>

              <p><br>Did I state anything about murdering CSJ? You can jolly well keep on sucking on CSJ's little dickie and cease to grow up, you little piece of shit. CSJ has retained the confidence of the general membership of SDP but lost the loyalty of the people by ruining the bread and butter of the common people.</p>
              <p>So far, the WP, RP, NSP and SPP are way ahead in winning the hearts and minds of the common people but many Singaporeans view the SDP as a political circus.</p>
