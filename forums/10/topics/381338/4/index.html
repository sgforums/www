              <p><br>Where were you when recession hit Singapore in 1987-88, and again in 1997 ?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Studying</span><br><br>In response to the 1987 recession, Dr Chee Soon Juan had written a book "Dare to Change" in 1994 - in which he had already advocated that Singapore has to wean itself from MNCs that are dependent on cheap labor and for Singapore to create an environment that will allow our own entrepreneurs to grow.</p>
              <p>In his 1994 book, he had also offered alternative ideas for changes to our education system that will allow our children to be nurtured into Thinkers and Problem Solvers and not simply rote learners regurgitating text books facts.</p>
              <p>The fact that an academician had popped into the political scene shocked LKY and his PAP, in the same manner when JBJ broke the duck's egg and got himself into Parliament during the 1981 election.</p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://singabloodypore.rsfblog.org/archive/2007/05/21/joshua-benjamin-jeyaretnam-on-bended-knees-never.html">Lee Kuan Yew was said to be furious with the victory achieved by Joshua B. Jeyaratnam (*1) </a>- can we expect anything less from LKY in reaction for the sudden appearance of CSJ in the 1992, when he had just gotten rid of JBJ through several fixes designed to get JBJ out of Parliament ?</p>
              <p>It is only obvious that CSJ had to be removed to prevent any threat to the planned succession of LHL sometime in the next ten years into the future.</p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://kentridgecommon.com/?p=4096">‘Do you seriously believe you have any access to any publicity of any opinions or interviews of politicians from the Alternative Political Parties concerning their plans to handle the current recessions(*2) </a>?</p>
              <p>Are you suggesting that First World Countries such as UK and Japan - with their mature political systems and practised politics - can be comparable to the politics practised in Singapore ?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">First World countries politics cannot be compared to SG due to more sophiscated nature which i am unbale to regurgitate here, but i am doing a comparison on how opposition figures themselves do not voice out and damage their own country and cause hardship if economic blocs are put up just to spite the government, look at Myanmar. Please read what i write properly before blasting me<br></span><br>Do First World Democracies such as UK and Japan need to have any help to bring down any of their political leaders when their mature politicians from any parties keep the sanctity of their Constitution intact, and make no attempt to change the Constitution to protect or advance their own selfish political agenda ? </p>
              <p>Singapore may have all the facade and external trappings of a modern First World, which unfortunately is a cleverly disguised theatre that is deliberately designed by LKY to suit his style of autocratic-paternalistic politics and political governance.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">i can see that from various newspaper articles, reviews, that is why we need more mature, credible opposition leaders. Dr Chee's antics does not go well with the local public, his academic findings should led to a brain battle with the ruling elite, throwing up ideas through dialogue rather than protesting and getting arrested which put the opposition parties in a bad light</span><br><br>All the verbiage about Asian Societies with Confucian values are no more then self-serving reasons to advance LKY's and his PAP political agendas.</p>
              <p>Singapore may have attained the semblance of a First World Country, but it is runned by Third World Politicians in Third World settings similar to that of Zimbabwe. </p>

              <p>The last statement is erroneous in assuming that CSJ is "the Opposition" personified - can one person's political strategy reflect the entire Opposition ?</p>
              <p>Secondly, the manner in which LKY and the PAP had targetted CSJ - since his first political outing in 1992 - showed that politics have taken on an ugly personal level, in the same manner that the same treatment was meted to the late-JBJ.</p>
              <p>Such treatment dished out in general doses are largely directed to those whom LKY feel most insecure with and see the most potent threat from.</p>
              <p>Those personalities include Francis Seow (the previous Solicitor-General in SG), Tang Liang Hong, and those Ex-Barisan Sosialis members who were released but denied their political rights after being incarcerated even as they were part of the Founding Fathers of the PAP.</p>
              <p>CSJ can no longer be in any position to win votes as long as he has a bankruptcy judgment that amount to millions to keep him out of politics.</p>
              <p>He can only be a political activists to play on the conscience of LKY and the PAP leadership to remind them of their social and constitutional responsibilities towards Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>Who else can play this role - when even the Law Society is not allowed to participate in their Constitutional sanctioned role to assist the Government in the legislative processes as part of the social responsibility of the Law Society ?</p>
              <p>Be as it may, it is plain silly for the educated and younger Singapore Generations not to realise that without any willing voices to speak boldly and honestly on behalf of Singaporeans, the present route that LKY and the PAP will surely lead Singapore to a more unstable and uncertain future.</p>
              <p>Thinkers like Catherine Lim also sees the same danger, and so do other silent ones that know better then to raise their profile.</p>

              <p><br>Where were you when recession hit Singapore in 1987-88, and again in 1997 ?</p>
              <p><span style="COLOR: #ff0000">Studying</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">How much do you know of what transpired during the 1987-88 and the 1997 crash ?</span></strong><br><br>In response to the 1987 recession, Dr Chee Soon Juan had written a book "Dare to Change" in 1994 - in which he had already advocated that Singapore has to wean itself from MNCs that are dependent on cheap labor and for Singapore to create an environment that will allow our own entrepreneurs to grow.</p>
              <p>In his 1994 book, he had also offered alternative ideas for changes to our education system that will allow our children to be nurtured into Thinkers and Problem Solvers and not simply rote learners regurgitating text books facts.</p>
              <p>The fact that an academician had popped into the political scene shocked LKY and his PAP, in the same manner when JBJ broke the duck's egg and got himself into Parliament during the 1981 election.</p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://singabloodypore.rsfblog.org/archive/2007/05/21/joshua-benjamin-jeyaretnam-on-bended-knees-never.html">Lee Kuan Yew was said to be furious with the victory achieved by Joshua B. Jeyaratnam (*1) </a>- can we expect anything less from LKY in reaction for the sudden appearance of CSJ in the 1992, when he had just gotten rid of JBJ through several fixes designed to get JBJ out of Parliament ?</p>
              <p>It is only obvious that CSJ had to be removed to prevent any threat to the planned succession of LHL sometime in the next ten years into the future.</p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://kentridgecommon.com/?p=4096">‘Do you seriously believe you have any access to any publicity of any opinions or interviews of politicians from the Alternative Political Parties concerning their plans to handle the current recessions(*2) </a>?</p>
              <p>Are you suggesting that First World Countries such as UK and Japan - with their mature political systems and practised politics - can be comparable to the politics practised in Singapore ?</p>
              <p><span style="COLOR: #ff0000">First World countries politics cannot be compared to SG due to more sophiscated nature which i am unbale to regurgitate here, but i am doing a comparison on how opposition figures themselves do not voice out and damage their own country and cause hardship if economic blocs are put up just to spite the government, look at Myanmar. Please read what i write properly before blasting me<br></span><br><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">If the politics of the First World countries cannot be compared to SG due to whatever reasons - is there any objectivity or purpose to compare the present political situation in SG which is so different from those First World countries that you wish to compare CSJ's action with ?</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">The reason for breaking up your post into paragraph is to make careful and clear understanding of your writing instead of lumping your wonderful work into a general piece of unprocessed writing.</span></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Do First World Democracies such as UK and Japan need to have any help to bring down any of their political leaders when their mature politicians from any parties keep the sanctity of their Constitution intact, and make no attempt to change the Constitution to protect or advance their own selfish political agenda ? </p>
              <p>Singapore may have all the facade and external trappings of a modern First World, which unfortunately is a cleverly disguised theatre that is deliberately designed by LKY to suit his style of autocratic-paternalistic politics and political governance.</p>
              <p><span style="COLOR: #ff0000">i can see that from various newspaper articles, reviews, that is why we need more mature, credible opposition leaders. Dr Chee's antics does not go well with the local public, his academic findings should led to a brain battle with the ruling elite, throwing up ideas through dialogue rather than protesting and getting arrested which put the opposition parties in a bad light</span><br><br><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">If you depend on the various newspaper articles and reviews - presumably all are Singaporean publications - you may as well subject yourself to the monotonous sound from a continuous syncophantic hammer drill held by the PAP control of SPH.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Obviously, CSJ actions have been derided into antics by the publications that are controlled by PAP - do you expect anything complimentary to be said about you by someone who has negative feelings towards you that emanates from the core of their being ?</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Are you certain that given the political evolution in Singapore as it is, there can be any possibility of LKY and his PAP to allow CSJ any space to throw up his ideas and have any debate ?</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">If there is such a desire, will there be a need to have such tight controls to prevent public support to any Alternative Political Parties.</span></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>All the verbiage about Asian Societies with Confucian values are no more then self-serving reasons to advance LKY's and his PAP political agendas.</p>
              <p>Singapore may have attained the semblance of a First World Country, but it is runned by Third World Politicians in Third World settings similar to that of Zimbabwe. </p>

              <p>What else can be forthcoming from the bankrupt mind of a X-rated Fraud that cannot even see that the spotlight which you seek for your grandstanding performance has been turned on you - and still your ignorance has been so clear in your continued avoidance to engage on any issues that have exposed your pseudo-intellect ?</p>
              <p>It is obvious that your position here is to provide the mindless syncophantic support for the PAP in the manner that LKY had feared in his youth, but which he had been so successful to harness the mindless and unthinking, poor educated Singaporeans like you.</p>
              <p>How could supposedly educated Singaporeans become pseudo-intellect ?</p>
              <p>Was it not a result of the years of education before the PAP decided in Year 2002 - to revamp the entire school syllabus to produce THINKING and PROBLEM SOLVING students ?</p>
              <p>Obviously, you cannot be in the group that the PAP begin to nurture from Year 2002 ?</p>
              <p>Sadly, the X-rated Fraud can only continue to be trashed and remained with its deafening silence, to be only a danger to itself when alone, and spread its genius in regurgitating ideas that it plagiarized from others.</p>

Is this an open, or is this a closed society? Is it a society where men can preach ideas - novel, unorthodox, heresies, to established churches and established governments - where there is a constant contest for men's hearts and minds on the basis of what is right, of what is just, of what is in the national interests, or is it a closed society where the mass media - the newspapaers, the journals, publications, TV, radio - either bound by sound or by sight, or both sound and sight, men's minds are fed with a <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">constant drone of sycophantic support</span></span> for a particular orthodox political philosophy? That is the first question we asked ourselves. I would like to see minds stimulated and debate provoked, and truth refined and crystallized out of the conflict of different evidence and views. I, therefore, welcome every and any opportunity of a chance to agree, or to dissent, in order that out of thesis comes synthesis - thesis, anti-major premise, anti-premise, synthesis, so we progress... I welcome every opportunity to meet members of the opposition, and so do members of my party, over the radio, over the television, university forums, public rallies. We never run away from the open encounter. If your ideas, your views cannot stand the challenge of criticism then they are too fragile and not sturdy enough to last. I am talking of the principle of the open society, the open debate, ideas, not intimidation, persuasion not coercion... Sir, the basic fundamentals we asked ourselves...is whether the duties of the Minister of Information and Broadcasting are to produce closed minds or open minds, because these instruments - the mass media, the TV, the radio - can produce either the open minds receptive to ideas and ideals, a democratic system of life, or closed and limited. But I know that the open debate is a painful process for closed minds...But let me make this point: that 5 million adult minds in Malaysia cannot be closed - definitely not in the lifetime of the people in authority. It is not possible because whatever the faults of the colonial system, and there are many...they generated the open mind, the inquiring mind."</span> <em>- Lee Kuan Yew Dec 18, 1964 Malaysian Parliamentary Debates </em></span></span></p>

SGreans love the opposition more than the ruling elite which is certainly not to be taken lightly but should be canvassed, harnessed.<br>As already mentioned earlier, we need more opposition not just to oppose but bring SG better.

              <p>The last statement is erroneous in assuming that CSJ is "the Opposition" personified - can one person's political strategy reflect the entire Opposition ?</p>
              <p>Secondly, the manner in which LKY and the PAP had targetted CSJ - since his first political outing in 1992 - showed that politics have taken on an ugly personal level, in the same manner that the same treatment was meted to the late-JBJ.</p>
              <p>Such treatment dished out in general doses are largely directed to those whom LKY feel most insecure with and see the most potent threat from.</p>
              <p>Those personalities include Francis Seow (the previous Solicitor-General in SG), Tang Liang Hong, and those Ex-Barisan Sosialis members who were released but denied their political rights after being incarcerated even as they were part of the Founding Fathers of the PAP.</p>
              <p>CSJ can no longer be in any position to win votes as long as he has a bankruptcy judgment that amount to millions to keep him out of politics.</p>
              <p>He can only be a political activists to play on the conscience of LKY and the PAP leadership to remind them of their social and constitutional responsibilities towards Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>Who else can play this role - when even the Law Society is not allowed to participate in their Constitutional sanctioned role to assist the Government in the legislative processes as part of the social responsibility of the Law Society ?</p>
              <p>Be as it may, it is plain silly for the educated and younger Singapore Generations not to realise that without any willing voices to speak boldly and honestly on behalf of Singaporeans, the present route that LKY and the PAP will surely lead Singapore to a more unstable and uncertain future.</p>
              <p>Thinkers like Catherine Lim also sees the same danger, and so do other silent ones that know better then to raise their profile.</p>

              <p>thats true forgot that he is still in bankruptcy judgement....I alway feels that CSJ could perharps do better to explain to public the reason of gaining greater voices in the affair of the govt.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately singaporean are still not clear about what kind of political reformed that is needed.  They heard one side of the view that 2 party system is not for SG....I think there is a lack of educating why the needs for greater distribution of power and what kind of reformed needed to our parlimentary system.</p>

Worse still, isnt your claim unsupported by the evidences of changes within our system since self governance under the brits till today?</p>
              <p>Or are you seeking for a change just for the sake of changing - from the boiling pot into the frying pan?</p>

              <p>Unfortunately, whatever CSJ's ideas are that have been reported are and will be generally skewed by the controlled local print and broadcast medias.</p>
              <p>Can he be represented accurately by any local print and broadcast media ?</p>
              <p>Can anyone count on the State controlled print and broadcast media to provide CSJ or any Politician from the Alternative Political Parties equal space and time to reach out to Singaporeans ?</p>
              <p>Until Singaporeans believe that the PAP has no right to change the Singapore Constitution to give only themselves the Rights guaranteed while denying the same to Singaporeans - then nothing that Dr Chee does will be seen to be credible.</p>
              <p>At this stage of the political development, it is retrogressive - as the generations that lived through the events of WW-2, of the 1950s till 1965, are familiar with the political space and knew what was political freedom.</p>
              <p>Obviously, for PAP's own poltiical interests - they will tweak the interpretation of the events of the 1950s to 60's - to focus attention to their interpretations of uncertainties, death and destruction from riots - when most of those events were deliberately set up by the political leadership themselves for their own political gains.</p>
              <p>The generations that grew from 1965 to 1975 saw the beginning of the political space being shrunk; while the generations that were born from 1975 till the present have been nurtured to the values of the PAP that politics is for the Politicians, and that no one is more qualified than the elite talents <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">appointed</span></strong> to political office.</p>
              <p>The emphasis is on "<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">appointed</span></strong>" - as LKY and the PAP believe that only they are the ones qualified to select and annoint who should be in politics, and those that they cannot accept to be their partner in politics will be mowed and shredded.</p>
              <p>How else could Chiam See Tong and Low Thia Kiang lasted so long, while the late JBJ who was as fiery and outspoken as CSJ were cut down ruthlessly, and those with the qualifications and fast minds of Francis Seow and Tang Liang Hong - (and the other PAP Founding Fathers who disagreed with LKY and his team) - were all persecuted into oblivion ?</p>

              <p class="quote_body"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #000000;">That will probably happen why MM is not here, PAP cannot survive for long as they keep on having the GRC system and parachuting in their candidates into these cozy positions even w/o a fight with anyone. It's a matter of time. These candidates cannot even be seem in any functional activity in their wards, i do not need to drop names, it's very obvious.</span><br><strong></strong></span></p>

              <p>The other danger for Singapore is that by the time MM move on from this world, how much more damage would have occurred for Singapore, when his ideas are set in concrete and become institutionalised, to be accepted as the Golden Rules even by majority of Singaporeans blinded by the false values created to entrench the PAP ?</p>
              <p>When LKY dared to evoke the values of ancient Confucianism  - which had basically stratified the roles of government and citizenry - simply to give its old philosophy a new twist to validate his own relevance and that of the PAP style of benevolent autocratic politics, the majority of the older Chinese educated population lauded his wisdom, only to regret the political fallout from the decades of his autocratic rule without the much hoped for benevolence.</p>

              <p>The Straits Times have shared their archive with the National Library, and it seems that you can access them from home by having an account with National Library.</p>
              <p>It is a treasure trove of information of events that transpired in Singapore based on the PAP's version of political issues, and their preferred visions of anything to do with Singapore's position on social and cultural developments - other then factual events.</p>
              <p>If you are overseas, you could make an effort to visit the British National Archive to search the released Official Records from its Colonial Office.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">All along SG news have skewed towards the ruling elite and is more biased reporting and outright offensive, not doubt about that...<br>With regards to the BNA, can a non-citizen get in to view?Pls PM me</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> No one should bashed one's "own country" - and the skewed impression given to CSJ's call to Obama has been deliberated given a twist to suit the political agenda to sully his name further.</p>
              <p>Is it not surreal that the syncophantic insistence continue to ignore the clear facts made to show the differences in what was published in the Temasek Review, with what the TS had printed ?</p>
              <p>It is not a surprise that the xenophobic rabble rousers will double their efforts to stoke up the fire with more inflammotary efforts so as to light up their xenophobic heroism in seemingly defending Singapore, even as they hide their true work to cover the misdeeds of LKY and the PAP on Singapore and Singaporeans.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"> TS or ST?!</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Even if FOX is not independent and can be bias in favor of the Right Wing Politics, at least in the USA there is the immense opportunity for any other disgusted citizens to set up private capital to start a competing publication to counter the controlled bias.</p>
              <p>Can this happen in Singapore ? <span style="color: #ff0000;">Afraid NOT when the ruling elite still holds rein parachuting desk bound jockeys to political positions and holding skewedviews that destroy our heritage/history in terms of progress[eg wet market]</span></p>
              <p>Without an alternative and independent publications to offer alternative opportunities to those maligned by the State-controlled print and broadcast media - Singaporeans can only have their views and values moulded and "trained" in one direction. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Unfortunately, whatever his ideas are that have been reported are generally skewed by the local print and broadcast medias.</p>
              <p>Can he be represented accurately by any local print and broadcast media ?</p>
              <p>Can anyone count on the State controlled print and broadcast media to provide CSJ or any Politician from the Alternative Political Parties equal space and time to reach out to Singaporeans ?</p>
              <p>Until Singaporeans believe that the PAP has no right to change the Singapore Constitution to give only themselves the Rights guaranteed and deny the same to Singaporeans - then nothing that Dr Chee does will be seen to be credible.</p>
              <p>At this stage of the political development, it is retrogressive - as the generations that lived through the WW-2, the events of the 1950s till 1965, had the political space and knew what was political freedom.</p>
              <p>The generations that grew from 1965 to 1975 saw the beginning of the political space; while the generations that were born from 1975 till the present have been nurtured to the values of the PAP that politics is for the Politicians, and that no one is more qualified than the elite talents <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">appointed</span></strong> to political office.</p>
              <p>The emphasis is on "<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">appointed</span></strong>" - as LKY and the PAP believe that only they are the one qualified to select and annoint who should be in politics, and those that they cannot accept from their own political judgment to be their partner in politics will be mowed and shredded.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">The older generation regreted their blatant support for the ruling elite only recently when they realised that policies are going against them and is more n more biased in terms of employment, housing, CPF </span></p>
              <p> </p>
