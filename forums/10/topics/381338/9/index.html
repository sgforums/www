              <p><br>CSJ is obviously a traitor of Singapore. By publicly encouraging U.S to impose trade blocks on his own motherland, Singapore.</p>
              <p>Just because of his own personal vendetta with the ruling party of Singapore, he is plotting to bring down the entire nation and it's citizens.</p>
              <p>Did he even bother to seek the people's opinions first before he went ahead and execute his retarded request?</p>
              <p>A self-imposed politician who has no support from the people equally as dangerous as a terrorist.</p>
              <p>What's the difference between this political terrorist and the real terrorist since they both seeked external power to burn down his own motherland?</p>
              <p>Someone should sign him up for permanent homestay in guantanamo bay.</p>

              <p>If only there were more political parties which truly care for the welfare of the people. What CSJ doesn't understand is that many Singaporeans couldn't care less about the political situation here. As long as Singapore enjoys a high standard of living ala Western nations with a growing and sustainable GDP, many Singaporeans would be satisfied with that. Yes, some people might complain that taxation is very high here, and that is only one of only few things which I can think of, which is not good here.</p>

              <p><br>The problems that the resident "zwei-siao-pseudo-Bavarian-Hog" has seems to be multi-fold that seems to begin and does not end with its reading and comprehension abilities, but will also include a deliberate determination to make CSJ as "zwei-siao" as its own miscreation can help itself to be..</p>
              <p>CSJ wants to pervert the law just like the PAP ?</p>
              <p>If the PAP has perverted the Law - is there any Law left to be perverted by CSJ ?</p>
              <p>Are the laws that have been perverted by the PAP left to be any kind of reasonable Laws - when such Laws will go against the common sense of Human decency ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>*** This seems to be the wrong question asked from one who is not a "human" but a "zwei-siao-pseudo-Bavarian-Hog", and certainly has little "decency" of any kind, let alone of the "Human decency" type. ***</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If CSJ had gone out of his ways to challenge such perverted Laws - is he merely doing it for his own sake, or is he challenging the PAP's perverted Laws - when no one else will do so ?</p>
              <p>If such acts by CSJ to challenge the PAP's acts of perverting the Singapore Laws are not standing up for the Rights of Singapore - what else can CSJ possibly be doing ?</p>
              <p>Is this ironical or simply characteristically "zwei-siao" for a pseudo-Bavarian Hog to indulge in the words that aptly apply to justify CSJ's actions - if only it can straighten its thinking as a "zwei-siao" hog.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Sometimes one will need to wonder if you are simply "zwei-siao" -  or simply being deliberately "zwei-siao" - which makes your kind of "zwei-siao" type of stupidity truly insufferable, as it is forever in action - as such "zwei-siao" idiocy knows no rest.</p>

              <p>How many %percentage of your annual income goes into taxes?</p>
              <p>I hope you can understand that I'm referring to your income tax.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you do not wish to compare with other countries, then tell us what is your ideal income tax %percentage.</p>

              <p><br>Actually, i consider that any money i'm made to give to the government which is based on a percentage of my income to be an income tax.</p>
              <p>Thus, i consider that CPF is also an income tax.</p>
              <p>So although we may have to pay low or no income tax, we still pay around 30%(Including employer contribution) of our monthly income to the government. A sum we would probably never get to see in its entirety unless we opt to migrate and never come back again (i believe we would have to put back the sum if we want to come back to work).</p>
              <p>So, we give a sizeable portion of our income to the government but we would never get free use of it ever again how is this different from a tax? </p>
              <p>You may argue that we can use it to service the loans for our homes but i see it equivalent to say a tax rebate or tax deductable.</p>

              <p><br>The problems that the resident "zwei-siao-pseudo-Bavarian-Hog" has seems to be multi-fold that seems to begin and does not end with its reading and comprehension abilities, but will also include a deliberate determination to make CSJ as "zwei-siao" as its own miscreation can help itself to be..</p>
              <p>CSJ wants to pervert the law just like the PAP ?</p>
              <p>If the PAP has perverted the Law - is there any Law left to be perverted by CSJ ?</p>
              <p>Are the laws that have been perverted by the PAP left to be any kind of reasonable Laws - when such Laws will go against the common sense of Human decency ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>*** This seems to be the wrong question asked from one who is not a "human" but a "zwei-siao-pseudo-Bavarian-Hog", and certainly has little "decency" of any kind, let alone of the "Human decency" type. ***</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If CSJ had gone out of his ways to challenge such perverted Laws - is he merely doing it for his own sake, or is he challenging the PAP's perverted Laws - when no one else will do so ?</p>
              <p>If such acts by CSJ to challenge the PAP's acts of perverting the Singapore Laws are not standing up for the Rights of Singapore - what else can CSJ possibly be doing ?</p>
              <p>Is this ironical or simply characteristically "zwei-siao" for a pseudo-Bavarian Hog to indulge in the words that aptly apply to justify CSJ's actions - if only it can straighten its thinking as a "zwei-siao" hog.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Sometimes one will need to wonder if you are simply "zwei-siao" -  or simply being deliberately "zwei-siao" - which makes your kind of "zwei-siao" type of stupidity truly insufferable, as it is forever in action - as such "zwei-siao" idiocy knows no rest.</p>
