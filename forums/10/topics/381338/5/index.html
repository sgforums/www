              <p>Should one not be surprised that the X-rated Fraud will avoid answering the exposes written on its butt, and will prefer to find easy meat that it hope to impress with its syncophantic idiocy ?</p>

              <p> How can a X-rated Fraud know what "change" should be when its dull mind is contented with the comfort zone that it locks intself into ?</p>
              <p>What changes to the "PAP System" has the X-rated Fraud seen with its deep set myopia when the "PAP system" has been governing Singapore since 1957 ?</p>
              <p>Only a X-rated Fraud devoid of any scruples and values will be hypocritical to impose its values of debating with unsupported statements, by demanding others to produce supporting evidences.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>With the displayed intellectual capacity of a X-rated Fraud, one can certainly expect changes that will bring itself to morph from being a X-rated Fraud into a X-rated Charlatan - in its attempt to be a pseudo-intellectual.</p>

              <p>What deeper warning are you alluding to, other than the lack of  warning betrayal of our ecomonic efforts by the Outlaw with his past blatant UNconstitional deeds now?</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>The wider audience wished for by the X-rated Fraud - can certainly depend on the expertise of the X-rated Fraud to exercise its pseudo-inttelect - to even leave out what the "UN-constitutional deeds" that its "outlawerly" was supposed to have committed.</p>
              <p> By the standards of a X-rated Fraud - "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">civil obedience</span></em>" is already "<span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>outlawlery</em></span>" and is "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">Un-constitutional</span></em>" as "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">Civil Obedience</span></em>" IS AGAINST the Law.</p>
              <p>Obviously, the X-rated Fraud will have its wider audience to believe that LKY and his PAP is Lawful in passing legislations that will affect and even change the basic meaning of the Singapore Constitution, which GUARANTEE the Citizens of the Rights that are so clearly stated.</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Unfortunately, the Berlin Wall with several more iron and bamboo walls have been built by LKY and the PAP to trap the mind of a X-rated Fraud.</p>
              <p>LKY and his PAP will be immensely comforted to know that they have a xenophobic X-rated rabble rouser to cover their butts.</p>
              <p>It is obvious that the X-rated Fraud is an expert in disrupting any honest efforts to expose the truth with its pseudo-intellectual ability to inject the specailly worked out 'truths' as the 'half-truths' with their specialist skills.</p>
              <p>The X-rated Xenophobic Fraud is at its best when the syncophantic music of its PAPa begins to be played.</p>

              <p>The Straits Times have shared their archive with the National Library, and it seems that you can access them from home by having an account with National Library.</p>
              <p>It is a treasure trove of information of events that transpired in Singapore based on the PAP's version of political issues, and their preferred visions of anything to do with Singapore's position on social and cultural developments - other then factual events.</p>
              <p>If you are overseas, you could make an effort to visit the British National Archive to search the released Official Records from its Colonial Office.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">All along SG news have skewed towards the ruling elite and is more biased reporting and outright offensive, not doubt about that...<br>With regards to the BNA, can a non-citizen get in to view?Pls PM me</span></p>
              <p><strong> <span style="color: #0000ff;">BNA is linked Public Records Office, whose address given by Google is at Chancery Lane, London WC2A 1LR, UK - and should be open to the public.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>You may wish to contact Tim Harper who was said to be teaching Southeast Asian History and the History of the British Empire at the University of Cambridge in London; and Greg Pulgrain, a Professor at Griffths University in Australia, who was said to be researching Southeast Asian History for more then 20 years.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Both names appeared in the article : </strong><a rel="nofollow" href="http://yoursdp.org/index.php/perspective/special-feature/302-lim-chin-siong-vs-lee-kuan-yew-the-true-and-shocking-history"><strong>“Lim Chin Siong vs Lee Kuan Yew : The true and shocking history – Part 1: Our man” (*1) </strong></a></span></p>
              <p>  </p>
              <p> No one should bashed one's "own country" - and the skewed impression given to CSJ's call to Obama has been deliberated given a twist to suit the political agenda to sully his name further.</p>
              <p>Is it not surreal that the syncophantic insistence continue to ignore the clear facts made to show the differences in what was published in the Temasek Review, with what the TS had printed ?</p>
              <p>It is not a surprise that the xenophobic rabble rousers will double their efforts to stoke up the fire with more inflammotary efforts so as to light up their xenophobic heroism in seemingly defending Singapore, even as they hide their true work to cover the misdeeds of LKY and the PAP on Singapore and Singaporeans.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"> TS or ST?!</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Not only the TS or ST - but also the xenophobic X-rated Fraud proven repeatedly to be an intellectual bankrupt but insist to display its pseudo-intellect in its characteristic grandstanding style.</span></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Even if FOX is not independent and can be bias in favor of the Right Wing Politics, at least in the USA there is the immense opportunity for any other disgusted citizens to set up private capital to start a competing publication to counter the controlled bias.</p>
              <p>Can this happen in Singapore ?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Afraid NOT when the ruling elite still holds rein parachuting desk bound jockeys to political positions and holding skewedviews that destroy our heritage/history in terms of progress[eg wet market]</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Exactly, which explains the fraudulent claims of peace and progress for the more pragmatic path to disallow public views that create dissensions, and distraction to the purpose of national programs.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Such pragmatic views are no more then a call for Singaporeans to give LKY and the PAP a 'Blank Cheque' with the word 'TRUST ME' - while they hold themselves to be non-accountable, and the non-transparent actions to be explained as "for National Security and Interest".</span></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Without an alternative and independent publications to offer alternative opportunities to those maligned by the State-controlled print and broadcast media - Singaporeans can only have their views and values moulded and "trained" in one direction. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Unfortunately, whatever his ideas are that have been reported are generally skewed by the local print and broadcast medias.</p>
              <p>Can he be represented accurately by any local print and broadcast media ?</p>
              <p>Can anyone count on the State controlled print and broadcast media to provide CSJ or any Politician from the Alternative Political Parties equal space and time to reach out to Singaporeans ?</p>
              <p>Until Singaporeans believe that the PAP has no right to change the Singapore Constitution to give only themselves the Rights guaranteed and deny the same to Singaporeans - then nothing that Dr Chee does will be seen to be credible.</p>
              <p>At this stage of the political development, it is retrogressive - as the generations that lived through the WW-2, the events of the 1950s till 1965, had the political space and knew what was political freedom.</p>
              <p>The generations that grew from 1965 to 1975 saw the beginning of the political space; while the generations that were born from 1975 till the present have been nurtured to the values of the PAP that politics is for the Politicians, and that no one is more qualified than the elite talents <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">appointed</span></strong> to political office.</p>
              <p>The emphasis is on "<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">appointed</span></strong>" - as LKY and the PAP believe that only they are the one qualified to select and annoint who should be in politics, and those that they cannot accept from their own political judgment to be their partner in politics will be mowed and shredded.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">The older generation regreted their blatant support for the ruling elite only recently when they realised that policies are going against them and is more n more biased in terms of employment, housing, CPF </span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Should we wait till we become the future older generation and then begin to regret ?</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">As matters stand, CPF was supposed to be made available we retire at the age of 55, then it was pushed to 60, then 65.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Now instead of changing the delayed withdrawal age repeatedly, it is more convenient to change with one stroke of the pen.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">The CPF is converted into a Life Long Old Age self-funded support scheme - with 3 plans designed to confuse, with the old being burdened to decide either to fend for itself only, or to leave some for its surviving offsprings.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">While the PAP Government content themselves with milion dollar rewards from the success of what has been achieved by Singaporean's sacrifices for Singapore - they will insist the toughest of rules to be imposed on us.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">While they will mindlessly invest US$100 Billions in dubious investments overseas that benefit foreign corporate executives, they will be miserly to Singaporeans with penny pinching program that demand more money to be paid before any equal amount is given to match.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">The amount of US$100 Billion that was lost in 2008-2009 could have been used to establish a Trust Fund to help ALL Singaporeans into perpetuity.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">It would have been the seed money for multiple programs that cover Health, Education, and Retirement of every Singaporean - young and old.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Generosity unfortunately did not begin at Home.</span></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The other danger for Singapore is by the time MM move on from this world, how much more damage would have occurred for Singapore, when his ideas are set in concrete and become institutionalised - to be accepted as the Golden Rules even by majority of Singaporeans blinded by the false values created to entrench the PAP ?</p>
              <p>When LKY dared to evoke the values of ancient Confucianism  - which had basically stratified the roles of government and citizenry - simply to validate the relevance to his and his PAP style of benevolent autocratic politics, the majority of the older Chinese educated population lauded his wisdom, only to regret the political fallout from the decades of his autocratic rule without the much hoped for benevolence.</p>
              <p>  </p>
              <p>It is a surprise that you will hold the view to equate bashing the PAP Government as bashing Singapore ?</p>
              <p>Dr Chee is insisting on breaking an UNLAWFUL Law - that goes against the grain of the Singapore Constitution which had guaranteed the Rights of All Singaporeans according to the simple words written.</p>
              <p>Not all Singaporeans are pissed by his actions, although many feel his actions to be pitiable in that he is seen as butting his head on a Wall.</p>
              <p>Then again, if there is no Dr Chee prepared to stand up - how many other indignant and concerned Singaporean will be prepared to stand up like him ?</p>
              <p>Many will not even pick up the pen or even enter a forum to stand on his side, and will prefer to stand safely with the view of the majority - many of whom simply flow with the values that were moulded by the daily insinuations from print and broadcast medias.</p>
              <p>Many have resigned themselve to their present fate that PAP is too strong, and things will change when LKY moved on.</p>
              <p>Many have forgotten that LKY is a long term planner and has already put in place all the mechanism and preparatory works for the future.</p>
              <p>The uncertain future after LKY - remains unspoken, and those prepared measures remain secret - but rest assured it will perpetuate and entrench the PAP further into the lives of Singapore - and Singaporeans will NOT have any say.</p>

              <p> It is not surprising that the bankrupt mind can so accurately spout the same words as the self-acclaimed talents of the PAP, as the X-rated Fraud has no other abilities but to blindly plagiarize the ideas and verbiage from the PAP.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">The blank cheque is still given due to the GRCs system which no opposition has been able to crack so far. In any "democratic society", all are able to vote, UNIQUELY SINGAPORE apparently does not belong to this category</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Which explains why when something happens, most SGreans will turn to the ruling elite to give them a mandate to impose their "strong-willed"[often repackaged] policies to the "cant be bothered" SGreans</span></p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Now instead of changing the delayed withdrawal age repeatedly, it is more convenient to change with one stroke of the pen.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">The CPF is converted into a Life Long Old Age self-funded support scheme - with 3 plans designed to confuse, with the old being burdened to decide either to fend for itself only, or to leave some for its surviving offsprings.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">While the PAP Government content themselves with milion dollar rewards from the success of what has been achieved by Singaporean's sacrifices for Singapore - they will insist the toughest of rules to be imposed on us.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">While they will mindlessly invest US$100 Billions in dubious investments overseas that benefit foreign corporate executives, they will be miserly to Singaporeans with penny pinching program that demand more money to be paid before any equal amount is given to match.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">The amount of US$100 Billion that was lost in 2008-2009 could have been used to establish a Trust Fund to help ALL Singaporeans into perpetuity.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">It would have been the seed money for multiple programs that cover Health, Education, and Retirement of every Singaporean - young and old.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Generosity unfortunately did not begin at Home.<br><br></strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">It's an obvious ploy to get all Singaporeans to get keep their monies in so that it will be used by a particular SWF to use it and get "better returns" even though it has proven otherwise... Are the scholars in these elite SWFs doing it base on gut instinct or they actually scrutinise the buy in to other listed companies in the world?!</span></span></p>

              <div>70.<span>     Singapore’s judiciary is highly regarded
              internationally for its independence and administration of justice. In
              the WEF Global Competitiveness Report 2009-2010, Singapore was ranked
              nineteenth out of 133 countries on the independence of the judiciary
              from political influences, ahead of many leading developed countries
              such as Japan, United States and France. In the IMD World
              Competitiveness Yearbook 2009, Singapore was ranked thirteenth out of
              57 countries for the fair administration of justice. </span></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>71.<span>     The PERC, which rates Asian countries on their
              business and legal environments, consistently rates the Singapore
              judiciary highly. In 2006 and 2007, the PERC Asian Intelligence Reports
              ranked Singapore second in Asia (after Hong Kong) for the level of
              confidence in Asian judicial systems. In 2008 and 2009, the PERC Asian
              Intelligence Reports ranked Singapore second in Asia (after Hong Kong)
              on expatriate perceptions of the quality of its judicial system. </span></div>

              <p>I agree with your views, and would gladly pay you more than 2cts for your rational analysis. It puts our citizens interest first, which is the most important prerequisite a wannabe politician should do.</p>
              <p>However, I would strongly disagree on only 1 point you raised and that is opposition political parties should team up ( simply put if that is what you mean, I apologise here and now if i had mis-interpretated your meaning)</p>
              <p>One or two here may presume that I am from the ruling party, but nothing can be more further from the truth from that statement. I am not, never was, nor have the ambition to be a politician, even with the opposition. I am only a simply ordinary guy, eking out a living, as everyone is. I doubt if they, with their high capabilities need the simple me, let alone be here in this forsaken site politicians had long given up.</p>
              <p>I respect politicians, the good ones for their courage in facing up to moral dilemmas, but doing the right thing for all, and not for selfish ambitions. That however does not mean I do not have such courage of my own, in equal measure with some brave souls here. as proven by my and their daily battles with rabid opposition followers and unworthy opponents here, standing up to their lies, half truths and manipulative whitewashing nonsense.</p>
              <p>By my belief that 'opposition parties should not work together', some will still intentionally cast aspersion on my integrity, as it disagrees and destroys their own selfish ambitions and manipulations, as some form of devious 'divide and conquer' attempts practised by the brits and monarchs of long past. It does not apply here to our republic, home of educated equals.</p>
              <p>Politics had often been about personal beliefs and methods to serve a nation. No 2 men has the same view. Differences and methodologies abound. Nothing can be more different than the current mainstream opposition parties. WP had always been a much more matured and sincere party, and I am deeply impressed with Sylvia Lim, though i personally wish her to improve on her public image with a less confrontational stances to appeal to the minds and hearts of voters.</p>
              <p>Each opposition party must draw on their own strengths, to formulate credible and practical plans for our people, recruit the best and brightest just as the ruling party does, reach out to as many people as possible and help our citizens with their woes.</p>

              <p>I respect politicians, the good ones for their courage in facing up to moral dilemmas, but doing the right thing for all, and not for selfish ambitions. That however does not mean I do not have such courage of my own, in equal measure with some brave souls here. as proven by my and their daily battles with rabid opposition followers and unworthy opponents here, standing up to their lies, half truths and manipulative whitewashing nonsense.</p>
              <p>By my belief that 'opposition parties should not work together', some will still intentionally cast aspersion on my integrity, as it disagrees and destroys their own selfish ambitions and manipulations, as some form of devious 'divide and conquer' attempts practised by the brits and monarchs of long past. It does not apply here to our republic, home of educated equals.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Is there any credibility in the fraudulent claims by the X-rated Fraud that "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">We hate confrontations</span></em>" - when its objections to the idea that "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">opposition political parties should team up</span></em>" will mean that they will have to compete with each other against the PAP ?</p>
              <p>This is characteristic Double-XX thinking that is hypocrisy personified in the resident X-rated Fraud.</p>
              <p>What does the X-rated Faud intend to insinuate by claiming that "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">Singaporeans are not Europeans</span></em>" and claiming that "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">We hate confrontations</span></em>" ?</p>
              <p>Is the X-rated Fraud implying that Singaporeans are less capable than the Europeans in handling our mental capacities in being able to discern the arguments and reasons that will surface from vigorous and robust debate ?</p>
              <p>It is obvious that the pseudo-intellect of the X-rated Fraud will revive the ghosts of the "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">riots and destruction</span></em>" of the 1950s and '60s - the supposed deaths and destructions - but will NOT admit that those were found to be ignited by the politicians desparate to hang on to their insecure positions.</p>
              <p>By now, the X-rated Fraud can surely be taken to task for its efforts to sabotage the election results in favor of the PAP by having the various Opposition Parties to work in 3-corner fights, dilute the combined resources of the Opposition Parties, and have them fight each other instead of working together.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>It is again, obvious that the X-rated Fraud is writing for the interest of the PAP - to delay any changes that must happen.</p>
              <p>It is even despicable for its bankrupt mind to even dare to treat its imaginary wider audience to be fools by spouting a fraudulently soft message - that is deceiving in itself - that change in "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">the short term</span></em>" is "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">dangerous view</span></em>".</p>
              <p>It is crystal clear that the message is plagiarized and regurgitated for the status quo to remain in favor of the PAP, even as it pretend to suggest that change can happen - "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">regardless if it comes from the opposition party or evolution within the ruling party</span></em>".</p>
              <p>After 42 years of continous PAP rule - with its characteristic arrogance to dispense favors to Singaporeans, who are made to feel that such dispensation are privileges and not our birthrights - it is amazing that the X-rated Fraud will call for : "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">A pace, all is prepared and understand so that none will be left behind, at least the majority</span></em>".</p>

              <p>Is the majority of Singaporeans not already left behind when the elitist policy of LKY and the PAP has created a wide divide between the Super-Rich, the Rich and the hard pressed Middle Income, the Poor, and the very Poorest of the Poor ?</p>
              <p>What further insufferable idiocy is the X-rated Fraud intend to spread with its imbecilic pseudo-intellect to propagate the deceptive messages in favor of the PAP ?</p>

Furthermore, look at the capabilities of some of the opposition parties - outright traitors, greedy property fights, etc. This will only tarnish the image of the opposition should they combine. Whose still to align with some who had shown their propensities for unconstitutional means - ousting leaders, breaking laws, denying others the right to freedom of expression, etc, even practised by their rabid followers.</p>

              <p>With pretentious Singaporeans in the form of a deceiving X-rated Fraud that attempt to pass itself as a concerned party with the interest for Singaporeans - does any Singaporean or Singapore need any Enemies ? </p>
              <p>With its skills in subverting the truth of events in Singapore, and its remarkable efforts to re-engineer historical events in Singapore, one can only what drives the shameless masochist to return repeatedly to be trashed for its dishonesty, its crude deceptions, and its clear pseudo-intellect.</p>

              <p> We can certainly leave the bankrupt mind of a X-rated Fraud to exercise its proven pseudo-intelligence to spout further bankrupt ideas that will only enhance the chances of the PAP to succeed in the next elections, and for the Opposition Parties to be knotted up with its different agendas.</p>

              <p> Are these all there is - that is supposed to help Singaporeans ?</p>
              <p>If at all the bankrupt ideas have been unwrapped, exposed, cut up, diced up, sliced thin, and examined in detail - and the single bone of contention with the bankrupt idea of the X-rated Fraud is that - it is here to subvert any effort by Singaporeans to stand and have our own independent views from that of the PAP.</p>
              <p>Is there any other simple words to describe the acts of such a fifth columnist that snuggle its way into our midst, and to subvert our thinking with its supposedly innocent and innocuous words and ideas ?</p>
              <p>The only simple and honest words used by our fore-fathers for such a character is true and straight to the point - "<strong>running dog</strong>".</p>
              <p>From a pseudo-intellect to a X-rated Fraud, and to a X-rated Rat.</p>
              <p>It must be quite an achievement to be recognised as a "Runing Dog".</p>
