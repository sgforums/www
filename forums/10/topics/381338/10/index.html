              <p>Obviously, you are as good with your imagination as you claim about mine - do you live only by your imagination of things that you read, and what you hope to read ?</p>

              <p>How did you see the words printed about any pledge to support CSJ ?</p>
              <p>Has your "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">not as highly educated</span></em>" mind failed you again, to lead you to read what your mind want you to read - even when words do not exist ?</p>
              <p>For one that is "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">not as highly educated</span></em>" - and claiming my "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">imagination has failed</span></em>" - you seem to be doing pretty good yourself in this departement as seen in your efforts with imagination in every paragraph.</p>

              <p>Your "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">not as highly educated</span></em>" abilities seem to fail you again - to read what is clearly and simply printed, but has again left you with a stupendous ability to perpetually read what is in the metaphysical world with your "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">not as highly educated</span></em>" skills.</p>
              <p>How stupendous an achievement with your "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">not as highly educated</span></em>" mind - that can allow you to reach such hot gassed idea - "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">that when you are unable to ignore the truth, has already proven that truth cannot simply be ignored</span></em>" ?</p>

              <p>Since you have declared that you are "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">not as highly educated</span></em>" - you should continue to keep on practising talking to yourself, and someday you will say something a little more intelligent.</p>

              <p>For your information, a person cannot be a whore without whore-seeking clients. Whores get paid while whore-seeking clients pays with their wallets and proteins which whores usually rejects the whore-seeking client's foul biological proteins but gladly accept the monetary payment.</p>
              <p>Without whores, whore-seeking client like yourself would be drilling holes into walls and self-satisfying your pathetic needs and most probably causing intense bodily harm to yourself.</p>
              <p>Whores are legal in many countries and widely accepted by most in many countries. However it's whore-seekers like yourself who patronised whores and condemns whores but still continue to seek whores for constant treatment to cure your twisted imaginations temporarily.</p>

              <p>For a "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">mere insignificant nobody</span></em>" it is amazing that it will jump with glee to spill its hidden vitriol over a simple statement given to "Seowlah" that - "<em><span style="color: #ff6600;">Why are clever person like you - so few around ?</span></em>"</p>
              <p>Obviously, the X-rated Fraud had to be the first one to see more then a simple statement, which even "Seowlah" could not and did not ?</p>
              <p>What possibly could be the reason for the pseudo-intellect in a X-rated Fraud to see what others could not ?</p>
              <p>Is the X-rated Fraud attempting to show itself to be more clever than 'Seowlah' - and taking 'Seowlah' to be a fool to be manipulated in its usual fraudulent ways to pass the blame on others while it capitalize on a situation offered on a silver platter ?</p>
              <p>It is quite characteristic of a X-rated Fraud in this reply as seen in its past statement that - "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">the compassionate side of me tells me that I have no right to make use of any human, espacially if he is a fool</span></em>".</p>
              <p>What possibly could have driven the X-rated Fraud to Double-XX itself to "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">make use of any human, espacially if he is a fool</span></em>" - who possibly is the fool that the X-rated Fraud has been exposed to be using again to prove its own worth ?</p>
