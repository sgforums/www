              <td class="alt2" style="border: 1px inset;"><strong>Chee Soon Juan to go on U.S. talk shows asking Obama to address human rights abuse in Singapore</strong><br><br>A week after MM Lee Kuan Yew was interviewed on the U.S. Talk Show – the Charlie Rose Show and was given a rare meeting with U.S. President Barack Obama at the White House, Singapore opposition leader Dr Chee Soon Juan will go on a series of radio shows in America.<br><br>The interviews come on the eve of President Barack Obama’s visit to Singapore for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) meeting from 12-14 Nov 09.<br><br>Among the interviews will be one with Mr Ron Reagan on Air America and veteran talk show host Lionel Lipshitz on The Lionel Show.<br><br>In an earlier interview with Talk Radio News Service Bureau Chief Ellen Ratner, Dr Chee spoke about the repressive laws put in place by the Singapore government to curtail the political rights of citizens such as the recent public order law passed which ban even peaceful solo protest.<br><br><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">He also urged Mr Obama to take note of the human rights abuses in Singapore and call on America’s political and business leaders to stop collaboration with the Singapore government</span></strong> unless it improves on its human rights record.<br><br>Last week, Singapore Law Minister Shanmugan spent 3 days trying to convince a skeptical American audience from the New York State Bar Association that Singapore is a country of law and that its situation is “unique”.<br><br>Dr Chee’s personal testimony of the human rights abuses and political persecution he had suffered at the hands of the ruling party is likely to win him much sympathy from the American public and further damage the reputation of the Singapore government.<br><br>Though the ruling party is able to maintain a tight grip over the local media, it has little or no influence over the American press.<br><br>While President Obama is unlikely to heed Dr Chee’s call to exert pressure on the Singapore government to liberalize the political landscape, the negative publicity generated worldwide will nevertheless make the regime feel uncomfortable.<br><br>Being a globalized city heavily dependent on trade, Singapore cannot afford to allow its international branding to be tarnished by charges of political repression.<br><br>In stark contrast, Hong Kong, despite having only limited self-rule under Communist China, seldom encounter such negative publicity about its political system.<br><br>Even China is becoming more conscious of its international image. Chinese President Hu Jintao recently gave a pledge to the western media that they would be allowed to report freely on events in China.<br><br>In an increasingly inter-connected world where barriers between states are breaking down fast by the internet, the Singapore government is finding it harder to keep the facade of itself being a “democracy” for long.<br><br>U.S. NGO Freedom House wrote in its 2009 report that Singapore is not an “electoral democracy which would have a detrimental impact on the impression the Americans have on Singapore.<br><br>While Dr Chee was never a MP, his influence on Singapore politics will extend far beyond Singapore’s shores.<br><br>The Singapore government should realize that its tried and tested methods of stifling political dissent through repressive measures will eventually backfire on them and damage their own credibility which no amount of PR exercise will reverse.<br><br>From now onwards, it has to be especially vigilant to its actions which may give others free ammunitions to shoot at it.<br><br>Singapore “exceptionalism” is no excuse for its oppression. The Singapore government may be able to deceive its own people, but not freedom-loving souls from the rest of the free world.<br><br><a href="http://www.temasekreview.com/2009/11/10/chee-soon-juan-to-go-on-u-s-talk-shows-asking-obama-to-address-human-rights-abuse-in-singapore/"><span style="color: #9a0a0a;">http://www.temasekreview.com/2009/11...-in-singapore/</span></a></td>

              <p>How did your genius translate the call to "<strong>stop collaboration with the Singapore Government</strong>" amount to a "<strong>call to the US to erect Trade Blocks</strong>" ?</p>

              <p>I weep when I read the news. Not for myself, but for my fellow citizens.</p>
              <p>For the millions who had endured the pain of the financial crisis, that is not of our doing but some selfish bizmen in US, and now to suffer the ignomity of having their country branded as a human rights abuser, not to mentioned the backlash by simple americans who know not better and the truth. Who is the govt but elected representatives of the people?</p>
              <p>I weep for our students studying overseas being subjected to abuses and snide remarks, as if our motherland is some african corrupt backwater dictatorship.</p>
              <p>I weep for our bizmen and entreprenuers who had been trying hard to get a foothold into the american economy, who will now face little or no support from the misguided american public, fed by a largely sensationalistic media to stoke up the flames, who cares not for rights, but their bottomline for revenue.</p>
              <p>All our nation's effort gone to waste. And for what? For that son of a bitch outlaw, who is never a representative of the people, let alone a constituency, for his outlaw ass. He complains of being victimised by the govt because he is an opposition political member.</p>
              <p>But does that means he is above the law, break laws that is across the board and meant for all equals? He was judged by our independant judiciary most made up of lawyers fromt the private sector.</p>
              <p>Had any other opposition political figure been victimised?</p>
              <p>What human rights had we citizens been denied?</p>
              <p>How had we been abused, or tortured, for our political beliefs, other than a greater need to put food on our tables for ourselves and espacially for our children, which is still within our own and collective efforts even in this crisis?</p>
              <p>I weep, real tears. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Once the US media goes to town with the news</span>, all our hardwork, sacrifice and efforts  would have gone to waste. By this selfish man, who was given a fair trial and found guilty.</p>
              <p>I weep, as if not enough that his supporters whitewashed brutual commie activities here in Singapore in the 60s, they continue to twist words, and whitewash that outlaw's shit thrown upon our faces and efforts.</p>
              <p>But the time will come when the weeping is over and action would be necessary. I had respect for Chiam as growing adult and his party, but it is now a mockery in the hands of the outlaw and his band with the whitewashing and doom inflicted upon us by their selfish desire to rule, .</p>
