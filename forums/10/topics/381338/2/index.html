              <p>Only the X-rated Fraud will perpetuate the lie in the legitimacy of a Government that is elected with less then 50 per cent of the citizens actually participating in the electoral process - with this being part of the deliberate design to handicap the Alternative Parties amongst other measures included.</p>

              <p>Obviously, the X-rated Fraud will lay it thick on Chiam who is now age 73, and has not even begun to groom a successor.</p>
              <p>Can we trust the deceitful claims by a X-rated Fraud to be an insignificant nobody, even as it will immodestly and furtively allow itself to think about the grand-standing opportunity as an illusionary successor to Chiam's political position ?</p>
              <p>The dreams and wishes of a X-rated Fraudulent Rat knows no limits when it possess no morals at being circumspect towards right and wrong, and will willingly submit itself to the false propaganda and perpetuate the falsehood to unsuspecting Singaporeans whom it will unabashedly claim to protect.</p>

              <p><strong>Chee Soon Juan to go on U.S. talk shows asking Obama to address human rights abuse in Singapore</strong><br><br>A week after MM Lee Kuan Yew was interviewed on the U.S. Talk Show – the Charlie Rose Show and was given a rare meeting with U.S. President Barack Obama at the White House, Singapore opposition leader Dr Chee Soon Juan will go on a series of radio shows in America.<br><br>The interviews come on the eve of President Barack Obama’s visit to Singapore for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) meeting from 12-14 Nov 09.<br><br>Among the interviews will be one with Mr Ron Reagan on Air America and veteran talk show host Lionel Lipshitz on The Lionel Show.<br><br>In an earlier interview with Talk Radio News Service Bureau Chief Ellen Ratner, Dr Chee spoke about the repressive laws put in place by the Singapore government to curtail the political rights of citizens such as the recent public order law passed which ban even peaceful solo protest.<br><br><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">He also urged Mr Obama to take note of the human rights abuses in Singapore and call on America’s political and business leaders to stop collaboration with the Singapore government</span></strong> unless it improves on its human rights record.<br><br>Last week, Singapore Law Minister Shanmugan spent 3 days trying to convince a skeptical American audience from the New York State Bar Association that Singapore is a country of law and that its situation is “unique”.<br><br>Dr Chee’s personal testimony of the human rights abuses and political persecution he had suffered at the hands of the ruling party is likely to win him much sympathy from the American public and further damage the reputation of the Singapore government.<br><br>Though the ruling party is able to maintain a tight grip over the local media, it has little or no influence over the American press.<br><br>While President Obama is unlikely to heed Dr Chee’s call to exert pressure on the Singapore government to liberalize the political landscape, the negative publicity generated worldwide will nevertheless make the regime feel uncomfortable.<br><br>Being a globalized city heavily dependent on trade, Singapore cannot afford to allow its international branding to be tarnished by charges of political repression.<br><br>In stark contrast, Hong Kong, despite having only limited self-rule under Communist China, seldom encounter such negative publicity about its political system.<br><br>Even China is becoming more conscious of its international image. Chinese President Hu Jintao recently gave a pledge to the western media that they would be allowed to report freely on events in China.<br><br>In an increasingly inter-connected world where barriers between states are breaking down fast by the internet, the Singapore government is finding it harder to keep the facade of itself being a “democracy” for long.<br><br>U.S. NGO Freedom House wrote in its 2009 report that Singapore is not an “electoral democracy which would have a detrimental impact on the impression the Americans have on Singapore.<br><br>While Dr Chee was never a MP, his influence on Singapore politics will extend far beyond Singapore’s shores.<br><br>The Singapore government should realize that its tried and tested methods of stifling political dissent through repressive measures will eventually backfire on them and damage their own credibility which no amount of PR exercise will reverse.<br><br>From now onwards, it has to be especially vigilant to its actions which may give others free ammunitions to shoot at it.<br><br>Singapore “exceptionalism” is no excuse for its oppression. The Singapore government may be able to deceive its own people, but not freedom-loving souls from the rest of the free world.<br><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.temasekreview.com/2009/11/10/chee-soon-juan-to-go-on-u-s-talk-shows-asking-obama-to-address-human-rights-abuse-in-singapore/"><span style="color: #9a0a0a;">http://www.temasekreview.com/2009/11...-in-singapore/</span></a></p>

              <p>what i'm afraid is end of the day if CSJ has his way, it's not the goverment that suffers but us mere commoners who works for a living, literally. who do not earn by just debating in Parliment or making new rules and regulations.</p>
              <p>there are some anti-PAP, pro-PAP, despots ass lickers or even just neutral here in this forum but i don't think anyone here wants a pay cut just because someone incite the USA to install a trade embargo with Singapore... i mean if he wants to wrestle power from the PAP, do it without us having to face the trouble... you can say i'm selfish but i have a family to feed... i need to work everyday to feed them and yup, too bad, my company deals with customers from USA right?</p>
              <p>but isn't CSJ worse off? playing politics all the way to USA and trying to get us all in trouble?</p>

              <p><strong>Chee Soon Juan to go on U.S. talk shows asking Obama to address human rights abuse in Singapore</strong><br><br>A week after MM Lee Kuan Yew was interviewed on the U.S. Talk Show – the Charlie Rose Show and was given a rare meeting with U.S. President Barack Obama at the White House, Singapore opposition leader Dr Chee Soon Juan will go on a series of radio shows in America.<br><br>The interviews come on the eve of President Barack Obama’s visit to Singapore for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) meeting from 12-14 Nov 09.<br><br>Among the interviews will be one with Mr Ron Reagan on Air America and veteran talk show host Lionel Lipshitz on The Lionel Show.<br><br>In an earlier interview with Talk Radio News Service Bureau Chief Ellen Ratner, Dr Chee spoke about the repressive laws put in place by the Singapore government to curtail the political rights of citizens such as the recent public order law passed which ban even peaceful solo protest.<br><br><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">He also urged Mr Obama to take note of the human rights abuses in Singapore and call on America’s political and business leaders to stop collaboration with the Singapore government</span></strong> unless it improves on its human rights record.<br><br>Last week, Singapore Law Minister Shanmugan spent 3 days trying to convince a skeptical American audience from the New York State Bar Association that Singapore is a country of law and that its situation is “unique”.<br><br>Dr Chee’s personal testimony of the human rights abuses and political persecution he had suffered at the hands of the ruling party is likely to win him much sympathy from the American public and further damage the reputation of the Singapore government.<br><br>Though the ruling party is able to maintain a tight grip over the local media, it has little or no influence over the American press.<br><br>While President Obama is unlikely to heed Dr Chee’s call to exert pressure on the Singapore government to liberalize the political landscape, the negative publicity generated worldwide will nevertheless make the regime feel uncomfortable.<br><br>Being a globalized city heavily dependent on trade, Singapore cannot afford to allow its international branding to be tarnished by charges of political repression.<br><br>In stark contrast, Hong Kong, despite having only limited self-rule under Communist China, seldom encounter such negative publicity about its political system.<br><br>Even China is becoming more conscious of its international image. Chinese President Hu Jintao recently gave a pledge to the western media that they would be allowed to report freely on events in China.<br><br>In an increasingly inter-connected world where barriers between states are breaking down fast by the internet, the Singapore government is finding it harder to keep the facade of itself being a “democracy” for long.<br><br>U.S. NGO Freedom House wrote in its 2009 report that Singapore is not an “electoral democracy which would have a detrimental impact on the impression the Americans have on Singapore.<br><br>While Dr Chee was never a MP, his influence on Singapore politics will extend far beyond Singapore’s shores.<br><br>The Singapore government should realize that its tried and tested methods of stifling political dissent through repressive measures will eventually backfire on them and damage their own credibility which no amount of PR exercise will reverse.<br><br>From now onwards, it has to be especially vigilant to its actions which may give others free ammunitions to shoot at it.<br><br>Singapore “exceptionalism” is no excuse for its oppression. The Singapore government may be able to deceive its own people, but not freedom-loving souls from the rest of the free world.<br><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.temasekreview.com/2009/11/10/chee-soon-juan-to-go-on-u-s-talk-shows-asking-obama-to-address-human-rights-abuse-in-singapore/"><span style="color: #9a0a0a;">http://www.temasekreview.com/2009/11...-in-singapore/</span></a></p>

              <p>Obviously, the TS has served its role to the hilt as "any

              deliberate stroke, so as to stoke support to an

              <p>there are some anti-PAP, pro-PAP, despots ass lickers or even just neutral here in this forum but i don't think anyone here wants a pay cut just because someone incite the USA to install a trade embargo with Singapore... i mean if he wants to wrestle power from the PAP, do it without us having to face the trouble... you can say i'm selfish but i have a family to feed... i need to work everyday to feed them and yup, too bad, my company deals with customers from USA right?</p>

              <p>Obviously the X-rated Fraud with the impressive pseudo-intellect will not appreciate the good fortune for Singapore when the US Government cut off its dealings with the SG Government - as the GIC will not be allowed to invest our Sovereign Funds in any of the useless US Government Bonds, nor will be allowed to buy into any of the useless US Banks that robbed us of our savings due to the X-rated intelligence of the elite talents managing the GIC and the Temasek Holdings.</p>

              <p>Obviously, the X-rated Fraud will not appreciate that the SG Government will not die nor starve by the US Government - as there are more then a few dozen countries with technologies that are equal to the USA.</p>
              <p>Where money is to be made, businesses will be at the door - a fact that the X-rated Fraud can hardly appreciate with its ability to distort Facts into Half-Truths that it had consistently harp and introduce to suit its agenda.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>At worst, the US Government will put on the pressure on the SG Government to mend its ways in its treatment towards Singaporeans, to treat Singaporeans with less of its arrogant autocratic ways, and to abide by the letters of the Constitution that even LKY had dared to preach in his youth.</p>

Is it a society where men can preach ideas - novel, unorthodox, heresies, to established churches and established governments - where there is a constant contest for men's hearts and minds on the basis of what is right, of what is just, of what is in the national interests, or is it a closed society where the mass media - the newspapaers, the journals, publications, TV, radio - either bound by sound or by sight, or both sound and sight, men's minds are fed with a constant drone of sycophantic support for a particular orthodox political philosophy? That is the first question we asked ourselves. I would like to see minds stimulated and debate provoked, and truth refined and crystallized out of the conflict of different evidence and views. I, therefore, welcome every and any opportunity of a chance to agree, or to dissent, in order that out of thesis comes synthesis - thesis, anti-major premise, anti-premise, synthesis, so we progress... I welcome every opportunity to meet members of the opposition, and so do members of my party, over the radio, over the television, university forums, public rallies. We never run away from the open encounter. If your ideas, your views cannot stand the challenge of criticism then they are too fragile and not sturdy enough to last. I am talking of the principle of the open society, the open debate, ideas, not intimidation, persuasion not coercion... Sir, the basic fundamentals we asked ourselves...is whether the duties of the Minister of Information and Broadcasting are to produce closed minds or open minds, because these instruments - the mass media, the TV, the radio - can produce either the open minds receptive to ideas and ideals, a democratic system of life, or closed and limited. But I know that the open debate is a painful process for closed minds...But let me make this point: that 5 million adult minds in Malaysia cannot be closed - definitely not in the lifetime of the people in authority. It is not possible because whatever the faults of the colonial system, and there are many...they generated the open mind, the inquiring mind."</span> <em>- Lee Kuan Yew Dec 18, 1964 Malaysian Parliamentary Debates</em></span></p>

              <p>Another pathetic imitative post from the resident X-rated Fraud
              at being larger then it can ever attempt to be no matter how hard
              it tries.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Does the X-rated Fraud now think that it is big enough to
              wear the Size-XXX shoes to pretend to be The Govt and know that it
              had tried ?</p>
              <p>The X-rated Fraud must have been head butted so many times that
              it will know the skull is too thick to be cared or moved by
              its by its fraudulent infatuation.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It must be desparation for companionship that get
              the X-rated fraud to be continuously besotted to a
              piece of turd to produce the hot gas
              needed to inflate its pompous role. </p>
              <p>Should anyone be surprise that it will even know what a piece of
              its turd will imply, afterall it require a shit-head to
              understand the language of turd - can anyone best the expertise of
              the X-rated Fraud ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Can the " <span style="color: #993300;">it agrees with
              her</span>" or even know how to express anyone else's views, with
              its poor language skills to be unable to even be circumspect with
              the contents of its approach in any debate ?</p>
              <p>It confirms again its inability to even know what is the truth
              when "Truth" is staring it in its face.</p>
              <p>It is obvious by now that the X-rated Fraud must
              be selectively blind to the truth to be blatantly
              dishonest in insisting that there is no evidence being
              given, or it will have to be concluded that its reading
              skill is limited to the Art of Turdish language
              only.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Has the X-rated
              Fraud now decide to "blackout" its declaration
              that '<strong>civil obedience</strong>' is
              <strong>"outlawrely"</strong> ?</p>
              <p>We can certainly depend on the X-rated Fraud for its
              expert opinion with its deep seated intimate knowledge
              from educating itself with the Art of Turdish culture, is it any
              wonder that it walks around hissing its hot gas wherever it moves
              ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is amazing that the X-rated Fraud will know that "Facts are
              Facts" - when it had always been fixated by its beliefs in
              "Half-Truths".</p>
              <p>It must have put more effort in
              its educational pursuit for a Bachelor's Degree in Turd -
              to learn that there is no such thing as "Half-Truths" and that
              "Facts are only Facts" ?</p>
              <p>Still its statement is but pure plagiarizing what was said as it
              attempt to imitate the style but with no abilities to make any
              effective delivery.</p>
              <p>It is simply pathetic that it believes it can fit a Size XXX
              shoes, when it can hardly fill the space in a Size S piece.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Assumptions and assumptions and assumptions - is that not the
              hallmark of one that continuously seek its wider audience for its
              grand standing performance ?</p>
              <p>Only an ASS will consistently make assumptions - as the word
              begins with the letters "ASS" - which is an acronym for "Attention
              Seeking Syndrome" that typifies the needs of the X-rated Fraud
              always being led by its deluded thoughts of being bigger then what
              it factually is.</p>
              <p>Facts are Facts - only a X-rated Fraud with the
              characteristics of as an ASS will be so hung-up with the
              need to whitewash any issues to bring more attention to
              its self-inflated importance.</p>
              <p>Facts are Facts - which the X-rated Fraud has been confirmed for
              its pseudo-intellect that is so quietly deafening waiting for any
              squeak of a response.</p>
