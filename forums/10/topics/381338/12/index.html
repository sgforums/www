              <p><br>If the "zwei-siao-HOG" is stuck with its "men-o-pause" why bother to spread its impotence around and blame everyone else for being so ?</p>
              <p>The only one that is uptight, angry, vulgarly loud with all the "zwei-siao" profanities is the "zwei-siao-HOG" which is suffering from its own self-inflicted impotence giving rise to its feelings of insecure delusions that necessitate itself to be more assertive.</p>
              <p>Can anyone compare to the "zwei-siao-HOG" who <em><span style="color: #0000ff;">"must have things his hissy fit way"</span></em> ?</p>
              <p>Only a "zwei-siao-HOG" will defy the mentioned anthropologists - whose conclusive findings have been accepted by Dr M Mahathir and LKY - and it will still continue to push its "zwei-siao" insistence that the MALAYs are NOT from Yunnan Province. </p>
              <p>This "zwei-siao" insistence is based on his cannot be mentioned "zwei-siao" <em><span style="color: #0000ff;">'DNA geneticists'</span></em> - who probably prefer not to get involved with the "zwei-siao" theories that the "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">Malays are the original people in Singapore and that all other races in Singapore are migrants</span></em>".</p>
              <p>All that the pathetic "zwei-siao-HOG" can do now to save butt - is to persist with its antagonist posture by being a loud mouth lout, spewing profanities, and following the "zwei-siao" imitative plagiarizing methods of the X-rated Fraud with similar pseudo-intellect as the "zwei-siao-HOG" playing the role of a pseudo-Bavarian HOG.</p>
              <p>Impotence lies in the one suffering from all the "men-o-pausal" symptoms of anger, impatience, short fuze insecurity, delusion, frustration - all of which needs to be compensated by being more assertive, pushy, loud mouth, profane and vulgar loutish aggressions.</p>
              <p>All of these acts are deliberately acted out to conceal its "zwei-siao" frustration with its being as impotent as an eunuch, and in not knowing how best to handle its self-inflicted injuries to its pathethic "zwei-siao" self.</p>

              <p>This must be a result of its many years of being left castrated and not being able to find its self-worth from that of others.</p>
              <p>Did they not return the "zwei-siao" castrated part to the "zwei-siao-HOG" - or was it not due to the fact that it was not even worth to be kept, which explains for the necessity of castrating the "zwei-siao-HOG" ?</p>
