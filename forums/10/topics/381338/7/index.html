              <p> It is certainly pathetic that some participants are here only for the sake of driving home a line of pseudo-politics that it is deliberately designed to trivialise, or to marginalise, or to misinform - all done to tarnish the image of the Alternative Political Parties as the next Election approaches.</p>

              <p>Is there a change in maturity ?</p>
              <p>Was there a flash that ignited your brilliance to suddenly conclude "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">that not everyone who hates PAP are CSJ supporters</span></em>" ?</p>
              <p>How did you come to such a conclusion ? How much energy did you expend to arrive at your displayed maturity change ?</p>
              <p>Do you seriously believe that "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">Hitman and his variants</span></em> <em><span style="color: #0000ff;">has always been the PAP denouncer but now he has learnt how to be pragmatic in wanting changes and not screaming like CSJ and cronies for change</span></em>" ?</p>
              <p>Firstly, can Hitman and its miscreants have any ability to change anything - whether by way of screaming or more subtle ways ?</p>
              <p>Secondly, if at all - Hitman and his variant in the X-rated Fraud are more likely to be PAP fraudsters adapt in the art of deceit - to blend into the crowd as Fifth Columnists, to spread the softer message in the PAP's interests, and to subtlely defend the PAP's interests with the pretext of defending the interests of Singapore and Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>Thirdly, the methods of the Hitman and his miscreants are identical to the PAP ways - when these miscreants will make an attack on the PAP as an attack on Singapore.</p>
              <p>Fourthly, it will hardly dawn on you that as more vigorous methods are applied in the handling of these miscreants - such as the Hitman and the X-rated Fraudsters - it will not be surprising that more miscreants will surface from the "woodwords"..</p>
              <p>Lastly, it does not take too much an effort to have fun with these miscreants, and you should learn to have fun having an exchange with them.</p>

              <p>Is the X-rated Fraud concerned that its erstwhile partner has awakened to the dubious ways of an exposed dishonest pseudo-intellect that is no better then a "running dog" that has the interests of the PAP more then the Singaporeans ?</p>
              <p>The pathetic bankrupt mind of a X-rated Fraud can only indulge with its continued infatuation with a mere piece of turd that it never tire to flog - which can only leave anyone to question if the X-rated Fraud is normal at all ?</p>
              <p>Why will a X-rated Fraud defend its position and allow its remarkable pieces of plagiarized ideas to be cut up or diced or sliced and all to be analysed in detail that show the pseudo-intellect that exist in a X-rated Fraud ?</p>
              <p>How did the X-rated Fraud get so badly trashed by a mere piece of turd that it cannot even beat into the ground despite is fraudulent efforts to delude itself with its grand presumptions in its self-assuming prestige displayed with so much pomposity ?</p>
              <p>It is simply ironic that a X-rated Fraud can have any doubt in itself and to even feel humiliated by the truth spoken of its fraudulent positions expressed in this SgForum.</p>
              <p>It is only natural for the X-rated Fraud to be in the present state of denial, as the truth bites into its fraudulent character, and when its hollow position is deflated from all the hot gas that it can hope to produce with its "Turdish" infatuation.</p>
              <p>Sadly, the X-rated Fraud remains trapped in its pseudo-intellect and think that it can continue with its deception to subvert Singaporeans with its Double-XX behavior to lull Singaporeans to sleep so as not to focus on the tail of the PAP.</p>
              <p>When the tail of the PAP is stepped, the X-rated Dog will run to its defense.</p>
              <p>It will even be dishonest to its own conscience by defending the PAP's tail while hiding behind a cloak of deceit - in misleading claims that protecting the PAP's tail is  protecting the Citizens.</p>
              <p>Is it any wonder that the Dog will lay claim on the Citizens as trained by the PAP ?</p>

              <p><br>Atobe ?</p>
              <p>Is there a change in maturity ?</p>
              <p>Was there a flash that ignited your brilliance to suddenly conclude "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">that not everyone who hates PAP are CSJ supporters</span></em>" ?</p>
              <p>How did you come to such a conclusion ? How much energy did you expend to arrive at your displayed maturity change ?</p>
              <p>Do you seriously believe that "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">Hitman and his variants</span></em> <em><span style="color: #0000ff;">has always been the PAP denouncer but now he has learnt how to be pragmatic in wanting changes and not screaming like CSJ and cronies for change</span></em>" ?</p>
              <p>Firstly, can Hitman and its miscreants have any ability to change anything - whether by way of screaming or more subtle ways ?</p>
              <p>Secondly, if at all - Hitman and his variant in the X-rated Fraud are more likely to be PAP fraudsters adapt in the art of deceit - to blend into the crowd as Fifth Columnists, to spread the softer message in the PAP's interests, and to subtlely defend the PAP's interests with the pretext of defending the interests of Singapore and Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>Thirdly, the methods of the Hitman and his miscreants are identical to the PAP ways - when these miscreants will make an attack on the PAP as an attack on Singapore.</p>
              <p>Fourthly, it will hardly dawn on you that as more vigorous methods are applied in the handling of these miscreants - such as the Hitman and the X-rated Fraudsters - it will not be surprising that more miscreants will surface from the "woodwords"..</p>
              <p>Lastly, it does not take too much an effort to have fun with these miscreants, and you should learn to have fun having an exchange with them.</p>

              <p>No, the Citizens will not be bothered and will wait for the light to dim on the life of the fraudster, so as to allow a new flame to be lighted that will reveal a new and more enlightened path.</p>
              <p>For more then 150 years, Singapore has been through thick and thin in our history since even before the colonisation of Singapore by Stamford Raffles in 1819 - and Singapore had continued to survive the trial and tribulations that swept through this island.</p>
              <p>Singapore will endure as it had endured the worst in our distant and recent past, and have even endured the worst from the continued abuse of political power for 42 years and more.</p>
              <p>The twisted mind of the X-rated Fraudster that believe itself to be a loyal dog to protect its Master's Tail will be overlooked by the Citizen - as the life of such a dog that is trained to run in circle to chase its master's tail is a result of Karma.</p>
              <p>Such a dog's life will only need the Citizen to decide when to put the dog to sleep - can the dog prevent euthanasia from being administered to it, when it cannot even control the tail that wags it Doggone body ?</p>

              <p>Yes, we can believe the standards of pretentious Bavarian character in the mind trapped in a kid's skull with no room to expand further.</p>
              <p>We can certainly rely on the interpretaion of a pretentious Bavarian to understand that politicians like LKY and CSJ will prefer to operate in the dark, and keep their views that serve the public to be kept locked in the private space of their own minds - even as they insist their high profile space to win the hearts and minds of the People.</p>

              <p>Hey, Turd! Does nationality has anything got to do with country of origin? The question here is whether does a Singaporean politician want to serve the people and not whether the same said politician is right about the ruling party or not.</p>
