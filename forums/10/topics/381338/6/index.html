              <p> </p>
              <p>It is not amazing that the resident X-rated Fraud will persist with its deception in planting its plagiarized ideas in its practised "Art of Misinformation" - to advance its own delusion of believing itself to be a Spokesperson for the Government, or Singaporeans, or Singapore.</p>
              <p>Can it possibly achieve its deluded goals with its appetite for grandstanding acts ?</p>
              <p>Cut up its entire verbiage and unravelling its efforts by the paragraph - the entire effort cannot stand-up to any critical review, which will prove again that its stand is as hollow as the hot gas that it never fail to spout.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What possibly can a "wannabe politician" achieved when the meanings of the term is no more then an ambitious nobody pretending to be somebody and imitate all the acts of the more successful politician ?</p>
              <p>Is there not someone that is so anxious to inisist on its presence and its ability to wear Size-XXX shoes ?</p>
              <p>If putting the "interests of citizens" first is the most important prerequisite for a "wannabe politician" - what can be said about the PAP pragmatism in putting its own Party interests first (which it conveniently equates as Singapore's interests) before that of any or all Singaporeans ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The brilliance of the X-rated Fraud reveals its idiocy to strongly disagree on the only single point raised, but offer no reasons for its insufferable disagreement, only to apologiise for any mis-interpretation to the meaning in the sentence - "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">opposition political parties should team up</span></em>".</p>
              <p>How many brilliant ways can the sentence be re-interpreted ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The X-rated Fraud never fail to be ever over presumptuous in believing that anyone can possibly think that the Ruling Party will lower their Standards to accept X-rated Frauds that will even cheat on a 50 cent car park coupon and willing to admit to such a cheap act only when actually caught.</p>
              <p>It is not a surprise that it will smoke its way to achieve credibility with its disingenious backdoor methods of claiming to be "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">only a simply ordinary guy, eking out a living, as everyone is</span></em>" - so as to nudge itself into the crowd, and to subvert the community from within as a planted 'Fifth Columnist'.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The pseudo-intellect of a X-rated Fraud can clearly be seen in this questionable reason offered for its belief that "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">opposition parties should not work together</span></em>" - "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">as it disagrees and destroys their own selfish ambitions and manipulations</span></em>".</p>
              <p>Is it not obvious that when opposition parties work together it will be expected that they should "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">destroy</span></em>" their independent "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">selfish ambitions and manipulations</span></em>" - that are typically in the interests of their respective parties - and to achieve this for sake of succeeding in their collaborative efforts to benefit Singapore and Singaporeans ?</p>
              <p>Can there be any truth in the claim of the X-rated Fraud that it is "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">divide and conquer attempts practised by the brits and monarchs of long past</span></em>" - when the respective political parties suppress their respective "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">selfish ambitions and manipulations</span></em>" - so as to "successfully team up" to confront the PAP in the next election ?</p>
              <p>This is the convulted ways of the X-rated Fraud in its dark art at deception with its well practised pseudo-intellect that has been consistently exposed.</p>
              <p>Only the idiocy of a pseudo-intellect will see the collaborative efforts of Opposition Parties teaming up as "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">divide and conquer attempts</span></em>".</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">men has the same view</span></em>" - how did the X-rated Fraud contradict itself by claiming that "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">Differences</span></em>" abound, even as it is a fact that "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">methodologies</span></em>" are varied ?</p>
              <p>One can only wonder what possibly can its understanding of "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">methodologies</span></em>" to mean - when one consider its stupendous language skills ?</p>
              <p>For one who has <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span></strong> done much to be even successful to maintain its own image in this Forum, it is again presumptuous for the X-rated Fraud to even dare to criticise Sylvia Lim's public image.</p>
              <p>It is obvious that this is the dark deception of a subversive social saboteur to deceive with a praise towards Sylvia Lim, and only to surreptiously cut her image down with an innocuous move.</p>
              <p>This confirms again the dark politics of the X-rated Fraud that pretend to lurk as an ordinary person but is no more then the pathetic "dog in sheep's wool" - as befitting the pseudo-intellect of a deceptive X-rated Fraud, with its despicable acts that do not qualify the "dog" to be a descendant of the more cunning Wolf.</p>
              <p>  </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The truth of the deception slowly emerges in the fraudulent concerns declared by the X-rated Fraud that claimed its primary interest is for the citizens.</p>
              <p>When it is clear that "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">opposition political parties should team up</span></em>" and suppress their "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">selfish ambitions and manipulations</span></em>" to compete against each other - so as to overcome the strength accumulated by the PAP's long years of manipulation and oppressive dominance - it is amazing that the X-rated Fraud should object and give its own fraudulent ideas that is not even worth the piece of rubble that it hope to form its worthless currency.</p>
              <p>This is the bankrupt capacity of the mind of a X-rated Fraud with its pseudo-intellect that has now again been exposed in the upcoming passages.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Is there any credibility in the fraudulent claims by the X-rated Fraud that "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">We hate confrontations</span></em>" - when its objections to the idea that "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">opposition political parties should team up</span></em>" will mean that they will have to compete with each other against the PAP ?</p>
              <p>This is characteristic Double-XX thinking that is hypocrisy personified in the resident X-rated Fraud.</p>
              <p>What does the X-rated Faud intend to insinuate by claiming that "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">Singaporeans are not Europeans</span></em>" and claiming that "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">We hate confrontations</span></em>" ?</p>
              <p>Is the X-rated Fraud implying that Singaporeans are less capable than the Europeans in handling our mental capacities in being able to discern the arguments and reasons that will surface from vigorous and robust debate ?</p>
              <p>It is obvious that the pseudo-intellect of the X-rated Fraud will revive the ghosts of the "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">riots and destruction</span></em>" of the 1950s and '60s - the supposed deaths and destructions - but will NOT admit that those were found to be ignited by the politicians desparate to hang on to their insecure positions.</p>
              <p>By now, the X-rated Fraud can surely be taken to task for its efforts to sabotage the election results in favor of the PAP by having the various Opposition Parties to work in 3-corner fights, dilute the combined resources of the Opposition Parties, and have them fight each other instead of working together.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is again, obvious that the X-rated Fraud is writing for the interest of the PAP - to delay any changes that must happen.</p>
              <p>It is even despicable for its bankrupt mind to even dare to treat its imaginary wider audience to be fools by spouting a fraudulently soft message - that is deceiving in itself - that change in "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">the short term</span></em>" is "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">dangerous view</span></em>".</p>
              <p>It is crystal clear that the message is plagiarized and regurgitated for the status quo to remain in favor of the PAP, even as it pretend to suggest that change can happen - "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">regardless if it comes from the opposition party or evolution within the ruling party</span></em>".</p>
              <p>After 42 years of continous PAP rule - with its characteristic arrogance to dispense favors to Singaporeans, who are made to feel that such dispensation are privileges and not our birthrights - it is amazing that the X-rated Fraud will call for : "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">A pace, all is prepared and understand so that none will be left behind, at least the majority</span></em>".</p>
              <p>"<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">none will be left behind, at least <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the majority</span></span></em>" ?</p>
              <p>Is the majority of Singaporeans not already left behind when the elitist policy of LKY and the PAP has created a wide divide between the Super-Rich, the Rich and the hard pressed Middle Income, the Poor, and the very Poorest of the Poor ?</p>
              <p>What further insufferable idiocy is the X-rated Fraud intend to spread with its imbecilic pseudo-intellect to propagate the deceptive messages in favor of the PAP ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>With pretentious Singaporeans in the form of a deceiving X-rated Fraud that attempt to pass itself as a concerned party with the interest for Singaporeans - does any Singaporean or Singapore need any Enemies ? </p>
              <p>With its skills in subverting the truth of events in Singapore, and its remarkable efforts to re-engineer historical events in Singapore, one can only what drives the shameless masochist to return repeatedly to be trashed for its dishonesty, its crude deceptions, and its clear pseudo-intellect.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> We can certainly leave the bankrupt mind of a X-rated Fraud to exercise its proven pseudo-intelligence to spout further bankrupt ideas that will only enhance the chances of the PAP to succeed in the next elections, and for the Opposition Parties to be knotted up with its different agendas.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> Are these all there is - that is supposed to help Singaporeans ?</p>
              <p>If at all the bankrupt ideas have been unwrapped, exposed, cut up, diced up, sliced thin, and examined in detail - and the single bone of contention with the bankrupt idea of the X-rated Fraud is that - it is here to subvert any effort by Singaporeans to stand and have our own independent views from that of the PAP.</p>
              <p>Is there any other simple words to describe the acts of such a fifth columnist that snuggle its way into our midst, and to subvert our thinking with its supposedly innocent and innocuous words and ideas ?</p>
              <p>The only simple and honest words used by our fore-fathers for such a character is true and straight to the point - "<strong>running dog</strong>".</p>
              <p>From a pseudo-intellect to a X-rated Fraud, and to a X-rated Rat.</p>
              <p>It must be quite an achievement to be recognised as a "Runing Dog".</p>

              <p>I weep when I read the news. Not for myself, but for my fellow
              citizens.</p>
              <p>For the millions who had endured the pain of the financial
              crisis, that is not of our doing but some selfish bizmen in US, and
              now to suffer the ignomity of having their country branded as a
              human rights abuser, not to mentioned the backlash by simple
              americans who know not better and the truth. Who is the govt but
              elected representatives of the people?</p>
              <p>I weep for our students studying overseas being subjected to
              abuses and snide remarks, as if our motherland is some african
              corrupt backwater dictatorship.</p>
              <p>I weep for our bizmen and entreprenuers who had been trying hard
              to get a foothold into the american economy, who will now face
              little or no support from the misguided american public, fed by a
              largely sensationalistic media to stoke up the flames, who cares
              not for rights, but their bottomline for revenue.</p>
              <p>All our nation's effort gone to waste. And for what? For that
              son of a bitch outlaw, who is never a representative of the people,
              let alone a constituency, for his outlaw ass. He complains of being
              victimised by the govt because he is an opposition political
              member.</p>
              <p>But does that means he is above the law, break laws that is
              across the board and meant for all equals? He was judged by our

              <p>Had any other opposition political figure been victimised?</p>
              <p>What human rights had we citizens been denied?</p>
              <p>How had we been abused, or tortured, for our political beliefs,
              other than a greater need to put food on our tables for ourselves
              and espacially for our children, which is still within our own and
              collective efforts even in this crisis?</p>
              <p>I weep, real tears. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Once the US media goes to town with
              the news</span>, all our hardwork, sacrifice and efforts 
              would have gone to waste. By this selfish man, who was given a fair
              trial and found guilty.</p>
              <p>I weep, as if not enough that his supporters whitewashed brutual
              commie activities here in Singapore in the 60s, they continue to
              twist words, and whitewash that outlaw's shit thrown upon our faces
              and efforts.</p>
              <p>But the time will come when the weeping is over and action would
              be necessary. I had respect for Chiam as growing adult and his
              party, but it is now a mockery in the hands of the outlaw and his
              band with the whitewashing and doom inflicted upon us by their
              selfish desire to rule, .</p>

              <p>Going below the belt now, are we? You have to resort to this?

              <p>Carry on, if it serves your purposes. All the more for everyone
              to see what kind of a person you are. You only dig your own

              <p>Nope. I dont get emotional over a piece of toilet paper. It holds no relevance to me or my country, for i see no repression in my homeland, not even to the outlaw and least of all bother with a proven traitor. In Russia, he would had been long removed.</p>
              <p>Absolute certainty is a priviledge that equally goes both ways. I didnt know Keyser was an uneducated man. He must have been toying with quantum physics. Should've kept to maths.</p>
              <p>Is there even reason to investigate rubbish before condemning it? Please do not use qoutations from famous men to lend credence to your beliefs, if you truly revered them. It would only make them turn in their graves for the misqoutation and misuse to apply to the kind of your filth you are bringing here.</p>

              <p>Nope. If there is any emotion, it would more be towards sympathy for you on how low you would go, and the state of your mental health. I have no reason to be angry with IMH persons, only pity for the further self destruction of your own delusional mind.</p>

              <p>Obviously you did not bother to open up the first post by the TS on Page 1, and checked the contents with the referenced site given, and read the contents carefully.</p>
              <p>For your convenience, I will repeat what I had posted on Page 1 in response to the TS attempt at deliberately being dishonest and misleading, or it is plain dumb in its reading abilities coming from a PAP education system that can only develop this kind of educated Singaporean.</p>

              <p><br>It is remarkable that you will call yourself "Anyhowsay" and should live up to your nick.</p>
              <p>Is it any wonder that you should "any how say" what the Temasek Review had printed as its headline - given in your own reference site in your opening post of this thread <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.temasekreview.com/2009/11/10/chee-soon-juan-to-go-on-u-s-talk-shows-asking-obama-to-address-human-rights-abuse-in-singapore/"><span style="color: #9a0a0a;">http://www.temasekreview.com/2009/11...-in-singapore/</span></a> - and replaced it with your own dishonest intepretation of your own skewed understanding with an intelligence that is as big as your dickhead ?</p>

              <p>" <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #000000;">He also urged Mr Obama to take note of the human rights abuses in Singapore and call on America’s political and business leaders to</span> <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">stop</span></strong></span> <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">collaboration with the Singapore government</span></strong></span> <span style="color: #000000;">unless it improves on its human rights record</span> "</p>
              <p>How did your genius translate the call to "<strong>stop collaboration with the Singapore Government</strong>" amount to a "<strong>call to the US to erect Trade Blocks</strong>" ?</p>
              <p>It does not take too much imagination to understand the reaction of dickheads with similar intelligence of one who will "any how say" to also "any how think".</p>
