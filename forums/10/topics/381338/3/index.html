              <p>Opposition candidates can better manage Singapore's Reserves ?</p>
              <p>What are you smoking ?</p>
              <p>Can the opposition candidates even get the opportunity to do what you expect - when you will prefer to stand on the side-lines and not help them prove that they are worth their salt ?</p>
              <p>The PAP was given the opportunity by the generation in the 1950s - to play football and be the star-players to kick the football, and those in the 1950s gave them the trust even when the PAP had no experience to be in any "football team to play football" in running a Government.</p>
              <p>The PAP footballers have now become <em>Prima Donnas</em> - and forgot who had allowed them the opportunity to play the game, and they have now raised the barriers to block anyone from playing the Game unless they pay the ultimate price to play football by their 'Kelong Rules' that are fixed to their benefit.</p>
              <p>Can there ever be another similar 1950 generation who will give a chance to a team of inexperienced but sincere and dedicated football players, and allow them to kick the ball and show the <em>Prima Donnas</em> - that the ball is round and do not belong to the Team that depend on 'Kelong Rules' to win their games.</p>

              <p>What do you expect from a self admitted shitty asshole wiper? It's her job to whitewash her master and beloved outlaw leader's fetid wastes. She would write longer if she could, after all, its all rubbish and twisted lies, but i guess humans have their limitation of lethargy.</p>
              <p>And she does it by screwing, deriding fellow citizens who DARES criticise her outlaw, pushing the blame to others, distracting, bullying, demeaning even in the face of blatant truth.</p>
              <p>This is her style and the kind of politics you will can expect if her outlaw wins in destroying us all. The only freedom and political openess is saved for those who agrees with her and her master. She and her outlaw had never cared about the common people. They exists only to serve the outlaw's ambition.</p>

              <p>yes yes, PAP is bad. they take millions and lose billions to foreigners. but the question here is;</p>
              <p>do we condone the actions of PAP or do we condone the action of Dr. CSJ on getting Singapore's economy into trouble?</p>
              <p>yes, you can say our country's leaders are not those who can feel the ground. then i will encourage you to join politics and change Singapore for the better; but not asking USA to have trade embargo on us that will and can affect our livelihood.</p>

              <p><br>i agree with xtreyier... if i may be neutral; andrew, i know you have deep hatred for the PAP but i feel you can't always come into any thread and try to distract it from the initial topic. i know PAP sucks and take millions but lose billions but here we have someone who may, i stress again, who may have good intentions on trying to oust the government and return power to the citizens but and i stress again but could damage our economy substantially if USA do indeed put in place a trade embargo on us.</p>

              <p><br>Where were you when recession hit Singapore in 1987-88, and again in 1997 ?</p>
              <p>In response to the 1987 recession, Dr Chee Soon Juan had written a book "Dare to Change" in 1994 - in which he had already advocated that Singapore has to wean itself from MNCs that are dependent on cheap labor and for Singapore to create an environment that will allow our own entrepreneurs to grow.</p>
              <p>In his 1994 book, he had also offered alternative ideas for changes to our education system that will allow our children to be nurtured into Thinkers and Problem Solvers and not simply rote learners regurgitating text books facts.</p>
              <p>The fact that an academician had popped into the political scene shocked LKY and his PAP, in the same manner when JBJ broke the duck's egg and got himself into Parliament during the 1981 election.</p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://singabloodypore.rsfblog.org/archive/2007/05/21/joshua-benjamin-jeyaretnam-on-bended-knees-never.html">Lee Kuan Yew was said to be furious with the victory achieved by Joshua B. Jeyaratnam (*1) </a>- can we expect anything less from LKY in reaction for the sudden appearance of CSJ in the 1992, when he had just gotten rid of JBJ through several fixes designed to get JBJ out of Parliament ?</p>
              <p>It is only obvious that CSJ had to be removed to prevent any threat to the planned succession of LHL sometime in the next ten years into the future.</p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://kentridgecommon.com/?p=4096">‘Do you seriously believe you have any access to any publicity of any opinions or interviews of politicians from the Alternative Political Parties concerning their plans to handle the current recessions(*2) </a>?</p>
              <p>Are you suggesting that First World Countries such as UK and Japan - with their mature political systems and practised politics - can be comparable to the politics practised in Singapore ?</p>
              <p>Do First World Democracies such as UK and Japan need to have any help to bring down any of their political leaders when their mature politicians from any parties keep the sanctity of their Constitution intact, and make no attempt to change the Constitution to protect or advance their own selfish political agenda ? </p>
              <p>Singapore may have all the facade and external trappings of a modern First World, which unfortunately is a cleverly disguised theatre that is deliberately designed by LKY to suit his style of autocratic-paternalistic politics and political governance.</p>
              <p>All the verbiage about Asian Societies with Confucian values are no more then self-serving reasons to advance LKY's and his PAP political agendas.</p>
              <p>Singapore may have attained the semblance of a First World Country, but it is runned by Third World Politicians in Third World settings similar to that of Zimbabwe.</p>
