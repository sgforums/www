              <p>Awwwwshucks, the way the "zwei-siao-pseudo-Bavarian-Hog" put it - it will seem that no one is capable to be - "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">comphrehending the suffering of the common man in the street</span></em>" - except for its remarkable self ?</p>
              <p>What does a "zwei-siao-pseudo-Bavarian-Hog" know about "empathy" - let alone about anyone in Singapore ?</p>
              <p>Can its empathy towards the people in Singapore be seen in its clever historical remarks that - <a rel="nofollow" href="/forums/10/topics/377726?page=11">‘<em>except for the malays, all of us are descended from foreigners to this island’</em> (*1) </a>?</p>
              <p>The last known response from the "zwei-siao-pseudo-Bavarian-Hog" was a preferred deafening silence and a hasty retreat from the thread, when it had been so strident with its expressed fantasy at tormenting its favorite "political penis".</p>
              <p>The most skillful retort that the bankrupt mind of a "zwei-siao-pseudo-Bavarian-Hog" has consistently displayed is to express its own tormented fantasy in "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">sucking CSJ's penis</span></em>".</p>
              <p>There must be some serious psychological connotation to be considered for such a regular manisfestation of a "zwei-siao-pseudo-Bavarian-Hog" sexual fantasy with a politician's penis.</p>
              <p>Could it be part of its Turd character as a member of the community from Turdistan ?</p>
              <p>One can risk a preliminary speculation that such a display belies the frustrations of the "zwei-siao-pseudo-Bavarian-Hog" with its own impotence when others are more able that its own worthless bravado.</p>
              <p>Its impotence must have been accentuated when it had been debunked for its fantasy to use a hand-grenade to blast a sniper in a hardened bunker; after its other bravado idea had similarly been blasted for using a non-existent Javelin missile in the SAF arsenal to blast a sniper in a bunker.</p>
              <p>The penile fantasy of a "zwei-siao-pseudo-Bavarian-Hog" clearly reflect a non-human troubled and frustrated mind, trapped in a body that it hopes to control but cannot, as it is overwhelmed by the larger environment that affect its very frustrated existence.</p>
              <p>The saga of the fascinating fantasy of a "zwei-siao-pseudo-Bavarian-Hog" continues..</p>

              <p><br>What more garbage can the "zwei-siao-pseudo-Bavarian-Hog wish to recycle - when with no more issues that it can possibly defecate, it will bring out old issues that have been trashed previously in another thread ?</p>
              <p>With the "zwei-siao" myopia of a pseudo-Bavarian-Hog from Turdistan, what does it know of the local Singapore environment and the attitude of Singaporeans towards anyone who attempt to solicit their attention - especially during the tight lunch hour ?</p>
              <p>Added to the "zwei-siao" myopia will be the skewed mentality of a pseudo-Bavarian-Hog that has never endeared itself to CSJ - even as its affection is directed to its besotted piece of Turd - what more need to be said ?</p>
              <p>Only a "zwei-siao-pseudo-Bavarian-Hog" can be believed that it will move from table to table to whisper its political message, as it attempt to cover as many tables as it can do so without any approval from Minister WKS - and during the noisy lunch hour.</p>
              <p>Has it been the habit of Singaporeans to welcome or even engage those salesmen in conversation, or to reach out to the promoters who distribute the leaflets - or has it not been a knee-jerk reaction to shy away or screw their face with impatience at all these activities that are seen as nuisances ?</p>
              <p>What is the difference in the Singaporean reactions towards the seemingly irritating acts of the salesmen and promoters, and their attitude towards CSJ's attempts to reach out to these lunch time Singaporeans ?</p>
              <p>Only a dumb "zwei-siao-pseudo-Bavarian-Hog" will wish to read more into a minor event to tarnish CSJ and the SDP further, as these are the easiest meat that it can manage to kick, without being kicked back in the groin.</p>
              <p>It will be better for the "zwei-siao-pseudo-Bavarian-Hog" to polish up on its the history - it should spend its time more usefully to resolve its slience to its brilliant statement that - <a rel="nofollow" href="/forums/10/topics/377726?page=11"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #810081;">‘<em>except for the malays, all of us are descended from foreigners to this island’</em> (*1) </span></span></a></p>

              <p><strong>Chee Soon Juan to go on U.S. talk shows asking Obama to address human rights abuse in Singapore</strong><br><br>A week after MM Lee Kuan Yew was interviewed on the U.S. Talk Show – the Charlie Rose Show and was given a rare meeting with U.S. President Barack Obama at the White House, Singapore opposition leader Dr Chee Soon Juan will go on a series of radio shows in America.<br><br>The interviews come on the eve of President Barack Obama’s visit to Singapore for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) meeting from 12-14 Nov 09.<br><br>Among the interviews will be one with Mr Ron Reagan on Air America and veteran talk show host Lionel Lipshitz on The Lionel Show.<br><br>In an earlier interview with Talk Radio News Service Bureau Chief Ellen Ratner, Dr Chee spoke about the repressive laws put in place by the Singapore government to curtail the political rights of citizens such as the recent public order law passed which ban even peaceful solo protest.<br><br><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">He also urged Mr Obama to take note of the human rights abuses in Singapore and call on America’s political and business leaders to stop collaboration with the Singapore government</span></strong> unless it improves on its human rights record.<br><br>Last week, Singapore Law Minister Shanmugan spent 3 days trying to convince a skeptical American audience from the New York State Bar Association that Singapore is a country of law and that its situation is “unique”.<br><br>Dr Chee’s personal testimony of the human rights abuses and political persecution he had suffered at the hands of the ruling party is likely to win him much sympathy from the American public and further damage the reputation of the Singapore government.<br><br>Though the ruling party is able to maintain a tight grip over the local media, it has little or no influence over the American press.<br><br>While President Obama is unlikely to heed Dr Chee’s call to exert pressure on the Singapore government to liberalize the political landscape, the negative publicity generated worldwide will nevertheless make the regime feel uncomfortable.<br><br>Being a globalized city heavily dependent on trade, Singapore cannot afford to allow its international branding to be tarnished by charges of political repression.<br><br>In stark contrast, Hong Kong, despite having only limited self-rule under Communist China, seldom encounter such negative publicity about its political system.<br><br>Even China is becoming more conscious of its international image. Chinese President Hu Jintao recently gave a pledge to the western media that they would be allowed to report freely on events in China.<br><br>In an increasingly inter-connected world where barriers between states are breaking down fast by the internet, the Singapore government is finding it harder to keep the facade of itself being a “democracy” for long.<br><br>U.S. NGO Freedom House wrote in its 2009 report that Singapore is not an “electoral democracy which would have a detrimental impact on the impression the Americans have on Singapore.<br><br>While Dr Chee was never a MP, his influence on Singapore politics will extend far beyond Singapore’s shores.<br><br>The Singapore government should realize that its tried and tested methods of stifling political dissent through repressive measures will eventually backfire on them and damage their own credibility which no amount of PR exercise will reverse.<br><br>From now onwards, it has to be especially vigilant to its actions which may give others free ammunitions to shoot at it.<br><br>Singapore “exceptionalism” is no excuse for its oppression. The Singapore government may be able to deceive its own people, but not freedom-loving souls from the rest of the free world.<br><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.temasekreview.com/2009/11/10/chee-soon-juan-to-go-on-u-s-talk-shows-asking-obama-to-address-human-rights-abuse-in-singapore/"><span style="color: #9a0a0a;">http://www.temasekreview.com/2009/11...-in-singapore/</span></a></p>

              <p><br>CSJ is obviously a traitor of Singapore. By publicly encouraging U.S to impose trade blocks on his own motherland, Singapore.</p>
              <p>Just because of his own personal vendetta with the ruling party of Singapore, he is plotting to bring down the entire nation and it's citizens.</p>
              <p>Did he even bother to seek the people's opinions first before he went ahead and execute his retarded request?</p>
              <p>A self-imposed politician who has no support from the people equally as dangerous as a terrorist.</p>
              <p>What's the difference between this political terrorist and the real terrorist since they both seeked external power to burn down his own motherland?</p>
              <p>Someone should sign him up for permanent homestay in guantanamo bay.</p>
              <p>I hope he get tortured until blood will seeped out of his eyes instead of tears.</p>
