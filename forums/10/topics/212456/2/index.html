You have very poor english and most probably very poor chinese too. You are so stupid that no matter what MM Lee does, you can never be employed. You point of views are so biased that it's sickening. MM Lee made us learn english because it's the universal language in the world. By knowing this language, we can trade with all countries in the world and have a truly globalised economy. What language do you think we should be educated in? German? So that we restrict ourselves to trade with only one nation? If you have no brains, nobody can help you. If your chinese is not good, don't blame other people. I can see that your english isn't great either, so who is at fault?</div>

It doesnt matter if you are non-Chi, able to speak Chi, coz I have Malay friends who can speak Chi, yet the employers still want Chinese ppl to work for them.[/b]</blockquote>err.. of course Chinese employers will mostly want Chinese employees, as would Malay employers will want mostly Malay employees.<br><br>But we're talking about gov bodies such as; schools, institutes, etc., that marginalizes Chinese.<br><br></div>
