            <div class='col-md body'>The report is not so accurate.  See my remarks in colour  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"><br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by PoRen:</div><div class="quote_body">By Mohd Haikal Isa<br><br>JOHOR BAHARU, Sept 28 (Bernama) -- The Malays in Singapore have been systematically marginalised since Lee Kuan Yew became Prime Minister, and the government under the city state's founding father also committed "ethnic Malay cleansing", said Singapore's veteran politician who migrated to Malaysia.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> <span style="color: blue;">If LKY maginalise the Malays, how do our Malay community receive free education?  Do they not have equal chance in entering university, polytechnics and applying for a HDB flat?</span><br><br>Prof Mohammed Yacob, who was political secretary to Singapore's second Chief Minister Lim Yew Hock, said the Malays were systematically marginalised since the People's Action Party (PAP) came to power in 1959.<br><br>According to Mohammed, the PAP reduced the Malay political power through the implementation of the government's housing policy.<br><br>He attested that Malays were uprooted from their villages and were resettled separately at various new townships including Tampines New Town, Bedok North and South, Toa Payoh and Ang Mo Kio.<br><br>"The PAP divided and ruled the Malays. The Malays were separated from each other and resettled in various housing estates so that they no longer have a political voice," he said in an interview with Bernama here.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> <span style="color: green;">Divide and rule the Malays?  Don't they do the same to the Chinese and all other race?  Chinese don't gather in chinatown anymore.  They are scattered all over Singapore and put to live next door with other races. </span><br><br>"The PAP government used the racial quota system to re-organise the population of Singapore to weaken the Malays. Each housing estate must have 72 per cent Chinese, 16 per cent Malays and 12 per cent Indians and others."   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow">  <span style="color: blue;">I don't see any harm in that.  This is to ensure racial harmony and encourage inter-racial interaction.  Do we want the Chinese vs Malay riot (that took place in the 1960s) to happen again?  We are a very small country and cannot and must not succumb our people's life safety to such tragedy, just to please some selfish individuals who want to live with their own ethnic group.  </span><br><br>The Malay political clout gradually diminished after the housing policy was implemented, he said.<br><br>"The PAP government also deliberately allowed the marginalisation of the Malay language and Malay schools to occur gradually and naturally.<br><br>"During the colonial rule, there were so many Malay schools in Singapore including in Kampung Gelam, Tanglin Kecil, Kampung Jaguh, Tanglin Besar and Kampung Melayu. The Tun Sri Lanang and Sang Nila Utama Malay schools were the pride of the Malays then. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> <span style="color: blue;">This kind of schools (grouping same ethnic group in one school) will only deprive the students from knowing about other cultures and ethnics.  </span><br><br>"But when Singapore pulled out of the Federation of Malaysia in 1965, Lee Kuan Yew changed the education policy which resulted in the marginalisation of the Malays along with their schools and language. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> <span style="color: green;">Singapore didn't pull out.  Malaysia kicked Singapore out.  </span><br><br>"The policy emphasised on Mandarin and English... and today, Malay stream schools are no longer in existence in Singapore.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> <span style="color: blue;">This is certainly wrong.  The policy doesn't emphasise Mandarin.  It only emphasise English.  Speak Mandarin campaign is meant for chinese only cuz during and before the 1970s, the chinese community spoke in all various dialects.</span><br><br>"In other words, the PAP government made a mockery of the constitution in paragraph 153 (2) which states that Bahasa Melayu is the national language of Singapore. PAP is committing ethnic Malay cleansing in Singapore," he said.<br><br>Mohammed sought refuge in Malaysia in 1978 after he heard that he was going to be arrested. He is now a Malaysian citizen.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> <span style="color: green;">I dunno this Mohammed, whether he exists or what he said.  But if he really made such false statements, he deserved to be arrested.  Good for him to become Malaysian, cuz Singapore don't need him. </span><br><br>Recently, Lee said Malaysia and Indonesia systematically marginalised their ethnic Chinese, sparking outrage among ethnic Chinese in both the countries.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> <span style="color: blue;">Let's not forget the anti chinese riots in 1997 and the fact that it has always been very difficult (almost impossible) for Malaysian Chinese to enter MY universities.  You can hardly see a chinese degree holder who grad from MY uni.</span><br><br>-- BERNAMA<br>http://www.bernama.com/bernama/v3/news_lite.php?id=222287<br><br></div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Rock^Star:</div><div class="quote_body">Thanks for the frank answer. Well, let's look at it this way too. There will never be an Indian or Malay PM in Singapore just like there will never be a black president for the US.<br><br>On the other hand, the willingness to defend one's family and land is good enough reason why we shouldn't restrict Malays who are in public service.</div></blockquote>I disagree. I think that Singapore will sooner or later have an Indian PM and later, a Malay PM.<br><br>It is true that in the public service, Malays are given differential treatment. However, I can think of 2 reasons. Firstly, the lower education standard AND the lower proportion of malays in the population as compared to the Chinese contribute vastly to the skewed ratio of Chinese: malays in top public service positions even after taking into account demographics.<br><br>Secondly, conflict of interest. Historically, Singapore's only possible enemies are its closest enemies. Indonesia- Konfrontasi. Malaysia- makes numerous threats to cut off water/food and invade us since independence. Although no expert in foreign policy, i believe the millitary will regard malaysia and indonesia as its traditional enemies. If, say Thailand or India start making hostile gestures, then I believe the millitary will change its thinking. Till then, Malays will be given less than equal treament in the armed forces and even public adminstration posts.<br><br>There is strong reason to believe that race will play a big factor in any war. Most wars are fought along racial lines. Nazi aryans versus slavs, japs versus chinese and american, italians versus abyssinia etc. A chinese will find it hard to kill his own race, so would a Malay. To prevent a conflict of interest, Malays should not be put in sensitive positions.<br><br>Im sorry if anything comes out wrong here but Im definitely not racist or a supremacist!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Singapore is unique that our society compromises various ethnic groups calling this tiny island home. However, because of the diversity of our society it is paramount that we live with mutual tolerance, strive to achieve a common understanding of each other culture &amp; tradition and to forge a common national identity.<br><br>Singapore is special for its geographical location is surrounded by Muslim country. Henceforth, it is of great importance that poltical leaders be able to resolve any conflict diplomatically, timely and rightly to prevent backslash detriment to our fellow Muslim community. Singaporeans on the other hand should restrain from using any conflict elsewhere as a means to sow discord to our society block. The consequence will be a horrendous breakdown of order and the replay of the disastrous racial war.<br><br>Regardless of race or religion, we are all Singaporean.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think the population of Singapore can be divided into 2 groups, a) those who are too old to remember and b) those who are too young to know. The citizens that remembers and knows are the ones that will remain silent. We, in Singapore needs eggs, vegetables, (FOOD)etc etc. We will go hungry and surrender in a matter of days before we even talk about how great we are.<br>Just a matter of curousity, do you know the range of the "105" cannons. It is further then the length from North to South of Singapore.<br>So let pray that those who are brave will come to reality and be humble. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>

Therefore Singapore must be suppressed.<br><br>The very fact that they are protesting and demanding an explanation and an apology shows that LKY is right about them.
