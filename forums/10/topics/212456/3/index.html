Sometimes, the policies may not be, but the end-result may create such perceptions among minorities.<br>I wish to see good debate and not personal attacks.<br>If there are indeed certain marginalizations in Singapore, we should review them; or at least, be more conscious of them (from Chinese Singaporean point of view). If the points mentioned are untruths, we should dispel such myths/half-truths.<br></div>

I think those are good values to be kept - certainly greed is not a good trait one ought to have.<br><br>Unfortunately, too many Malays take those lessons to the extreme and use it as an excuse for mediocrity. Being contented is one thing; but pursuing greater heights of success and achievement is just as noble. It seems to me that the catchphrase 'tidak apa' ('it doesn't matter') is the order of the day. When 'tidak apa' becomes 'tidak apa-thy', mediocrity sets in.<br><br>And no, religion has nothing to do with it. If anything, Islam has always exhorted on its followers the pursuit of knowledge. So don't blame religion for Malay consistently faring the worst when it comes to education. And what with loose morals running rampant among the Malay youth these days (as an example, 30% of all teenage pregnancies are among Malay youths) - such acts certainly have no place in Islam.<br><br>I've seen far too many Malay youths complaining that 'we can never seem to do well', but upon my asking them, they all sheepishly admit to not putting in enough effort. Maybe they should start looking in the mirror before blaming others for their woes.<br><br>And before you guys start flaming me for being anti-Malay, let me say this first: I AM Malay. I am just sick and tired of our Malays complaining of mediocrity because of our supposedly being 'marginalised' when it is in fact the rampant 'tidak-apathy' mindset that's crippling my own race.</div>

As you can see from my nick, I go out of control whenever I see such incredibly biased opinions.<br><br>Secondly, I do not know if your post is a joke, but I will try to answer the issues as sensibly as I can. I'm sure there are some poor and backward European countries where english isn't worth 2 cents, but are you sure that chinese will be worth 3 cents?<br><br>Taiwan and Japan are much larger countries with much larger populations than us. Besides, I do not know what made you think that Taiwan is doing economically better than us. If GDP per capita is a good gauge, than we rank higher than them: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_%28nominal%29_per_capita" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_%28nominal%29_per_capita</a><br><br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_%28PPP%29_per_capita" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_%28PPP%29_per_capita</a><br><br>Whereas for Japan, there are some manufacturing industries they excel in that we cannot even dream of going into because of our size. An example would be their automobile manufacturing industry. For Singapore, we have to rely on areas such as tourism, shipping, bio-medical science and other forms of manufacturing. I think, so far, the government has done pretty well in sniffing out opportunities for Singapore.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br><br>By Mohd Haikal Isa<br><br>JOHOR BAHARU, Sept 28 (Bernama) -- The Malays in Singapore have been systematically marginalised since Lee Kuan Yew became Prime Minister, and the government under the city state's founding father also committed "ethnic Malay cleansing", said Singapore's veteran politician who migrated to Malaysia.<br><br>Prof Mohammed Yacob, who was political secretary to Singapore's second Chief Minister Lim Yew Hock, said the Malays were systematically marginalised since the People's Action Party (PAP) came to power in 1959.<br><br>According to Mohammed, the PAP reduced the Malay political power through the implementation of the government's housing policy.<br><br>He attested that Malays were uprooted from their villages and were resettled separately at various new townships including Tampines New Town, Bedok North and South, Toa Payoh and Ang Mo Kio.<br><br>"The PAP divided and ruled the Malays. The Malays were separated from each other and resettled in various housing estates so that they no longer have a political voice," he said in an interview with Bernama here.<br><br>"The PAP government used the racial quota system to re-organise the population of Singapore to weaken the Malays. Each housing estate must have 72 per cent Chinese, 16 per cent Malays and 12 per cent Indians and others."<br><br>The Malay political clout gradually diminished after the housing policy was implemented, he said.<br><br>"The PAP government also deliberately allowed the marginalisation of the Malay language and Malay schools to occur gradually and naturally.<br><br>"During the colonial rule, there were so many Malay schools in Singapore including in Kampung Gelam, Tanglin Kecil, Kampung Jaguh, Tanglin Besar and Kampung Melayu. The Tun Sri Lanang and Sang Nila Utama Malay schools were the pride of the Malays then.<br><br>"But when Singapore pulled out of the Federation of Malaysia in 1965, Lee Kuan Yew changed the education policy which resulted in the marginalisation of the Malays along with their schools and language.<br><br>"The policy emphasised on Mandarin and English... and today, Malay stream schools are no longer in existence in Singapore.<br><br>"In other words, the PAP government made a mockery of the constitution in paragraph 153 (2) which states that Bahasa Melayu is the national language of Singapore. PAP is committing ethnic Malay cleansing in Singapore," he said.<br><br>Mohammed sought refuge in Malaysia in 1978 after he heard that he was going to be arrested. He is now a Malaysian citizen.<br><br>Recently, Lee said Malaysia and Indonesia systematically marginalised their ethnic Chinese, sparking outrage among ethnic Chinese in both the countries.<br><br>-- BERNAMA<br>http://www.bernama.com/bernama/v3/news_lite.php?id=222287<br><br></div>
