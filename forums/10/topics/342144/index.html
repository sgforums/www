              <p><span><strong>Special 
              Report: </strong><a href="http://www.chinaview.cn/08yearender/"><strong>Yearender 
              2008</strong></a><strong>      </strong>     </span></p>
              <p><span>    by Sun Ruijun and Bao Erwen </span></p>
              <p><span>    BEIJING, Dec. 28 (Xinhua) -- The world has undergone remarkable changes 
              this year, but international security situation on the whole remained stable 
              with "peace" and "development" prevailing as the themes of the times. </span></p>
              <p><span>    In 2008, the world has continued moving toward multi-polarization, 
              resulting in a distinctive shift of international forces. Globalization is 
              developing in depth and regional cooperation is gathering momentum. </span></p>
              <p><span>    The world has been confronted with one hotspot issue after another and 
              non-traditional threats are increasing. The world economic growth took a turn 
              for the worse due to the outbreak of the global financial crisis. </span></p>
              <p><span>    <strong>WORLD MULTI-POLARIZATION STRENGTHENED</strong> </span></p>
              <p><span>    In recent years, the international political structure has transformed 
              gradually from "one superpower coexisting with several other powers," formed 
              after the Cold War, to multi-polarization. </span></p>
              <p><span>    The transformation picked up speed this year, with significant changes in 
              the balance of international forces. </span></p>
              <p><span>    The United States has been acting as the world's only superpower in 2008, 
              but the financial turmoil, which broke out in Wall Street in September, showed 
              its vulnerability. </span></p>
              <p><span>    In addition, the country is still deep in trouble with its wars in Iraq and 
              Afghanistan, which has undermined its international image. </span></p>
              <p><span>    Some analysts attributed the waning U.S. strength to its policy of 
              unilateralism and expansionism on international issues, and its practice of a 
              laissez-faire free market economy at home. It remains to be seen what 
              consequences of these policies will have on U.S. national strength. </span></p>
              <p><span>    By contrast, Russia's flexing of strong muscles in the international 
              political arena in the outgoing year indicated a marked recovery of its 
              strength. </span></p>
              <p><span>    After sending troops to Georgia in August, Moscow announced itsrecognition 
              of the independence of South Ossetia and Abkhazia and established diplomatic 
              ties with them. </span></p>
              <p><span>    Furthermore, the Russian military forces also carried out operations in 
              Latin America, which has long been considered the "backyard" of the United 
              States. </span></p>
              <p><span>    Washington, which has been pushing NATO's eastward expansion and trying to 
              deploy anti-ballistic missile systems in East Europe, seemed to have no 
              effective measures to deal with Russia's counterattack. </span></p>
              <p><span>    The growing strength of Russia has something to do with its leaders' strong 
              will to make their country regain world power status. Over the past years Russia 
              had seized the favorable opportunities by pursuing a pluralistic and pragmatic 
              diplomatic policy, reviving its national economy and safeguarding its national 
              interest. </span></p>
              <p><span>    Also in 2008, after standing the test of natural disasters following the 
              Wenchuan earthquake in May, China succeeded in hosting the "truly exceptional" 
              29th Olympic Games in August. In October, the country sent Shenzhou-7 spacecraft 
              into orbit, accomplishing its first ever space walk. </span></p>
              <p><span>    China has showed to the world its overall national strength is on constant 
              increase following 30 years of reform and opening-up. China has become one of 
              the major engines for world economy and contributed significantly to world 
              economic growth. </span></p>
              <p><span>    Moreover, China has played more important roles in international affairs, 
              such as the financial summit and the informal meeting of the Asia-Pacific 
              Economic Cooperation (APEC) this year. </span></p>
              <p><span>    Meanwhile, the European Union (EU) continued to enhance its independence 
              and influence in international affairs. </span></p>
              <p><span>    In March, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown and French President Nicolas 
              Sarkozy said their countries share a vision of a "global Europe." </span></p>
              <p><span>    "We need Britain and France at the heart of Europe, a global Europe, that 
              is reforming, open, flexible, outward-looking," the two leaders said in a joint 
              statement. </span></p>
              <p><span>    The outgoing 2008 has also seen a large number of developing countries rise 
              with increasing momentum. </span></p>
              <p><span>    From a geopolitical perspective, the center of world power is shifting from 
              both sides of the Atlantic to the western Pacific region, as the emerging 
              countries are mostly located in Northeast Asia, Southeast Asia, South Asia and 
              the Middle East. </span></p>
              <p><span>    This shows that the existing international system is undergoing 
              readjustment with new reshuffles and restructuring profoundly changing the 
              balance of power in the world. </span></p>
              <p><span>    <strong>GLOBALIZATION, REGIONAL COOPERATION</strong> </span></p>
              <p><span>    The in-depth development of economic globalization has made economic ties 
              and interdependence between countries even closer, boosting the sustained growth 
              of world economy, and benefiting many countries. </span></p>
              <p><span>    The Doha Round of talks of the World Trade Organization, aimed at 
              furthering global trade, remained deadlocked this year. However, the financial 
              summit and the 16th Leaders' Meeting of APEC in November sent out a strong 
              signal for boosting the talks and gave them fresh impetus. </span></p>
              <p><span>    Yet, economic globalization has not been plain sailing this year. </span></p>
              <p><span>    Some developed nations, out of their selfish interest, asked too much of 
              their developing counterparts, leaving the Doha Round of trade talks in an 
              impasse. </span></p>
              <p><span>    After the outbreak of financial crisis, trade protectionism gained ground 
              in some developed nations. However, economic globalization will continue despite 
              twists and turns, as it is the inevitable outcome that corresponds to the 
              development of productive forces of today's world, and constitutes the general 
              trend of world economic growth. </span></p>
              <p><span>    It is hoped that developed nations would establish an equal, 
              mutually-beneficial and win-win partnership with developing nations, so as to 
              advance economic globalization toward balanced development, shared benefits and 
              win-win progress. </span></p>
              <p><span>    Regional integration is another highlight in 2008, with regional and 
              sub-regional cooperation further strengthened. </span></p>
              <p><span>    The EU continued to boost the process of its integration. Except Ireland, 
              the Czech Republic and Poland, all EU member nations have ratified the Lisbon 
              Treaty, signed by EU heads of state and government in December 2007 and designed 
              to reform EU institutions and streamline decision-making in the ever-enlarging 
              union. </span></p>
              <p><span>    A charter of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN),which was 
              ratified by parliaments of 10 members of the regional bloc and formally entered 
              into force on Dec. 15, clearly set the strategic goal of setting up an ASEAN 
              community. </span></p>
              <p><span>    In Africa, the Southern African Development Community (SADC) inaugurated a 
              free trade area in August. </span></p>
              <p><span>    In October, the SADC and two other
              regional blocs, the East African Community and the Common Market for
              Eastern and Southern Africa, held a summit in the Ugandan capital of
              Kampala to discuss Africa's economic integration. <br><br> </span></p>
              <p><span><strong>    COMPLICATED SECURITY SITUATION</strong> </span></p>
              <p><span>    International security situation remained stable on the whole this year despite sporadic traditional threats. </span></p>
              <p><span>    The U.S.-led NATO continued to take
              "containment" measures against Russia. Meanwhile, Washington has
              reinforced its military strength in East Asia. </span></p>
              <p><span>    The armed conflict between Georgia
              and Russia in South Ossetia took the world by surprise. Observers noted
              however, the root cause of the conflict lies in Russia's perceived
              threat to its strategic security posed by NATO's continued eastward
              expansion that will recruit Georgia and Ukraine as new members and
              Washington's insistence on deploying anti-ballistic missile systems in
              Poland and the Czech Republic, rather than the apparent differences
              over South Ossetia's sovereignty. </span></p>
              <p><span>    The year 2008 has also seen new changes in some old hotspot issues, and the emergence of some new hotspot issues. </span></p>
              <p><span>    The nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula achieved a breakthrough, but also encountered new obstacles. </span></p>
              <p><span>    After the Democratic People's
              Republic of Korea (DPRK) formally submitted a declaration on its
              nuclear program, Washington removed the country from the "list of state
              sponsors of terrorism." </span></p>
              <p><span>    But the two countries were far apart on the issue concerning verification of the DPRK's declaration. </span></p>
              <p><span>    Iran's nuclear issue remained
              deadlocked. Tehran refused to halt its sensitive uranium enrichment
              activities, while Western nations threatened to launch a new round of
              sanctions against the country. </span></p>
              <p><span>    Iraq's security situation has
              improved, with violent attacks on decline as compared with last year.
              Washington and the Iraqi government reached a deal on the status of the
              U.S. forces stationed in the country. But sectarian conflicts,
              political confrontation, terrorist activities and the U.S. military
              presence were still threatening Iraq's stability. </span></p>
              <p><span>    As insufficient U.S. and NATO
              troops were unable to deal effective blows to Taliban insurgents,
              Afghanistan underwent the most turbulent year in 2008 since the fall of
              the Taliban regime, with at least 5,000 people killed in violent
              attacks this year. </span></p>
              <p><span>    In the Middle East, Israeli and
              Palestinian leaders failed to honor their commitment of a peaceful deal
              made at an international meeting in the U.S. city of Annapolis last
              November. </span></p>
              <p><span>    Meanwhile, Fatah and Hamas, two
              major factions in Palestine, were locked in frequent clashes due to
              different political views. </span></p>
              <p><span>    In November, the Sudanese
              government announced an immediate ceasefire in the war-torn western
              region of Darfur to pave the wayfor the Arab-sponsored peace
              negotiations with the rebel movements. But in July, a prosecutor of the
              International Criminal Court (ICC) demanded an arrest warrant for
              Sudanese President Omeral-Bashir, accusing him of "genocide" and other
              war crimes committed in Darfur. </span></p>
              <p><span>    The ICC move set a precedent for an
              institution transcending states prosecuting the incumbent leader of a
              sovereign state, causing grave concerns among Middle Eastern and
              African nations, as the move threatened the current international order
              based on the UN Charter. </span></p>
              <p><span>    In February, Kosovo's declaration
              of independence drew mixed reactions from the international community,
              with Washington voicing support and recognition for Kosovo's
              independence, EU nations holding different views on the issue, and
              Serbia and Russia expresses strong opposition to Kosovo's independence. </span></p>
              <p><span>    Moscow maintained that Kosovo's
              independence would endanger the system of international law and leave
              negative consequences for the Balkan region and the world at large. </span></p>
              <p><span>    In Thailand, Pakistan and Zimbabwe,
              different political factions, as representatives of different interest
              groups, got into furious disputes over election issues. </span></p>
              <p><span>    The year 2008 has also witnessed
              increasing non-traditional security threats, including terrorism,
              climate change and piracy. </span></p>
              <p><span>    On Nov. 26, more than 200 people
              were killed and some 300 others injured in terror attacks in Mumbai,
              India's largest city. Afghanistan and Pakistan also fell victim to
              terror attacks. </span></p>
              <p><span>    As for climate change, a disaster
              caused by freezing rain and snow hit a large area in southern China.
              Hurricanes pounded Central America and the Caribbean. More than 77,000
              people were killed and nearly 56,000 people went missing in a severe
              tropical storm in Myanmar. </span></p>
              <p><span>    Since the beginning of 2008, more
              than 120 cases of piracy occurred off Somalia, a war-torn country in
              Africa, with more than 30 ships hijacked and some 600 sailors held
              hostages. </span></p>
              <p><span>    As rampant piracy is posing
              increasing threats to maritime trade and shipping, some countries were
              forced to use military force to ensure the safety of their commercial
              vessels. </span></p>
              <p><span><strong>    FINANCIAL CRISIS</strong> </span></p>
              <p><span>    In September this year, a financial
              "tsunami" that broke out in Wall Street, quickly turned into the most
              serious global financial crisis since the Great Depression in the
              1930s. </span></p>
              <p><span>    According to the U.S. company
              Goldman Sachs &amp; Co., global financial institutions would suffer a
              loss of 1.4 trillion dollars in the U.S. subprime crisis. Global
              financial crisis had already plunged the United States, the euro zone
              and Japan into recession, and slowed down the growth of emerging
              economies. </span></p>
              <p><span>    The International Monetary Fund has
              predicted a 3.7 percent growth rate for world economy this year, lower
              than the 2007 figure of 5.0 percent. </span></p>
              <p><span>    The global financial crisis is
              blamed on the laissez-faire economic policy adopted by the U.S.
              government and its failure to exercise effective financial regulation
              amid the dramatic expansion of financial derivative products since
              early this century. </span></p>
              <p><span>    People expect the international
              community to draw lessons from the crisis and undertake necessary
              reform of international financial system in a comprehensive, balanced,
              incremental and result-oriented way, so as to establish a new
              international financial order that is fair, just, inclusive and orderly
              and fostering an institutional environment conducive to sound global
              economic development. </span></p>
              <p><span>    As long as it joins forces, the
              international community will be able to tackle all political, security
              and economic challenges and continue to advance the world further
              toward justice, peace and prosperity, observers said. </span></p>
