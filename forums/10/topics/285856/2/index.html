            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Rock^Star:</div><div class="quote_body">So what caused apathy among our youths?</div></blockquote>Ignorance, of course.<br><br>If you were to ask me to list 10 negative stuff about PAP in 10 minutes, I would probably be able to tell you a few, and probably give justification for one of them only - just like a student who did not prepare for his exams. Conversely, Poh Ah Pak would be able to shoot out at least 100 of them like a machine gun and justify each of them with so much evidence and proof that printing them would require the entire Amazon rainforest, right, Ah Pak?<br><br>And with ignorance, comes fear. If one doesn't know much about something, he/she will not feel confident discussing about it, because of the fear of the consequences - criticism, labelled as kaypoh and whatsoever.<br><br>To illustrate this better, it's like going to a forum of some unknown field to you, say, soaps and detergents. Then you post something like "PAPA Lemon sux sia - cannot remove this XX stain from plates", and get a reply from the PAPA CEO, "*laughs* I'm afraid you'll need to justify this. Our dishwashing detergent is produced using the latest ABC technology and ingredients like DEF also blah blah blah...". Then "?" shows all over your head about the ABCDEF nomenclature and you feel down-right stupid in front of other forum users. Either that, or you receive a lawyer's letter the next day demanding for a public apology and state that you made up everything; you'll probably go wtf and regret about complaining in the first place.<br><br>And I still remember the TV telecast of a conversation between LKY and a group of people. Then one of the participants got pinned down for asking a sensitive question (something about a survey) like a needle through an ant. It's just...scary.<br><br>One way to end such ignorance is to make sure the knowledge is "compulsory" aka in textbooks and examinations. The advantage of this is, unless something else in his/her knowledge proves it untrue, it remains true in the learners' mind. Something like an opt-out system; you get what I mean. But of course, it will never happen until MOE privatises some eons later.<br><br>Another would be to get the person to generate an interest in the topic, one of which is by proving some "truths" relevant to his/her life untrue, as mentioned above, or by providing alternative viewpoints about it. With the internet, there's technically no limit on what you can find out about anything (yet), confidential stuff aside, if he/she is indeed genuinely interested about it. And just how does it feel like to realize that you have been kept in the dark or been given one-sided views about certain issues, which would probably affect your future, for the past ten-odd years?<br><br>But anyway, the challenge here is to spark that interest in the first place, imho. With so much censorship and restriction on freedom, it is no surprise that me and my peers are being apathetic about political issues. Even the local newspapers which the teachers encourage us to read are simply filled with either pro-PAP content or non-politics stuff, mainly trivia. Nothing else. And so much for the impression that our papers are neutral and unbiased which I had until a few months ago. What a charade, or maybe it's just that I was dumb.<br><br>Right now, I feel like I'm ban1 men2 nong4 fu3-ing in front of you SC regulars. But anyway, if there is any part of my post which is incorrect or just naive teenager crap, do point them out, but don't flame me - I fear of being flamed.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by LatecomerX:</div><div class="quote_body">Ignorance, of course.<br><br>If you were to ask me to list 10 negative stuff about PAP in 10 minutes, I would probably be able to tell you a few, and probably give justification for one of them only - just like a student who did not prepare for his exams. Conversely, Poh Ah Pak would be able to shoot out at least 100 of them like a machine gun and justify each of them with so much evidence and proof that printing them would require the entire Amazon rainforest, right, Ah Pak?<br><br>And with ignorance, comes fear. If one doesn't know much about something, he/she will not feel confident discussing about it, because of the fear of the consequences - criticism, labelled as kaypoh and whatsoever.<br><br>To illustrate this better, it's like going to a forum of some unknown field to you, say, soaps and detergents. Then you post something like "PAPA Lemon sux sia - cannot remove this XX stain from plates", and get a reply from the PAPA CEO, "*laughs* I'm afraid you'll need to justify this. Our dishwashing detergent is produced using the latest ABC technology and ingredients like DEF also blah blah blah...". Then "?" shows all over your head about the ABCDEF nomenclature and you feel down-right stupid in front of other forum users. Either that, or you receive a lawyer's letter the next day demanding for a public apology and state that you made up everything; you'll probably go wtf and regret about complaining in the first place.<br><br>And I still remember the TV telecast of a conversation between LKY and a group of people. Then one of the participants got pinned down for asking a sensitive question (something about a survey) like a needle through an ant. It's just...scary.<br><br>One way to end such ignorance is to make sure the knowledge is "compulsory" aka in textbooks and examinations. The advantage of this is, unless something else in his/her knowledge proves it untrue, it remains true in the learners' mind. Something like an opt-out system; you get what I mean. But of course, it will never happen until MOE privatises some eons later.<br><br>Another would be to get the person to generate an interest in the topic, one of which is by proving some "truths" relevant to his/her life untrue, as mentioned above, or by providing alternative viewpoints about it. With the internet, there's technically no limit on what you can find out about anything (yet), confidential stuff aside, if he/she is indeed genuinely interested about it. And just how does it feel like to realize that you have been kept in the dark or been given one-sided views about certain issues, which would probably affect your future, for the past ten-odd years?<br><br>But anyway, the challenge here is to spark that interest in the first place, imho. With so much censorship and restriction on freedom, it is no surprise that me and my peers are being apathetic about political issues. Even the local newspapers which the teachers encourage us to read are simply filled with either pro-PAP content or non-politics stuff, mainly trivia. Nothing else. And so much for the impression that our papers are neutral and unbiased which I had until a few months ago. What a charade, or maybe it's just that I was dumb.<br><br>Right now, I feel like I'm ban1 men2 nong4 fu3-ing in front of you SC regulars. But anyway, if there is any part of my post which is incorrect or just naive teenager crap, do point them out, but don't flame me - I fear of being flamed.<br></div></blockquote>LatecomerX, simple truths but great insights. Speakers' Corner surely appreciates your effort here, unlike the many who give one liner smart alecky comments.<br><br>Anyway, I agree with you that ignorance breeds fear and therefore apathy as a result.<br><br>If LKY was exasperated at the Q &amp; A exchange because intially, no Singaporean had asked questions, then he must be a man of ironies given his tendency to stifle all opposition towards his ideas.<br><br>For a man to claim that a lack of opposition and constant walkovers mean good governance, then surely he has no right to lament at the lack of response from Singaporeans that day since he was the engineer of this apathy?<br><br>I only became interested in politics during my army years. All those years before were pure apathy due largely to the mundane political scene here. Even with the advent of internet, APATHY is still widely prevalent. Little wonder that PAP boasted recently that they do not fear the internet.</div>
