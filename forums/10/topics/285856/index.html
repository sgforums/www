            <div class='col-md body'>Undergrads<br>Too docile for the world<br>Good at studies, they lack initiative and verbal skill that will make it hard to compete in a changing world.<br>By Seah Chiang Nee, littlespeck.com<br>Oct 13, 2007<br><br>STEPPING up to the mike to ask Lee Kuan Yew a question at a campus forum, university student Terence found himself Â‘tremblingÂ’.<br><br>Â“I couldnÂ’t control it. My legs shook violently,Â” said the only Singaporean among the first seven undergraduates with questions for the Minister Mentor, who still overawes many Singaporeans he meets.<br><br>The other six were foreigners. From the Singaporeans who made up the vast majority of the 1,800-strong forum audience, there was silence.<br><br>As the moderator proceeded to end the session, an exasperated Lee asked: Â“Is there no Singaporean who wants to ask a question?Â” Three locals then came forward with mundane questions.<br><br>The question-and-answer was LeeÂ’s annual campus sojourn to feel the pulse of people who will one day inherit South-East AsiaÂ’s wealthiest state.<br><br>Terence, who was the first to step up, provided an answer to LeeÂ’s question Â– without referring to it Â– on SingaporeansÂ’ reticence in expressing themselves.<br><br>In his blog, he described his experience of facing Lee, who is two generations his senior, as Â‘nerve-wreckingÂ’, and which Â‘took a lot of gutsÂ’ from a questioner.<br><br>TerenceÂ’s case could be just an over-statement of his nervousness and may not be representative of the student body. On previous occasions, a few had stood their ground in facing off against Lee, one even calling him Â“a despotÂ”.<br><br>But what is more worrying is the general mood of docility at a time when Singaporeans are bugged by a number of unpopular government policies.<br><br>At a time when students elsewhere are playing an active role in society, the locals remain either uninterested or turned-off about anything beyond pursuing a degree and a career.<br><br>In some ways, Lee had been the cause of this Â‘donÂ’t careÂ’ lethargy, his education system having produced a highly educated, but unquestioning new generation.<br><br>LeeÂ’s campus experience last week came as his government is planning to build a fourth Â– and even a fifth Â– university to meet the demand for higher learning at home and in the region.<br><br>The system had worked very well when Singapore was a manufacturing centre for multi-national corporations. It produced hardworking ant-workers to man the production lines, helping the state to prosper.<br><br>To LeeÂ’s credit, he saw the global change away from this, and invested heavily (so did the parents) in educating Singaporeans, which is now paying off.<br><br>Economic growth, at 7.8% in 2006, is expected to rise by another 8% this year.<br><br>Generally, Singaporean students rank highly in the world, topping in Maths and Science, and many eventually become good professionals and skilled technicians for the economy.<br><br>(Last year, the island republic recorded a GDP per capita income of US$32,867 Â– 17th highest in the world.)<br><br>But LeeÂ’s tight control of society has also had a negative impact. It discouraged the emergence of creative, independent-minded youths capable of expressing themselves.<br><br>He has always feared that opening up too quickly would result in disorder. He once declared: Â“If nobody is afraid of me, IÂ’m meaningless.Â”<br><br>Although he has mellowed in recent times, his reputation of knocking heads still lingers.<br><br>The result has been a lack of any fire in the belly, an adventurous streak that Lee often says he wishes to see in his people.<br><br>Instead, the 21st Century Singaporean is professionally capable, knowledgeable in data knowledge, but short on initiative, action and verbal skills.<br><br>He is also self-centred and apathetic about the world around him, a trait that Lee knows will make it hard for Singapore to compete against more gung-ho hordes from China and India.<br><br>Â“Unquestioning citizens are easier to govern. In a small country like Singapore, this necessary compromise has been engineered to prevent chaos,Â” a newspaper reader wrote.<br><br>The education system still tolerates no talk-back, described by a writer as Â“Teacher teaches, pupils listenÂ”.<br><br>He added, Â“The political culture does not encourage one to speak up, let alone question.Â”<br><br>The university student understands that academic achievement and a dream job do not lie in the ability to ask probing or political questions of a leader, one cynic said.<br><br>Â“Kindly look elsewhere for student activism,Â” he added.<br><br>Â“At any rate, the local student knows Â– something his foreign friend does not Â– that asking Lee questions is not going to change anything, so why botherÂ”, a blogger said.<br><br>Ask him an embarrassing question, Lee would Â“give you his famous laugh and explain to you in very simple terms his point of view, which will be the final and only answerÂ” was another comment.<br><br>Part of this lies in the age gap between Lee and young Singaporeans; some 60 years divide them.<br><br>The dilemma has, however, not affected the Singaporean universitiesÂ’ steady climb in world rankings or their contribution to the flourishing economy.<br><br>i would say that most singaporeans are too docile and unquestioning not just the undergrads or grads.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Why are the university students lacking the critical thinking abilities ?<br><br>Can our university undergrads think on their feet.<br><br>Let us analyse why we have reached this apathetic state of affairs as lamented by many social commentators like Dr. Catherine Lim or Mr. Ngiam Tong Dow.<br><br>If our undergrads are said to be less critical and less analytical who do we compare them with ?<br><br>From what has happened to our journalists and students in recent public debates or Q&amp;A forums, it is more than obvious that they were found to be lacking critical thinking as compared with their counterparts elsewhere.<br><br>So why are they lacking such abilities? Is it caused by environmental or inherent factors. How different is our environment today as compared with that of free countries like US or UK? Do we suffer a war or such drastic setback in recent history?<br><br>No? If we cannot find any other substantive cause for our lack of critical thinking among the undergrads then the more likely possible and obvious cause is our political and social environment we are living in.<br><br>For example how do our leaders or MPs value individual freedoms or participative governance in our society? How do our leaders choose or select the professors ? Were they chosen from among well behaved politically uncritical with clean record of not holding tii vocal or strong views about politics or democracy or freedom. If so how do we expect to have good critical teaching to produce critical students in our universities?<br><br>One NUS professor was removed and he said the in his parting shot that in Singapore "it is not what you know but who you know" that matters. Is this true?<br><br>So unless we allow freedoms of expressions within the universities through careful selection of teaching staff with such qualities will we be better off or worse off in the long term?<br><br>Will our students be free to discuss and discover truths and expose falsehood of what is posted in the Little Red Dot or "20 Major Policy Errors" written in forums ?<br><br>If the students want to develop critical thinking abilities they should be left to develop them from interactions and exposures with the real world and not just follow the standard textbook questions and answers which probably do not prepare them to ask searching questions of MM Lee about major government policy errors.<br><br>MM Lee was a staunch believer of autocracy and dictatorial leadership for his own reason. To him granting greater freedoms of speech and expressions and rights of citizens will lead to instability and chaos. He did not allow the jury trial in serious crimes or politically motivated defamation suits. He does not allow habeas corpus for greater protections of individual freedoms. He did not allow Law Society to disagree with government policies or actions.<br><br>In the same way he did not allow journalist to write critically about government policies.<br><br>Should the students be allowed to think otherwise from the one-sided political environment which preaches only the virtue of top-down autocratic leadership which does not tolerate dissent.<br><br>So if students are not allowed to develop naturally will they know how to argue and discuss critically to come up with what is good system for Singapore.<br><br>If the students and journalists were docile and far from critical or analytical as compared with the writing in some forums due to lack of analytical views it is clear that our political environment plays a great part.<br><br>Why our cannot ask good searching questions of his government? Standard solutions to textbook problems?<br><br>MM Lee should know why both the undergrads and journalists are unable to develop their intellectual abilities? Only it will be poor public relation for him to concede the real cause.<br><br>There is a heavy price to pay if we want a stable and orderly society which does not permit or encourage citizens of freedoms of speech and expressions of opinions both the by-products of democracy.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Surely, it can't possibly have escaped the observation of any rational mind the docility espoused herein stems from the culture of fear and terror that permeates through the state rather than one's educational inclinations?<br><br>It's no coincidence that such cultures are inherent in other totalitarian regimes like China and North Korea as we witness the nurturing of an identical culture? All that despite having the fact such regimes have actually got sound infrastructure in place to churn out tonnes of highly capable technocrats.<br><br>Is the docility in question a product of education or totalitarianism?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>If you ever needed a benchmark for docility spurned by effective totalitarianism, look no further than the legendary paradise known as the DPRK. In case you were wondering, their "Dear Leader" - pretty similar to the despot running this regime - doesn't subscribe to the merits of international institutions like "Reporter without Borders" and "Amnesty International" either.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

It could be an exploration of ideas. For example, why can't allowances for those who have no means to support themselves be indexed to average earnings ? 1/4 of average earnings. Citizens prefer persuation as opposed to coercion, why can't the government persuade citizens to purchase the annuity through tax incentives or matching $ for $ if we purchase etc.<br><br>As much as some of us here wishes that students stand up to and challenge lao lee and his legacy, scold him or whatever....questions can also be asked and ideas explored.</div>
