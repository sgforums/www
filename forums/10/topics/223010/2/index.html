The term is associated with a social consensus (usually expressed through democratic elections) that certain services should be available to all, regardless of income. Even where public services are neither publicly-provided nor publicly-financed, for social and political reasons they are usually subject to regulation going beyond that applying to most economic sectors.<br><br>It is also an alternative term for civil service.<br><br>Sectors<br><br>Public services tend to be those considered so essential to modern life that for moral reasons their universal provision should be guaranteed, and they may be associated with fundamental human rights (such as the right to water). An example of a service which is not generally considered an essential public service is hairdressing.<br><br>In modern, developed countries the term public services often includes<br><br>* education<br>* public transportation<br>* broadcasting and communications<br>* electricity and gas<br>* fire service<br>* healthcare<br>* police service<br>* waste management<br>* water services<br><br>Characteristics<br><br>A public service may sometimes have the characteristics of a public good (being non-rivalrous and non-excludable), but most are merit goods, that is, services which may (according to prevailing social norms) be under-provided by the market. In most cases public services are services, i.e. they do not involve manufacturing of good (accounting)goods such as nuts and bolts. They may be provided by local or national monopolies, especially in sectors which are natural monopolies.<br><br>They may involve outputs that are hard to attribute to specific individual effort and/or hard to measure in terms of key characteristics such as quality. They often require high levels of training and education. They may attract people with a public service ethos who wish to give something to the wider public or community through their work and are prepared to work harder for less pay as a result. (John Kenneth Galbraith has looked at the role of such "public virtue" in economic growth.)<br><br>History<br><br>Historically, the widespread provision of public services in developed countries usually began in the late nineteenth century, often with the municipal development of gas and water services. Later, other services such as electricity and healthcare began to be provided by governments. In most developed countries such services are still provided by local or national government, the biggest exceptions being the U.S. and the UK, where private provision is more significant. Nonetheless, such privately-provided public services are often strongly regulated, for example (in the US) by Public Utility Commissions.<br><br>In developing countries public services tend to be much less well developed. Water services, for example, may only be available to the wealthy middle class. For political reasons the service is often subsidised, which reduces the finance available for expansion to poorer communities.<br><br>See also<br><br>* Public ownership<br>* Public policy<br>* Privatization<br>* Public service broadcasting<br>* Services of General Interest (SGI)<br>* Welfare state<br>* Public value<br>* New Public Management<br><br>External links<br><br>* Daniel Chavez (ed), Beyond the Market: The Future of Public Services, TNI Public Services Yearbook 2005/6, Trans National Institute (TNI) / Public Services International Research Unit (PSIRU), February 2006<br><br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Wiki needs a specific definition for Singapore's Public Service.<br>The above do not fit SG version of public service which is profit driven for the few elites, everything can be privatized for higher profit under one system managed through fear.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>even some of the old guards didn't believe in throwing money at politicians:<br><br>Cabinet pay<br>May soon rise<br>During May election, hikes in 5-7% GST and cabinet ministersÂ’ pay were widely speculated. Now the 2nd part may also come true.<br>By Seah Chiang Nee, littlespeck.com<br>Nov 26, 2006<br><br>By far the highest in the world, Singapore cabinet ministersÂ’ salaries are likely to head for another increase soon.<br><br>It follows the recent announcement that civil service salaries would be kept competitive to retain talent, although it did not cover political leaders.<br><br>However, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong had given a strong hint of it when he said in March that ministersÂ’ pay was lagging behind salary benchmarks.<br><br>This was widely anticipated during the May general election when speculation was rife that two unpopular hikes would come as soon as polling ended: A GST (Goods and Services Tax) increase from 5-7% and a rise in cabinet salaries.<br><br>The GST hike from 5-7 per cent was recently announced. And observers say the cabinet pay now looks almost certain to materialise.<br><br>With the next election five years away, the news is unlikely to cause immediate damage to the ruling PeopleÂ’s Action Party (PAP).<br><br>However, public resentment remains high against the huge salaries paid to the Prime Minister, Minister Mentor and Senior Minister as well as other ministers, although it wasnÂ’t enough to bring down the government.<br><br>Currently, ministers are paid basic annual salaries (plus performance bonuses) and, at age 55, they are entitled to collect both a salary and full pension.<br><br>The President's basic salary US$1,500,000 (S$2,507,200) while the Prime Minister gets US$1,100,000 (S$1,958,000).<br><br>Minister's Basic salary ranged from US$655,530 to US$819,124 (S$1,166,844 to S$1,458,040) a year.<br><br>In comparison, the president of the United States, the most powerful nation in the world, earns US$400,000 and US$50,000 expenses, less than what a junior minister earns in Singapore. In UK, Prime Minister Tony Blair earns US$170,556 annually.<br><br>When Mr. Lee Kuan Yew devised the high salary scheme in 1994 Â– allegedly as a means to combat government corruption - many Singaporeans opposed it including some of LeeÂ’s own colleagues.<br><br>Mr. Lim Kim San had "his reservations against throwing money at politicians. His personal preference was to give them challenges and dare them to overcome them.Â”<br><br>Not convinced that high pay packets were necessary to beget good politicians, he said in an interview in 2000: "You don't throw money at yourself. We have a lot of people, like entrepreneurs, who will accept challenges. What is worrying me is that we are having less people who will take up a challenge'." (S.T. July 21, 2006)<br><br>Lee has defended the high salary as necessary to give Singapore its good governance and keep it AsiaÂ’s least corrupt country.</div>
