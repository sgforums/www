They can still go to the Supreme Court.<br><br>Plaintiffs left the courtroom holding a banner that read, "Unjust verdict."<br><br>The plaintiffs had sought 100 million yen (930,000 dollars) for atrocities including the Nanjing massacre, bombings by Japanese forces and the "Unit 731" that performed medical experiments on humans.<br><br>Meanwhile Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi on Tuesday defended his visits to a Tokyo war shrine that have infuriated China and called for the two countries to understand each other's views amid a heated row.<br><br>Since taking office in 2001, Koizumi has made four pilgrimages to the Yasukuni shrine, which honors 2.5 million Japanese war dead including seven World War II leaders hanged for war crimes.<br><br>Asked if his visits to the Shinto sanctuary were a reason for the massive anti-Japanese protests this month in China, Koizumi said: "I don't think so."<br><br>"I have been visiting in order to pledge not to have war and to mourn the war dead," Koizumi told reporters.<br><br>"Respective countries have respective histories and traditions and have different opinions," Koizumi said. "It is necessary to deepen mutual understanding."<br><br>Chinese State Councillor Tang Jiaxuan, a former foreign minister, has said Japanese leaders' visits to the Yasukuni shrine were at the heart of bilateral problems.<br><br>Koizumi has visited the shrine annually since taking office, each time prompting protests by China and South Korea, which were victims of Japanese aggression.<br><br>Koizumi has not yet gone this year or said clearly if he will. His last pilgrimage was on January 1, 2004.<br><br>skyline63<br>Junior Member<br><br>Joined: 14 Apr 2005<br>Posts: 107<br><br>Send Message<br>20 April 2005 Â· 01:35 AM Click Here to See the Profile for skyline63     Edit Message     Reply with Quote<br>Not happy.

Since you love them so much !<br><br>Calm down. The last thing we need is anger clouding the current situation. Already, enraged chinese protesters have resorted to physical show of force through stone pelting, material boycotts of Japanese products to make their point. I believe that a blockade of their front gate is a more effective and stronger statement: not only does it convey a picture of self-control despite great dissatisfaction, it also make it even easier to emphasis their points.<br><br>For me, the current status quo should not stay: they have obscured their own World War II history to such an extent that come a decade or two, the young Japanese would look at us in incredulity whenever we mention Japan's unapologetic stand.<br><br>We need to assert our rights to a public apology, not only to China and South Korea, but to all the other nations Japan has transgressed during its wartime aggression: to do justice to all the suffering our grandparents (parents to some of us) have suffered, we must demand that the Japanese education ministry rewrite their history books to adhere to facts. This is something I feel isn't hard achieve, and is the right thing to do. After all, History is about facts, not some nationalistic propaganda to whitewash the past.<br>[This message was edited by pkchukiss on 2005-04-20 17:48:02.]<br>Contact [&gt; pkchu.spin+tuition@gmail.com &lt;] for private tuition<br><br>Visit my NS blog!<br>skyline63<br>Junior Member<br><br>Joined: 14 Apr 2005<br>Posts: 107<br><br>Send Message<br>23 April 2005 Â· 12:44 PM Click Here to See the Profile for skyline63     Edit Message     Reply with Quote<br>People teach their children.

The whole textbook thing was also probably a deception as<br>the textbooks were not widely adopted before and the Japanese government<br>knew that it will be the same this time round. However, it allowed the Japanese government to arouse Chinese nationalistic feelings. And the Chinese naively played along. It gave them the opportunity to label China a 'scary' country. China's refusal to apologize after the attack on the Japanese embassy allowed the Japanese to portray themselves as the victims and China as unreasonable and irrational. With the Prime Minister's apology, Japan gained the moral high ground. Japan is seen as the more reasonable, rational, co-operative and peaceful among the 2 countries. Furthermore, China's strong opposition to Japan's acceptance to the Security Council is seen as aggressive and allowing regional politics to interfere with an International system. This whole issue also caused a greater scrutiny of China's own human rights record.<br><br>This tactic is not new. The US has used it against a previous super-power, the Soviet Union, in the Cold War. They advertised themselves as the 'country of freedon' while the communist Soviet Union is condemned as repressive. And recently, they began to label countries as the "Axis of Evil" and some countries as allies to terrorists. It is apparent that Japan seeks to sway world opinion that China is a threat and steps must be taken to contain its growth, just like how the US did with the Soviet Union. China has not helped itself in this matter. It displayed what people think as a conduct unbecoming of a future superpower.<br><br>So, round 1 to Japan.

It certainly doesn't prove anything. Most Chinese have nothing against the Japanese. In fact there are more and more Japanese who see China as a great place to live in and are migrating to China in numbers. Here is the related article about Japanese migration to China:<br><br>http://www.muninn.net/blog/archives/000229.html<br><br>It has been 60 years since the war ended but even until today the Japanese government are still denying and glorifying their past mistakes. What's the reason behind this?<br><br>I think that the Japanese government is trying to stir up nationalistic sentiments among its citizens in order to divert their attention from its ailing economy. By continuing to whitewash their altrocities, the Japanese government is trying to incite foreign countries to stage protests against them, this will anger the Japanese and help rally the people of Japan behind the ruling government.<br><br>What's most disturbing is that in recent years in Japan itself, ethnic Chinese and Korean and their properties are frequently subjected to unprovoked death threats and attacks from Japanese nationalists. Look at these articles:<br><br>http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2004-04/23/content_325864.htm<br><br>http://210.145.168.243/pk/066th_issue/98102107.htm<br><br>http://www.imadr.org/imadr_jc/song_hesuk.html<br><br>What have the japanese government been teaching their younger generations anyway?

Another thing is that since the Japanese economic bubble burst in the early 1990s, their economy has shrunk for more than 10 consecutive years. The unemployment rate is still high and foreigners are seen as competitors who took away their jobs and hence more and more discrimination against foreigners.<br>suntze<br>Junior Member<br><br>Joined: 04 Mar 2005<br>Posts: 53<br><br>Send Message<br>22 April 2005 Â· 04:42 PM Click Here to See the Profile for suntze     Edit Message     Reply with Quote<br>The following is taken off the BBC web site but is not meant to inflame more feelings.

It displayed what people think as a conduct unbecoming of a future superpower.<br>So, round 1 to Japan. Next move.<br><br>Of course it is strategic.

Let's not be too hasty to judge. From a political point of view, the Chinese government could be using protests over a history text to send a subtle message to Japan and the US that it will not condone the emergence of a powerful military rival in the region, especially one closely aligned with Washington.<br><br>Moreover, the Communist party has always embraced nationalism as its favoured means of ideological control.

Bush<br><br>Ah, but the existing superpower is a known factor while China is still unknown. That's why during these periods, countries are scrutinizing and judging China's foreign policies, deciding whether having China as a superpower would be best for the future. This is especially true for the Europeans countries as they are not part of Asia and may not benefit much or could be threatened by Asia's growth. The shift of power from the West to the East may also be uncomfortable to them as they are not as familiar with the culture. They probably prefer India as a superpower as India was a former colony and has retained a Western structure while China's structure is different. Europeans are also critical of China's past and its human rights record.<br><br>The global media is also still mostly controlled by US and Britain.

A lot of Chinese people around the world are closely following the news to see how China is going to engage US and Japan in power play games. And they aren't just getting their news from the Western media. The 22 million signatures obtained around the world for the online petitions against Japan's U.N.
