His postal privatization legislation-that he staked the fate of his government on-did squeak through the Lower House on Tuesday when a large number of Liberal Democratic Party members bucked the party line.<br><br>But there was no sign of excitement at having achieved a major victory nor a deep sense of failure at having fallen short of killing the bills.<br><br>What accounted for this lack of emotion?<br><br>Granted, Koizumi had made postal privatization a pledge to the voters, and he has long argued that privatization was necessary. However, doubts remained whether the issue was one Koizumi and the ruling coalition should be locking horns over.<br><br>Many LDP politicians probably agree with a comment made by Toranosuke Katayama, secretary-general of the LDP Upper House caucus.<br><br>"Privatization is Koizumi's first love," Katayama said. "We are being made to reluctantly go along on his date with it."<br><br>Those with doubts about the policy could do nothing before a prime minister rolling full steam ahead and brandishing the threat of dissolving the Lower House and calling a snap election.<br><br>Having lost the balance in implementing policy, there was no way to revise its course.<br><br>The issue illustrates the limits of Koizumi's political methods, which can only be described as naive.<br><br>While Koizumi repeated his slogan of "moving from the public sector to the private sector," he showed no signs of trying to create a majority through rational arguments.<br><br>Concerns were inadequately addressed about privatization in underpopulated rural areas that depend on post offices.<br><br>The lack of effort in listening carefully to what the people had to say and explaining the policy represents the negative aspect of Koizumi's political style. It resembles his handling of the Yasukuni Shrine issue.<br><br>The opposition within the LDP also cannot be praised.<br><br>They showed false obedience to Koizumi after he won the LDP presidential election while calling for postal privatization.<br><br>While there may have been a few opponents who felt emotional resistance to Koizumi's tactics, others were simply opportunistic. They looked more toward the stance of their support organizations, while others calculated what would be advantageous in the post-Koizumi political world.<br><br>While the postal privatization drama was playing itself out, other important matters were being ignored.<br><br>Japan and China are engaged in a fierce diplomatic battle over whether Japan should become a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council. At a time when Japan's Asian diplomacy is at a critical stage, there is no sign of leadership from Koizumi.<br><br>In Samawah, Iraq, a Self-Defense Force vehicle was damaged by a bomb. And yet, there has been no debate within government or ruling coalition circles.<br><br>Because Koizumi and the LDP have been unable to make any move on a comprehensive revision of the taxation system, scholars in the government Tax Commission proposed higher income taxes for salaried employees. About the only thing the LDP could do was work on damage control.<br><br>The Koizumi administration has begun its downhill slide even as the gap grows wider between the direction being emphasized by the leader and pressing political issues.(IHT/Asahi: July 6,2005)<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sixty years after Hiroshima (Aug 6) and Nagasaki (Aug 9), the Japanese people are still suffering the lies of their politicians.<br><br><img src="http://img262.imageshack.us/img262/3213/abomb5vx.jpg"><br><br><strong>Japanese are forgetting the lessons of Hiroshima, says the man who was Barefoot Gen</strong><br><span class="small">By Colin Joyce in Hiroshima<br>(Filed: 04/08/2005)</span><br><br>For a generation of Japanese, the image of a young boy laughing and crying in Hirsohima's ruins defined war's suffering and warned of the dangers of militarism.<br><br>But the comic artist who created the boy fears that 60 years after the first atom bomb exploded those lessons are being forgotten as its survivors pass into history.<br><br>"At 66, I am one of the youngest of the people who suffered the atom bomb but I may not be here in 10 years' time," said Keiji Nakazawa. "Soon there may be no one left to tell.<br><br>"We can see signs of militarism re-emerging. Politicians are moving to the Right, textbooks are changing and there are people who say we did nothing wrong."<br><br>"... Japan's leaders started the war. There would have been no bomb without that."<br><br>Last week a nationalist took a hammer and chisel to the inscription on the war memorial at Hiroshima reading: "Rest in peace for the mistake will never be repeated". After his arrest he told police he objected to the word "mistake", which refers to Japan's militarism.<br><br>Many fear that the country is distancing itself from a clear acknowledgement of its wartime guilt. This week it toned down its apology on the sixtieth anniversary of the war's end, removing mention of "colonial rule" and "acts of invasion" used 10 years ago.<br><br>Many school textbooks no longer refer to comfort women - Asians forced to become prostitutes for the Japanese Imperial Army. Best-selling history books now attempt to show the past's "bright side", stressing that Japan helped liberate Asia from British and other Western imperialists.<br><br>In Gen's heyday, Hiroshima was a symbol of a commitment to pacifism and utter rejection of nuclear weapons. But Japan is now strengthening its military and discussing amending its constitution, which renounces war forever.<br><br>A small minority even believe they should consider developing their own nuclear deterrent.<br><br>According to Mr Nakazawa, amid the rewriting of history it is the family that should hold on to the truth about what really happened.<br><br>He complained: "Today's parents don't talk to their children about the war."<br><br>Hiroshima's A-Bomb Dome, the building at the epicentre of the explosion left in ruins as a monument, seems to get smaller each year, it is said, a reference not just to the dwindling number of survivors but fading awareness of the past.<br><br>Two years ago, a student set fire to thousands of the Peace Park's hand-folded paper cranes, a memorial to a little girl, Sadako, who died from leukaemia years after the bombing. The student later explained that he had no idea what the cranes symbolised.<br><br><span class="small"><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2005/08/04/whiro04.xml&amp;sSheet=/news/2005/08/04/ixworld.html" rel="nofollow">Telegraph</a>, U.K.</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In an interview with CCTV, MM LKY offered the following view with regards to the Japanese present position taken about their recent history, and the reasons for their present resistance in acknowledging mistakes of the past.<br><br>According to MM LKY, it seems that towards the end of World War 2, the 'main actors' in the top Japanese Political and Military establishments were tried as 'War Criminals' and executed for the War that they started and inflicted across the Far East and South-east Asia.<br><br>MM LKY also suggest that before the entire ranks - from the middle and lower echelons of the Japanese Political and Military heirachy - could be accounted for and tried for the war crimes of WW2,  a new war had broken out on the Korean Peninsula - with the Communist North Koreans invading South Korea.<br><br>USA was then distracted by this new development, which evolved into a direct US conflict with China supporting North Korea, and requiring the political support from the new government of a new Japan after WW2.<br><br>With the distraction, the USA lost its steam in the hunt for the middle and lower echelons of the War Criminals from the Government and Military War Machines.<br><br>MM LKY suggest that these 'War Criminals' - or their children and/or second generation Japanese mentored by these 'War Criminals' - are occupying seats of power in the current Japanese Political establishment; as well as in the Economic Power House of industries, manufacturing, building, and trading.<br><br>It is little wonder that we are seeing the helplessness of the Koizumi's Government in preventing a non-too-subtle move to change the historical records of factual events, which is intended to conceal the shame of wrong doings, and can only bear the hallmarks of a resurgence of Japanese Nationalist Pride.<br><br>This process has started with the push to change the History Books used by Schools at all levels, which glorified the past and denial of atrocities committed.<br><br>It has been followed by the efforts in the Japanese Parliament to change the Constitution to allow the Military to embark on overseas missions - to support 'humanitarian operations' (similar to our SAF Humanitarian Ops, which has provided vast opportunities to exercise and flex our muscles in planning, co-ordinating, and logistical capabilities) .<br><br>A revision to the Japanese Constitution is also being demanded by certain Japanese Right Wing (Nationalist) Political Sections to 'throw out' all the constraints that hamper Japan from building up its own Military in response to the perceived threats from China and North Korea.<br><br>In Europe, most Nazi German soldiers were remembered by name - individually or by military units - for the war crimes committed in WW2, and were hunted down to all corners of the world since the end of WW2.<br><br>Unfortunately, the uneducated and terrified communities in the Far East and South-east Asia could not remember the 'Individual Soldier's name, or the names of the Military Units which released the hordes of Japanese soldiers, who were given total freedom to sack the conquered cities, and the freedom to commit all the atrocious crimes on helpless Civilians - from the Korean Peninsula, across China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Philippines, Indochina (Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia), Thailand, Burma (Myanmar), Malaya, Singapore, Borneo, Indonesia, and New Guinea.<br><br>The Asian Communities affected by WW2, and 'visited by the Japan Imperial Army, should demand the United Nations to start a new investigation into those surviving Japanese 'War Criminals' hiding behind their present positions in the present Japanese Political and Economic Establishments.<br><br>These Criminals should be unmasked by tracing their war time positions held.<br><br>The more difficult tasks is to 're-educate' the post-WW2 generation that is mentored by these 'War Criminals' and now holding high positions in the present Japanese Political and Economic Establishments.<br><br>Hopefully, with the United Nation taking the lead, those peace loving Japanese will be supported, and help prevent a new resurgence of fanaticaly Japanese Nationalism - that will undoubtedly lead to imperialism and foreign military adventures.<br><br></div>

But these 2 is the best saviour bomb that saves millions of lives in Asia especially the chinese and korean. During WWII about 20 millions of Chinese lost its lives during the Japansese invasion and mascared. Bomb is bad but this 2 has serve its purpose truthlly. Japan is the only country had tasted of atomic weapon.<br><br>US were shocked for the devastation and thus help Japan a lots after the WWII to rebuild because not much American were killed by Japanese only lots of warship navies were destroy at Hawaii.<br><br><blockquote>Little Boy and Fat Man<br><br>Little Boy and Fat Man (L to R) were the world's first atomic weapons. Little Boy was the first nuclear weapon used in warfare. It exploded approximately 1,800 feet over Hiroshima, Japan, on the morning of August 6, 1945, with a force equal to 13,000 tons of TNT.  It weighed about 9,000 lbs. Immediate deaths were between 70,000 to 130,000.<br><br>Little Boy was dropped from a B-29 bomber piloted by U.S. Army Air Force Col. Paul W. Tibbets. Tibbets had named the plane Enola Gay after his mother the night before the atomic attack.<br><br>Fat Man was the second nuclear weapon used in warfare. Dropped on Nagasaki, Japan, on August 9, 1945, Fat Man devastated more than two square miles of the city and caused approximately 45,000 immediate deaths.<br><br>Major Charles W. Sweeney piloted the B-29, #77 that dropped Fat Man. After the nuclear mission, #77 was christened Bockscar after its regular Command Pilot, Fred Bock.<br><br>While Little Boy was a uranium gun-type device, Fat Man was a more complicated and powerful plutonium implosion weapon that exploded with a force equal to 20 kilotons of TNT.</blockquote><img src="http://www.wpafb.af.mil/museum/arm/arm42.jpg"><img src="http://www.wpafb.af.mil/museum/arm/arm41.jpg"></div>

The reference was dropped in the final version approved by the government in December. WednesdayÂ’s report acknowledged that even a change in JapanÂ’s defence posture would not reduce its reliance on assistance from the United States, a key ally.<br><br>Â“If Japan became capable of striking strategic bases after reviewing Â‘defence-onlyÂ’, the effect by itself would be small,Â” it said. Â“Therefore, it is needless to say it would be wise to maintain and enhance the current defence policy of depending on the US military (in emergency) without overestimating the effect from reviewing Â‘defence-onlyÂ’.Â” The report also said Japan should keep Â“constant watchÂ” on China as its Â“rapid economic growth has made it possible to expand its air and navy forces.Â”<br><br>It predicted a push at home and abroad for Japan to develop nuclear capabilities if China caught up to the United States in nuclear capacity.<br><br>As the only nation ever attacked with atomic bombs, Japan officially believes that all nuclear weapons should be abolished. afp<br><blockquote>Originally posted by Gun:<br><strong><br><br><span style="color: darkred;">Lies and the revisionist of history.<br>Japanese politians are now upping militaristic tone in the latest report.<br><br>An influential  Japanese think-tank (Japan Forum on International Relations) says in its latest report that "JAPAN needs to reconsider its 'defence-only' policy and become prepared to strike first to ward off an attack from existing and new threats"<br><br>This report was forward to Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi.<br><br>Pls note that this forum consist of leading corporations (Mitsubishi, Sony etc), lawmakers and academics, including </span>[b]<span style="color: red;">prominent conservative thinkers </span></strong> - <span style="color: darkred;">said the country needed to change to cope with the rapid militarisation of <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">old foes</span></strong> China and North Korea and the new threat of terrorism.<br><br>Why is this group referring to victims of Empiral Japanese occupation in WW2 as "Foes" ?<br><br>Japan is now on the verge of remilitarisation.

Similar to the American "Weapons of Mass Destruction" fiasco, all it takes is another Marco Polo Bridge incident to give the Japanese a legitimate "pre-emptive strike" excuse to send troops into China.<br><br>Let us hope that Koizumi would reject the forum proposal.

"The LDP's proposed revision of the constitution demonstrates Japan's new mindset -- encouraging military expansion. This is nerve wracking."<br><br>"MILITARY BULLY"<br><br>The editorial accused Japan of portraying itself as "the only victim of atomic arms", adding: "The depth of Japan's remorse (for World War Two atrocities) is in doubt."<br><br>"Without a guilty conscience, Japan is attempting to turn itself into a regional military bully," the editorial concluded.<br><br>The Japanese white paper, which appears at a time of strained Sino-Japanese ties, echoes a U.S. Defense Department report in July that said China's fast-modernising military could pose a long-term threat to the region.<br><br>Defence Minister Yoshinori Ohno said, however, that Japan did not see China as a military threat.<br><br>The report also stressed Japan's concern about China's passage in March of an anti-secession law authorising the use of "non-peaceful means" to re-unify with Taiwan. Beijing claims sovereignty over the self-ruled democratic island which split with the mainland when the Communists won power there in 1949.<br><br>The Taiwan issue is one of many sore points in the Sino-Japanese relationship. Others include Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi's annual visits to a war shrine in Tokyo and Chinese accusations that Japan is whitewashing its wartime past.<br><br>The China Daily said that recently uncovered archives had shed new light on chilling human experiments carried out by Japan's notorious Unit 731 in China during World War Two.<br><br>At a news conference in the northeastern city of Harbin, Chinese researchers presented Japanese files recording details of 1,463 people secretly transported to Unit 731.<br><br>"This is direct evidence proving Unit 731 conducted biological experiments on live human beings," Jin Chengmin, an expert on Unit 731 at Harbin Academy of Social Sciences, said.<br><br>Unit 731 conducted experiments on humans to develop biological weapons such as bubonic plague, typhoid and cholera.<br><br>(Additional reporting by Vivi Lin)</div>

Ten days later, Chiang Kai-shek (1887-1975), generalissimo of the KMT government, proclaimed that China would not give any more ground to the Japanese.<br><br>On August 3, Beiping, the then name of Beijing, and Tianjin were occupied by Japanese troops. China's armies were thrown into the counterattack to prevent the country being overrun.<br><br>The first pitched battle in this fight back took place in Shanghai, the economic centre of the East.<br><br>On August 13, Chinese troops attacked Japanese positions in the city, despite the fact the Japanese navy had moved from the Yangtze River to an area just off the coast and Japanese land forces were being massively reinforced by troops from Japan and Taiwan, then a colony of Japan. By August 10, Japan had 150,000 soldiers in the area.<br><br>About 50,000 KMT soldiers, or five divisions, under the leadership of general Zhang Zhizhong (1890-1969) on the left and general Zhang Fakui (1896-1980) on the right, were given the task of overcoming the Japanese positions.<br><br>"Unlike previous battles against Japanese armies where local warlords were the major fighting force, this time the central armies with the best weapons in China were put directly into action," said Zeng Jingzhong, a historian at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences' (CASS) Institute of Modern History.<br><br>Chinese troops threw themselves at Japanese defences in a hail of bullets.<br><br>Zhang Fakui recalled in his memoirs: "Chinese soldiers did not have artillery to destroy Japan's defence works. They had to charge again and again, with their fallen bodies providing shelter to later waves."<br><br>After several days of bitter fighting, Chinese soldiers had occupied some Japanese positions but were unable to drive the occupying force into the sea.<br><br>Winning that ground had cost China dearly, with record casualty figures filtering to the rear. Strafing, bombing and constant bombardment from Japanese warships anchored offshore meant there was no respite for Chinese troops.<br><br>"More than two thirds of my 15,000 soldiers died within the initial stages of the battle for Shanghai," recalled general Sun Yuanliang (1904 - ), commander of the 36th Division.<br><br>While the battle raged into the latter half of August, both countries continued to reinforce their positions. By early September, the number of Chinese soldiers in Shanghai and nearby regions surpassed 500,000, while Japanese troop strength stood at nearly 300,000. Before long, China had committed three quarters of a million troops to the area.<br><br>Many historians have tried to answer why commanders of the central armies chose Shanghai as the place to make a stand.<br><br>Wang Jiadian, a Nanjing-based historian, put forward a reason in his paper on the KMT's strategy in the early stages of the war. He explained that after Beiping and Tianjin were occupied, there was a dire need to attract major Japanese forces to battlefields away from important railway lines.<br><br>Otherwise, the Japanese, equipped with trucks, tanks, planes and cavalry, could use the railway network and roads of North China to move down into Central China, occupy Wuhan, the heart of China, and cut the country in two.<br><br>It was therefore natural to choose Shanghai, near the then capital Nanjing, and where the best equipped Chinese armies were situated, as the place to fight, Wang said.<br><br>Another goal was to pressure international powers whose interests were concentrated in Shanghai and other cities in China's rich East to intervene, according to Yu Zidao, a historian at Shanghai-based Fudan University.<br><br>But Chinese troops, with no prepared positions, had only collapsed houses, trees and the bodies of dead soldiers for shelter against Japanese bombing and the dense fire from their machine guns. Heavy casualties were inevitable.<br><br>Zeng from the CASS said that without the bloody battles in Shanghai, Japanese forces would have strolled into Nanjing along the Yangtze River.<br><br>He added that the Shanghai Defence Battle held another significance to give heart to Chinese people across the country and stiffen their resolve against the Japanese.<br><br>In his letter to US President Roosevelt, US captain Evans Carlson, who was Roosevelt's special envoy to Shanghai, wrote that he had never seen the Chinese so united and so brave in his 10 years in the country.<br><br>In mid September, Chinese forces were thrown onto the back foot and became defenders.<br><br>General Feng Yuxiang (1882-194<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">, chief commander of the Third War Zone covering Shanghai and nearby regions, said in his memoirs: "The whole Shanghai battlefield was like a big furnace, melting down division after division of our soldiers. Sometimes a division of 10,000 lost half its strength in just three hours."<br><br>Senior officers also perished in the battle for Shanghai, including generals Wu Keren (1894-1937), Cai Bingyan (1902-37), Pang Hanzhen (1899-1937), and Wu Jiguang (1903-1937).<br><br>On November 5, Chinese troops were forced to withdraw from the city after suffering 300,000 casualties. On November 12, Shanghai was occupied by the Japanese. They had suffered 60,000 casualties.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Wuhan Campaign<br><br>Although the Chinese fought bravely, they could not compete with the Japanese bombers, artillery and tanks. Nanjing was next to be occupied by the Japanese on December 12, after which the invaders immediately set about massacring 300,000 Chinese civilians and prisoners of war.<br><br>While the fight for Shanghai raged, Japanese troops in North China moved into Shanxi Province where KMT forces and CPC troops came together to hold off the invaders. On September 25, 1937, CPC forces ambushed a Japanese supply column in Pingxingguan, northeastern Shanxi, killing more than 1,000 Japanese.<br><br>But Japanese units overcame the Chinese defence line at the end of October and Shanxi's capital Taiyuan was occupied on November 12, 1937. The commander of the Ninth Army, general Hao Mengling (1898-1937), lost his life in the battle.<br><br>After the fall of Nanjing, Chinese troops won a partial victory in Tai'erzhuang, to the north of Jiangsu Province's Xuzhou, when more than 10,000 besieged Japanese troops were wiped out. But the Chinese forces were pushed back by strong Japanese counterattacks.<br><br>After Nanjing, the Japanese targeted Central China's Wuhan. In the Wuhan Campaign, which was launched in May 1938, 1.1 million Chinese troops were concentrated to defend the city from 400,000 Japanese invaders, whose weapons were far more sophisticated.<br><br>But having learnt from the failures in Shanghai, Taiyuan, Nanjing and Xuzhou, the Chinese forces adopted the principle of mobile war, which meant soldiers would not wait in their trenches for Japanese attacks.<br><br>In a speech made in February 1938, Chiang stressed Chinese resistance should be focused on using the vastness of the country to sap Japan's limited forces and resources.<br><br>On June 11, the Chinese destroyed a levee on the Yellow River in Henan Province, turning 50,000 square kilometres of land in Central China into marsh.<br><br>Eight hundred thousand Chinese civilians died because of the flooding, but Japanese tanks and trucks were stopped. They were forced to alter their attack from eastern China westwards along the Yangtze River.<br><br>And it was along the Yangtze that general Xue Yue (1896-199<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> ordered his troops to build defences, predominantly in the mountainous areas of northern Jiangxi Province. With the help of their new mountain defences, Xue's forces held off the attacks of general Yasuji Okamura (1886-1966) for several months.<br><br>Bogged down, Okamura sent a division round the Chinese positions to hasten the advance to Wuhan.<br><br>But Xue second-guessed Okamura. Without orders from Chiang in Wuhan, Xue moved 100,000 Chinese troops to besiege the 20,000-strong Japanese army in Wanjialing, Jiangxi Province. On October 9, Chinese troops launched their final assault, annihilating nearly all the besieged Japanese forces. It was China's biggest victory in the war to that point.<br><br>The weak Chinese air force and navy also did their duty with bravery. Unable to stand against the superior Japanese warships, the Chinese navy scuttled their own vessels in the Yangtze River to disrupt shipping lanes.<br><br>By the end of October, however, most positions outside Wuhan had been lost to Japan. On October 24, Chinese forces began to withdraw. During the six-month campaign, China had lost hundreds of thousands of troops, but compared with previous battles, no single division was wiped out.<br><br>In addition, most of the industry in Wuhan and other major cities in Central China was successfully transported to Sichuan and Yunnan provinces, enabling the Chinese economy to sustain the country in the seven remaining years of the war, said Zeng.<br><br>Between the Shanghai battle and the end of the Wuhan Campaign, China's armies had shattered the Japanese dream of conquering China in three months, at a cost of more than a million soldiers.<br><br>"After the Wuhan Campaign, Japanese troops became so exhausted that they could not launch massive attacks to conquer China's hinterland. This enabled guerrillas most led by the CPC to fight in the rear of occupied areas. The blood of Chinese soldiers and generals eventually led to China's great victory over Japan in 1945," Zeng said.<br><br>(Source: China Daily)</div>

Racked with malaria, he would lock himself away for days. They're not happy memories but, Elliott says, "I thought that was how all fathers were."<br><br>Fred Howe finally won some serenity, although his poor health lasted forever. His wife, Elsie, doted on him and cared for him tirelessly. He scarcely talked about the war, although Di knew he had fought the Japanese - Elsie allowed nothing "made in Japan" in the house.<br><br>About 45 years after the end of World War II, with Elliott in her 40s, her sister Pauline found 27 newspaper articles written by their father in 1948. Di Elliott learnt, for a start, that marks on his arms were his torturers' cigarette burns. She began a long search for more information. Next Monday, the 60th anniversary of the end of the war, she will tell her story - and her father's - at a commemoration at Kanchanaburi cemetery in Thailand.<br><br>Advertisement<br>AdvertisementHowe was part of the desperate fighting retreat down the Malay peninsula in January 1942 when he survived the Battle of Muar, during which his 2/19th Battalion was almost annihilated by the vastly superior Japanese force.<br><br>He became a prisoner of war on the Burma-Thailand railway. At Nakhon Pathom camp, his life was saved by a mate's blood donation. He was too ill to be taken to Japan, fortunately, because only 86 prisoners of the 1200 Australians and Americans on the Rakuyo Maru survived a US torpedo.<br><br>Elliott says: "Husbands and sons returned home traumatised and in poor health. They survived imprisonment but, without the support of their womenfolk, many may not have survived freedom."<br><br>Howe died in 1975, well before Elliott knew his story. "I am enormously proud of him," she says. "I just wish I had the opportunity to tell him so."<br><br>As much as she might like to forgive, she keeps the Japanese at arm's length. "I understand what happens in battle but I despise some of the acts they carried out. You can't hold it against the young but I felt real bitterness in Singapore once when an old Japanese man was pointing at various places. I knew, 'You were here then!"<br><br>"THE stupid neither forgive nor forget; the naive forgive and forget; the wise forgive but do not forget." So wrote Thomas Szasz, a psychiatrist, philosopher and Hungarian refugee from Nazism. But the question of forgiveness is not so simple.<br><br>It sometimes seems that humankind is more proficient at war than peace. Although World War II took six years, some who suffered have yet to find real peace. As long as they cannot, forgiveness is hard. Some have no intention of forgiving; some say their God might forgive but they never can. All say they will never forget.<br><br>Rowley Richards couldn't forgive Japan's high command but has no bitterness towards the people: "The only person who suffers from bitterness is the person who harbours it. It's not so much a question of forgiveness as of understanding. We should try to understand different cultures and their history."<br><br>Richards, whose book, A Doctor's War, was published recently, was one of 42 Australian doctor-prisoners on the Burma railway. Each night he had to "play God", trying to save lives by juggling which men could work. He knew that those sent out to work might not return.<br><br>Yet he made good friends among the Japanese. Some guards were kind. Civilians helped him with food. After the war he sent food packages to Japan and keeps in touch with Japanese friends.<br><br>He points to history to help the understanding he urges: Germans have fought with and against the French and Italians over the years; Australians fought on the same side as the Japanese in World War I and a Japanese cruiser escorted Australians to Gallipoli.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br><br>Other historical points are worth considering. At the end of World War I, the Japanese argued for a racial equality clause in the peace treaty with Germany. Prime minister Billy Hughes, defending White Australia, attacked the proposal, which was lost. Some US scientists who worked on the atom project argued against using the bomb on people. It could be dropped on an uninhabited island to reveal its power.<br><br>Yet the Japan-Australia trade agreement, a foundation of Australia's postwar economic success, was signed as early as 1957. And now, because the Japanese are not permitted to engage in combat under their pacifist constitution, Australian soldiers protect Japanese defence force engineers in Iraq.<br><br>Arch Taylor, who was with Lark Force when Rabaul was taken, helped gather the remains of 150 of his comrades who were tied up and massacred on the Toll estate. "I saw terrible atrocities," he says, "like an officer with his heart cut out."<br><br>Working with the R.W. Miller company after the war, he sold coal to the Japanese. "By God we made them pay for it. I ended up quite friendly with clients but I can't forgive them as a nation and we must never forget."<br><br>While some saw new beginnings through trade, others sought spiritual reconciliation. Padre Lionel Marsden, who preached to prisoners on the "death railway", set up a Marist mission in Japan in 1949. Father Tony Glynn joined him, taking food and clothing and returning samurai swords. He became the only foreign honorary citizen of Nara and died there in 1994. His brother, Paul, worked there for 21 years and says: "If you can forgive, you are freed."<br><br>Alan Dunstone, of Sparrow Force, helped rescue 1500 emaciated prisoners facing execution in Kuching in 1945. Dunstone, the actress Bec Cartwright's grandfather, says: "I will never forget but I tend to forgive."<br><br>Ray Brown was stabbed 22 times and left for dead before spending 3Â½ years as a prisoner. He went to Japan in 1967 to try to understand the Japanese. Now 86, he can't forgive what they did to his mates and welcomes VP Day because he believes prisoners would have been killed if not for the bomb. But he says: "It's stupid to hate. It takes so much out of you."<br><br>George McGrath's mates were decapitated on Ambon. He was one of only 64 survivors of the 332 men and women on the hospital ship, Centaur, and is the last survivor of the 2/12th Field Ambulance on the ship. The sinking defied international war conventions. McGrath, 88 and genial, still prays for lost friends. "It was bloody murder. But they got punished in the end. I'm moving towards forgiveness."<br><br>IN 1945, the Japanese high command ordered that no prisoners survive the war. With Allied forces nearing Sandakan, the Japanese ordered surviving prisoners to march 265 kilometres to Ranau. Of 2434 Australian and British prisoners incarcerated in Sandakan in 1945, only six survived. A total of 1787 Australians and 641 British perished in the camp, along the track or at Ranau. The last were executed on August 27, 12 days after the war ended.<br><br>For Maureen Devereaux, August 15 is an unhappy anniversary. Her big brother, John Barnier, died at Sandakan. "He was my hero," she says.<br><br>She has all the many letters he wrote and the camphorwood box from Malaya. By December 1941 he had received 60 letters from home and pleaded that no more socks be sent. His musket, he said, was well-oiled.<br><br>Devereaux clearly remembers VP Day. She was in Grafton High School's debating and basketball teams that played Coffs Harbour High. "There was so much joy, hope and excitement," she says. "People were saying, 'John will be home soon'. We waited and waited, sitting round the wireless listening for news. I'm so happy for those who came home but I don't forgive the Japanese, although John had such a deep Christian faith he might want me to forgive."<br><br>AS A BOY in Cowra Don Kibbler was taught to hate the Japanese. Marukeni Takahara was navigator and rear-gunner in a Japanese flying boat shot down off Darwin in February 15, 1942. Takahara spent most of the war as a prisoner in Cowra. He was wounded in the Cowra breakout, in which 247 Japanese and four Australians died.<br><br>Now Kibbler and Takahara are friends. Kibbler helped Japanese businessmen after the war and is responsible for Cowra's splendid Japanese gardens. "An old Australian soldier told me that they'd cut heads off dead Japanese, boiled them and sold the skulls to Americans," he says.</div>

The closed-door dialogue was co-chaired by Dai and Zoellick.[Xinhua]<br><br>The first ever high-level strategic dialogue between the world's largest developing and developed countries has attracted extensive interest in the wider international community.<br><br>Many are wondering if the first-ever strategic dialogue will be able to resolve past confrontations, and what influence the talks will have on bilateral and international relations.<br><br>At any time, talking through areas of friction is certainly the best course for two countries to take when their interests and concerns are intertwined.<br><br>The holding of the first round of the strategic dialogue demonstrates that Beijing and Washington still have a lot of room to develop the communication channel.<br>Compared to other exchange or dialogue channels that exist between China and the United States, the recently concluded strategic dialogue is less developed.<br><br>Currently there are two kinds of irregular exchange between the two countries. One is the exchange of visits by high-level government officials and even top leaders.<br><br>Chinese President Hu Jintao and US President George W. Bush are expected to hold six meetings this year. The foreign ministers of the two nations are also due to hold talks, and there will be a number of meetings of ministry and committee representatives.<br><br>The other exchange channel is the establishment of a high-level hotline.<br><br>The hotline linking the heads of the two countries and direct telephone contact between foreign ministers have served as very important channels for communication.<br><br>At the same time, there are at least four regular communication mechanisms between China and the United States.<br><br>Beijing and Washington set up a human rights dialogue mechanism in 1990. A joint commercial and trading committee, chaired by Chinese Vice-Premier Wu Yi, was established as early as in 1983. The committee decided one regular meeting should be held every year.<br><br>The two countries set up a defence affairs consultation mechanism at the vice-ministerial level, which calls for two meetings per year.<br><br>China's National People's Congress (NPC) , the country's top legislature, and the US Senate have decided to set up a panel with two gatherings every year.<br><br>Compared to both regular and irregular dialogue mechanisms, the current strategic dialogue is conducted at a relatively low level.<br><br>The United States has also established a strategic dialogue mechanism with Japan, the Republic of Korea and other allies.<br>Take the two plus two (2+2) talks held early this year between Washington and Tokyo. The two countries' defence and foreign ministers participated.<br><br>Compared to the 2+2 talks, the strategic dialogue between the China and the United States is obviously at a lower level.<br><br>Though dialogue level is not the only criterion with which its importance is gauged, it is necessary for the two countries to improve their dialogue level if they are to achieve a breakthrough in strategic affairs.<br><br>Given the fragility of Sino-US political relations, regular dialogue mechanisms between the two countries are in danger of being broken off if any major conflict or controversy occurs.<br><br>According to an accord reached by China and the United States, the human rights consultation mechanism should hold two meetings every year. However, only 13 meetings had been held in the 12 years following its establishment.<br><br>The joint commercial and tradecommittee should have held 23 meetings by this year. However, the 16th meeting was convened in Beijing not long ago.<br><br>According to an agreement, China's NPC and the US Senate should hold two meetings every year, but so far only seven rounds have been convened.<br><br>Beijing and Washington set up an annual defence affairs consultation mechanism at vice-ministerial level in 1997. But the bombing of the Chinese Embassy in the former Yugoslavia by US-led NATO put the brakes on the exchange, which only resumed in December 2002.<br><br>China and the United States share common views about the direction in which the strategic dialogue should be steered.<br><br>Comments made by China's foreign ministry spokesman and by Zoellick in Hong Kong demonstrate that the Sino-US strategic dialogue will surpass concrete affairs and aim to deepen mutual understanding, enhance trust and expand co-operation.<br>As two influential countries, China and the United States have clearly realized the importance of enhancing trust and eliminating suspicion.<br><br>Mutual distrust and misgivings are caused by a string of complicated factors, such as differences in political systems, cultural divergence, and inevitable competition and a lack of trust between an emerging power and the only superpower.<br><br>The easing of these conflicts depends on a change in international structure and the deepening of all kinds of exchanges between the two countries. High-level dialogue on a regular basis will effectively help share information and prevent costly strategic misjudgements.<br><br>The strategic dialogue between China and the United States is a good starting point. It will be beneficial for stabilizing bilateral constructive and co-operative relations. Still, the dialogue can be more strategic if it is held at a higher level.<br><br>With the increasing deepening of Sino-US relations, the strategic dialogue between the two countries is expected to enter a crucial stage in the future.</div>

Security Council backed by Brazil, Germany, India and Japan, China's U.N. ambassador said.<br>Wang Guangya said he reached the agreement with John Bolton during a meeting Tuesday, which was the new U.S. ambassador's first full day in his new post, because both believe the proposal by the so-called Group of Four would divide the U.N.'s 191 member states.<br><br>Washington and Beijing are already on record as opposing the G-4 resolution for different reasons, but the agreement would mark a new joint effort to prevent its approval by the U.N. General Assembly, which requires a two-thirds "yes" vote.<br><br>Wang said the ultimate objective of China and the United States is to expand the Security Council with a formula that is not divisive.<br><br>"But at this stage, I think our objective will be to oppose the G-4, to make sure they do not have sufficient votes to take the risk to divide the house," he said Wednesday.<br><br>"We agreed to work together to make sure that our interests are being maintained - which means that we have to work in parallel ways to see that the unity of the U.N. members, the unity of every regional group, will not be spoiled because of this maneuver and process," Wang said.<br><br>But he said Washington and Beijing will be working in parallel in the coming weeks to block the resolution - not together - because "we have different friends in different parts of the world."<br><br>After 10 years of seemingly endless debate, Secretary-General Kofi Annan told U.N. member states in March that he wanted a decision on Security Council expansion before a summit of world leaders in September. But the issue remains highly contentious, and no proposal on the table at the moment that can win the required two-thirds support.<br><br>The U.S.-China effort to defeat the Group of Four comes on the eve of Thursday's emergency summit called by the African Union to consider whether to approve a compromise agreement which some of its ministers reached with Brazil, Germany, India and Japan in London on July 25. Algeria and Egypt contend there is no agreement, and the 53 African nations are known to be divided.<br><br>But Japan said if a compromise resolution is agreed on at the summit in the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, the Group of Four is likely to put it to a vote.<br><br>The Security Council currently has 15 members, 10 elected for two-year terms and five permanent members - the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France.<br><br>Brazil, Germany, India and Japan have introduced a resolution calling for a 25-member council that would add six permanent seats without a veto and four nonpermanent seats. They are hoping to win four of the permanent seats with the other two earmarked for Africa. South Africa, Nigeria and Egypt are the leading African contenders.<br><br>Source: The New Anatolian, 7 August 2005<br><br>Copyright Â© 2005     Journal of Turkish Weekly</div>

She keeps his uniform at her home. The ash from his last cigarette, his hair and fingernail clippings are stored in a small box. In her heart she holds 60 years of accumulated anger.<br><br>Her grandfather, Hideki Tojo, was Japan's prime minister in World War II and ordered the attack on Pearl Harbour. Arrested after Japan's surrender, he was put on trial for war crimes by the Allies and executed.<br><br>Yuko Tojo, 66, insists that her grandfather was not a villain, but a hero. The greatest battle of her own life has been over his soul. The calls for his and 13 other Class-A criminals' souls to be banished from Japan's most controversial war memorial, the Yasukuni Shrine, to a new one is being advanced as one way to make visits there by Japanese political leaders acceptable to China and South Korea, who suffered at the hands of Japan during wartime and colonial occupations.<br><br>Advertisement<br>AdvertisementTojo is appalled. In her version of history, Japan was defending itself, there were no war crimes, the war was unfair, Japan was the victim and her grandfather was a martyr who died protecting Emperor Hirohito. "There is not enough pride in Japan," she says. "In his last letter my grandfather said that his family must never apologise or make excuses for him. If we do, all that he did to protect the emperor will have been for nothing and he will have died in vain."<br><br>"Gutless," is the word she reserves for Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi and other business and political leaders who do not stand up to critics, particularly China and South Korea.<br><br>She may never get over the day in June when Emperor Akihito, son of the wartime ruler, paid homage at war memorials including one for 10,000 Korean dead during a visit to the Pacific island of Saipan. What irks her the most is that he has never paid his respects at the Yasukuni Shrine.<br><br>Tojo says that the Emperor is being prevailed on by the Government to stay away from the shrine because of political sensitivities. She claims that he wrote a poem in the 1980s alluding to his disappointment about it. For her part, she goes to the Yasukuni Shrine about 10 times a year.<br><br>Incredibly, she says that when she visits she prays for everyone else memorialised there but not her grandfather, whose spirit she honours at the family plot elsewhere.<br><br>She does not trust recent public opinion surveys showing that most people no longer support the Yasukuni Shrine visits by Japan's prime minister. She puts the results down to "survey magic", as though they are somehow rigged.<br><br>Nonetheless, she knows first hand how hard it is to motivate ordinary people. It is, after all, 60 years after the end of an inglorious war defeat and the great mass of people are now more interested in economic recovery than upsetting China, a crucial trading partner.<br><br>She takes a sidelong glance at the young people around her, eating extravagant pieces of cream cake with strawberries and listening to the jazz soundtrack that is playing. "No, they are not really interested," she says with a crusading "not yet anyway" look on her face.<br><br>Though she denies being a political activist, Tojo organises and leads expeditions to old battlefields where she searches for the remains of dead Japanese soldiers and repatriates them. She is indefatigable, organising young people to go with her and always available for speaking visits to clubs and youth groups. For inspiration, she often lays out for her audience the relics of her grandfather's life.<br><br>Last year, during an expedition to Palau in the Pacific, she recovered the remains of 110 fallen soldiers and brought them back to Japan. She will go again in a few months looking for more. Her grandfather, she thinks, would be proud.</div>

No mention, however, was made of the fascist Japanese War Lords, like Hideki Tojo, who had launched wars of aggression against Asian/Pacific states, beginning in 1931, and with the U.S., in 1941. TojoÂ’s granddaughter recently said, Â“Japan didnÂ’t fight wars of aggression.Â” Ignoring the evils of the War Lords plays into the hands of the Revisionists.<br><br>Some of the ways in which the August, 1945 A-bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki by the U.S. were recalled recently grossly distorted history and were very one-sided. They leave the WWII's Japanese War Lords, and war criminals, like Hideki Tojo, off the hook for their horrific crimes against humanity, which included the killing of millions of peoples, especially in China. Also, over 200,000 women in the territories occupied by Japan: China, Korea and other Asian/Pacific states, were turned into sexual slaves (Â“comfort womenÂ”) to serve the officers of the Japanese Imperial Army. [1] Although Tojo, with others, was put on trial for his war crimes after WWII and executed for his evil deeds, [2] his granddaughter recently insisted that he was a scapegoat and that Â“Japan didnÂ’t fight wars of aggression.Â” [3]<br><br>The Baltimore Sun reporting on Aug. 9, 2005, about the Nagasaki Â‘RemembranceÂ’ ceremony, said the mayor of that city, Â“criticized U.S. nuclear policy...Â” However, the Nagasaki mayor didnÂ’t say one single word about how Japanese fascists were responsible for launching WWII. So, what are the people of his city to think? Probably, that America was the aggressor in the conflict and that Japan was just an innocent victim! IÂ’m afraid the new generation growing up in Japan isnÂ’t being told the entire truth about WWII, nor, as well, are their counterparts in the U.S. How then, are they ever to learn the lessons of the history of that critical period?<br><br>The fanatical Japanese War Lords, who were political cronies of the equally fanatical Nazis, are the ones who started the conflict with the U.S. by their preemptive attack on Pearl Harbor. (Haven't we heard that word "preemptive" a lot lately?) The War Lords, with their Imperial Army, are the ones who also rampaged through China, Korea, Manchuria, Singapore, the Philippines, and other countries in the Asia/Pacific region, beginning in 1931, and up until 1945. (1) They left in their bloodstained wake massive destruction, death, misery and mayhem. In December, 1937, the Japanese Imperial Army occupied the city of Nanking, in China. Within a period of three months, it had slaughtered roughly 350,000 Chinese and raped an estimated 20,000 women. According to the author of the expose', "The Rape of Nanking," the victims: men, women and children were Â“killed with bayonets, swords, even bamboo sticks. Their bodies [were] sexually mutilated.Â” [4]<br><br>Unfortunately, the frame of reference that is used surrounding events remembering the dropping of the A-bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki contain little or no context like the above. ItÂ’s all about the Americans dropping the A-bombs and the Japanese victims. Period! Case closed! The vicious Japanese thugs who began a campaign of naked aggression against their neighboring countries as early as 1931, (and deliberately, without any warning, attacked Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941, with hopes of landing a knockout punch on the U.S.), and, who are ultimately responsible for all the carnage that followed, including the inexcusable maltreatment of POWs, aren't even mentioned! Can you image someone letting Adolf Hitler's murderous Nazi gang get off that easily for its massive crimes against humanity during WWII?<br><br>Biological warfare was also on the agenda of these scheming Japanese fascists. From 1932 to 1945, Imperial Japan was developing germ warfare for its military. This notorious project centered mostly in northern China, became known as Â“Unit 731.Â” Thousands of Chinese men, women and children, Koreans, and POWs, too, including some Americans, were infested with strains of anthrax, bubonic plague, cholera and other diseases. In all, an estimated 580,000 victims died. The scientist, who ran the operation, Dr. Shiro Ishii, incredibly, escaped prosecution for his wrongdoings. [5] Does anyone doubt that these dangerous biological chemicals would have, if possible, been used on American cities by these demented War Lords?<br><br>Few Americans of my generation will ever forget the stories about the Â“Bataan Death MarchÂ” of April 9th-15th, 1942. [6] On those dates, surrendering American and Filipino POWs, 70,000 of them, were forced to march by their Japanese captors, 65 miles in searing heat to a prison camp, located at Camp OÂ’Donnell. Bataan is a peninsula found in the Luzon providence of the Philippines. With little or no water or food, almost 10,000 perished along the way. Some were left out in the sun to die, others were beheaded for falling behind or killed for just no reason at all. No mercy was shown the desperate POWs by the Japanese. After the war, the Japanese monster in charge of that ghastly operation, General Masharu Homma, was convicted of War Crimes and executed on April 3, 1946, outside of Manila.<br><br>And, then there is also that shocking, never-to-be-forgotten photo of the badly-emaciated General Jonathan Wainwright. He was the highest ranking American POW of the so-called Â“Japanese Empire.Â” Wainwright, and the troops under his command, gallantly defended the island of Corregidor fortress in the Philippines until required to surrender on May 6, 1942, to the overwhelming Japanese forces. He then spent the next three years as a POW, barely kept alive by his captors, until the prison camp that he was confined in, on Manchuria, was liberated by the Russian Army. [7]<br><br>One of the worst Japanese atrocities occurred late in the war. On Dec. 17, 1944, the Japanese guards at the Palwawan camp (Philippines) herded 150 American POWs into three covered trenches. The trenches were then set on fire and as the POWs tried to escape the blaze, they were shot and killed. Only 11 of the 150 POWs were able to survive that massacre. [8]<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>One sad consequence of this censoring of history is that the American heroes of WWII in the Pacific, the hundreds of thousands who fought and died fighting against the Japanese Imperialists, remain mostly unsung. Many of them, men, and women, too, came out of the working class and off the farms of our nation. I also believe that the innocent peoples of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, in 1945, could have been saved from destruction, if those same fanatical Japanese War Lords, the ones who also condoned burying people alive; men, women and children in China, would have done the right thing and surrendered to the Allied Forces, when they knew that their cause was hopeless. If they weren't fanatics, than why didn't they surrender after Hiroshima? Why did they force the U.S. drop a second bomb? The devastating human toll of those two A-bombings should primarily be attributed to the unbridled fanaticism of the fascist Japanese War Lords. They brought the world the evils of Japanese Imperialism-Racism and Militarism. [9]<br><br>Finally, I say: Stop turning a blind eye to the barbaric crimes of the fascist Japanese War Lords. It will only favor a revisionist revival in Japan.

But to their mission's critics, the crews that dropped the atomic bombs on Japan were part of a war crime.<br>Three men involved in the attack on Hiroshima shared with the BBC their memories of a day that has stayed with them for 60 years.<br>Theodore "Dutch" Van Kirk - Navigator<br>Morris "Dick" Jepson - Weapons test officer<br>Dr Harold Agnew - Scientist, on observation plane<br>________________________________________<br>Theodore "Dutch" Van Kirk, 84<br>The day before the mission we sat through briefings on Tinian island where they told us who was assigned to which plane, and we ran through what we were going to do.<br><br>Mr Van Kirk (left) has never doubted the bomb's morality<br>About 2pm we were told to get some sleep. But I don't know how they expected to tell us were we dropping the first atomic bomb on Japan and then expect us to sleep.<br>I didn't get a wink. Nor did most of the others. But at 10pm we had to get up again because we were flying at 2.45am.<br>They briefed us that the weather was good, but they were sending weather observation planes up so we would have the best information on targeting Hiroshima.<br>We had a final breakfast and then went down to the plane shortly after midnight.<br><br>There was a great jolt on the aircraft and we were thrown off the floor. Someone called out 'flak' but of course it was the shockwave from the bomb<br><br>Dutch Van Kirk<br><br>Crew's joint statement<br><br>There was a lot of picture-taking and interviewing going on - by the military - and it was a relief to get in the Enola Gay about an hour before we took off.<br>We flew in low over Iwo Jima while the bomb crew checked and armed Little Boy (the uranium bomb) and once we cleared the island we began climbing to our bombing altitude of just over 30,000 feet.<br>It was perfectly clear and I was just doing all the things I'd always done as a navigator - plotting our course, getting fixes to make sure we were on course and reading the drifts so we knew the wind speed.<br>As we flew over an inland sea I could make out the city of Hiroshima from miles away - my first thought was 'That's the target, now let's bomb the damn thing'.<br>But it was quiet in the sky. I'd flown 58 missions over Europe and Africa - and I said to one of the boys that if we'd sat in the sky for so long over there we'd have been blown out of the air.<br>Once we verified the target, I went in the back and just sat down. The next thing I felt was 94,000lbs of bomb leaving the aircraft - there was a huge surge and we immediately banked into a right hand turn and lost about 2,000 feet.<br>We'd been told that if we were eight miles away when the thing went off, we'd probably be ok - so we wanted to put as much distance as possible between us and the blast.<br>All of us - except the pilot - were wearing dark goggles, but we still saw a flash - a bit like a camera bulb going off in the plane.<br>There was a great jolt on the aircraft and we were thrown off the floor. Someone called out 'flak' but of course it was the shockwave from the bomb.<br><br>Within a minute of the blast a white cloud had reached 42,000ft<br>The tail-gunner later said he saw it coming towards us - a bit like the haze you see over a car park on a hot day, but moving forwards a great speed.<br>We turned to look back at Hiroshima and already there was a huge white cloud reaching up more than 42,000 feet. At the base you could see nothing but thick black dust and debris - it looked like a pot of hot oil down there.<br>We were pleased that the bomb had exploded as planned and later we got to talking about what it meant for the war.<br>We concluded that it would be over - that not even the most obstinate, uncaring leaders could refuse to surrender after this.<br>In the weeks afterwards, I actually flew back to Japan with some US scientists and some Japanese from their atomic programme.<br>We flew low over Hiroshima but could not land anywhere and eventually landed at Nagasaki.<br>We didn't hide the fact that we were American and many people turned their faces away from us. But where we stayed we were made very welcome and I think people were glad that the war had ended.<br><br>Click here to return<br>Morris "Dick" Jepson, 83<br>I was a young second lieutenant in the US Air Force and was designated as the weapons test officer on the Enola Gay.<br><br>For Dick Jepson, the Enola Gay flight was his first combat mission<br>The bomb was designed to detonate when it was about 1,500 feet - or about one-and-a-half seconds - above the ground to ensure the maximum possible destructive range.<br>To that end it contained a range of radar-designated electronics.<br>In the run-up to the mission I had spent five months at Harvard and three months at MIT studying radar design.<br>For several months I worked on developing the electronics that would allow the bomb to detonate above the ground, flying test missions over southern California.<br>The Manhattan Project [to build the atomic bomb] was compartmentalised so the thousands of people working on it could not know the full details of the plan, but I was in no doubt I was training for an atomic bomb drop.<br>On the day of the mission, I had to perform some final tests on the electronics that operated the bomb.<br><br>Everyone's thoughts turned to what devastation there would have been down below - we all had that thought on our mind because we had seen what the bomb could do<br><br>Morris "Dick" Jepson<br>There was a box in the plane's forward compartment that connected to the bomb via a cable system.<br>My final job was to climb down into the bomb bay, crawl around the bomb and manually arm the device. I took out three testing plugs that isolated the bomb and put in three red firing plugs.<br>The most important thought in my mind was that this would detonate and end the war.<br>Unlike the others, this was the only combat mission I had been on, but there was only one point when I was apprehensive.<br>I knew how long it took for the bomb to fall and detonate - 43 seconds - so I counted but nothing happened. I just thought this was devastating.<br>But in the excitement I had counted too fast. That second, the crew reported a huge flash and it had gone off.<br>A few seconds later I felt the first blast wave.<br>There was a second shockwave and I knew by the delay that it had detonated at the right height - and this second wave was the force of the bomb bouncing back off the ground.<br>Everyone's thoughts turned to what devastation there would have been down below - we all had that thought on our mind because we had seen what the bomb could do.<br>But it was the right thing to do.<br><br>Click here to return<br>Dr Harold Agnew, 85<br>I had come from working on the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos and my abiding memory is of it being a very exciting time, working with all the best scientific minds of the day.<br><br>Dr Harold Agnew, with the plutonium core of the Nagasaki bomb<br>I describe myself as a 'grunt' at that time, I did what I was told to do. But I was part of a great undertaking.<br>For the Hiroshima mission I was on board The Great Artiste, a second B-29 that had tailed the Enola Gay to the bombing zone.<br>We'd flown alongside them all the way up there and were about four or five miles off to one side of Hiroshima, dropping gauges with parachutes that would measure the yield of the bomb.<br>After we dropped our gauges I remember we made a sharp turn to the right so that we would not get caught in the blast - but we still got badly shaken up by it.<br>I don't think anyone realised exactly what would happen. It was the only uranium bomb to be dropped.<br>My honest feeling at the time was that they deserved it, and as far as I am concerned that is still how I feel today.<br>People never look back to what led up to it - Pearl Harbour, Nanking - and there are no innocent civilians in war, everyone is doing something, contributing to the war effort, building bombs.<br>What we did saved a lot of lives in the long run and I am proud to have been part of it.<br>After the war I returned to the University of Chicago to continue my studies and later rejoined Los Alamos, where I eventually became director of the laboratory.<br>About three-quarters of the US nuclear arsenal was designed under my tutelage at Los Alamos. That is my legacy.</div>
