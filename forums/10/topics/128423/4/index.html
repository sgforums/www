Japan's alliance with America lies in tatters. Chinese and Indian criminal gangs run amok.<br><br>But Murakami's main villains are a group of North Korean commandos. On the opening day of the baseball season, they storm the Fukuoka Dome stadium on the southern Japanese island of Kyushu. As incompetent Japanese politicians fail to act, more North Korean troops arrive, sealing Kyushu off from the rest of Japan.<br><br>In Japan these days, bad guys just don't come any more sinister than North Koreans.<br><br>Despite the recent war of words between Japan and China, it is North Korea and its unpredictable leader, Kim Jong Il, that remain enemy No. 1 in the eyes of the Japanese public. Pyongyang achieved that notoriety with the 1998 launch of a long-range ballistic missile that crossed Japan's airspace, and cemented it with the admission 2 1/2 years ago that it had abducted more than a dozen Japanese citizens to train its spies in Japanese language and customs.<br><br>There is deep unease here about the prospect of North Korea testing a nuclear weapon. Although North Korea's main antagonist may be Washington, Japan is a far closer target.<br><br>"In the Japanese mind, North Korea is the devil," said Yasuhiko Yoshida, a North Korea specialist at Osaka University of Economics and Law.<br><br>That enmity has been a catalyst for pulling Japan out of its postwar pacifist shell, and has spurred Tokyo to take an increasingly hard line on national security issues.<br><br>Amid this loathing for North Korea, Japan's alliance with Washington is seen, more than ever, as indispensable, and its public accepts such moves by Tokyo as sending troops to Iraq and joining the planned U.S. antiballistic missile defense shield.<br><br>Yet opinions diverge in Japan on whether North Korea or China poses the gravest threat to national security. While the media and public remain obsessively focused on North Korea, some Japanese politicians, bureaucrats and military leaders may be using fear of Pyongyang's erratic behavior as a cover to prepare for what they see as Japan's sharpest long-term security problem: a rising China.<br><br>"There is clearly concern about North Korea's missile capability, but in the longer run there is a much greater fear among professionals about what China will become," said Robert Dujarric, a northeast Asia specialist for the Washington-based Hudson Institute who is based in Tokyo. "Japanese officials are reluctant to talk publicly about the China threat, whereas it is politically correct to talk about the threat from North Korea."<br><br>But Japanese leaders' enthusiasm for joining the U.S. missile shield would not be nearly as acute if there were no sense of an ultimately bigger threat posed by China. The North Koreans may be frustrating to deal with, but most officials in Japan believe a diplomatic solution to Kim's nuclear weapons program will eventually be reached.<br><br>The real need for a defensive shield, in Tokyo's eyes, is for protection against Chinese nuclear missiles. Yet at least until last month's anti-Japanese riots in several Chinese cities, the Japanese public had given little thought to the possibility of a clash with their colossal rival.<br><br>Until China's recent spate of Japan bashing, the Japanese public thought of China as little more than a good investment opportunity or a fresh tourist destination. Even Japan's right-wing extremists have directed most of their venom at North Korea and, to a lesser degree, South Korea, rather than at China.<br><br>So the Japanese public was mostly baffled by the flag-burning and window-smashing at Japanese consulates and businesses in China.<br><br>"People are generally indifferent about China, and they were completely shocked to discover that the Chinese hated them so much," said Masaru Tamamoto, a senior fellow at the Japan Institute of International Affairs in Tokyo. By comparison, every hiccup out of North Korea sustains anti-Kim sentiment in Japan.<br><br>No issue has driven that animosity more than the kidnapping during the Cold War of at least a dozen civilians. Five of the abductees have been released. Pyongyang says the rest are dead Â— a claim few in Japan believe.<br><br>It requires no stretch of the Japanese imagination to accept that a regime willing to kidnap Japanese teenagers from the streets of their hometowns would also be willing to launch a nuclear attack. And a breakdown of old social and financial networks among ethnic Koreans living in Japan has virtually wiped out any voices that might defend Kim's regime here. Pyongyang's natural allies in the communist and socialist parties have been marginalized, while hard times in the Korean-controlled pachinko gambling business have dried up much of the money that pro-Pyongyang groups once directed to sympathetic Japanese politicians.<br><br>Furthermore, ethnic Koreans in Japan were appalled by the abduction revelations, weakening the hold Kim's supporters wielded over the community.<br><br>The near-universal loathing of Kim's regime explains the allure to a Japanese novelist of a plot that casts North Koreans in the villain's cloak.<br><br>"Japan is a hierarchical society that wants hierarchies in everything, even foreign relations," Tamamoto explained. "But because of our history, we haven't been allowed to look down on anyone.<br><br>"Except North Korea," he said. "That's the one country, because it is so demonstrably crazy, that Japan is permitted to look down on."</div>

KRISTOF<br><br>KYOTO, Japan -- When they invaded Korea 400 years ago, Japanese samurai warriors brought back priceless porcelain, ingenious metal type for printing and noses and ears hacked off the corpses of tens of thousands of Koreans.<br><br>In one of the world's more macabre war memorials, a 30-foot-high hillock here in the ancient Japanese capital marks where the noses and ears were buried. The 400th anniversary of this Mimizuka, or Ear Mound, will be commemorated in September, underscoring the tensions and hostilities that still set the countries of East Asia against each other.<br><br>Few Japanese outside Kyoto know of the Ear Mound, but almost all Koreans do. In Japan, even among those who have heard of it, the Ear Mound is largely seen as a bizarre relic of little relevance today. To many Koreans, it is a symbol of a Japanese brutishness that still lurks beneath the surface waiting to explode.<br><br>"Frankly speaking, I think there is a risk" of Japan some day again attacking its neighbors, said Ryu Gu Che, an ethnic Korean in Kyoto, and he suggests that the best way of reducing the risk would be for Japan to acknowledge and repent the savagery symbolized by the Ear Mound.<br><br>"So although 400 years have passed," he said, "I think both peoples should study this episode and learn some lessons."<br><br>Ryu, who is organizing the anniversary ceremony, says that the lesson that Japan should learn is to show greater remorse. The lesson for Korea, he said, is to avoid corruption and weakness that could tempt foreign invaders.<br><br>Although the major countries of East Asia, ranging from Vietnam through China to Korea and Japan, share a common cultural heritage to a considerable extent, deep antagonisms linger. A major reason for these antagonisms is not just competing interests today but also divergent memories of the past.<br><br>In Asia, history hangs over the present and constantly threatens to destabilize the future. The most sensitive memories are of World War II, but the Ear Mound underscores how some incidents continue to fester long after the people who were tortured or killed have turned to dust.<br><br>Americans also mutilated corpses, of course, with European settlers scalping Indians and vice versa, but those atrocities do not have the same political or social resonance today that such episodes do in East Asia.<br><br>The Ear Mound dates from Japan's plans to conquer China and divide it among Japanese lords. Korea was in the way, so Japan assembled some 200,000 troops in 1592 and launched an invasion, setting off a war that lasted six years and by some accounts killed more than one million Koreans -- close to one-third of the country's population at that time.<br><br>The samurai in those days often cut off the heads of people they had killed as proof that their deeds matched their stories, but it was impossible to bring back so many heads by boat to Japan. So the samurai preserved the noses and sometimes the ears of those whom they killed, soldiers and civilians alike.<br><br>Most of the noses were cut off corpses, but some Koreans reportedly were not killed and survived for many years without noses or ears.<br><br>The Japanese troops brought back barrels that may have contained the noses or ears of 100,000 Koreans, scholars say, but these numbers are unreliable. Korean estimates are sometimes tainted by the partiality of the researchers, and the subject has not attracted extensive Japanese scholarship, partial or impartial.<br><br>Japan's rulers displayed the noses and ears to Japanese subjects, apparently as a warning not to challenge the authorities, and then buried them and dedicated the Ear Mound on Sept. 28, 1597. Organizers of the ceremony on the 400th anniversary say that it will include Japanese and Koreans alike -- Buddhist priests as well as Christian pastors -- and will aim to appease the spirits of those who were killed and mutilated.<br><br>"Our purpose is not rooted in hatred," Ryu said. "Rather, the point is to learn the lessons of history."<br><br>"Ethnic conflict and hostility is not unique to this area," he added. "We've seen it in Bosnia and elsewhere. It's universal, and we know it's difficult to erase. But this is a step forward."<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"><br>Continued below</div>

KRISTOF<br><br>Some 700,000 Koreans live in Japan, mostly descendants of forced laborers brought here early in this century, and it often galls them that Japan does not show more remorse for the occupation of Korea from 1905 to 1945 or for the use of Korean girls as sex slaves during the war.<br><br>In Korea itself, anger at Japan still rumbles beneath the surface and a visit to a historic site is usually accompanied by a guide's angry comments about looting that occurred as far back as the 16th century.<br><br>On the other hand, some Japanese argue that Koreans and Chinese have vastly exaggerated the scale of the suffering and that in any case atrocities are simply an unfortunate part of any war.<br><br>"One cannot say that cutting off ears or noses was so atrocious by the standard of the time," read a plaque that stood in front of the Ear Mound in the 1960s. That was taken down, but it still angers Koreans that Toyotomi Hideyoshi, the Japanese leader who organized the invasion, is treated in Japan as a national hero because of his actions within Japan.<br><br>Over the last decade Japanese school textbooks have made enormous strides in recounting the brutality of the period honestly. Fifteen years ago, not a single textbook referred to the Ear Mound, but it is common in this year's textbooks, and so eventually this bit of history may become much better known in Japan.<br><br>"Now about half of all high-school history textbooks mention the Ear Mound," said Shigeo Shimoyama, an official of Jikkyo, a publishing company that in the mid-1980s became the first textbook company in Japan to include a reference to the mound.<br><br>Shimoyama said that at that time the Education Ministry objected to the reference as "too vivid" and forced the publisher to tone it down and also give Hideyoshi credit for piously dedicating the Ear Mound so as to enshrine the spirits of the dead.<br><br>"That is such a uniquely deceptive Japanese logic to say that 'we enshrined the spirits after killing these people,' " fumed Kum Byong Dong, a lecturer at a North Korea-affiliated university in Japan and the author of a book on the Ear Mound. "The officials at the Education Ministry think the same way as Hideyoshi's people did 400 years ago."<br><br>Koreans react to the Ear Mound in different ways.<br><br>When Park Chung-hee was dictator of South Korea in the 1970s, some of his officials urged that the Ear Mound be leveled because it was shameful for Koreans. Other Koreans have suggested that the mound be relocated to Korea to appease the spirits of the dead. But most say that the mound should stay in Japan as a reminder of past savagery, and in any case Japan treats the Ear Mound as a national landmark and would be unwilling to return it.<br><br>The Ear Mound is not mentioned in most guidebooks, and it attracts few Japanese or foreign tourists. But children in the Hiroshima public schools, who are particularly sensitive to war because of the atomic bombing there, are regularly bused to Kyoto to see the mound and ponder the suffering that Japan has inflicted on its neighbors.<br><br>Although the Ear Mound in Kyoto is the best known, there are similar ones -- mostly much smaller -- around the country, particularly in the south. Those also date from the Korean invasion and were apparently established by feudal lords who also sent troops to Korea.<br><br>Just a few years ago, scholars learned of the "Thousand Nose Mound" -- which some local people had known of all along -- near Bizen in western Japan. It apparently is also made up of the noses and ears of Koreans from the invasion 400 years ago, and it was recently rebuilt and rededicated to the spirits of the dead Koreans with contributions from 600 local Japanese residents.<br><br>The money the Japanese government allocates to maintain the Ear Mound in Kyoto is insufficient and so several Japanese and Korean volunteers cut the grass and clean up the mound as well.<br><br>"As a Japanese, I feel badly for what we did to the Korean people, and so I try to do something to make up for it," said Shiro Shimizu, 83, a volunteer who lives next to the Ear Mound.<br><br>"The lesson for today is that we should respect human life," Shimizu added. "In times of peace, this would never have happened. So I hope we will always be able to maintain peace."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The following is an interesting viewpoint from an Australian ex-diplomat.<br><br><blockquote>Shedding imposed war guilt<br><br>By GREGORY CLARK<br><br>Tokyo is right to blame the Chinese authorities for failing to prevent damage to Japanese diplomatic and other properties during recent anti-Japanese demonstrations. But the Chinese authorities probably had their reasons. Demonstrations in China can easily turn into ugly antigovernment riots when confronted by state power.<br>The Tiananmen "massacre" was a good example. The alleged killings of thousands of prodemocracy students in Beijing's Tiananmen Square on June 4, 1989, in fact, as declassified U.S. Embassy documents show, comprised the heavy casualties caused on June 3 when angry rioters, including students, clashed with troops sent to remove the Tiananmen students. One of the Western punishments imposed on Beijing for this nonmassacre of students was a ban on the sale of riot-control equipment.<br><br>Ironically, one reason why the Chinese police may have failed to crack down on the anti-Japan rioters could have been the lack of such equipment.<br><br>That said, Tokyo is not without fault either. It seems quite insensitive to the damage caused by its anti-China moves and slights. These include everything from very one-sided views of three territorial disputes and tacit promises to cooperate with the United States in military action against China over Taiwan, to homage at Yasukuni Shrine and refusals to admit to the sickening catalog of Japanese atrocities against China before 1945. South Korea is beginning to suffer the same treatment, and is reacting with even greater official vigor.<br><br>Claims that Japan has apologized for past aggressions are meaningless. If Japan was really repentant, it would have done something to punish or at least ostracize those responsible for the worst atrocities -- the notorious Unit 731, for example, with its germ warfare and vivisection experiments on live Chinese prisoners. Then we would not have to tolerate the obstinate efforts to deny Japan's wartime military abuse of abducted sex slave "comfort women."<br><br>The apology claims are even more meaningless given Japan's tatemae and honne propensity to say one thing and mean something quite different. A good recent example of this is the way Tokyo today blandly insists that the junior high-school textbook revisions that have angered South Korea and China so much were made by publishers, when it is obvious to everyone that they were imposed by the education ministry, often against the publishers' will.<br><br>Why is Tokyo so obstinate and unfeeling, to the point of being willing even to push South Korea into a growing alliance with China, and to leave itself isolated in Northeast Asia? Similar clumsiness in the territorial dispute with Russia leaves it even more isolated (see The Japan Times article, March 24, "Northern Territories dispute highlights flawed diplomacy" for details). Even allowing for the emotionalism and ad hoc manner in which Japan conducts much of its diplomacy, it is hard to believe that Tokyo wants deliberately to antagonize its neighbors. Some other factor must be involved, and I suggest that deep down it goes back to Japan's largely unstated view of itself as a victim of obstinacy and insensitivity from others.<br><br>In the catalog of Western postwar myths and mistakes toward Asia -- that China attacked India in 1962, that the Vietnam War was sponsored by Beijing, that there was a Tiananmen "massacre" -- high on the list has to be the naive view that the West had no responsibility for Japan's 1930-40s' push into Asia and its 1941 Pearl Harbor attack.<br><br>As many Japanese see it, both were the inevitable result of Western pressures. For centuries the Western powers had been pushing their colonial expansions closer to Japan. But the same powers objected when Japan set out to gain its own colonies nearby, in Taiwan, Korea and Manchuria. Japan's late 1930s' push into China is condemned outright in the West. But many conservative Japanese see it as provoked by Western inspired anti-Japan boycotts and incidents in China going back to the early 1930s.<br><br>Racist anti-Japanese policies in the U.S. and Australia during the 1930s rankled deeply. Then came the U.S.-imposed 1941 embargo on exports of needed fuel and raw materials to Japan -- a declaration of economic war if ever there was one. The final insults were the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki followed by the flawed Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal passing arbitrary judgments on alleged Japanese war criminals.<br><br>Nor is there much remorse over Japan's wartime atrocities. Rationalizations are many -- that they were deliberately exaggerated by anti-Japan elements in Asia, that the Chinese killed each other even more barbarously, that the West committed similar atrocities or, to paraphrase the memorable words about Iraq by U.S. Defense Secretary, Donald Rumsfeld: "Stuff happens."<br><br>Resentment over these and other details has been bubbling along for decades in the ultra-rightwing juku (indoctrination schools), conservative lecture halls and the pages of the now powerful rightwing media. It underlies the recent strong rightwing shifts in Japanese attitudes. Tokyo's policymakers seem to feel deeply the need for Japan to shake off the burden of unfairly imposed war guilt and to reassert itself, even if it is misunderstood by others.<br><br>One who has said so publicly is leading Liberal Democratic Party conservative and former MITI (industry and trade) minister Takeo Hiranuma. He calls for Japan to renounce Article 11 of its San Francisco peace treaty with the allied powers, under which Japan promised to accept the war-crimes verdicts. He sees this as an answer to the Yasukuni problem and a key to Japan regaining self-pride.<br><br>But there is one puzzle in all this: Why don't Japan's conservatives and rightwingers take out their postwar resentments more on the West, the U.S. especially, rather than on Asian neighbors? Some do, such as Tokyo Gov. Shintaro Ishihara; they are as much anti-America as they are anti-China. The ultraright is violently anti-American.<br><br>But most on the right wing also see U.S. help as crucial to the ultimate goal of confronting China once again, beginning with Taiwan. As some point out, failure to get that help before 1941 led to Pearl Harbor and Japan's ultimate wartime defeat.<br><br>Critics like to compare Tokyo's attitudes unfavorably with Germany's sincere post-1945 efforts to atone for war guilt. But the analogy is flawed. It should be with Germany after World War I, not Germany after World War II.<br><br>Exaggerated efforts by the Allied Powers to impose war guilt and punishments on post-1918 Germany had one ugly result. His name was Adolf Hitler.<br><br>Gregory Clark is a former Australian diplomat and vice president of Akita International University.

Both of them saw themselves as victims during the wars! With the rise of nationalism, Adolf Hitler led the German into WW2. We now see the rise of nationalism in Japan. According to Stockholm International Peace Research institute, Japan's military expenditure in 2004 was around 42.4 billion US$, rank only after USA, UK and France, and is the highest in Asia.

            <div class='col-md body'>France and Belgium did occupy the Ruhr region in the 1923 when Germany fell behind in war reparations. However, that invasion galvanised the German population and give rise to the Nazi party under Adolf Hitler.<br><br>China and Korea are particularly concerned about Japan remilitarising and flexing its muscles over disputed territorial waters. Japan has the financial and technological capability to be a military superpower should it decide to do so. Imo, although there is rising nationalism in Japan, there is sufficient domestic safeguards and international linkages to prevent Japan from remilitarising  and posing any serious military threat to its neighbours.<br><br>On the other hand Japan, Taiwan, US and perhaps some others in SE Asia, are concerned about a rising China that may eventually dictate to its smaller neighbours. The factors that will restrain China in pursuing such a course are its domestic institutions and international linkages. Given that by the time China attains sufficient financial and technological capabilities (that is probably a matter of time), the international linkages of global markets and cultural and diplomatic ties are likely to be in place.<br><br>The question will be whether China's domestic political and social institutions will be sufficiently matured to prevent China from its version of hegemony using its new superpower status.<br><br></div>

In comparison, US spends 3% and China spends 1.6% (unofficially, perhaps more) of their GDP on defence (Spore spends nearly 6% of GDP on defence).

(AP) Sixty years after World War II, Chinese-American activists are helping organize a growing international movement that seeks to hold Japan accountable for atrocities committed by Japanese soldiers as they occupied other parts of Asia during the war.<br>The bitter feud over Japan's invasion of China made headlines in April when violent demonstrations erupted throughout China to protest Tokyo's approval of textbooks that critics say gloss over its military aggression.<br><br>But for more than a decade in the United States, Chinese immigrants have waged a grassroots campaign seeking an official apology for Japan's occupation of China, Korea and other parts of Asia, where Japanese troops are accused of killing millions of civilians and forcing women into sexual slavery.<br><br>The Chinese government estimates that 35 million people died in China alone as a result of Japan's occupation from 1931 to 1945, when the military routinely used biological and chemical weapons against Chinese citizens.<br><br>"Everybody knows about the Holocaust in the West, but nobody knows there was a tragic event that happened in Asia at five times the scale during that war," said Ignatius Ding, 62, a Taiwan-born engineer whose grandfather was a founding member of the Chinese Nationalist Party, or Kuomingtang. "That's why we refer to it as the forgotten Holocaust."<br><br>The Japanese war crimes redress movement has been gaining momentum in recent years, and Chinese-American activists see their biggest opportunity this year as Japan attempts to join an expanded United Nations Security Council.<br><br>The activists, part of the Global Alliance for Preserving the History of World War II in Asia, helped organize an online petition which seeks to block Japan's U.N. bid that the alliance says was signed by more than 40 million people worldwide.<br><br>As U.N. member countries debate the Security Council's expansion, activists plan to buy media ads this summer opposing Japan's bid unless Tokyo formally apologizes. They're also calling for boycotting the products of Japanese companies that made artillery for wartime Japan.<br><br>Like their counterparts in China, the Chinese-Americans claim Tokyo has suppressed or distorted the history of Japan's invasion of its neighbors, so that most Japanese citizens, especially young people, know little about the country's violent past.<br><br>"We want a formal apology so that everyone knows the history and truth of World War II," said Stanford University law student Kevin Han. "We don't want that history destroyed by the Japanese government."<br><br>Japanese officials have made public apologies for their country's wartime occupation of its neighbors. Most recently, Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, speaking to Asian leaders at the Asian-Africa summit in Indonesia in April, expressed "deep remorse and heartfelt apology" for Japan's colonial rule and aggression.<br><br>"Japan's leaders have apologized on various occasions so far," said Yuka Ejima, a spokeswoman for the Japanese Embassy in Washington, D.C. "It's nonsense to say that Japan hasn't apologized to the Asian people."<br><br>But activists call those apologies superficial, pointing to continued visits by Japanese leaders to Yasukuni Shrine, which honors Japan's 2.5 million war dead and 14 Class-A war criminals.<br><br>Instead, they want a strongly worded government apology backed by the Diet. The Global Alliance, made up of some 40 groups, also wants compensation for victims, Japanese textbooks that acknowledge more fully the brutality of the occupation, and laws that punish Japanese citizens who deny or distort Japan's wartime past.<br><br>"Preserving the truth is very important. This is the only way for healing to take place between the Japanese and Chinese people," said Betty Huang, who chairs the Global Alliance. "If they don't officially apologize to the Chinese people, Japanese officials will repeat the wrong history again."<br><br>Here in Silicon Valley, the grassroots movement started in 1991, when a group of Chinese Americans held a memorial and panel discussion on the 1937-38 massacre in Nanjing, the former Chinese capital.<br><br>The city was then known as Nanking, and China says Japanese troops slaughtered as many as 300,000 people in the Rape of Nanking.<br><br>"We got a bunch of seniors to show up and they packed the place. We were shocked. We thought people got over things like this," said Ding, who lives in Cupertino. "At the end, they said, 'You people have to do something about this because the war ended without full closure because Japan never really admitted anything.' "<br><br>Ding and other Chinese community activists, including children of Nationalist Party officials who fled China after the communist takeover, formed the Alliance for the Preservation of Truth of the Sino-Japanese War.<br><br>They organized memorials and demonstrations, linked up with similar advocacy groups around the world and formed the Global Alliance, advancing their cause through public education, legislation and litigation.<br><br>Seeing graphic photos of torture and killing at one of the group's events inspired Chinese-American writer Iris Chang to write her 1997 best seller "The Rape of Nanking," which helped galvanize the wartime redress movement.<br><br>In 1999, the California Assembly passed a resolution calling on Japan to compensate victims, and Gov. Gray Davis signed a law -- later overturned -- to allow lawsuits against companies allegedly involved in Japanese war crimes.<br><br>Their advocacy also helped lead in 2000 to then-President Bill Clinton's order to declassify government records on Japanese war crimes. And this year, they encouraged the California Senate to pass legislation to require schools to teach the history of the war in Asia.<br><br>The activists have helped file lawsuits in Japan and the United States seeking class-action compensation for the "comfort women," who were forced into sexual slavery and for prisoners of war forced to perform slave labor for Japanese companies.<br><br>None of the suits has yet succeeded, but activists feel like their campaign is gaining momentum.<br><br>"When we first started, the Japanese government didn't pay any attention to us. We were totally insignificant," said Cathy Tsang, one of the movement's organizers. "Now they're starting to pay attention."<br><br>The Japan Times: June 16, 2005<br>(C) All rights reserved</div>

The question regarding Security Council reform has become complicated and the prospect of reform is not so clear.<br><br>In 1945 when the United Nations (UN) was founded, it decided to set up the Security Council and the "five permanent members" system, designed to exercise effective management over international peace, security and stability through the Security Council and such a strong and efficient institution as the "five permanent members" system.<br><br>Today, reform made to the Security Council should be more conducive to an effective management of international peace, security and stability, and to the promotion of a sound development of the UN, rather than regarding the Security Council reform and obtainment of the qualifications for "being permanent members" as awards to certain countries for their "international contributions", still less as the "aims" for certain countries to enhance their international positions, and even to satisfy the big countries' ambitions.<br><br>The attempt to influence the process and orientation of the Security Council reform under the excuse of so-called "international contributions", and to make up for one's own "international contribution" at the expense of the process of UN reform not only is not serious, but also is irresponsible to the UN reform and the international community.<br><br>As an ancient Chinese saying goes, "Haste makes slow going; more haste, less speed". The UN and Security Council reform bears on the well-being of the world's six billion people, so the reform must be carried out in a safe and cautious manner and must proceed in a planned and systematic way.<br><br>Reform must be in conformity with the democratic principle and in keeping with the interests and aspirations of the majority member states, especially of the vast numbers of developing countries with insufficient representation in the Security Council, as well as with the principle of regional balance. The practice of certain countries which "canvass votes" by providing economic aid as the bait obviously does not accord with the democratic principle and the principle of international fairness and justice, and may possibly lead the UN and Security Council reform astray, and thus hamper the sound development of the UN and the Security Council.<br><br>Reform should be conducive to promoting international harmony and the creation of an atmosphere of common stability, and conducive to boosting the cooperative spirit of UN member states, rather than leading to endless quarrel and even to the break-up of the UN. To achieve this, time is needed to listen to the full and free expressions of wishes made by various parties concerned, especially by the vast number of developing countries; time is needed for wide-ranging consultations, for bridging differences among various parties and for seeking consensus. Any coercion imposed on the UN and other member states by using "strength" and "contribution" by the "snack" method of setting a time limit and hastily making decisions is unhelpful to ironing out differences and defusing contradictions.<br><br>The strong rebound of the "Unity in Seeking Consensus" group upon the "G4" formula has especially proved that consensus reached through wide-ranging consultations is not only necessary, but also is imminent. The parties concerned should make further careful consideration to avoid making hasty decisions.<br><br>In regard to operation, the Security Council reform must help enhance the efficiency of the Security Council in promoting international peace, security and stability. The UN and the Security Council's "five permanent members" system were born through a lesson learned at the cost of blood from World War II. At the end of World War II, people still had lingering fear of the outbreak of a new world war, demanding that big countries bear irreplaceable responsibility for international peace and security, the Security Council and the "five permanent members" system emerged as the times required. But this does not mean that any country, once possessing the economic strength of a big country, can "draw a dipper with a gourd as model" and must also "become a permanent member".<br><br>"Becoming a permanent member" is not only an honor, it is all the more a kind of international responsibility. When condition is not ripe, if the "five permanent members" mechanism is willfully expanded or if the scope of the veto power is enlarged, the result will not only possibly lower the Security Council's efficiency, but also will become a new source of instability due to the strong international rebound.<br><br>Carried on the front page of People's Daily Overseas Edition, June 9, the article is translated by People's Daily Online</div>

Other factors should be weighed as well, including the size and population of the country, its military capacity and its potential to contribute to UN peacekeeping operations.<br><br>Other elements, he said, are adherence to democracy and human rights principles, financial contribution to the world body, and a candidate's record on counter-terrorism and non-proliferation.<br><br>"The debate so far has largely been predicated by geographics," Burns said, saying the United States wants a wider discussion on the matter, including reforms on the budget, administration and management of the world body.<br><br>"We will introduce early next week at the General Assembly a proposal laying out the criteria for eligibility for both permanent or non-permanent membership in the Security Council," Burns said.<br><br>"This is a new American idea," he said.

UN reform needs broad consensus through consultations, he said.<br><br>Italy supports a proposal advocated by some countries that favours an enlargement of the Security Council from 15 to 25 members, with all the 10 new seats being non-permanent ones.<br><br>Fini said the 10 new non-permanent seats could be allocated to the world's five regions, each with the right to choose its own representatives.<br><br>The principle of regional balance and equal rights of participation of member states must be upheld in UN reform, he said.<br><br>Italy supports substantial and comprehensive reform of the United Nations, said Fini. But the reform must provide equal chance for each and every member state to compete for a seat on the Security Council.<br><br>One of the goals of the UN reform is to facilitate the participation of small- and medium-sized countries and developing countries at the Security Council, said Fini. The region-decides-on-its-own-seats proposal serves this purpose, said Fini.<br><br>Fini, who also serves as Italy's deputy prime minister, said the UN summit scheduled for September will provide an important opportunity for member states to discuss UN reform and help achieve the goal of improving the efficiency, trustworthiness and legitimacy of the United Nations.<br><br>On the future role of the UN, Fini said that under the UN Charter, the Security Council should safeguard world peace and security.

True, this could prove there is something wrong with all of Japan's neighbors. But it could also prove that there is something wrong in the way Japan handles territorial problems with its neighbors. There is no clearer example of this than the dispute with Russia.<br>Russian President Vladimir Putin says he is willing to visit Tokyo this year to negotiate a much delayed peace treaty with Japan on the basis of the Japan-Soviet Joint Declaration of Oct. 19, 1956, which promises the return to Japan of the Habomai islets and Shikotan (islands at the southern end of the Kuril archipelago that were occupied by Soviet forces in 1945). But Tokyo says Putin is not welcome unless he promises also to return the two much bigger islands of Etorofu and Kunashiri nearby.<br><br>Why should Tokyo today want seriously to amend an agreement it signed and ratified almost 50 years ago? The story begins with Japan's 1951 San Francisco Peace Treaty with the Allied Powers. Article 2(c) of the treaty said unequivocally that Japan would renounce all rights, title and claim to the Kuril islands chain (Chishima Retto) and southern Sakhalin (Karafuto) -- territories to the north of Japan that Japan had controlled up till 1945. But Japan's Foreign Ministry insists that Japan never recognized Etorofu and Kunashiri to be included in those renounced Kuril islands.<br><br>This Foreign Ministry claim simply is not true. Japanese materials at the time -- Foreign Ministry maps, statements by former Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida at San Francisco and in his later memoirs, and newspaper reports all make it clear that Etorofu and Kunashiri were most definitely included.<br><br>The chief U.S. negotiator for the San Francisco treaty, Secretary of State John Foster Dulles, agreed. Asked at San Francisco to define the territory of the Kurils, he said only that the Habomais might be excluded (at the time there were suggestions that Shikotan might be part of the Kurils).<br><br>More was to follow. Questioned in the Diet on Oct. 19, 1951, over whether the word "Kurils" as used in the treaty included Etorofu and Kunashiri, the head of the Foreign Ministry Treaties Bureau, Kumao Nishimura, said unambiguously that both the northern Chishima and southern Chishima (Etorofu and Kunashiri) were included.<br><br>So why the insistence now that Japan has every right to demand not just the Habomais and Shikotan but also Etorofu and Kunashiri? More background is needed, and fortunately we do not have to rely on the heavily slanted Foreign Ministry material. We have a remarkably detailed but little-known 227 page book titled "Moscow ni Kakeru Niji" (Rainbow over Moscow -- The Secret Record of Restoring Japan-Soviet Relations, Asahi Shimbunsha, 1966) by Shunichi Matsumoto, a former diplomat and mainstream conservative politician who represented Japan in most of the 15 months of complex negotiations leading to the 1956 joint declaration.<br><br>Matsumoto says that when he began the talks in London in June 1955 his brief was simply to demand the return of the Habomais and Shikotan on the grounds that before 1945 the two territories had administratively been part of Hokkaido rather than the Kurils.<br><br>The Soviet side rejected this demand, saying both territories were included in the Kurils promised to Moscow at Yalta in February 1945 as a condition for Moscow entering the war against Japan (in Russia, the two territories were called the Lesser Kurils).<br><br>But at the 10th meeting on Aug. 9 and coinciding with Soviet moves for detente at the Big Four meeting in Geneva that year, the Soviet side suddenly made a turnabout and said Moscow would consider returning the Habomais and Shikotan if Japan promised that its military alliance with the United States was not directed at any third nation.<br><br>Matsumoto duly reported this major breakthrough to Tokyo, only to receive new Foreign Ministry instructions on Aug. 27. This time he was told to demand not just the Habomais and Shikotan but also the unconditional return of Kunashiri and Etorofu as well.<br><br>Matsumoto was astounded by this extraordinary shift in position. He blames conservatives in the Foreign Ministry, and in particular ultraconservative Foreign Minister Mamoru Shigemitsu, for seeking deliberately to sabotage efforts by then-Prime Minister Ichiro Hatoyama for better relations with Moscow.<br><br>He also notes how the shift in position coincided with a meeting in Washington between Shigemitsu and the bitterly anticommunist Dulles, who, he says, also wanted to block any territorial solution with Japan. (Released State Department documents confirm that Dulles as early as January 1955 was urging pressure on Shigemitsu to prevent a settlement on the territorial dispute.)<br><br>Moscow predictably rejected the belated Etorofu-Kunashiri claim and the talks spluttered out, only to be revived by Shigemitsu himself, accompanied by Matsumoto, arriving in Moscow in July 29, 1956, for further talks, and creating yet another extraordinary volte-face also conveniently ignored by the Foreign Ministry materials.<br><br>Shigemitsu had begun with a strident demand for all four territories -- the Habomais, Shikotan, Etorofu and Kunashiri (what Japan was beginning to call its "Northern Territories." ) But in the face of blunt Soviet rejections and explanations, he suddenly about faced and on Aug. 12 declared that he would sign a peace treaty on Soviet conditions, i.e., he would accept the Habomais and Shikotan, and drop the demand for Etorofu and Kunashiri.<br><br>Problem over? Not quite.<br><br>Shigemitsu was immediately summoned to London for talks on the 1956 Suez Canal crisis and on Aug. 19 met Dulles again. According to Matsumoto, an ashen-faced Shigemitsu returned from the meeting saying, "Dulles has said something completely terrible (mattaku hidoi). He said if Japan lets the Soviet Union keep Etorofu and Kunashiri the U.S. will make Okinawa its own territory."<br><br>Dulles' threat worked. Shigemitsu returned to Tokyo and the talks could only be revived by Hatoyama himself visiting Moscow a month later. Once again there was impasse over territory claims, but both sides agreed on a Joint Declaration to restore diplomatic relations and to hold further talks on a peace treaty, with the promise of the Habomais and Shikotan to be returned if and when the treaty was signed. Despite strong Japanese pressures, there was no mention of continued talks about territory.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"><br>continued next post</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>True, there are reasons why Tokyo has found itself caught up in this mishmash of contradictions. From the start, many Japanese conservatives, including Shigeru Yoshida, were not happy about the territorial renunciations at San Francisco. They insisted that history proved how Japan had gained control of the Kurils peacefully. Some even insisted that southern Sakhalin (Karafuto), taken from czarist Russia after the Russo-Japanese war of 1904-5, was also gained "peacefully." In particular, they were very unhappy about having to renounce all rights to the southern Kuril islands of Etorofu and Kunashiri, arguing that this "traditional territory" had never been controlled by Russia.<br><br>But having been forced at San Francisco formally to renounce all these territories, all the conservatives could do by way of a comeback was to note that there was no mention of to whom these territories had been renounced. They called for an international conference to decide the question, and hoped that somehow in the process Japan could regain not just the Habomais and Shikotan, but also some other renounced territories -- Etorofu and Kunashiri in particular. Part of Matsumoto's original 1955 brief had been to demand such a conference.<br><br>But the unexpected Soviet offer of the Habomais and Shikotan in August 1955 threw this strategy into disarray. So Foreign Ministry conservatives had to move quickly to stake out the claim to the Etorofu and Kunashiri territories they had wanted all along. In the process they were forced suddenly to insist that Japan had never renounced its rights to Etorofu and Kunashiri, despite a mountain of evidence to the contrary.<br><br>The twists and turns do not end there.<br><br>Etorofu and Kunashiri are always called Minami (southern) Chishima in Japanese. And since the Japanese version of the San Francisco treaty says Japan renounced all rights to Chishima Retto, it stands to reason that it had also renounced Minami Chishima.<br><br>To get round this rather incriminating detail, the Foreign Ministry had to begin to emphasize how the English version of the San Francisco treaty uses the word Kuril Islands. This, it insists, can refer only to the Northern Kurils. Why? Because that was the alleged meaning of the Russian word "Kuril" in 19th-century treaties with Japan. This, despite the fact that at San Francisco, Minami Chishima was always translated by the Japanese side as "Southern Kurils."<br><br>The Matsumoto book spots the first sign of the Chishima/Kuril vocabulary change in Aug. 30, 1955. Soon after, in October, Tokyo officially sought the U.S., British and French view of this change. Only Washington offered a glimpse of support by suggesting reference to the International Court of Justice -- a move that Tokyo has pointedly declined to endorse. The British, whose Tokyo embassy had in now-released documents described the Japanese change as "curious and naive," were fairly negative. The French were very negative, making pointed reference to the record of discussions at San Francisco.<br><br>True, the U.S. was much more supportive in later 1956-57 statements, but by then it had every reason to want to be supportive. Needless to say, Tokyo today repeats constantly what the U.S. had to say in 1956-57, ignoring anything that happened beforehand. It also has to clutch at vague straws claiming Moscow has at various times since 1956 promised further talks on territory -- talks that from the Russian point of view could simply be intended to put an end to Japan's various claims.<br><br>The Foreign Ministry position in all this is understandable. For as the saying puts it, "diplomats are honest people sent out to lie for their country." What is alarming is the ease with which not just public but intellectual opinion in this country has been mobilized to provide full support for the shaky Foreign Ministry position.<br><br>The few who suggest a "two-island solution" -- that Japan should receive the Habomais and Shikotan and leave Etorofu and Kunashiri for the future -- are quickly silenced. Very occasionally, when the Kumao Nishimura statement is raised, we are told that it was "mistaken," or for "domestic consumption only," or "later retracted."<br><br>Washington's role in all this is even more "curious." Why in 1951, at the height of the Korean War and its anti-Soviet hysteria, did it force a reluctant Japan to renounce all claim to all the Kuril islands? Professor Kimitada Miwa of Sophia University suggests it was due to a secret 1947 Washington-Moscow deal to guarantee Soviet support in the United Nations for U.S. control over Micronesia.<br><br>My own research says it had something to do with pressure from a bitterly anti-Japan Canberra determined to see Japan stripped of all its prewar possessions. Others say it was a skillful Dulles plot to force Tokyo and Moscow into decades of confrontation, or to preserve the Yalta framework for the sake of Europe, especially for Austria, which was still partly under Soviet occupation.<br><br>Be all that as it may, the U.S., which in 1951 had forced Japan to renounce all claim to the Kurils, including Etorofu and Kunashiri, in 1956 was able to threaten to turn Okinawa into a U.S. colony if Japan did not maintain all claim to the Kurils, including Etorofu and Kunashiri. Machiavelli would have been proud of that.<br><br>Interestingly, the only Japanese who seem able to see the problem in perspective are at totally different ends of the ideological spectrum -- the Japanese Communist Party and the extreme right, including Tokyo Gov. Shintaro Ishihara. Both blame Washington for the current mess. Both say that Japan should stop fussing about Etorofu and Kunashiri and go on to claim all of the Kurils as its "traditional territory."<br><br>The Foreign Ministry could easily back them up by releasing still unclassified documents in which Japan in 1951 strongly protested U.S. pressure to renounce the Kurils, including Etorofu and Kunashiri, and by pointing out how Japan was still under U.S. occupation. But if it did that, its claim that Japan never renounced Etorofu and Kunashiri would automatically be undercut. The chickens would finally have come home to roost.<br><br>Gregory Clark, vice president of Akita International University, is a former Moscow-based Australian diplomat and a member of former Foreign Minister Makiko Tanaka's private advisory committee on foreign-policy questions.

            <div class='col-md body'>Wikipedia has a good list of atrocities committed by Japs b/f and during WW2.  2 major accounts happened in S'pore. It's important that we never allow Japanese to pretend that nothing had happened.  I'm glad that LHL mentioned that S'pore do not agree with their account of the WW2 history. I think LKY also sais that Japanese govt should not cover up their ugly history.<br><br>Till today, those chemical weapons left behind by Japanese Army during WW2 are still hurting and killing Chinese civilians in China.<br><br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Japanese_War_Atrocities" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Japanese_War_Atrocities</a><br><br>Â•	Rape &amp; murder of Last Empress of Korea<br>Â•	Nanjing Massacre<br>Â•	March 1st Movement<br>Â•	Laha massacre<br>Â•	Alexandra Hospital massacre<br>Â•	Sook Ching Massacre<br>Â•	Bataan Death March<br>Â•	Manila Massacre<br>Â•	Unit 731<br>Â•	Unit 516<br>Â•	Unit 100<br>Â•	Death Railway<br>Â•	Comfort Women<br>Â•	Sandakan Death Marches<br>Â•	War Crimes in Manchukuo<br>Â•	War Crimes in the Pacific<br>Â•	War Crimes in Asia Mainland<br>Â•	Kaimingye germ Weapon Attack<br>Â•	Changteh Chemical Weapon Attack<br>Â•	Shantung Incident<br></div>

The court also agreed that the Japanese have endured many hardships since settling in their homeland decades later.<br><br>But the ruling denied the government's responsibility, saying the health ministry did not cause a delay in the implementation of repatriation programs. The ministry also provided necessary support measures, the court ruled.<br><br>Although the court said Tokyo should have acted quicker in identifying the Japanese and bringing them to Japan, it concluded that the source of the plaintiffs' hardships was the chaos in the final stages of World War II, when their parents either died or returned home without them.<br><br>Public policy to compensate for this kind of damage should be left to the Diet and the government from a broad perspective, the ruling said.<br><br>The 32 plaintiffs plan to appeal the ruling.<br><br>"The Japanese government is cold. It only guarantees a minimal level of living," one of the plaintiffs said after the ruling. "I am not sure whether it was a good idea to come to Japan."<br><br>The plaintiffs in this and the other suits are seeking 33 million yen each in compensation.<br><br>The "fast-track" lawsuit at the Osaka District Court was allowed to proceed quickly because of the advanced ages of the plaintiffs. In fact, one of the plaintiffs died before the ruling.<br><br>A total of 2,064 war-displaced Japanese have filed lawsuits against the central government at 15 district courts since the first one reached the Tokyo District Court in December 2002.<br><br>The plaintiffs account for more than 80 percent of the war-displaced who came to Japan on a permanent basis under government-funded repatriation programs.<br><br>They say Japan did not move fast enough in getting them to Japan and failed to provide sufficient support in terms of funds, employment and language lessons. About 70 percent of them are on welfare.<br><br>Following the ruling, Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroyuki Hosoda told reporters: "We are aware of the situations in which those who had been repatriated are becoming old, and it is becoming difficult for them to support themselves due in part to trouble with the Japanese language. Considering these facts, the government will try to provide necessary support for them so that they will be able to lead stable lives."<br><br>The district court ruling by Presiding Judge Ichiro Otaka acknowledged that Japan's colonization and military action in the former Manchuria were responsible for the creation of the war-displaced.<br><br>The ruling said the state had a reasonable obligation to repatriate the war-displaced as soon as possible after Japan-China relations were normalized in September 1972.<br><br>But it took nearly nine years after ties were normalized for Japan to even conduct a survey on determining the identities of the war-displaced.<br><br>Yet the court rejected arguments that a lack of effort by the state led to the delay.<br><br>"There is no understanding of our severe situation in this ruling," said Toshio Matsuda, the head of the plaintiffs group. "We will fight to the end with our lives."(IHT/Asahi: July 7,2005)</div>
