The survey conducted by Kyodo News in mid-May, with some 1,000 people responding each in Japan, China and South Korea, show that our neighbors look at Japan with critical eyes.<br>In China, 83 percent of the pollees say they feel little or no warmth toward Japan. The corresponding figure in South Korea is 75 percent. Both figures represent a worsening of sentiment toward Japan since the previous poll in 2002. At that time, people who felt little or no warmth toward Japan accounted for 67 percent in China and 69 percent in South Korea.<br><br>By contrast, 48 percent in Japan hold either some or strong feelings of warmth toward China; and 58 percent toward South Korea. Interestingly, while the figure for China represents a decrease of six percentage points from the 2002 poll, the corresponding figure for South Korea has gone up by five percentage points probably due to the "Hanryu" boom or heightened interest among Japanese in South Korean movies and TV dramas.<br><br>In the other poll conducted in early July in Japan and the U.S., to which some 1,000 people responded in each country, 52 percent of the Japanese pollees say the U.S. government cannot be trusted, an increase of 26 percentage points from a similar poll in 1991. By contrast, 59 percent in the U.S. regard the Japanese government as trustworthy.<br><br>Americans' general warm feeling toward Japan is not reciprocated by Japanese. While 81 percent in the U.S. say they feel some warmth or have a strong warm feeling toward Japan, only 68 percent in Japan have such a feeling toward the U.S.<br><br>The polls seem to indicate that national leaders' behavior and attitude strongly affect people's perception of the countries led by them. In the case of Japan-U.S. relations, President George W. Bush's unilateralist diplomacy and security policy, as represented by the Iraq war, apparently has caused apprehension among Japanese people.<br><br>Concerning the relationship between Japan, on the one hand, and China and South Korea, on the other, Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi's repeated visits to Yasukuni Shrine, which enshrines wartime Prime Minister Hideki Tojo and 13 other convicted class-A war criminals as well as 2.46 million Japanese war dead, apparently has influenced Chinese and South Koreans' chilly perception of Japan. Other likely causes for such a perception are state-screening approval of a nationalist history textbook and a territorial row over Takeshima Island with South Korea and a separate one over Senkaku Islands with China.<br><br>Eighty-six percent of the Chinese pollees and 82 percent of the South Korean pollees say Mr. Koizumi should not visit Yasukuni Shrine. Although he explains that he makes a pledge of not repeating war when he visits Yasukuni Shrine, the poll indicates that Chinese and South Koreans do not accept his explanation and take issue with the Yasukuni visit itself, irrespective of what he thinks or prays at the shrine.<br><br>There is a strong possibility that China's anti-Japanese education and campaigns have affected the people's perception of Japan. Still, the poll results indicate that a national leader must take utmost care in his behavior so that people of other countries do not take him as callous toward their feelings.<br><br>Even in Japan, opponents of Mr. Koizumi's Yasukuni visit are larger in number than supporters (41 percent against and 31 percent for) -- a reversal of the 2002 poll findings. At that time, 33 percent opposed and 54 percent supported his Yasukuni visit.<br><br>To improve bilateral relations, 57 percent in China call for solving the issue of the historical perception, which concerns Japan's colonialism and war-making in the past, while 42 percent in South Korea demand Japan's apology and compensation for past deeds.<br><br>There is a bright side to the poll. Forty-three percent in China and 30 percent in South Korea say they are interested in Japan's mass culture like movies, music, animation and fashion either "very much" or ''to some extent." It is encouraging that 63 percent of Chinese pollees in their 20s and 52 percent of corresponding pollees in South Korea have interest in Japan's mass culture.<br><br>The poll results show that "soft power" as embodied in artistic activities, entertainment and education can have a beneficial effect on overall relations between countries. But at the same time the poll indicates that, unless soft power is accompanied by efforts to solve the historical perception issue, enduring friendly relations between Japan and its neighboring countries will be hard to come by.<br><br>The Japan Times: Aug. 11, 2005<br>(C) All rights reserved</div>

Scores were tortured. At the end of the war, a few weeks later, only half were alive.<br>Then the perpetrators got off lightly.<br>Three employees of Kajima Gumi, the construction company overseeing the workers, were sentenced to death and another to life imprisonment by the Allied war crimes court in 1948. But the penalties were later reduced, and all were released by 1955. The man responsible for laborers in the town is celebrated in a bust near where his charges were killed.<br>The "Hanaoka Incident' could easily enter the record as yet another example of how Japan, 60 years after the end of World War II, has not convincingly faced up to the colossal slaughter of innocents as it conquered a wide swath of Asia in the 1930s and '40s.<br>But there is another side to the Hanaoka story.<br>As a boy of 9, Yasuo Togashi cheered with his neighbors when the bone-thin escapees were recaptured. Then, as he entered adulthood, he was overwhelmed with regret as he learned details of what those Chinese endured, and he joined a group of townspeople who dedicated their lives to keeping those memories alive.<br>"We thought the Chinese weren't even human, and we were happy when they were caught," said Togashi, 69, a retired elementary school teacher. "Now, I feel nothing but remorse. I didn't really understand it at the time, but as an adult, I was really shocked about it."<br>Since the 1950s, Togashi and others have tried to set things right: They have built monuments, hosted survivors visiting from China, and taught their schoolchildren about the past. The town holds an annual remembrance for the victims.<br>Repeated efforts<br>Few countries have apologized as often as Japan has for its aggression in Asia and to so little effect.<br>Since the 1970s, Japanese prime ministers and even emperors have expressed varying degrees of regret and remorse over the suffering caused by Japan.<br>Just last April, Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi sought to defuse a surge of war-related tensions with China during a speech at an Asian summit: "In the past, Japan through its colonial rule and aggression caused tremendous damage and suffering for the people of many countries, particularly those of Asian nations."<br>Tokyo's commitment to peace goes beyond rhetoric.<br>The country's U.S.-drafted constitution forswears war to settle international disputes, and no Japanese soldier has fired a shot in war since 1945. Japan is the world's No. 2 source of developmental aid after the United States, and it has paid billions in reparations to nations it invaded.<br>Not all of Asia is clamoring for further atonement. Singapore, the Philippines, Indonesia and Vietnam, all conquered by the Japanese, have mostly come to terms with the war and are more interested in lucrative ties with the world's second-largest economy than in dwelling on the past.<br>Yet, with the approach of Aug. 15, the day Japan marks the end of World War II, it is clear many Asians have nagging doubts about the depth of Japanese remorse.<br>Those doubts can erupt into violence, particularly in countries that bore the brunt of Japanese expansionism: China and the Koreas. Anti-Japan riots broke out in China this year, triggered by the Japanese government's approval of a history textbook that critics say glosses over atrocities in the 1930s and '40s.<br>The main reason for the doubt is the awesome scope of Japanese brutality as Tokyo built an empire that, at its wartime height, stretched from deep in the Pacific to Southeast Asia.<br>The Japanese assault was merciless. Civilians were bombed, doused with biological agents, machine-gunned and subjected to cruel medical experiments. Tens of thousands of women were forced into brothels for Japanese troops. Prisoners were tortured, executed, starved or worked to death.<br>Ambivalent nation<br>But at bottom, the Japanese themselves have not decided how much remorse they feel, and their ambivalence is reflected in myriad ways that undermine their statements of regret.<br>On April 22, while Koizumi was apologizing for the war, at least one member of his Cabinet and more than 80 Japanese lawmakers visited Yasukuni Shrine, a bastion of the emperor-worship at the heart of Japan's imperialist ambitions and the burial place for executed World War II war criminals.<br>An increasingly powerful clique of nationalist educators is encouraging a rollback of mentions of Japanese atrocities from wartime accounts in school books.<br>Even the verdicts of the war crimes tribunal that sat in Tokyo from 1946 to 1948 are being prominently questioned.<br>Ground zero in Hiroshima, meanwhile, symbolizes a view of the war long engraved in Japanese hearts: that of Japan as victim.<br>That a single bomb on Aug. 6, 1945, could kill 140,000 people and another on Nagasaki three days later could kill 80,000 obliterated from Japanese consciousness the history of much of what preceded it: Japan's invasions of Asia, the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor.<br>Outside the city there is the Holocaust Education Center to teach Japanese about Nazi atrocities. Its operators insist they make no connection between the Holocaust and Hiroshima, but the museum's location resonates deeply with the Japanese view of the bombings as a slaughter of innocents.<br>And nowhere does the museum mention that Japan was Germany's ally during the war, or that Japanese soldiers, like the Nazis, perpetrated mass killings and medical experiments on human beings.<br>Nazi parallels<br>Comparison with Nazi Germany is not a welcome one in Japan. The stock response is that what the Nazis did the extermination camps, the atrocities on an industrial scale far overshadow the haphazard, disorganized way Japan ran roughshod over its victims.<br>Not everybody in Japan buys that reasoning.<br>Kiyoko Nakano, taking photographs with her husband beside the ruins of the Hiroshima dome, draws the standard Japanese lesson from the bombing of her hometown: that all killing of innocents is a crime and should be condemned.<br>But, unlike many Japanese, she includes her own country among the list of criminals and bitterly criticizes those who seek to obscure Japan's wrongdoing.<br>"They always want to hide those bitter experiences," she said. "But if we don't face ourselves, Japan can never progress."</div>

The book, published by the outspokenly nationalist Japanese Society to Create New History Textbooks, or Tsukurakai, will be used by 6,400 students in the ward.<br><br>It is the first time that the controversial book has been adopted in one of JapanÂ’s main cities, and represents an important victory for the Tsukurukai, an organisation of right-wing academics determined to foster patriotism among Japanese children and counter what they regard as Â“masochisticÂ” views of Japanese history.<br><br>The book, produced by the Fusosha publishing house, omits reference to Â“comfort womenÂ” Â— mainly Korean and Chinese sex slaves forced to service Japanese soldiers Â— and refers to the Nanking massacre as an Â“incidentÂ”, saying that Â“manyÂ” Chinese died there, rather than citing historical estimates of the numbers who died, which range from tens of thousands to 300,000.<br><br>The Tsukurukai propagates the view that, far from the cruel and rapacious invasion described by many historians, JapanÂ’s occupation of China, Taiwan, Korea and South-East Asia liberated them from oppressive Western colonists.<br><br>After Otawara, a small city to the north of Tokyo, adopted the book last month, Hidet-sugu Yagi, the societyÂ’s head, called it Â“a historic step that shows efforts to bring history education back on the right track have begun to take root.Â”<br><br>Suginami ward is the third and largest education authority to choose the book, which has been designated for use in 65 schools nationwide. Formerly the number of students who would have studied the book next year was around 5,000; yesterday the total more than doubled. By the end of this month the Tsukurukai hopes to see the book adopted by 10 per cent of the countryÂ’s 583 education boards.<br><br>Fujioka Nobukatsu, the nationalist historian and the societyÂ’s founder, was present yesterday at the hearing of the Suginami educational committee, which attracted about 400 people. He declined to comment on the decision.<br><br>Â“Among the people queuing were old men in black suits, holding placards that read Â‘Adopt the textbookÂ’,Â” Kaoru Matsuno, a local parent and an opponent of the decision, said. Â“The scene reminded me of one of HitlerÂ’s meetings.Â”<br><br>Mrs MatsunoÂ’s group, the Society of Mothers, gathered a petition against the new book that bore 28,000 names. Â“The reason we have done this is because we want to avoid a misunderstanding of history and a glorification of war,Â” she said.<br><br>The book has provoked the greatest outrage in China, where thousands of demonstrators stoned the Japanese Consulate in Shanghai after Tokyo approved it for use in schools. Events in Tokyo yesterday set the stage for tension across Asia on Monday, when Japan remembers its surrender in 1945 and its former colonies celebrate the anniversary of triumph and national liberation.<br><br>Emperor Akihito and Juni-chiro Koizumi, the Prime Minister, will join politicians, veterans and war-bereaved family members for an annual ceremony of remembrance for the dead. There, he is expected to use the form of words first uttered by Tomiichi Murayama, the former Prime Minister.<br><br>In 1995 Mr Murayama offered Â“sincere condolencesÂ” for the Â“huge pain and sorrowÂ” caused in the war Â“to many nations, especially those in AsiaÂ”. Like his predecessor, Mr Koizumi is likely to speak of his hansei or deep remorse, rather than shazai, meaning an unambiguous apology.<br><br>A few hundred yards away, in the nationalist Yasukuni shrine, rightwingers will gather to celebrate the opposite point of view: that Japan has nothing to be sorry for and should speak proudly of its wartime record as Asian Â“liberatorÂ”.<br><br>Mr Koizumi has infuriated China and South Korea by making an annual visit to the Shinto shrine, a practice that he has insisted he will continue. The question this weekend is whether he will do so on Monday, thus causing maximum offence to JapanÂ’s neighbours. On balance, that seems unlikely; but there has never been a Japanese prime minister less predictable than Mr Koizumi.</div>

I don't know about you, but I couldn't help but hear talk of "forgiving" America by those related to those who died in the bombing, or are still suffering the effects of the bombing. There was talk that American had been irresponsible in dropping "the bomb" and that we shold have found "another way." Hmmm... not sure about that. These comments came from several Japanese now in America who are somehow involved in "no nukes" programs as well as the usual suspects who think everything America does is of the Devil. What seemed to get lost in the shuffle this past weekend was that America did not bomb Japan because we were a bunch of war mongering ogres with nothing better to do and Japan seemed to be the most vulnerable, peace-pipe smoking country within reach.<br>We dropped the bomb because we needed to end a war that they dragged us into. They bombed us first. Remember Pearl Harbor? Remember four long years of war against the Axis powers in Europe and the Pacific? (Not much has been made of the war of the Pacific theater of late, as all recent World War II television shows and films focus on the European area of action. I think there's some political correctness going on. It's easier to say "kraut" on TV than "Jap". It looks like the new film "The Great Raid" may reverse the trend; we'll see.)<br><br>Nobody ever talks about forgiving Japan for bombing Pearl Harbor. It's always America who has to apoligize.<br><br>Why?<br><br>We killed thousands of Japanese civilians to save the lives of thousands of American troops. They were the only lives that counted then. Japan had its chance to surrender before the bombing, but the government refused. I'd also like to point out that Japan could have saved Nagasaki from getting nuked if they'd surrendered after Hiroshima, but they were exceptionally hard-headed. Sometimes it takes awhile to get your point across.<br><br>Today's decendants of Hiroshima survivors can scream all they want about how bad nukes are and that we should be a nuke-free world, but they continue to miss the point. Their grandfather's started the fight.<br><br>I personally marked the anniversary of using the world's most destructive weapon with a sense of gratitude that World War II didn't last as long as it could have, that thousands more of our troops didnÂ’t die. One of the victory phrases from 1945, told to me by an old paratrooper, was "Golden Gate in '48," meaning the troops didn't expect a quick end in the Pacific theater after VE Day. Those of us who think the war was ending anyway so bombing Japan wasn't necessary don't understand that our grandfathers didn't have the benefit of today's history books. They had no idea that things would turn out the way they did.<br><br>And if the other side hadn't pushed first, the war never would have happened. I can't say that enough.<br><br>Right now we're engaged in a war making sure people like the Axis don't rise again (and we better get on the back's of Iran and North Korea - and I mean yesterday - as they're the next threat). Such action is regretful, but, again, who started the fight?<br><br>They did. In 1945, we finished it.<br><br>And we'll finish it again.</div>

But so much sorrow and shame remains unresolved. The Japanese government has not yet come to terms with the former comfort women."<br><br>The "Wednesday Demonstrations" have taken place every week since 1992 here in Seoul, but this Wednesday, protesters at some 30 cities in 10 different countries including the United States and Japan also held the rallies to pressure Tokyo.<br><br>So far, the Japanese government has spoken twice on the issue. Originally, it denied military involvement, but after being harshly criticized by victimized countries, Japan admitted that its military did use prostitutes but that they were not forced into service. After another slew of protests, Japan finally admitted in 1993 that force was involved in the sexual slavery.<br><br>Even with this concession, Japan refused to give reparation, saying such compensation was included in the 1965 treaty between Korea and Japan.<br><br>Estimates show at least 200,000 women, mostly from Korea, China and the Philippines were forced into wartime prostitution for millions of Japanese soldiers stationed throughout Asia.<br><br>"We were beaten until blood ran from our bodies. My scars from the knives are still there. They have to pay for the blood we shed. Back then, we had no choice but to follow them because our country was lost, and I was too young. But now it is different."<br><br>Although closure seems a long way off, activists here say they will continue to fight for justice even after the victims have passed away. And more younger Koreans are participating.<br><br>It's been 60 years since the end of World War II. The former comfort women are now in their 70s and 80s, but they say the protest will continue until the Japanese government grants them the apology and justice they deserve.<br><br>Arirang News</div>

Human Rights Commission.<br><br>Citing the public's right to know, the Korean government said it has now completed disclosure of the documents that were compiled for over a decade some 40 years ago.<br><br>The government decided to produce all the documents on the Korea-Japan treaty after a ruling by the Seoul Administrative Court ordered the release of five sets of papers in relation to a 2002 lawsuit by a group of 99 alleged Korean victims, who demanded recognition of their right to review the documents.<br><br>Japan did not openly oppose the disclosure but maintains a policy to keep its pertinent documents on the treaty confidential.<br><br>Korea's release of documents comes at a critical time when the two countries are cooperating closely ahead of the resumption next week of six-party talks on ending the North Korean nuclear problem.<br><br>History issues have continued to haunt the two closest neighboring countries, including a renewed controversy earlier this year over Japan's claims on the Korea n-controlled Dokdo islands.<br><br>The latest 35,350-page archives detail negotiations over property claims, and the efforts by the two sides to narrow their differences on the basis for normalization of relations.<br><br>Included are the so-called Kim-Ohira memo - between then Japanese Foreign Minister Masayoshi Ohira and chief of the Korean Central Intelligence Agency Kim Jong-pil.<br><br>The archives also show close involvement by the United States, including a letter from then U.S. President John F. Kennedy to Park Chung-hee.<br><br>The archives show Japan insisted on dealing with the Dokdo issue during the negotiations or taking it to the International Court of Justice, while Korea rejected the idea and argued that the islands were rightfully Korean territory and not a subject for negotiation.<br><br>The two sides later agreed to leave Dokdo out of the treaty and to leave room for further discussions through diplomatic channels.<br><br>The treaty on basic relations signed between Korea and Japan stipulated that "all treaties or agreements concluded between the Empire of Korea and the Empire of Japan on or before August 22, 1910 are already null and void."<br><br>The archives also showed 14 years of wrangling between the two countries over Korea's demand for special legal status and management by the Japanese government of over 600,000 Koreans living in Japan since the colonial period. Japan opposed the proposal, saying the Koreans would be considered as ordinary foreigners.<br><br>The two later settled the issue by giving permanent residence status to Koreans who had been living in Japan since before Aug. 15 1945, liberation day, as well as to sons and daughters born within a five year period after the treaty took effect.<br><br>The Foreign Ministry here also simultaneously released some 7,400 diplomatic documents from the Vietnam War era, during which period the country deployed about 50,000 soldiers to South Vietnam.<br><br>The archives recorded the then government's evaluation that the U.S. stipends for the deployed Korean troops were too meager.<br><br>The United States paid $130 million in stipends for Korean troops in Vietnam as of the end of 1969, but one of the documents said "the compensation was too little, at the very minimum and obligatory level, compared to other countries."<br><br>Vice Foreign Minister Lee Tae-shik said "South Korean government has no intention to renegotiate" the normalization agreement signed between Seoul and Tokyo.<br><br>"The (South Korean) government is not considering renegotiating the agreement at the moment, because Korea abides by the trust of the international community by acknowledging any agreement."<br><br>Public access to the documents will begin from Monday next week at the Institute of Foreign Affairs and National Security in southern Seoul.<br><br>(angiely@heraldm.com)<br><br>By Lee Joo-hee<br>2005.08.27</div>

John Ikenberry | bio<br><br>In response to Anne-MarieÂ’s query, I do think the September 11th general election in Japan is well worth watching -- and watching closely.<br><br>I was in Tokyo earlier this month when the Diet rejected the center piece of Prime Minister KoizumiÂ’s reform agenda -- privatization of the postal system. Foreigners, however, are interested in the other big item in the Koizumi platform Â– the "normalization" of JapanÂ’s military through constitutional reform. I have some thought on this.<br><br>But, importantly, the current upheaval in Japan is triggered by the postal reform controversy Â– and its manifold implications for JapanÂ’s government, society, and economy Â– not foreign policy. The postal system is where most Japanese put their savings and it is these financial assets Â– the largest pool of saving in the world Â– that allows the ruling Liberal Democratic Party to pursue spending programs that service its constituencies and retain its lock on power. So Prime Minister Koizumi is pursuing a high-risk strategy Â– threatening to break up his own political party to get his way. Koizumi promised to call elections if he lost the vote. Defiantly, his own LDP failed to give him the votes and now the issue is before the electorate.<br><br>Aug 26, 2005 -- 09:11:03 AM EST<br><br>When I was in Tokyo, I actually ran into Â– literally Â– one of the leading figures in the Diet showdown on the evening of the vote. My son and I were walking into the ANA Hotel in central Tokyo at the very moment that Shiruka Kamei Â– a rebel LDP member who helped orchestrate the Koizumi defeat Â– sprang from his limo and entered the ANA, and we found ourselves walking together through the throng of reporters, TV cameramen, and photographers to the elevators. Kamei was heading to a news conference in the hotel ballroom where he announced he was leaving the LDP to help launch a new political party, Kokumin Shinto (PeopleÂ’s New Party). Now his career is in the hands of his constituents in Hiroshima.<br><br>In her post, Anne-Marie sited a recent piece on the coming election that argues that Koizumi is making a move to consolidate his power, stirring up nationalist sentiments, awakening anti-Americanism, and perhaps after the September 11 election "dramatically alter[ing] JapanÂ’s profile in Asia and the world, particularly if it is determined to change one of the most enduring legacies of the 1945 surrender: JapanÂ’s constitutional renunciation of the use of military force."<br><br>My sense is that there is a glimmer of truth to this view -- Koizumi, as one of my Japanese friends notes, "is taking Japan down a dangerous path." Moreover, the U.S. is deeply implicated in this move. In my view, AmericaÂ’s policy of pushing Â– or encouraging, whatever term you want to use Â– Japan in this direction is likely to be a classic case of "be careful of what you wish for. . . . "<br><br>Here are the points that I would emphasize.<br><br>First, as I mention above, the current political storm is not about foreign policy. It is about domestic political reform. Koimuzi himself said recently: "The biggest question at stake in the election is whether or not you support the privatization of postal services." So what is most at stake on September 11 is the fate of the LDP and reform of the Japanese system. If Koizumi ends up splitting the LDP and the Democrat Party wins the election Â– that would be the most consequential outcome of the election.<br><br>Second, KoimuziÂ’s efforts to "normalize" Japan is not new. It has been part of his platform from the beginning. Moveover, the Japanese debate about reforming Article Nine of the Constitution dates back at least to the first Iraq war. The debate has been about providing Japan a legal basis to participate in "collective security" within the framework of alliance and the United Nations. Putting the specific question of constitutional reform to the side for a moment, there is mainstream support in Japan Â– and around the region and world Â– for Japan to play a stronger role in areas of UN-sponsored peacekeeping, humanitarian intervention, and conflict prevention. In effect, the search has been to find a Japanese "third way" between constitutional pacifism and normalized military power.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Third, in the meantime, the stakes have risen Â– North Korean nukes, the rise of China, 9/11, and the American estrangement from the UN. Japanese people generally feel more threatened by developments within the region. They also feel pressure from the United States to "step up to the plate" and be a more fully capable ally. Even before September 11, the U.S. has been urging Japan to breakout of its old postwar straightjacket. The so-called Armitage report Â– a bipartisan group of Japan foreign policy specialists and diplomats Â– called for the U.S. and Japan to transform their relationship into something akin to the U.S.-British special relationship. Japan would be a more normal military power but tied tightly to the U.S. in an alliance that has wider regional reach. In office, Powell and Armitage spoke of the need for Japan to revise its constitution. Japanese diplomats felt this pressure from Washington, particularly when it has been coupled with the Bush administrationÂ’s seeming ambivalence toward fixed-formal alliances. One senior Japanese diplomat posted in Washington described to me what he understood to be the imperative of Japanese foreign policy Â– to make the alliance "useful" to Washington, which meant making Japan a military power that could go more places and do more things. Koizumi is an enthusiastic constitutional revisionist and he has responded to the increase in Japanese public insecurity and pressure from Washington to press his case.<br><br>Fourth, the actual LDP draft terms of constitutional revision are relatively moderate. The Preamble with stay the same. The first paragraph of Article Nine will not be changed Â– this is the one where Japan relinquishes its war waging rights. The second paragraph will be changed to say that Japanese Self Defense Forces can be used to defend the country. So, as my friend Takashi Inoguchi of Chou University tells me, the language of "pacifism will stay and the status quo will be preferred." Of course, this is where constitutional language meets politics Â– what does self defense mean? Even without constitutional reform, this definition has been expanding Â– and it is likely to do so even more after reform.<br><br>Fifth, the new Japanese impulse to revise the constitution is not really a response to "growing Japanese nationalism." It is hard to detect a rise in nationalism at the popular level. The Japanese scholar, Masaru Tamamoto Â– who is now with the Japanese Institute for International Affairs Â– sees the debate about the constitution more as an issue of "statehood" Â– that is, the ability of Japan to use force as an expression and right of state sovereignty. It is more about reclaiming the lost sovereignty of the Japanese state than a response to a swelling public nationalism or patriotic emotion. As Tamamoto says in an email to me: "Such a statehood, of course, is only possible with American encouragement and participation."<br><br>In an insightful essay in the Far Eastern Economic Review (canÂ’t get link Â– it is the January 2005 issue), Tamamoto makes this point:<br><br>"TodayÂ’s dominant political and intellectual voices [in Japan] deem that Japan had ceased to be a state afer World War II. The argument is simple: Recovery of statehood means reacquiring the right to use force as an instrument of state policy. In a sense, the rise of such thinking is understandable. After all, Japan is maneuvering between the United States and China, two countries that are extremely sensitive about sovereign statehood, and whose policies are driven by the equation of sovereignty and national security. "<br><br>"The Japanese quest for statehood means the ability to engage in collective security policy with the United States Â– Japanese soldiers fighting alongside American GIs. Already, there are 600 Japanese ground troops in Iraq as part of the Â‘coalition of the willingÂ’ Â– although these soldiers stay put inside their isolated fortress, since their primary mission is to be there and not get killed. This is the first time since 1945 that Japanese soldiers have ventured into a war zone."<br><br>Sixth, this new political climate is not really a product of anti-Americanism. The article Anne-Marie cites suggests that there is rising sentiment in favor of inviting America to remove its bases and leave Japan. Yes, there is a strong local opposition to bases in that area Â– polls, for example, show that residents in Okinawa think the airbase located in the center of their city should be moved. But they want them moved to another location in Japan. Leaders and the public are not entertaining the idea of a Japan free of an American military presence Â– quite the contrary Â– the alliance with the U.S. is seen by much of the Japanese people as an integral part of the constitutional order itself.<br><br>As I argued in an earlier post, Koizumi and Washington are playing with fire. To put it bluntly, normalization of the Japanese military opens East Asia to a new era of arms races, security competition and political instability. It threatens to launch China on a path that the United States will regret. A more normal Japan will make the U.S.-Japan alliance a more provocative and controversial institution within the region. For decades the bilateral alliance has been seen as the linchpin of stability in the region. It now threatens to be the lightening rod of instability. Official Washington wants its alliance with Japan to look more like its special relationship with Britain. But Britain has nuclear weapons and independent military forces. This is not what we should want Japan to look like in East Asia. Germany is a better model.<br><br>The challenge today is to help Japan continue its search for a "third way" toward more active participation in regional and global security and governance. As Masaru Tomamoto says in his Far Eastern Economic Review article, "At the moment, Japan does not have a workable formula to maintain the security relationship with the United States and foster cordial relations with China." At this moment, the U.S. should not be trying to renationalize and remilitarize Japan so it can be a full alliance partner in President BushÂ’s war on terror. Rather, the U.S. should be trying to help build an East Asian regional order that can accommodate both a rising China and a Japan that has a sense of its own statehood. Germany has been doing this within the context of the EU and NATO. On the other side of the world, the U.S. and East Asia need to invent regional institutional structures to help China and Japan both continue to redefine their political and security identities without blowing the region apart.</div>

The elections will be held only a week apart.<br><br>Apart from their similarities in political style shown in recent weeks, however, Koizumi and Schroeder have adopted sharply contrasting foreign policies on the two interwoven issues of Iraq and relations with the United States - their countries' most important ally during the Cold War. It can be easily imagined that<br><br>President George W Bush has a strong desire to see the staunchly pro-US Koizumi survive the upcoming vote. Not Schroeder - to say the least.<br><br>Schroeder can find an ally in Japan over Iraq and the US: Katsuya Okada, leader of the main opposition Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) now challenging Koizumi's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). Like Schroeder, Okada is critical of what is widely perceived as Bush's unilateralism. The DPJ leader condemns Koizumi's foreign policy as just following big brother US and calls for the withdrawal of Japanese troops from Iraq by the end of this year.<br><br>The big gamble<br>Koizumi took a political gamble by dissolving the Lower House of the diet, Japan's parliament, on August 8, only hours after the postal privatization bills, the centerpiece of his reform program, were voted down by the Upper House by a vote of 125 to 108. Although Koizumi's LDP and its coalition partner, New Komeito party, together hold a majority in the Upper House, a larger number of LDP lawmakers than the party leadership had expected voted against the bills. Koizumi cannot dissolve the Upper House, so he uses the election as both a means to cleanse the party of dissidents and to revitalize his reforms.<br><br>The Upper House rejection of the bills followed weeks of fierce internal feuding within the LDP between supporters of his reform programs and what he calls "old-guard conservatives" or "resistance forces". The bills had been passed by the Lower House, the more powerful of the two diet chambers, on July 5, on the strength of the LDP-led coalition's majority, but by a narrow margin of only five votes because of a revolt by about three dozen LDP lawmakers.<br><br>Koizumi, who had claimed that the killing of the postal bills would be tantamount to a no-confidence vote against him, was quick to carry out his threat to dissolve the Lower House for a snap general election to seek a new mandate for reform programs, especially his pet project to privatize Japan Post, effectively the world's largest financial institution with about US$3 trillion in assets. Koizumi vowed to step down if the LDP-New Komeito coalition failed to secure a majority in the Upper House.<br><br>When he dissolved the Lower House, Koizumi came under a barrage of criticisms, even from within his LDP, that dissolving the Lower House on the grounds of government-sponsored bills being voted down in the Upper House was an unconstitutional act. Koizumi brushed away the charge.<br><br>In the general election set for September 11, all 480 seats are up for grabs. The LDP has 212 seats going into the vote, excluding the 37 seats held by dissenters, and New Komeito party has 34 seats. The LDP and New Komeito party have a combined 246 seats, only five seats more than the 241 required for a majority. The DPJ has 175 seats going into the election.<br><br>Koizumi seems to have wind in his sails. Since he dissolved the Lower House, public support for him has been rising sharply, according to public opinion polls by Japanese newspapers. But there are still three weeks to go before the vote and public opinion is volatile. Autumn winds could suddenly blow in the opposite direction.<br><br>Foreign policies issues<br>In stark contrast with the German leader, Koizumi has been one of the world's staunchest supporters - along with British Prime Minister Tony Blair - of Bush's anti-terrorism campaign, launched in the wake of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center in New York and the Pentagon, and of his Iraq war.<br><br>The Koizumi government enacted two new controversial laws to enable the Self-Defense Forces (SDF) to assist US-led military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. Under the first law, enacted in October 2001, only weeks after September 11, SDF naval vessels were sent to the Indian Ocean to support US-led operations in Afghanistan, where the Islamic fundamentalist Taliban regime had been ousted from power.<br><br>Under the second law, enacted in August 2003, the Koizumi government at the end of that year dispatched several hundred ground troops to Samawah, southern Iraq, on a humanitarian and reconstruction mission. In December 2004, the government extended the SDF dispatch to Iraq by another year, until the end of this year. The decision came despite strong objections from opposition parties and amid growing concerns about the safety of the Japanese troops. Opinion polls, conducted by news media when the extension was decided, showed that a majority of Japanese were against the decision.<br><br>Japan and the US are now moving to strengthen security and defense ties based on the bilateral security treaty, including the development and deployment of a missile-defense system to counter the threats of missile attacks from North Korea, which has an estimated 200 or so Rodong missiles capable of striking almost all of Japanese territory.<br><br>The two countries are expected to reach an agreement later this year on the realignment of US military bases in Japan. The Bush administration is reviewing the role of these bases as part of its military's worldwide "transformation". The role the US expects Japan to play will be that of a "power projection hub" to ensure stability in an "arc of instability", an area stretching from Northeast Asia to the Middle East via Southeast Asia and South Asia.<br><br>China, a rapidly ascending military and economic power, is alarmed by the US military transformation now underway. There are suspicions in China that the real US motives for the sweeping overhaul of its military's global posture might be what some call the "soft containment" of China.<br><br>The state of Japan-US relations is now one of the best in history, backed by a personal friendship between Koizumi and Bush. Their chemistry seems good. In stark contrast, Japan's relations with Asian neighbors, especially China and South Korea, have been in recent months at their lowest points.<br><br>Japan has seen relations with China and South Korea strained seriously by such issues as Koizumi's repeated visits to Tokyo's Yasukuni Shrine, territorial disputes and Tokyo's bid for a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council. China and South Korea regard the shrine, where some class-A Japanese war criminals, including former prime minister Hideki Tojo, are enshrined with the 2.4 million war dead, as a symbol of Japan's militaristic past. Japan's public opinion is split down the middle over Koizumi's visits to the shrine.<br><br>Many experts in Japan take Koizumi to task for the current stalemate in ties with the two Asian neighbors, with some even accusing the US-first prime minister of lacking a clear Asia policy.<br>DPJ's foreign policies<br>All Japanese political parties have made public their manifestoes, or policy platforms, for the September 11 general election.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In its manifesto, the LDP puts strengthening Japan-US alliance first. Improving ties with China and South Korea comes next. In a significant difference with the LDP, the DPJ puts Asia policy first and then Japan-US relations. "It is one of Japan's top priority foreign-policy tasks to rebuild relations with China," the DPJ manifesto says. The manifesto also indirectly criticizes Koizumi for lacking a relationship of trust with top Chinese leaders and calls for the construction of a state-run alternative facility to Yasukuni Shrine to honor the war dead, an idea strongly supported by South Korea but balked at by Koizumi.<br><br>Regarding ties with the US, the DPJ's policy platform does not use the word "strengthen" as the LDP manifesto does but instead says it wants to see an "evolution" of the bilateral ties and calls for a review of bilateral arrangements, including that of the Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) within three years.<br><br>The SOFA, which sets the legal status of American service members stationed in Japan, has been criticized by many in Japan as an unfair arrangement in recent years, especially since the 1995 gang rape of an elementary school girl by three American soldiers in Okinawa. But the Japanese government has been negative about any review of the arrangement out of political consideration to the US.<br><br>Former DPJ leader Naoto Kan once advocated withdrawal of US Marines to US territories such as Guam and Hawaii from the southernmost Japanese island of Okinawa - where the bulk of more than 40,000 American service members deployed in Japan, mostly Marines, are stationed.<br><br>On Iraq, the DPJ's manifesto stipulates that the SDF troops should be pulled out by the end of this year, when the current, one-year mandate of their deployment in that country is to expire. Since the Iraq war, the DPJ has claimed that there was no "legitimate reason" for launching the war and that Japanese troops' participation in the US-led multinational forces was in breach of the war-renouncing, post-war Japanese constitution.<br><br>But the DPJ is not opposed to other relations with the US. In July last year, DPJ leader Okada visited the US. It was his first overseas trip since taking the helm of the opposition party, apparently reflecting his recognition of the importance of Japan-US relations should the DPJ take power. Okada's apparent favorite in the US presidential election in November was Republican President Bush's challenger John F Kerry, who is a Democrat. Okada participated in the Democratic Party convention in Boston during his US trip for talks with Kerry's staff, although he also held talks with some Bush administration officials later.<br><br>Differences between Koizumi and Okada<br>The political backgrounds of Koizumi and Okada may help explain their foreign-policy differences.<br><br>Former prime minister Takeo Fukuda, Koizumi's mentor, effectively inherited the LDP faction founded by Nobusuke Kishi, who served as prime minister from 1957 to 1960. The LDP faction Fukuda once led is now chaired by former prime minister Yoshiro Mori and called the Mori faction. Koizumi had belonged to the faction, but left it, albeit nominally, after becoming prime minister.<br><br>Kishi was a hawkish politician and one of the staunchest US allies. He served as commerce and industry minister in the Tojo government. After Japan's defeat in World War II, Kishi was arrested as a suspected class-A war criminal, although he was indemnified and released later. He stepped down after railroading revisions to the 1952 Japan-US security treaty through the diet in 1960 amid raucous diet debate and tumultuous demonstrations across the country, mainly by leftist students and labor unionists.<br>In the largest anti-government protests after the war, some protesters stormed the diet building and clashed with riot police. A female University of Tokyo student died in the protest. The revisions were aimed at correcting what was widely perceived as the unequal nature of the treaty in favor of the US, and the protests were more against Kishi himself for his high-handed handling of the revision issue than against the specific contents of the revised treaty.<br><br>DPJ leader Okada had belonged to the LDP faction led then by former prime minister Noboru Takeshita before leaving the party along with Ichiro Ozawa, now deputy DPJ leader, and others in 1993 to form a now-defunct new party. Their departure from the LDP led to the party's devastating defeat that year in the general election and its first loss of power since its 1955 founding. The Takeshita faction was a successor to the LDP faction founded by former prime minister Kakuei Tanaka, who reopened Japan's diplomatic relations with China in 1972 and is still revered in China as a "benefactor who dug a well for water-thirsty people".<br><br>Traditionally, the faction inherited by Kishi, Fukuda and others, including current leader Mori has been the most hawkish of all LDP factions and also pro-US, while the faction inherited by Tanaka, Takeshita and two other former prime ministers - Keizo Obuchi and Ryutaro Hashimoto - has been pro-China.<br><br>There is much more to it. Koizumi served as a secretary to Fukuda before being first elected to the diet. Tanaka and Fukuda were implacable political rivals within the LDP. Their power struggle driven by strong personal animosity was so fierce that it is still remembered as "kaku-fuku war".<br><br>Concerns among conservatives<br>Despite its campaign rhetoric, the DPJ will become more realistic if it takes power. It is common sense in Japanese political circles that any prime minister would not survive long without the backing of the US administration.<br><br>Former prime minister Tomiichi Murayama's demarche is a good example. When he became the first socialist Japanese prime minister in nearly five decades in the mid-1990s, Murayama made an about-face in his socialist party's security policy and declared that his government would accept the existence of the SDF and maintain the Japan-US security alliance. Before Murayama became prime minister, the socialist party had insisted that the SDF was unconstitutional and that the Japan-US security alliance be scrapped.<br><br>The socialist party had been the biggest opposition party for decades after the end of World War II but it is now in danger of extinction due to loss of support. Many former socialist party members now belong to the DPJ.<br><br>To be sure, the DPJ may just be engaged in the tactic of playing up policy differences with the LDP in hopes of boosting its prospects in the upcoming general election. But concerns about the DPJ's foreign policy are growing in Japan, especially among conservatives.<br><br>The conservative Japanese daily Yomiuri voiced concerns about the DJP's foreign policy. In an editorial on August 20, the paper said: "We wonder if there is no risk of the Japan-US alliance being shaken by the DPJ's stance. The DPJ needs to give a clearer explanation (about its stance)."<br><br>The Washington Post has thrown its support behind Koizumi. It said in an editorial on August 15 that Koizumi's defeat would be "awkward" for the US. "Not only is the main opposition party in Japan muddled on economics, but it is critical of the prime minister's pro-US foreign policy and promises to withdraw Japanese troops from Iraq," the paper said.<br><br>"An election that endorsed those policies would be troubling, as would one that allowed a weakened LDP to remain in office in exchange for ditching Mr Koizumi. With luck, Mr Koizumi will convince the voters that his stand on reform is worth backing. He has a month to make his case."<br><br>In an apparent attempt to dispel domestic concerns about his foreign policy ahead of the September 11 vote by emphasizing the importance he attaches to ties with the US, Okada said on August 16 that he will choose the US as the destination for his first overseas trip if he becomes the next prime minister. But at the same time Okada made it clear that he would convey a message to Bush: his DPJ government has no intention of budging on the issue of pulling SDF personnel out of Iraq at the end of this year.<br><br>Hisane Masaki is a Tokyo-based scholar, journalist and commentator on international politics and economy.

They also argued that the Asahi continues to publish the book.<br><br>The relatives filed the suit in April 2003, saying they could not tolerate the continued defamation of the two men.<br><br>During the trial, the defendants argued there was no defamation committed, as the lieutenants had agreed to publish their wartime stories and were apparently involved in the indiscriminate killing of civilians and prisoners of war, as well as soldiers.<br><br>After the ruling, the plaintiffs claimed it was physically impossible for such a contest, and it was regrettable the court did not clearly state it was a fabrication.<br><br>Their lawyers took issue with the court's stand that it could not say the contest did not take place. This puts the burden on the plaintiffs to prove the incident was fabricated, whereas it should be up to the writers and publishers to prove it did take place, they argued.<br><br>Honda called the ruling "natural" and alleged the plaintiffs were trying to downplay the Nanjing Massacre and Japan's invasion of China.<br><br>He said he was in a sense grateful because the suit effectively helped underscore the contest as an established historical fact, but he expressed anger that the court proceedings "wasted" his time.<br><br>The plaintiffs said they intend to appeal.<br><br>The Japan Times: Aug. 24, 2005<br>(C) All rights reserved</div>

Talks are also under way with South Korea, which Mr. Ong says has shown more flexibility than Japan in negotiations.<br><br>ASEAN's head has warned Tokyo that it is being too inflexible in trade talks, and that could have consequences. The leader of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations - ASEAN - is warning Japan that it could lose its position in the regional market to rivals such as South Korea, unless it compromises more in free trade talks.<br><br>ASEAN Secretary-General Ong Keng Yong says the 10 nations of the group want to expand exports to Japan. However, they are frustrated by what ASEAN says is Tokyo's unwillingness to open its market more to tropical fruit and other agricultural products.<br><br>"We are now reaching a critical point," said Secretary General Ong. "I now believe that we should look for re-establishing a normal trade relationship. Yes, you have some difficulties in regard to certain products. We can find a way to overcome it.

Then there were the few who not only saw the movie, but were the movie.<br>The movie, "The Great Raid," is the story of the raid on the prisoner of war camp at Cabanatuan on Luzon in the Philippine Islands. It was that camp were many of the survivors of the Bataan Death March ended up to endure three years of punishment, starvation, illness and death at the hands of their Japanese captors.<br>On Jan. 30, 1945 that misery ended with a raid by 120 of this nation's newest, and untested, fighting force ? the U.S. Army Rangers. They freed the remaining 513 American prisoners at that camp and killed 300-plus of their tormentors in what history has acclaimed "the greatest rescue mission every undertaken and accomplished by the United States military."<br>Two of those who lived through those experiences reside in Northern Virginia. One was a prisoner who had been moved by the Japanese prior to the raid but spent two incarcerations at Cabanatuan. The other was one of the Rangers who pulled off the raid and brought the prisoners home.<br><br>U.S. ARMY COLONEL Melvin H. Rosen, a 1940 graduate of the Military Academy at West Point, was one of the 10,000 Americans taken prisoner by the Japanese upon the surrender of Bataan on April 9, 1942. They were joined by 50,000 Filipinos.<br>Rosen was not at Cabanatuan on the night of Jan. 30. But he had been there twice before. That night he was encased in an even deeper hell ? forced slave labor in Japan.<br>Rosen had been moved numerous times by the Japanese on three of their so-called "Hell Ships" to various locations in the Pacific to perform hard labor. His freedom did not occur until Sept. 10, 1945, nearly a month after the Japanese stopped fighting and eight days after their formal surrender aboard the battleship USS Missouri in Tokyo Bay.<br>"We were liberated by the U.S. Army's Seventh Division at Incheon, Korea," he recalled. He and others had been pressed into forced labor in Korea, then a Japanese territory. "Nobody knew we were there. Who would have thought Korea," Rosen, now 87, said sitting in the living room of his Falls Church home.<br><br>BURSTING THROUGH the gates of Cabanatuan Prison just after dark that fateful night 60 years ago, was 21-year-old Vernon Abbott of High Point, N.C. He had enlisted in 1940 at age 17. Little did he know that his destiny and that of the men who came to be known as the "Ghost Soldiers" would cross on a Pacific Island some 9,000 miles and a "lifetime" into the future.<br>Abbott became one of the 120 specialized forces assembled by Lieutenant Colonel Henry Mucci, the Commanding Officer of the 6th Ranger Battalion. They were an elite infantry unit with very little combat experience except for Mucci who had commanded ranger training in the jungles of New Guinea.<br>A West Point graduate and second generation Italian American from Bridgeport, Conn., Mucci, portrayed by Benjamin Bratt in the film, had been Provost Marshal in Honolulu on December 7, 1941. He was affectionately referred to as "Little MacArthur" by his men because of his pipe smoking and flare for the theatrics of war.<br>"He was the best officer I ever served under. I'd have done anything for him. He was one of us. He stayed with the enlisted men even when he could have been with the officers," Abbott, now 81, said at his upholstery shop in Mount Vernon District.<br>Army intelligence became aware of a Japanese plan to kill all POWs when an invasion of the Philippines by American forces became imminent. It was referred to by the Japanese high command as "the final disposition of prisoners" and was emphasized in the movie.<br>That was when it was decided that a rescue mission would be launched to save the prisoners that remained at Cabanatuan. That decision was made on Jan. 26. They estimated they had no more than five days to save the prisoners before they were slaughtered as had been the case at other POW camps.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>HOW THAT DECISION was carried out and the lives of the prisoners leading up to the night of Jan. 30 is the story of "The Great Raid." Both Rosen and Abbott judged it authentic and accurate with only a few flaws they excused as "Hollywood."<br>"Overall, it was pretty good. There were a couple of things I didn't like. The Black Widow planes in the movie just flew in and out. But that's not the way it happened," Abbott said.<br>"Those planes kept flying around that camp to distract the Japanese. The Black Widow was the only plane with radar in its nose which made it especially equipped for night flying," he said.<br>Abbott also thought the directors of the movie should have used more actual film of the prisoners so that their true physical condition would have more accurately portrayed. "Some of the ones in the movie looked like they were in better shape than we were coming through the gate," Abbott said.<br>He also wished the public could have been made more aware of how the Japanese not only mistreated the POWs but how they slaughtered them. However, it is vividly portrayed in the film that if one prisoner escaped 10 others were executed including the escapee who was inevitably captured. It also shows how prisoners were herded into bunkers and burned alive as part of the Japanese plan for "the final disposition."<br>Abbott also took exception as to how the raiders were chosen in the film version. "In the movie it doesn't show that they asked for volunteers. But, that's the way it happened in real life. We were all volunteers. And Col. Mucci said that some of us would not be coming back so we better pray before we left," Abbott said.<br>Abbott had great praise for the Filipino Scouts that fought with the Rangers on the raid. "Their part in the raid was very well portrayed in the film. They took out all the Japanese reinforcements," he said. And, that is exactly how it is shown in the film.<br>"I went in the main gate after we shot the guy in the tower," Abbott recalled. "When we got to one of the prisoner barracks they thought we had come to kill them. Then my buddy, Bill Butler, said, "I'm from Tulsa, Oklahoma. We're here to take you home."<br>"The prisoner said 'God bless you.' And, that's when we started freeing them. Many we had to carry. They were too weak or sick to walk," he said. A picture of Abbott carrying a prisoner is displayed in the book "Ghost Soldiers" by Hampton Sides. Above that photo is the prisoner's quote "We thought they were Gods."<br><br>THE RANGERS did not lose one prisoner. However, during the evacuation, several died due to ill health, malaria and malnutrition, according to Abbott. The movie records only one of those deaths.<br>The Rangers lost only two. One was their medical officer. There were no Japanese survivors.<br>Rosen also gave the film high ratings, although, as he admitted, he was not lucky enough to be one of those rescued. "I was a Canbantuan twice, but, was moved out to serve in slave labor camps. The second time I left was only weeks before the raid," Rosen said.<br>"Since I wasn't there at the time I can't really speak to the authenticity of the movie. But, I do know it portrayed conditions at the camp accurately," he said.<br>POWs from Bataan were first taken to Camp O'Donnell before going to Canbantuan. "We buried 1,500 American at O'Donnell. The Filipinos buried 26,000 there," he said.<br>Rosen spent two years at a penal colony on Mindanao before returning to Canbantuan for the second time. Then he was put on a "Hell Ship," eventually ending up in Korea.<br>"The raid took place in January of 1945. I was put on the ship in November 1944. Bad timing," said Rosen with a glint in his eye.<br>He also had high respect for the Filipino Scouts who were equivalent to the U.S.'s Rangers. "They were the most highly trained and disciplined soldiers the U.S. Army ever had," said the West Point graduate.<br>Rosen chose the Philippines upon graduation from West Point because he had decided, "We were going to be at war with Japan and I thought the Philippine bases had the most and best of everything," he said.<br>"How wrong I was. As soon as I arrived in January 1941 there was a fly over. I looked up and saw they were flying World War I planes. That's when I knew I had made a big mistake," Rosen recalled.<br>"The Japanese hit us on Dec. 8, right after Pearl Harbor. It was actually the same day because we were on the other side of the international date line. We went into the Bataan peninsula as a defense strategy," Rosen said.<br>After a 150-day siege the Americans had no ammunition or many other supplies. That's when the largest surrender in American military history occurred and the infamous "Death March" followed by three years of hell began.<br>Rosen's only complaint about the movie is that it portrays all the prisoners as survivors of the Death March. "Many in the camp were also survivors of Corregador as well as Bataan," he said.<br>He also defended Gen. Douglas MacArthur's escape to Australia prior to the fall of the Philippines which is referred to at the beginning of the film. "He was ordered to Australia by the president. What else could he do? He was first and foremost a soldier and he followed orders. No one should ever question his personal honor," Rosen said.</div>

You have a cartel of countries who represent the supply side. I think if major countries on the demand side of the oil domain are able to pool their resources and requirements, I think itÂ’ll put them in a better position at the negotiating table with the states in the supply cartels. We have an OPEC for the oil producers, I think there is a case for an OSEC or oil consumers kind of consortium. And in Asia, countries like India, China and perhaps at some point, Indonesia, plus Korea and Japan who also have large oil requirements, could pool their efforts together. I think itÂ’s inevitable actually.<br><br>JT: What could be included in the initial steps for this collaboration?<br><br>UB: Well, I think there is a clear interlink today between the energy dimension along with the growth rates and the environmental impact. So I think we need to do some consultation between the long term energy supply and demand. And the correlation with economic activity and impact on the environment because of greenhouse gases, and the commitments which the Kyoto protocol represents. So I think we need a kind of strategic dialogue, which would be strategic in a non-military sense. That is if we can make reasonable projections into the future, I think we have to carry out very informed assessments. So that there is a sense of cooperative effort as far as major oil consumers and the demand side is regulated in the appropriate manner. I also foresee a point in the not too distant future when these countries might have to look at alternate sources of energy. Now, whether these are solar, whether theyÂ’re wind or nuclear, will depend on individual countries and their own options and constraints. But hypothetically, whether we talk about nuclear or the wind, I think again, a certain degree of cooperation will be mutually beneficial.<br><br>JT: Should the United States and Europe be worried by such a deal between India and China?<br><br>UB: I think not. As I believe energy will very soon become the driving force or the driving determinant for many bilateral and multi-lateral relations. And given the United States own dependence on hydro-carbons at this point in time, I think the US itself could also be brought on board, so that there is a sense of transparency, and whatever China and India are proposing to do that in the long term would not be detrimental to a country such as the United States.<br><br>JT: What will this collaboration mean for western oil firms who have not been able to compete on the same level as these state-backed oil firms from China and India?<br><br>UB: Well, I think the fact that the western oil forms did not bid for Petrokazakhstan is not an indication that they would be outbid or that they did not want to. I think as far as western countries are concerned, I think here we have a clear political dimension which is the way that the governments of individual countries, whether itÂ’s the United States or Japan, are looking at hydrocarbons. ThatÂ’s one aspect. The second is the degree in which they are looking at it from a purely business and commercial point of view, which is another strategic dimension. My understanding of the Petrkazakhstan deal, was that the Chinese were determined to get it and this happened in the back drop of the attempt by CNOOC for UNOCAL, and the fact that they did not get it, I think ChinaÂ’s determination and the fact that China would have paid a price that was higher than what others were willing, was more or less evident. So I think there was a sense of prudence that may have dictated the response of the western oil companies.<br><br>Commodore Uday Bhaskar, from the Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses, in India.<br></div>
