What they have ignored is that judgment should not be made by the heir of perpetrators, it said.</span><br><br>Leading German newspapers are of the view that a lack of thorough remorse and self-reflection by Japan for its wartime crimes is at the root of the recent protests in China and South Korea.<br>Japan failed to win its neighbor's trust and its apologies made in the past "appeared rather to be politically opportune," Germany 's mainstream newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung said in a front-page article Monday.<br>The revision of the history textbooks by Japanese right-wing groups evoked the nightmare of its neighbors, the newspaper said in another front-page editorial last week.<br>Instead of self-examining why the neighboring countries reacted so vehemently, Japan treated itself as a victim of the history, the editorial said.<br>Japan's repentance and atonement have remained at the level of symbolistic gesture and compensation through financial assistance, it said. "Today, 60 years after the capitulation, Japan still regards itself only as war-loser, not as perpetrator and responsible for what has happened."<br>"Japan could not settle up with its neighbors unless it learned to accept the neighboring countries' sight of the past," the editorial said. "Politically, Japan could also benefit from the learning process."<br>Another mainstream German newspaper Sueddeutsche Zeitung criticized the Japanese government for hurting the feelings of its neighbors. Each time when Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi visited the Yasukuni Shrine, which honors 2.5 million Japanese war dead including war criminals from World War II, each time when the Japanese government defended its revision of history textbooks, Japan added fuel to the flames, the newspaper said last week.<br>To the protests in Beijing, Japan has by now shown no sign of self-criticism, it said.</div>

A great nation understands history cannot be skirted but must be faced.<br>A great nation seeks to work through its history, and resolve it, so its people will not remain forever vulnerable to the kind of questions that, if ignored, only fester.<br>A great nation understands, to repeat a truth that should not lose its force even if it has become a cliche, that those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.<br><br>Those who cannot remember the past ... are sure to inflame those who do.</span><br>See all the bad feeling that has erupted over a few words in a Japanese textbook. Because they're the wrong words. And words are important, as attested by the latest flare-up between China and Japan.<br>Not for the first time, Japanese textbooks downplay atrocities committed by the Emperor's troops during the war between China and Japan in the 1930s. That conflict that became part of a world war in the 1940s, just as those who warned against ignoring aggressors had said it would.<br><br>But in today's Japanese textbooks, what the world knows as the Rape of Nanking has become just an "incident."<br>The Rape of Nanking was no incident. It was a six-week-long massacre. It was a historic European-style horror committed in that Chinese city by Japanese troops in 1937-38.<br>There has never been an accurate tally of the dead. Estimates range from 150,000 to 300,000. In six weeks. Many of the victims were executed by sword or bayonet, up close and hateful. This was the real face of what the Japanese called their Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.<br>This brutal piece of history is still vivid to the Chinese. But in Japan, it's just an "incident," a slight embarrassment, something to dismiss lightly as Just One of Those Things.<br>After all, there are so many "incidents" to overlook. The Rape of Nanking may only be the best known. The Bataan death march, Pearl Harbor and a few other "incidents" give Americans something in common with the Chinese on this score. And telling us to let bygones be bygones only adds to the deep rage those memories can still fuel.<br>Japan's latest denial has provided China with the moral high ground in the long-running competition between the two countries. Hence the huge demonstrations in China against this rewriting of history. Unlike protests against the communist regime, these have at least the authorities' tacit approval. For there's nothing less spontaneous in a communist society than a spontaneous demonstration.<br>This old grievance against Japan makes a perfect stick with which to beat the Japanese when frictions develop over other issues -- like who controls how much of the sea between Japan and China, and all the oil and gas deposits there.<br>For its own good, and not just its own material good, but for the good of its national soul, Japan needs to stop minimizing its old, but still painful, misdeeds.<br>Unlike Germany, Japan has never fully faced its past with all its atrocities and aggressions, which were certainly not limited to the Rape of Nanking. Some countries work through their pasts and become stronger for it. Others try to get around their past and wind up forever in thrall to it.<br>Now that Japan has begun to talk of seeking a seat on the U.N.'s Security Council, Chinese rage grows even greater. But Beijing might want to be careful about demanding moral purity as a qualification for U.N. honors. Communist China's own record -- including the massacre at Tiananmen Square and Mao Tse tung's whole, long and bloody reign -- isn't exactly an exemplary one. China too has a past to be acknowledged.<br>There also is a lesson for Americans. Whenever some injustice from our past resurfaces, the surest reaction from some will be dismayingly like the Japanese to mentions of the Rape of Nanking -- to dismiss, minimize or reduce it to an "incident."<br>But our own resentful reaction to Japan's moral amnesia should tell us something about the importance of re-examining the American past. That includes the treatment of interned Japanese citizens during the Second World War. And the long history of degradation of the American Indians. And the whole, peculiar institution of slavery, followed by the un-American, separate-but-unequal caste system known as segregation.</div>

Unfailingly polite and punctual, they cultivate long-term business ties and always pay their bills, he says.<br><br>Yet even when he and his best clients share a meal and unburden themselves with sake, they studiously steer clear of discussing the past, certainly not the atrocities Japan committed during its World War II-era occupation of China.<br><br>"They have a tendency to avoid sensitive topics," Wang says. He does not. He recently told employees in his Beijing headquarters to join an uprising against Japan and to stop buying Japanese goods, at least through May.<br><br>Surging anti-Japan sentiment, which has plunged relations between Asia's two leading powers into crisis, has been fanned in part by official propaganda and hotheaded Chinese youth who hurl stones into Japan's diplomatic compounds. But pressure on Japan to face up to its history was initiated, and could be sustained well into the future, by people like Wang, 37, who has a master's degree in business, travels abroad, runs his own company and cares passionately about Japanese amnesia.<br><br>Japan has joined traffic jams and the housing bubble as top concerns for China's urban middle class. Entrepreneurs and white-collar professionals have benefited disproportionately from China's economic policies, but many worry their government will not press historical grievances against a major investor and trading partner for long.<br><br>"Our government takes a soft line on foreign policy. They put economic development first," says Li Bin, the chief executive of Nirvana, a health-club chain. "It is critical for successful people to stand up for the rights and interests of the country."<br><br>Such sentiments make the Japan issue - and nationalism generally - double-edged swords for Beijing.<br><br>China reversed course late last month and ordered people to let the government handle Japan itself. The police detained people for organizing illegal marches. But the authorities are clearly worried that patriotic protests could return, perhaps as soon as May 4, the anniversary of a 1919 protest that defined modern Chinese patriotism. More protests could put as much pressure on the Chinese government as they do on Tokyo.<br><br>The Communist Party stirs patriotic feelings to underpin its own legitimacy at a time when few, even in its own ranks, put much faith in socialism.<br><br>Official propaganda and the state-run education system stress the indignities China suffered at the hands of foreign powers from the mid-19th century through World War II.<br><br>Japan, which Beijing says killed or wounded 35 million Chinese from 1937 to 1945, gets the most attention.<br><br>This spring, officials did little to stop a petition drive against Japanese membership in the United Nations Security Council or to discourage a boycott of Japanese goods or even to prevent unusual and sometimes violent street protests. The government used the popular movement as leverage to demand concessions from Tokyo and to flex its muscle at the United Nations.<br><br>But Beijing has never made nationalism the driving force in its foreign policy. The government mainly emphasizes its desire to have a "peaceful rise" that does not impinge on its neighbors, and the authorities are nervous about disrupting the flow of investment and technology that has powered economic growth.<br><br>Moreover, anti-Japan protests have a long and, for the government, a sobering history. A student-led march on May 4, 1919, to protest the decision by the World War I allied powers that allowed Japan to take over Germany's colonial territories in China, spawned Chinese resistance against Western colonialism. But the May 4 movement and similar uprisings, in 1931, 1937 and as recently as 1987, turned against the domestic government, which has often been viewed as too impotent or corrupt to defend national interests.<br><br>"My impression is that the well-educated elite in China are genuinely baffled and upset by how long the government has tolerated provocation from Japan," says Wenran Jiang, an expert on China-Japan relations at the University of Alberta in Canada. "Every anti-Japan movement has sooner or later turned against the government."<br><br>Officials may have turned on the tap of anti-Japanese sentiment to help release pent-up anger and give their diplomacy a boost. But they are having a harder time shutting it off.<br><br>Police have broadcast a blizzard of messages to cellphone users in major cities warning against "spreading rumors, believing rumors, or joining illegal demonstrations."<br><br>In recent days, several organizers of online petition drives and popular protests against Japan have been detained or had their computers confiscated. One major state-run newspaper published a viciously worded editorial warning that anti-Japan protests were cover for an "evil conspiracy" to undermine the government.<br><br>Even so, some urban professionals say they might take to the streets again. Some have promoted a march on May 4, the anniversary of the 1919 movement, despite stern warnings it will not be tolerated.<br><br>"I think we need another march," says Guo Hui, 30, who runs his own public relations company. "I feel it needs to be peaceful and well-organized. But we have to push ahead."<br><br>Guo, who joined demonstrations in mid-April, says he is worried that the momentum the anti-Japan movement generated will fade. He says he hopes a boycott effort against Japanese goods can extend at least into the summer months.<br><br>"The advantage of a march is that you pass many major intersections," he says. "If you hand out literature to people at every intersection, you can really have a huge impact."<br><br>Guo says he has no major grievances against the Chinese government. But during an interview at a Starbucks in Beijing, which Guo records on his handheld computer "to avoid any misunderstandings," he says he tends to care much more about political and diplomatic issues than his parents' generation.<br><br>"They never got involved in anything," he says. "But I think you have certain responsibilities as an individual. If every individual says something, that has much more force than if the Foreign Ministry says it."<br><br>Whether such involvement might lay the foundation for Chinese civil society, injecting a dose of pluralism into policy making, is a matter of debate. The only test of its staying power has been patriotic demonstrations that, at least initially, did not challenge the government.<br><br>But a senior editor at a party newspaper said the persistence of the anti-Japan campaign and the participation of urban professionals had alarmed the authorities. Officials are accustomed to dealing with unrest among peasants and workers who feel defrauded or disenfranchised by China's economic boom, not among the urban elite who are its primary beneficiaries.<br><br>"The white-collar middle class is supposed to be a pillar of stability," the editor said.<br><br>Li, of Nirvana, employs 500 people at his five health clubs in the capital. He travels abroad regularly, he says, but adds, "I get homesick right away."<br><br>On his office wall he has hung pictures of himself with Chinese cultural icons, including the martial-arts actor Jet Li and the film director Zhang Yimou.<br><br>He says his generation feels pride about China's status in the world. But he thinks the Japanese still look down on Chinese, much as they did 60 years ago. "The Japan issue is deep in our bones," he says.</div>

Militaristic greedy politicians who sent their own young boys on suicide bombing missions do not deserve any place of honour among martyrs. Hideki Tojo carried a sword, but unlike the ancestors whose shrines he now shares, he did not die gloriously in battle. After hearing about the defeat of the Japanese forces in Saipan, he hid his shame with a cowardly attempt to put a bullet in his chest, but survived. He was arrested, allowed to nurse back to health, and was enshrined as a martyr after his execution at the war tribunal.<br><br>Alas, his counterpart in Germany wasn't so fortunate. Hitler's birthplace isn't a shrine. Hitler's grave isn't piled with fresh flowers every day. You can't buy tapes of Hitler's speeches on the open streets of Germany. Hitler isn't routinely praised as 'a great patriot' by leading German politicians. Apparently the Germans didn't think every war dead deserves a national burial.</div>

Disputing claims of sovereignty over them have prevented the two countries from signing a peace agreement 60 years after the end of the war.<br><br>When Koizumi went around the islands, he declared them to be Japanese territory. He held off from actually going ashore, but his declaration was sufficient to seriously damage Japan's relations with Russia.<br><br>Koizumi had thought that by offering billions of dollars of Japanese tax-payers' money to help Russia build pipelines to exploit its gas deposits in Siberia, he could ensure that those pipelines would bypass China and deliver the gas to ports north of Vladivostok, convenient for shipping to Japan.<br><br>Russia has now announced that it will probably build a pipeline into China first. This has produced some spluttering in Tokyo among politicians who thought that the pipeline was in the bag. They should reread the anti-Russia nationalist speech that Koizumi made as he traveled around the islands.<br><br>In December, Japan announced that its commitment to work with the United States on developing antimissile defense technology was aimed at the threat from China. Until then, public discussion had made North Korea the fantasy threat to justify joining America's Theater Missile Defense program -- not the real existence of hundreds of nuclear armed missiles in China capable of reaching all of Japan.<br><br>In February the Japanese government further upset the Chinese by agreeing with the U.S. that Taiwan was a "common security issue" in which the U.S.-Japan military alliance had an interest doing "whatever it takes" to defend Taiwan, as U.S. President George W. Bush put it. Although this was known to be the case for some time, it was the first time that the Japanese government had agreed to have it stated so publicly and so baldly.<br><br>In the last six months, Koizumi has had several other significant summit meetings. In November he met with President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo of the Philippines and promised her that Japan would press ahead with plans for a bilateral free-trade agreement.<br><br>Later that month he met Vietnamese Prime Minister Phai Van Thai in Hanoi and said that even though Japan was now in financial difficulties it would still increase aid to Vietnam and support its application to join the World Trade Organization.<br><br>In India, Koizumi followed in the footsteps of Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao, who had signed an agreement with India's Premier Manmohan Singh to establish "strategic partnership for peace and prosperity." Singh said to Wen as he left that "we have started to create new history together."<br><br>Koizumi and Singh signed an eight-point plan setting up a "strategic and cooperative partnership." India's media reaction was to describe Koizumi's visit as "Japan's PM in India to strengthen ties amid rift with China."<br><br>In Pakistan, where the Chinese and Pakistani premiers had strengthened their economic and military ties through an "all-weather partnership of friendship, cooperation and good neighborly relations" a few days earlier, Koizumi held discussions on a wide range of bilateral issues. He trumped the Chinese offers of friendship with a promise to restart the soft loan aid program that Japan stopped after Pakistan tested its nuclear weapons in 1998.<br><br>Upon hearing that, Pakistani President Shaukat Aziz said this meant that Japan would regain its "position as Pakistan's principal development partner."<br><br>With Taiwan, Vietnam, India and Pakistan, a pattern emerges. Having gotten up Russia's nose with his trip to the southern Kurils, Koizumi has moved on to the Chinese, who have been, as you might imagine, irritated by these "containment activities."<br><br>After Pakistan, Koizumi traveled to Europe and pressed the European Union to "proactively approach Japan and East Asia," as this "should lead to the world's stability and prosperity." He explained by telling the Europeans that Japan does not want the EU to end its embargo on arms sales to China.<br><br>He also made it clear that he expects EU support for Japan's bid for a permanent seat on the U.N. Security Council. This would be against the strongly expressed wish of China; China has a veto on such decisions in the U.N., as does Russia.<br><br>In Europe, Koizumi has pressed the EU to locate the new $10 billion nuclear fusion research station in Japan rather than in France. ITER is a massive new research project designed to generate electricity from the sort of nuclear fusion that powers the sun. The project will create about 10,000 jobs.<br><br>Japan is lobbying hard for ITER to be built in Japan. ITER is being financed by Japan, the U.S., South Korea, the EU, Russia and China. Russia and China have said they are against the project being located in Japan. I wonder why.</div>

Japanese is regaining their old nationalist habits because the LDP are still in great influence.<br><br>Look, both China and Japan are both walking in the same direaction and will soon prove that they are superior in every ways,<br><br>2. China is as guilty as trying to whitewash their own history as Japan. A report in IHT (If I remember right..? Or is it Newpaper.. take from IHT?) says that Chinese government during the cultural revolution made many mistakes that costs lives more than what the Japanese did, and they quickly remove all traces of those decisions from the textbooks.<br><br>Believe it or not, your choice. But I am not surprised.<br><br>When I took business chinese module, the China teacher was clearly trying to drive into us her propaganda of Chinese superiority in front of all other races by stressing examples of inventions and history - especially towards America and Japan.

Japanese are evil and she always potray them as demons.<br><br>3.  To me, they are both the same just that one will be more powerful and we will be needing the Chinese market for our own profit. So naturally, if I must choose, it has nothing to do with morality.<br><br>4. I am a pure chinese, my father was born in Shanghai. To me, they are the same.. both nationalist morons desecrating wartime crimes and exploiting human emotions and empathy for their stupid national idealogies.<br><br>So while we kept flaming Japan, we should also put a close eye on Chinese nationalism. Both are as guilty as each other for trying to be the next Nazi empire.<br><br>This is what I think.</div>

It was a slightly cooler stage than the red-hot phase the two countries had been in for more than a month. Yet to the dismay of China, the increasingly assertive Tokyo seems reluctant to move. Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi expressed Â“deep remorseÂ” for his countryÂ’s World War II aggression. But his apology came just hours after Japanese lawmakers visited the Yasukuni shrine. China and Japan has entered a new cycle of confrontation.<br><br>JapanÂ’s latest moves indicate that it intends to shift to the right. Once again, the whole affair has renewed an argument over the cliche of Â“A rearmed Japan-a myth or reality?Â” The latest development is reminiscent of JapanÂ’s 1999 confirmation of its flag and hymn. At that time, JapanÂ’s leftists saw the confirmation of the Â“HinomaruÂ” and Â“KimigayoÂ” as a step on the way toward militarization. Japanese officials are now contemplating the prospect of changing JapanÂ’s constitution to annul Article 9, in which Japan renounces the sovereign right to wage war. Former U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell told Japanese officials last August that <span style="color: red;">Tokyo would need to revise Article 9 if the country were to attain a permanent United Nations Security Council seat.</span><br><br>Japan had clung desperately to the Â“Yoshida doctrine,Â” a deal that relieves it from the responsibility and expense of rearming itself and let it focus on fostering its economy. Yet the disturbing state of affairs in and around Japan is compelling it to change the status quo. Currently, there are three factors in TokyoÂ’s decision to switch its course: ChinaÂ’s looming as the worldÂ’s next superpower, the Washington-Pyongyang nuclear standoff, as well as JapanÂ’s long-moribund economy. Specifically, JapanÂ’s sick economy is fanning the flames of chauvinism. The rise in jingoism bolstered JapanÂ’s long-dormant desire to become a Â‘normalÂ’ nation.<br><br>The most important element in JapanÂ’s shift in course is WashingtonÂ’s tacit approval of JapanÂ’s high-profile efforts to develop its own military capability. The Bush administration is making stepped-up efforts to address North KoreaÂ’s threats and ChinaÂ’s rise. Washington perceives its close ally South KoreaÂ’s intransigence. Thus Washington is playing the Japan card. Japan is emerging as the U.S.Â’s Â“deputy sheriff in the Pacific.Â”<br><br>Yet WashingtonÂ’s silent consent to JapanÂ’s military build-up could well boomerang against it. As Japan is preoccupied with developing its own independent military capabilities, it might pay less attention to its alliance with the United States. Within the depths of the Pentagon and the U.S. intelligence community, one hears an argument. It goes like this: There are two rising powers in Asia. The two rising powers are China and Japan. <span style="color: red;">In the long run, a strong Japan might slip out of Uncle SamÂ’s grasp. WashingtonÂ’s hopes for teaming up with Japan to contain the Middle Kingdom may then evaporate.</span></div>

It has been in place since 1989 and has become a sore point in China-European relations.<br><br>Meanwhile, James Soong, a Taiwan opposition leader visiting the mainland, said Taiwan must learn to cooperate with China. (Page 3)<br><br>Noting that Luxembourg still has six weeks as the EU's presiding country, he said, "In six weeks a lot of things can happen." He added that "with efforts on both sides," there may be a decision on lifting the ban "in these six weeks or out of these six weeks."<br><br>The proposed new treaty that EU and Chinese officials announced Wednesday would replace the current treaty between the EU and China, which was signed in 1985 and "simply doesn't reflect any more the whole breadth or scope of this partnership," said Benita Ferrero-Waldner, the European commissioner for external relations.<br><br>The agreement will replace the current treaty between the EU and China, which was signed in 1985 and "simply doesn't reflect anymore the whole breadth or scope of this partnership," Ferrero-Waldner said.<br><br>New ties will grow from trade and economics into such areas as technological research, environmental questions and overall political and diplomatic considerations.<br><br>The China-EU agreement will be a measure of the two sides' growing international weight, Ferrero-Waldner said.<br><br>"We are both emerging global players," she told a press briefing in Beijing, "and therefore our relationship is not only bilateral, but also international, about a relationship that is a global one. We are deeply committed to going on and strengthening and deepening this partnership, which we see as a formidable opportunity."<br><br>The announcement of new treaty negotiations comes at a difficult time in European-Chinese relations over the arms embargo.<br><br>Relations also have been riled by the EU's decision to begin an investigation that may choke off China's growing exports of garments to Europe.<br><br>But the EU's "troika" of foreign policy leaders said they hoped their two-day visit to Beijing to mark the 30th anniversary of China-EU diplomatic relations would help defuse these disputes and advance the two sides' "strategic partnership."<br><br>The three EU leaders are Ferrero-Waldner, who coordinates EU foreign policy, Asselborn; and Christopher Hum, ambassador to China from Britain, which holds the next presidency.<br><br>Ferrero-Waldner said the EU was committed to solving these disputes through dialogue with China.<br><br>S said they would not derail growing ties between China and Europe. "Our objective is to find a solution without recourse to safeguard measures," she said of the looming garment dispute.<br><br>She was referring to special World Trade Organization rules that can be used to choke off the flow of exports in extraordinary circumstances.<br><br>In Brussels, however, several EU member countries called on the organization to speed up and expand the investigation into Chinese garment exports. France, Spain, Italy, Belgium, Greece and Portugal supported the request, Agence France-Presse reported.<br><br>The EU trade commissioner, Peter Mandelson, in April opened an inquiry to examine whether China's surging garment exports were threatening European manufacturers to the point that export restrictions are justified.<br><br>China's garment exports to Europe of some types of clothing grew by over 500 percent in the first months of this year compared to the same time last year.<br><br>While welcoming the EU delegation, Chinese diplomats said they were unhappy with the EU's postponement of lifting the arms ban and rejected linking of a decision on that issue to improvements in China's human rights, and also objected to any caps on exports.<br><br>"Linking the lifting of the arms embargo to human rights is unreasonable and unhelpful," said China's foreign minister, Li Zhaoxing, at a joint press briefing with the EU officials. He said that by "imposing" its human rights standards on other countries, the EU was "itself flouting human rights."<br><br>"We oppose linking the question of lifting the ban to human rights," said Liu Jianchao, a Chinese foreign spokesman, at a press briefing on Tuesday. "China will continue to improve its human rights, but that should by no means be relevant to the lifting of the arms of the arms embargo."<br><br>Ferrero-Waldner also denied that the EU had made any explicit demands for human rights improvements in China before the ban was lifted. But she said China would "help" its case by demonstrating better treatment of its citizens, especially by ratifying the UN Covenant on Civic and Political Rights.<br><br>China signed that covenant in 1998 but has so far failed to ratify it, which would oblige China to bring many of its laws into line with the covenant.<br><br>"We need to have to persuade our public opinion, for instance also our European Parliament, that China is making concrete steps to improve human rights," she said. "China also needs to help us to turn the page."<br><br>Another member of the EU delegation said it would also seek the release of political prisoners jailed during China's 1989 crackdown, loosening of restrictions on China's press, and also an undertaking from China to overhaul its "labor-re-education camps" that allow for imprisonment without trial.<br><br>China has also said it will "resolutely oppose" any caps the EU or United States places on China's garment exports. China's garment exports to Europe would be allowed to grow "at a normal speed," said Ferrero-Waldner.<br><br>But the EU would also act to stop what she called "serious market disruption."<br><br>But EU officials sought to reach beyond these disputes and show that China and the EU were now important partners on the international stage.<br><br>"We should not let the arms embargo overshadow our relationship," said Ferrero-Waldner.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>JAPAN'S FORMAL WAR on China began in 1931, and Japan occupied parts of China--two-thirds of the country at its peak--until the end of the war in 1945. The Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal and Chinese war historians estimate deaths resulting from the Japanese occupation at 10 million to 30 million. These figures, which some Chinese activists hope to revise upward, reflect deaths from massacre, attack, forced starvation and germ warfare.<br><br>According to Japan's government admissions, the testimony of Japanese soldiers, and Chinese survivors, Japanese soldiers routinely killed civilians in brutal ways. They raped women and turned them into sex slaves. Japanese doctors performed medical experiments without anesthesia. Prisoners were subjected to amputation and frozen alive. Epidemics were unleashed on Chinese and POW populations through germ-warfare experiments. But the incident which stands out most in the Chinese mind for its unbridled brutality is the Nanking massacre.<br><br>On the morning of Dec. 13, 1937--59 years ago this week--roughly 50,000 Japanese soldiers captured China's capital city, Nanking. Many residents had already fled Nanking before the invasion, including my grandparents. A new Chinese capital was founded in Chung King, in the Sichun province where my mother was born. Yet, according to historians, more than half a million Chinese remained trapped in Nanking. On that fateful invasion 59 years ago, the Japanese there were given the order to kill all captives. During the ensuing chaos, commonly referred to as the "Rape of Nanking," between 200,000 and 300,000 or more Chinese lost their lives to Japanese soldiers, according to court records and historians.<br><br>As the stories go--recorded in international newspapers, Chinese government and academic documents, Japanese photographs and in the diaries of Red Cross officials stationed in Nanking--the Japanese killed so many men, women and children with machetes that their arms became tired and they had to rest before they continued. The soldiers also used bayonets, machine guns, live burial and fire. Decapitation was popular, evidenced by dozens of photographs in James Yin Shi Young's The Rape of Nanking (Innovative Publishing Group, 1996). Chinese heads were fed to the dogs. Women were raped, forced to perform bizarre sexual acts, then killed. Fathers were forced to rape their daughters, and sons, their mothers. Chinese men were forced to rape corpses. Competitions took place among Japanese soldiers to see how many Chinese they could kill in one day.<br><br>For six to eight weeks, the horrors in Nanking continued unabated. After World War II, while the Germans were preparing for trial at Nuremberg, the U.S., represented by General Douglas MacArthur, brokered secret deals with the Japanese government. In exchange for their research on germ warfare and human biology, the murderous actions of the Japanese in China and elsewhere in the Pacific would be ignored. Even today, the germ-warfare research which the U.S. obtained, and which some believe may explain some POW illnesses, has not been declassified.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>UNLIKE THE OUTRAGE over the actions of the Nazis, there has been little international recognition of Japanese war crimes. While the Germans have formally apologized many times, the Japanese emperor still has not. Some conservative Japanese believe the massacre never happened. Many continue to honor war criminals at national shrines. In 1979, when the U.S. first compiled a list of 60,000 European war criminals who were not allowed to travel to the United States, there was no list of Japanese war criminals. There were no memorials erected to honor the Chinese dead, nor to sear the memory of atrocities committed in China into the American conscience.<br><br>Only in 1995, on the 50th anniversary of the end of the war, did the Diet house of the Japanese parliament pass a resolution expressing "deep remorse"over Japan's World War II actions, noting simultaneously that such actions took place in the context of worldwide "colonial rules and acts of aggression." Soon after, Japanese Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama made a "personal" statement expressing his remorse, in which he called Japanese actions a "mistake" which would not be repeated. Otherwise, the official Japanese position is that war-crimes issues were settled at the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal--after which seven Japanese high-ranking officers were hanged, and at subsequent war-crimes trials in China. The issue of reparations was settled in the 1951 San Francisco Peace Treaty, where an approximate $15-per-head payment for POWs was awarded for distribution to the Red Cross. There were no other reparations to victims of the war by Japan.<br><br>China, roiling with an internal war after World War II, has done little of note to hold the Japanese responsible for its military actions. And the Chinese here have only begun to give voice to their seething anger over the Japanese occupation. My mother, for example, cannot look at photos of naked Chinese women forced into sexual positions by the Japanese (carried in soldiers' wallets), or of bayoneted bodies and mass graves. Yet she recently donated money to a campaign conducted by local Chinese to place an ad in the New York Times protesting permanent membership in the U.N. Security Council for Japan; and she volunteered at the recent International Symposium on Japanese Responsibility for World War II Atrocities at Stanford.<br><br>ONLY IN THE LAST decade, since the communist Chinese government's killing of students in Tiananmen Square inspired massive protests, have American-based Chinese begun to protest publicly in their adopted nation. As Chinese here feel more comfortable as citizens, their children, American-born upstarts like myself, have begun to ask questions about World War II. And we wonder why we did not learn of the Japanese massacres in school.<br><br>Now, the Japanese threat to the Diaoyutai Islands, a hundred miles from the shores of Taiwan, has prompted vigorous activism around Japanese militarism, much of it centered in Silicon Valley--specifically, at the Cupertino-based Alliance to Preserve the Truth of the Sino-Japanese War. Through Web sites, email, and fundraising from a large and largely affluent population of Chinese here, Santa Clara County is a stronghold of Chinese efforts to hold Japan accountable for its wartime crimes. At Stanford last weekend, more than 250 people--including Japanese, Koreans and American POWs--gathered for a three-day conference to discuss legal avenues for international justice, for victim reparations and, above all, for apologies from the Japanese. There was talk of a permanent memorial or museum. As one organizer put it, "We seek justice." The U.S. government is beginning to respond. Last week, the Justice Department issued a list of 16 Japanese war-crimes suspects barred from the U.S.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>How did you become interested in this topic?<br><br>My parents told me stories about the atrocities when I was a little girl. I found it hard to believe at that time, but they said that it was so bad that the surface of the Yangtze River was literally covered with bodies and blood. My grandparents were almost separated during World War II, and my mother almost died because the Japanese had bombed the hospital where my grandmother had been staying when she was pregnant with my mom back in 1940. And when I was a little girl, I tried to find information on the rape of Nanking in the local library, but there was nothing there. This was in Illinois. Later on, in college, I tried finding information, but it became clear no one had written a book that had penetrated the mass consciousness. There have been books, but they tend to be compilations of some of the documents generated from that time--nothing the mass media would pick up. So I decided to work on it.<br><br>My mother will start to cry when she thinks about what the Japanese did in China. It's hard for her to discuss. How did it feel for you to be immersed in this material?<br><br>It was very difficult. The Global Alliance for Preserving the Truth of the Sino-Japanese war had put together a conference in December of 1994, which I attended. I remember being in that conference hall looking at all these photos of decapitated bodies and women who had been horribly mutilated after rape. I was walking around in a state of shock. [During research at the National Archives and] at the Yale Divinity School Library, in the beginning, when I would read a passage about a Japanese atrocity, I had to look away from the page. ... It's really frightening how fast you get used to the atrocities, because after a while I stopped having that reaction. Part of you wants to stay sensitive, but the only way to deal with the atrocities and to protect yourself psychologically is to numb your mind to it ... It's very, very easy to just accept these atrocities and almost see them as banal. It really gave me insight into the true nature of evil and how easily we all can become desensitized.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Do you talk about this project with your parents?<br><br>Yes, I have. Actually, when I showed my father some of the Nazi diaries that I had discovered, when he read them, he burst into tears.<br><br>A Jewish friend of mine had some problems with the use of the word "holocaust" to describe what happened in China. Have you encountered resistance to the use of that word?<br><br>Not at this point. Most of my Jewish friends are very interested in this topic because they say they are sensitive to genocide issues and they feel that this is an important story. My book is not an attempt to show that one ethnic group's suffering was worse than another's. But it's important to focus on the truth of what happened.<br><br>Is this generally taught in textbooks in the United States?<br><br>We're seeing in San Francisco [in the San Francisco Unified School District], children will be required to learn about the Japanese atrocities committed during the rape of Nanking. It's the beginning of a trend of increased awareness on the subject. [But, generally,] there's very little. I think Americans are abysmally ignorant about this, and it's not really their fault because there's very little written about it.<br><br>There was an apology by the Japanese Prime Minister in 1995, but most Chinese feel that apology was weak, hardly enough. What do people want?<br><br>At a minimum, what the Asian community wants from the Japanese is a full and sincere apology to all of its victims from World War II. Reparations for victims. A guarantee that the next generation of Japanese schoolchildren will be taught the full extent of wartime atrocities committed by the Japanese. That's a good start. Right now, in Germany, it's against the law not to teach the Holocaust in public schools. Contrast this with Japan, which for decades has systematically covered [Japanese war crimes] up. They whitewashed it from their textbooks. ... During the rape of Nanking--just that incident alone--the number of deaths that resulted surpasses the death toll, the immediate death toll, of the victims of Nagasaki and Hiroshima combined. That's just one incident. And the rape of Nanking was not a unique and isolated incident. There were so many similar atrocities that occurred all throughout China. So few people even know about [them].<br><br>What did you learn had happened in Nanking?<br><br>In Nanking, babies were thrown in the air and bayoneted on the way down. Some people were buried waist deep and torn apart by German shepherds. People were killed in any manner you could imagine. I mean, fire, freezing, mutilation, explosion. ... Prisoners were used for bayonet practice. Women's %^**@^s were cut off. Men were castrated. I have read accounts of tanks being stuck, not able to go across a ditch because the ditch was empty, and so they would round up all the civilians in the area, men, women, children, and shoot them all down and they'd put their bodies in the ditch so the tank could go over it. I could go on for days. ... It was horrifying. ... And it's amazing how some of the people survived. Women hid in holes in the ground. Some women dressed in rags, or shaved their heads and smeared soot over their faces so they would appear to be too ugly or diseased to be raped. ... There were people who pretended to be dead, then clawed their way out of half-buried graves or hid under mounds of bodies. I read one account in which a Buddhist nun and a little girl hid for several days, almost a week, and they didn't dare open their eyes. And they were covered with other bodies. They just lay like that, pretending to be dead, until they were rescued later.<br><br>In your research you've come across the diaries of German Nazis stationed in China. One man in particular, Rabe, head of the International Committee for the Nanking Safety Zone, risked his life trying to protect the Chinese. Why were the Nazis helping the Chinese?<br><br>You have to understand that some of the people who were members of the Nazi party had not been in Germany for many decades. So they did not understand the extent of activities the Nazis were engaged in in Germany. In fact, they were probably more Chinese in heart and soul than they were German. And many of them thought of the Nazi party as a socialist party. John Rabe, who was head of the local Nazi party, I consider something of the Oskar Schindler of China because he risked his life to protect all of these citizens, and later on he was punished by the Germans for this because he was aiding the citizens of an enemy country. After the war, he was denounced [by the Allies] for being a member of the Nazi party, even though he was in China and had saved all those hundreds of thousands of lives. There were more than 100,000 people crammed into the Safety Zone in Nanking, which was only about 2 1/2 square miles. Members of the Safety Zone Committee protected women from rape. They risked their lives to cart in food. Many of them endured physical violence by the Japanese for protecting Chinese. They were all routinely slapped or beaten up. ... For years afterwards, many of them were psychologically scarred. One would have complete amnesia when attempting to talk about it. And at least one woman committed suicide when she was in the zone. Her name was Minnie Vautrin; she has a diary which I found at Yale. She's like the Anne Frank of China because she kept daily diaries--they are so compelling, and I would like to make sure her diary is published.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There is an argument that the Japanese may have committed atrocities, and they should be recognized, but there was never this sort of gas-chamber, mechanized attempt to kill all the Chinese as there was to kill all the Jews. Do you see that as a difference between the two "holocausts"?<br><br>Obviously the Japanese could never be able to exterminate all of the Chinese people. There's so many of them. But they wanted to make an example of Nanking, and I would say the method of execution was quite systematic. Of course, it wasn't as systematic as what the Germans did to the Jews. The Japanese used swords and knives. They used machine guns and fire. But the results were horrifying. It wasn't as systematic, it wasn't as "clean." What happened in Nanking was actually quite messy.<br><br>Do you think the lack of action on the part of the U.S. just after the war had anything to do with Asian racism that was going on during World War II?<br><br>I think there were many, many factors involved. For one thing, Japan was seen primarily as a victim after World War II because of the dropping of the A-bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The whole issue of Japanese wartime responsibility is so controversial precisely because it's tied in with the American bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. On one hand, we have this image of the Japanese as being these suicidal bombers, these warriors, these perpetrators of atrocities like the rape of Nanking, but on the other hand we have these images of innocent Japanese civilians with their skin falling off from the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. ... Secondly, the Chinese themselves did not make a big issue about it. After 1949, there were two Chinas--and both Taiwan and the PROC had economic and political reasons for being on good terms with the Japanese. ... In the United States there weren't as many Asians at that time, and I also think this was not something that really interested many people. Let me give you an example: John Taylor is military reference librarian at the National Archives. He told me that when all the Japanese records were seized by the United States and brought to the national archives, the U.S. government funded less than a third of the documents to be microfilmed. Whereas, all the records that the Americans had seized from Germany were microfilmed and processed. Most of the Japanese documents were sent back. They did not spend as much effort trying to understand the Japanese mentality, the Japanese records, as they did with the German records. That's a fact.<br><br>Which leads us to the current situation in which perhaps most Americans don't know what the Japanese did. They know we fought a war against the Japanese, but they don't understand that there were atrocities going on in Japan that were similar to what the Germans were doing in Europe.<br><br>And in some ways even worse. For instance, one out of about 20 POWs captured by the Germans died, but in Japan it was roughly one out of three. Historians have found that the Japanese treated their POWs much worse than the Germans had. Now that's a fact. There's a great deal that the Americans need to know about the entire Asian side of World War II.<br><br>After the war, the United States agreed not to prosecute the Japanese for the same war crimes that the Germans were being prosecuted for. Now there is this movement to try to recall the charges that were lost. Why do you think anyone will be successful today?<br><br>In the past, the Chinese learned from their ancestors and their parents that politics can be deadly. People who came to this country came based on their scientific or technical expertise, and they had learned from their parents or from their own experiences that it's probably best to stay away from politics. That's why you see a tradition of Chinese political apathy in this country. But in the last few years we've seen an increase in Chinese activism. Now we have the first international conference to discuss legal strategies to force the Japanese to pay reparations for wartime crimes. It was only just a few years ago that the Korean comfort women issue was first addressed. The first major conference in this area on the Nanking massacre was held just two years ago. ... So, why now? I would say that demographically, there are more Asians here, they have more economic clout, they're more politically sophisticated. There's a whole new generation of Chinese-Americans who are going into fields that are traditionally non-science--literature, or filmmaking--and I think that's important, too. Almost every Chinese-American family has had some kind of experience with World War II, in many cases, dead relatives. All of these forces are contributing to the organization that we're seeing. ... Look at this conference. It's drawing people from all over the world, from more than 50 organizations. I think we will see cooperation, a systematic plan by organizations, and a movement that will force the Japanese to take them seriously.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>On China-Japan Dispute, Western Pundits Show Anti-China Bias</strong><br><span class="small">Commentary, Philip Cunningham<br>Pacific News Service, Apr 19, 2005</span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Editor's Note: Why is it so hard for Westerners to understand China's rage about a concerted Japanese effort to rewrite history? PNS contributor Philip J. Cunningham is a Fulbright fellow looking at media images in Japan and China. He is based in Kyoto, Japan, and currently writing from Beijing.</span><br><br>BEIJING--The tendency for the Western media to tacitly side with Japan in the latest volatile history tiff with China is predictable, given ideological proclivities and insecurities about China's rise. But it is hypocritical and ultimately self-destructive to remain silent as Japan goes about, in a determined and sustained way, rewriting history.<br><br>In the "New History Textbook," Japan's invasion of northeast China is no longer termed an invasion, comfort women are erased from the record and the Nanking Massacre is dismissed as a controversial "incident."<br><br>The textbooks are just the tip of an iceberg as Japan's post-war ruling party revives militaristic values in Yasukuni Shrine rituals, reinstates obligatory school ceremonies involving the controversial wartime flag and anthem and continues to chip away at broadly received historical narratives, as it has done since Prime Minister Nakasone announced his proactive vision for a strong Japan.<br><br>Do Americans, who sacrificed so many of their "greatest generation" to defeat Japanese fascism really want to live in a world where the massacre of America's steadfast allies in Nanking is reduced to a non-event? Where Pearl Harbor is repainted as a justified attack? Is the United States ready to live in a world where the war against Japan was but an example of white man's racism?<br><br>Anyone comfortable with such conclusions can make light of China's anguish about Japan's rewriting of history. Of course respectable pundits never go so far; they prefer to chastise China with blinders on, conveniently forgetting the freedoms they enjoy are dependent and directly related to the sacrifices made by the Allies, including China, in the world war against fascism. The World War II memorial in Washington correctly recognizes China's contribution, as does the composition of the U.N. Security Council, where China has a coveted permanent seat with veto powers.<br><br>China is a big country with big problems, but it is unpopular for all the wrong reasons. Anachronistic Cold War ideologues hate China for being too communist, while beleaguered manufacturers and protectionists hate China for being too capitalistic. America hates China for not letting its people demonstrate, while Japan hates China for letting its people demonstrate.<br><br>Western punditry on the latest outburst ranges from triumphant condescension to feigned neutrality: "Settling scores is for small minds." "China is pushing and scripting protests." Anger about whitewashed textbooks can't possibly be sincere, so it must be government-manipulated. Japan apologized already, get over it. Why can't you Asians get along?<br><br>Daniel Lynch writes in the Asian Wall Street Journal that China's outburst reflects a desire to "control history writing in Asia." But is China's take on Imperial Japan -- that it was wrong to invade, wrong to cross the sea to kill, rape, plunder and colonize -- really all that different from America's?<br><br>Former U.S. China Ambassador James Lilley suggests it is somehow below the dignity of the United States to get involved in little island disputes or questions of history. But what about U.S. involvement in the Falklands conflict? What about Grenada? What about the Gulf of Tonkin, for that matter?<br><br>Michael Eliott of Time magazine said just before the recent flare-up that "those nervous spats between China and Japan have one prayer: that the U.S. will continue to hug Asia's powers in a comforting embrace." Prayer? Hugs?<br><br>Philip Bowring, writing in the International Herald Tribune, belittles Asian tensions as "historical mudslinging." He mocks Beijing, saying, "any country that purports to want greater Asian representation deserves bitter criticism if in practice it thwarts the aspirations of Japan and India" to gain Security Council seats. What of China's support for India's bid, and U.S. unwillingness to support the same?<br><br>The Economist leans heavily on Japan's side, making the lop-sided and condescending suggestion that in return for Japan withholding approval of the textbooks, China should give up propaganda and be serious about "negotiations about disputed waters," putting the onus on Beijing.<br><br>Japan Times contributor Gregory Clark, a contrarian and revisionist known for his dubious claim that the Tiananmen Massacre is a myth, comes as close as any commentator in memory in justifying Japan's attack on China and then Pearl Harbor, blaming the WWII attacks on "anti-Japan boycotts and incidents in China" and U.S. "racist anti-Japanese policies."<br><br>Japanese accusations of racism are not without merit. Indeed, it is a form of reverse racism that the West demands more of Germany's reckoning with history, and gets it. Japan's cultural and geographic distance from Europe reinforces a sense of exotic differentness. "If Americans come from Mars and Europeans come from Venus," writes the Arts and Letters Daily, published by the Chronicle of Higher Education, "what is the home planet of the Japanese? Saturn?"<br><br>But there is only one world, and on this one little planet there is room for only so much disagreement on documented historic matters. When it comes to the Holocaust, most Westerners appreciate the fact that recklessly rewriting history is not OK. Why is it so hard, then, for opinion leaders in the West to see that denying Nanking or the existence of comfort women or Japan's invasion of Asia is deeply infuriating?<br><span class="small"><br>Source: <a href="http://www.cctr.ust.hk/articles/chinabias.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.cctr.ust.hk/articles/chinabias.htm</a></span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The real issue for Japan is, IMV, the type of relationship she wants to maintain with her close neighbours, principally China, Russia and Korea but more particularly, China.<br><br>Russia poses no real threat in the foreseeable future; the dispute over the Kurile islands is a relatively contained issue that will probably be resolved through diplomacy.<br><br>The threat from N Korea is essentially the nuclear arms issue. This issue, will IMO, be resolved eventually by Pyong Yang opening up its nuclear facilities for inspection in return for economic aid, principally from the US, Japan and S Korea.<br><br>The long-term concern for Japan is, I believe, ChinaÂ’s future economic dominance and military power. ChinaÂ’s long-term vision is to grow its economy, firstly to satisfy the needs of its huge population and secondly to attain the status of a major global power. Here, we are talking of many decades required for that level of development and growth.<br><br>In order to achieve its vision, China needs to have peaceful relationships with her trading partners. Hence, whilst China will compete for influence, access to resources and markets, etc. she will not want to (with the exception of the issue over Taiwan) bring about military conflict that will jeopardise these goals. The question for Japan is how will she manage the relationship with a close dominant neighbour. IMV, it will be a dangerous strategy to try to obstruct China from realizing its long-term goals or to affect its Â“core interestsÂ”, ie Taiwan. Remilitarizing Japan (ie going far beyond legitimate self-defence capacity) will not help safeguard her future. This will be perceived negatively by China and others and may back-fire.<br><br>IMV the best course for Japan (and others) is to engage China, help open up its society and induce more democratic reforms. A democratic China is the safest China for Japan and its neighbours, in fact, for everybody<br></div>
