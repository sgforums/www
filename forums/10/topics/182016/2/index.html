            <div class='col-md body'>What's the point of staying here? FTs come to increase the cost of your housing, they take your jobs, get hardwhip allowance for coming here, they take your women and men, leaving you stuck without a mate. The govt in all their wisdom decides to skirt the issue and come up with a romancing singapore to encourage more FTs to marry locals.<br><br>In shops, even the majority race gets discrminated against. When a FT punches and permanantly scars a local, he pays the same price for eating on the train or littering, $1000, not even a pinch of his high pay.<br><br>The burden of citizenship is fighting and dying for your country, but is there an advantage of citizenship? Isn't it very stupid to continue to sarcrifice time, money, effort and your entire life in service to an uncaring pap corporation?<br><br>Remember, this is not a nanny state, no one cares if you live or die. No one cares if you die for the country or not, unless you're rich, then the nation will morn for the lose of your tax money.</div>

Yes, every country expects the same burden of citizenship from her citizens. Germany gives welfare, US gives money for Army Reserves. Taiwanese and Koreans are protected from foreign floodgate.<br><br>Singapore opens floodgate for foreigners but does not gives its citizens any benefits better than foreigners, so i refuse to sign the social contract.

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes, I think Calvin is saying that Singapore does not value the contributions of its NS men enough. There is little advantage in defending Singapore, 'not sparring your life bood', as the SAF oath states. As the EDB Chairman so eloquently put it, he would rather give his scholarships and jobs to women and foreigners. Elites and foreign talents can avoid the rigors of NS and get ahead of you in seniority and pay..<br><br>If the country does not recognize your sacrifice, why bother? You have to think for yourself and do whatever is best for you and your family.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>now I shall not question if the chap's loyalty and blood is up for sale to the highest bidder, or to the country that accords him the highest privileges and benefits of citizenship.<br><br>my point is that the "social contract" which includes the "burdens" of citizenship, still stands, no other country in the world will as foreigners to help defend her (unless you're kuwait, and you have something the world needs badly), that burden has always fallen onto her citizens, and her citizens alone (now i'm repeating myself again ...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> )<br><br>and this FT flood is not limited to just Singapore alone ... you should know that too, OM, where you are right now, eh ? ...<br><br>across the country where I am, I see legions of people from the very same countries that's "flooding" Singapore right now too ... I see illegals working at take-outs and as delivery boys, professors who can barely speak proper English teaching maths and engineering, professionals on work permits working at local companies, and making the local curry resturants and dim sum places bustling ... and more too !, refugees and economic migrants from eastern europe, Africa trouble spots, south america, they are all here, too ! ...<br><br>the global economy, as the chap put it, hasn't erased away national boundaries, it has only made international competition more keenly felt at each national level, if you think Singapore is being flooded with foreigners, go take a holiday in vancouver for instance, first time I touched down, I thought i landed in Hong kong ! ... I once thought that we should limit foreigners here in Singapore, but now I conclude that doing that would be economic suicide, foreign competition is an inexorable force, this "FT" effect would be felt everywhere, sooner or later ...<br><br>as to the "social contract", please refer to my previous posts, it certainly exist too in other countries, infact, as one of my local friends so succintly put it:" I have no problems with foreigners coming here, but it's not about eating sushi and kebabs alone, are they willing to be loyal to this country and not to their native countries ? " .... yes, I get this sort of thing to my face ... (beer sessions make conversations flow). so, the expectation of the social contract is still there.<br><br>note that I'm not talking about fighting and dying for the flag now, or even to fight to defend your loved ones, if you think these are abstract concepts irrelevant to today's global ecnomies, and everyone should try to do the best for themselves, fine, but of course, in another country, you'll be the FT/job snatcher/leacher/whatever ... and not only do you loose your bitching rights, you'll be the subject of the natives' bitching too ...<br><br>In the end, I suspect that the real reason is that some chaps are simply sore about serving NS, am I right ? ...<br><br></div>
