I will however fight with and for singaporeans (brothers).<br><br>The government has to sincerely consider rewarding/treating  citizens and its conscript/reservists a little better. We aint the government's bitch. Just because we are poor dint mean we are expendable and that we will fight for rich man's assets. Close the income gap and we might just stay and fight!</div>
