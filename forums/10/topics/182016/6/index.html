If so full of nationalistic pride, dun become begging dogs when people get glory outside. Its shameful.<br><br>Everything about sg's system is to serve its 'leaders' 1st and the people 2nd.<br><br>Staying in sg is just like living in a chicken farm factory. U're cooped up, not given the freedom to develop as an individual. U grow according to the plan your masters have for you. U're fed and protected from outside predators but only because its to your master's own advantage, and ultimately u sacrifice so THEY can get richer and fatter.<br><br>U can continue seeing those who leave as quitters but how many of u have the guts to be a wild chicken and rsk the fox and live and die for yourself and no one else? And shame on those few who betray their fellow chicken to speak falsely and flatteringly of their masters, in return for a few more grains of feed.<br><br>People with no honour should just shut up and slink back to hide behind their master's feets than to come out here and bark.
