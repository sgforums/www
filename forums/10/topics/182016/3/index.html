This is exactly what you said:<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Calvin86:</div><div class="quote_body">If the surveys shows that i am the minority, i have to seriously rethink about my views.</div></blockquote>In other words, what you're saying is that you are going to let your own personal viewpoints be swayed by what the majority thinks. You would rather be 'following the crowd' and blindly follow the results of a single survey (how big is your survey size anyway) rather than risk being in the minority.<br><br>Still, I disagree with your stand, and if war were to ever come to our shores, I seriously hope that I will not be ordered to use my SAR-21 on deserters. I want to spray 5.56mm rounds at my enemies, and not at fellow Singaporeans who simply don't like the way things are run around here.<br><br>I already told you: I will not fight for those politicians with their fat paychecks in their ivory towers. I will fight for my family and friends not because everyone else is doing it... but because they are the ones I truly love and cherish.<br><br>Even so, as much as I disagree with your stand, your credibility will take a beating if you just blindly follow the crowd.<br><br></div>
