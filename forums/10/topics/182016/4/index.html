Compared to them, our NS is no big deal...at the very least, we don't have to face real bullets and suicide bombers. Apparently although national service there is compulsory, they have a fair amount of freedom as to the vocation in which they choose to serve. Both men and women have to serve, so there is true equality of the sexes. Exemption is granted for religious and medical reasons.<br><br>I asked him if they have NS dodgers as well and of course, they are. However, those who do not serve NS for various reasons (eg. overseas studies till they exceed the maximum age of conscription ala Melvin Tan) are looked upon with disdain in Israel. They will not be able to get a job in the civil service and in many private businesses. As a result, such NS dodgers are rare.<br><br>I guess they value their national servicemen more...</div>

Once upon a time, I was "xenophobic" too ... while I'm here, I read about Brazillian footballers given citizenship and running off back to Brazil and laughed too, but then again, I realised that Singapore was not the only country doing something like that, remember the last olympics ? ... the gymnasts from Switzerland wearing chinese faces ? ... the Canadians born in China and the Bahamas ? ...<br><br>if someone says that he wants to run away cos Singapore is being over-run by the foreign influx, I hope he sees the irony of it all: if you feel this way towards the foreigners in Singapore, you'd expect the natives of the country you're going off to, to not feel this way ? to welcome you with open arms ? ... (actually, infact, many of them still do, a few racists aside, it says so much about Singaporeans, no ? ... but that's for another thread) ....<br><br>if it's global competition one is afraid of, then I'll have to say, too bad. Life in this global era is now more darwainian, economic boundaries are now erased, if you think by keeping out foreigners you can keep your job, that doesn't fly either, the jobs will either flow out through outsourcing, or through relocation anyways, in anycase, the people will keep coming, by hook or by crook, legally or illegally, anyways ... remember the Chinese cockle pickers in the UK ? this reality is inexorable, and something we all have to face up to it, the ultimate litmus test is, of course, to see if one is up to the challenge. C'mon, you and I, and the legions of Singaporean professionals and students, are giving other country's natives a good run for their money right now, no ? ... in some of the classes I'm attending, the chaps with black hairs outnumber the blondes, brunettes, and redheads combined together .... and my sister told me that Singaporeans are so numerous at certain places in perth you can hear hokkien being spoken, (courtesy of newly ORD'ed NS boys of course) ... My point ? you'd just have to suck it up, cos you cannot expect Singapore to be a nice little closed off pond forever, cos the deep blue sea is going to swallow us up, sooner or later ....<br><br>why did I make the above point ? ... cos in real terms, I have to admit I don't quite see how foreigners are being given the same privileges as Singaporeans ? ... they still pay higher school fees than us, they are still ineligible for certain scholarships, their children goes into different queues for primary school balloting. In contrast, I'm eligible for post grad subsidies here too, I get the very same free provincial health coverage as the native born, and I can compete for the same jobs (if they want me), as the natives ... a pretty raw deals for the natives here too, don't you think ? ... what more, I read somewhere in the UK for example, the shortage of nurses is so acute they'll pay the school fees of foreigners to study nursing, provided they'll work there after graduation, eh ? ... trampling in the face of the native brits, or facing the reality of shortages ? ...<br><br>On the other hand though, it is somewhat ironic that on one hand, you have people grumbling of the influx of foreigners, and on the other hand, you hear of foreign spouses of chaps being denied citizenship, even permanent residence, again and again ....<br><br>But in the end, the whole debate is about NS, really, isn't it ? .... </div></blockquote>well said, a fair and balanced view.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Calvin86 has a very skewed view of live. But it is unavoidable that some boys like him grow up in our society.  With our education system, everyone from a hokkien beng to an overseas scholar has their own opinion and their own option to choose to do what they want and say what they want.<br><br>They (those who think of running away) take things for so GRANTED!!!!<br><br>If you think why the US Resevists get paid so much?  Cause they are REALLY Ops ready.  Who do you think are fighting in Iraq/Afghanistan?  They are nt regulars but all reservist!  Would you rather be in that kind of situation Mr calvin86?<br><br>"I solemly swear i will defend the constitution of USA....."<br>"Good that's our boy, now grab that kit and take the next flight to Baghdad! Do i hear a yes, SIR???"<br><br>What other country in our part of the world actually has so vibrant an economy, so safe a neighbourhood and yet so stable a political / global relationship that civil / international war is but a small item on our mind?<br>You take for granted Terrorist bombings is something you read in the newspapers and that you CAN read.<br>You take for granted your school is within 1 hours travelling at the most, that You have drinkable tap water, that you have a blackout once every few years.<br>You think Shopping Centers, Supermarkets, 7 - Eleven and fastfoods restaurants grow from seeds?!?<br>You take for granted that you can go to primary school then secondary school then tietiary education then more and more.<br>You take for granted that you have AIRCON, Internet and computer to spew such ungrateful rubbish?!!  The government provides all these and the average Joe can actually afford at least most of these and can provide his/her CHILDREN with these same comfort and you ask what the country has to offer you?<br>NS hasnt given you the balls to fight for that toilet bowl you sit on everyday yet?<br><br>Would you prefer to be a peasant in China facing droughts/storms/landgrabs?<br>Would you rather be an Israeli where NS is a real life and death situation?<br>Would you instead choose to live in Africa where water is worth more than your mp3 player/handphone?<br>Or do you whine that This country is better this way and this other country is better than us that way.<br><br>I sorry to sound so horrid but you seem to be unable to appreciate what you already have. And running away? Ha, what makes you think your new country will trust you?<br>Once a traitor, It STICKS on YOUR FOREHEAD.<br><br>And as for those others who say FT takes away our jobs.  I say WE work hard to take those jobs back from them.  Which person actually needs that kind of money to live comfortably anyway?  If everyone does then all of us are paupers!  All Men are greedy to an extend and would appreciate a better life than what we have now.  If you ask me will i pick up a job that pays me 10k a month?  Who wouldnt if they know they can do it? Have what you can. Try for what you can have to earn more. But do not borrow more money than you can earn!<br>The government isnt going to hand us our golden rice bowl.  If you want THAT kind of government turn Muslim and go to our neighbour in the North.  They have a Bumiputra policy.<br><br>Of course all i have written are but mere words of a citizen who has every intend to protect and defend what good life we have.  I cant change your perception of how nothing has benefited your life so far living on our small little red dot.  You can continue sitting in a taxi and go home safely after midnight and take that Lift up to your floor and go home and sleep on a spring mattress to sleep.  Oh wait before that, brush your teeth!  Switch off the lights(do  you?) and enjoy the peaceful wind from the window or fan (with the occasional speedster going turbo at the street below).  Swat at a mosquito or two thinking of them as itchy and painful buggers than bringings of malaria/dengue/yellow fever.  You can continue on your life ignoring the neighbourly Ah ma carrying a heavy load going up the staircase too.  Cause you arent worth the attention either.<br><br>Good Luck my (not) friend. Cause you will need alot of it.<br><br>Let the flaming of my speech begin.  I will try to reply.</div>
