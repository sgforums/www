The point is, if an eagle wishes to soar, why restrict them from doing so just because turkeys think that its best to be a turkey? The eagles aren't laughing at the turkeys. On the contary, the eagles are sick and resentful of being forced to be a turkey, or be labelled as a failure. This backlash against the turkeys is something they've had coming a long time ago, no thanks to their oppression and dismissal of eagles who wish to leave and be eagles instead of being turkeys.<br><br>to add on also, there will of course be some turkeys who think they r swans n some turkeys who think they r eagles. but at least those who think they're eagles dare to try to fly high like an eagle, while those who think they r swans just continue to sit and do nothing exactly as a turkey does, while being content with thinking they can fly if they need to. Truth is, when the need comes, they will find out they're turkeys afterall.</div></blockquote>some of you take these politicians words too seriously. this thing about quitters is the s h i t s that come out of lao goh's mouth when he had diarrhea of the brain, when his wife got the same illness, she got peanuts coming out of her mouth.

Like our forebears who left China and India for a better life elsewhere, people emigrate because they are not successful in their homeland for various reasons. There might not be jobs for their skills, they might not be politically astute enough for their country of origin or their political views were not acceptable to their countrymen, whatever..<br><br>I do not think it is wrong for them to emigrate and I think that is the right thing for them to do. Those who are successful, whether it be the Mandarins in Imperial China or the elites in the Singaporean Civil Service, will not leave.<br><br>Obviously what is meant by success depends on an individual's perceptions and expectations.  However, if those who consider themselves as unable to succeed in Singapore remain in the country, their growing unhappiness will only fester and generate social unrest. That will create social problems and it would have been better for them to leave.</div></blockquote>During those time in China n India, there is many turmoil, poverty also causing people from these country to leave in search of a better livehood.<br><br>In Spore, the people living mostly those unable to cope with the dual language policy.
