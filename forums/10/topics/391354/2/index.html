              <p>Angel,</p>
              <p>I am not against foreigners with talent working in Singapore. I am a 'talent' export from this country to PRC and I support qualify and capable individual that work in my country. The problem is that Singapore are importing less capable and qualify individual and they are NOT TALENT. The purpose as to hire them to compete with local citizens in lowering the wages/salary and the living standard in Singapore. NO COUNTRY IN THE WORLD adop this type of policy, not even in PRC where I am working.</p>
              <p>During CNY, I met with friends and ex-colleagues who are qualified Singapore Accountant in their mid 30s/40s. I counted 3 out of 10 who are now working overseas and the remainders are either in the public service or as Public Accountants. To my surprise, the Public Accountants are struggling to meet end needs after the rule changes where their main source of income, auditing are no longer compulsory. Accountants from Indian are taking employment at all level of positions in the financial industry now. I have serious doubt over these  ppl cabability or 'talent' given Singapore financial talent are widely known for their knowledge and international exposure. So the question is why are company taking accountants from elsewhere where local accountant are more superior in training and international experience???? There are probably two reasons 1) Singapore companies have access to cheap accountant from India, hence it does not make sense to pay more for local accountant to keep books. 2) The saying that all birds with same feather flock together...when I am in PRC, my preference is to take another Singapore accountant for the language and cultural behaviour if two candidates (both a local PRC and Singaporean Accountant) are competing for the same position. Unfortunately, in PRC, we can only take foreigner in key position. The reverse is probably happening in Singapore where the Indian CFO could take cheaper accountants to work for him rather than taking a Singaporean.</p>
              <p>I think most other jobs in Sinagapore, be in Engineers, HR etc are facing the same predicament that Singapore Accountants are facing.</p>

              <p><br>Dear ah Wm,</p>
              <p>I understand your concern, as i said earlier, we singaporeans, the society and economy had reached a point of diminishing Marginal utility, meaning that we are overestimated ourselves, overpaid ourselves and over spoonfeeded ourselves that we had reach a point of thinking that we must be paid a higher salary in comparing to the cost of living, that is exactly what is happening in Japan, as such that for decades, they cannot turn up their economy because peoples refused to have competitive wage system adhered to a global market, and eventually even their own MNCs had moved out. We have to remember competitive in our wage flexibility, otherwise, as an industrial dependent country without any natural resources beside some rambutans, we would be history if we continuing to have a rigid wage structure of getting high and higher paid without knowing that the global market is not that much.</p>
              <p>As i said again, in term of social economy, we also have to look at the society as a whole, we are in a diminishing birthrate and aging population, with less young in the market and more old leaving the market, the funnel had tilted upside down, previous being 10 youngs support 2 olds, now it is almost 5 youngs support 5 olds and in 10 years time it will be 2 youngs supporting 10 olds who are no more contributing to the economy. It will be a heavy burden on these youngs which i am also one of them. You may be right that we are not attracting first class talent here, and certainly not singaporean like your type of class here, but our population is at stake in near future, do you understand that in the first place??? Aren't we too selfish to let our youngs suffer later. And do you think the govt like to implement unpopular policies such as allow more immigrant in,...there is simply no choice. Govt dun mind call all foreigners go back and win a big margin election votes, but they take their chance, because they know the consquences of a diminishing population, by which singapore economy depend on it. Human resource.</p>
              <p>Changes and adjustment is never going to be easy, i understand that, going overseas are not for bosses, it is usually those lower in rank such as you, sg accountants are in great demand in China, why? because sg accountants are consider clean. That is your advantage, but dun take it so lightly, as you rightly put it, indian accountant are on the rise, but luckily, Chinese dun like indian, so Sing goes to China, Indian come to Sg. Nevertheless, like it or not, it is a global market, it is good actually for you or your friend to see for themselves how worthy is an accountant in a global market, from there you guys set your priorty, if you have been spending lavishly, think twice, santa claus days are over. You have market yourself, given you at your heyday of your career facing such problem, by the time we, the young ones come into the market, we would had prepared ourselves and knows our value. Therefore, for you and your friend, they need to adjust to the market a global market not just simply a Singapore market.</p>
              <p>Simply put it, as a boss, if an indian can delivery me a good accounting report and settle the auditors, i dun mind employing him at a lower rate than a Singaporeans, this tell you that the society as a whole, professionals are not peoples who can command a high paid, but simply a mere worker as any other working class. When you go US or british or aussie to find jobs, you dun demand alots because you want to be competitive with the locals there, you get the jobs, so the Aussies, Brits and Americans are facing the same problem, but are they complaining, no, because they understand what is globalisation, a bounderless economy and labour which they created.</p>

              <p><br>Dear ah Wm,</p>
              <p>I understand your concern, as i said earlier, we singaporeans, the society and economy had reached a point of diminishing Marginal utility, meaning that we are overestimated ourselves, overpaid ourselves and over spoonfeeded ourselves that we had reach a point of thinking that we must be paid a higher salary in comparing to the cost of living, that is exactly what is happening in Japan, as such that for decades, they cannot turn up their economy because peoples refused to have competitive wage system adhered to a global market, and eventually even their own MNCs had moved out. We have to remember competitive in our wage flexibility, otherwise, as an industrial dependent country without any natural resources beside some rambutans, we would be history if we continuing to have a rigid wage structure of getting high and higher paid without knowing that the global market is not that much.</p>
              <p>As i said again, in term of social economy, we also have to look at the society as a whole, we are in a diminishing birthrate and aging population, with less young in the market and more old leaving the market, the funnel had tilted upside down, previous being 10 youngs support 2 olds, now it is almost 5 youngs support 5 olds and in 10 years time it will be 2 youngs supporting 10 olds who are no more contributing to the economy. It will be a heavy burden on these youngs which i am also one of them. You may be right that we are not attracting first class talent here, and certainly not singaporean like your type of class here, but our population is at stake in near future, do you understand that in the first place??? Aren't we too selfish to let our youngs suffer later. And do you think the govt like to implement unpopular policies such as allow more immigrant in,...there is simply no choice. Govt dun mind call all foreigners go back and win a big margin election votes, but they take their chance, because they know the consquences of a diminishing population, by which singapore economy depend on it. Human resource.</p>
              <p>Changes and adjustment is never going to be easy, i understand that, going overseas are not for bosses, it is usually those lower in rank such as you, sg accountants are in great demand in China, why? because sg accountants are consider clean. That is your advantage, but dun take it so lightly, as you rightly put it, indian accountant are on the rise, but luckily, Chinese dun like indian, so Sing goes to China, Indian come to Sg. Nevertheless, like it or not, it is a global market, it is good actually for you or your friend to see for themselves how worthy is an accountant in a global market, from there you guys set your priorty, if you have been spending lavishly, think twice, santa claus days are over. You have market yourself, given you at your heyday of your career facing such problem, by the time we, the young ones come into the market, we would had prepared ourselves and knows our value. Therefore, for you and your friend, they need to adjust to the market a global market not just simply a Singapore market.</p>
              <p>Simply put it, as a boss, if an indian can delivery me a good accounting report and settle the auditors, i dun mind employing him at a lower rate than a Singaporeans, this tell you that the society as a whole, professionals are not peoples who can command a high paid, but simply a mere worker as any other working class. When you go US or british or aussie to find jobs, you dun demand alots because you want to be competitive with the locals there, you get the jobs, so the Aussies, Brits and Americans are facing the same problem, but are they complaining, no, because they understand what is globalisation, a bounderless economy and labour which they created.</p>

              <p><br>Actually agree with most of what you wrote..but competition must be conducted on a level playing field. Take NS...Require all PRs and adult foreigners who want to work in Singapore to serve out two years of full-time national service first. That applies to female Singaporeans as well. And enough of that argument that women serve their NS by having children....the birth rate is dropping year by year...what if a woman does not produce children? Send them to prison for AWOL? Forcibly make them pregnant? :)</p>

              <p>it seem angel and ruling regime also dont get what we singaporeans says. we say we dont nee so much PR and foreigners. we did not say we dont want them at all.</p>
              <p>since years ago, we have been lamenting about increase productivity instead of foreigns workers. but the ruling regime decided to take the short cut.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>if we dont put  halt to this PRs and foreigners issue , we singapore will lose our identity. if the Prs do not convert singaporeans within 5 years they should go back to their country. first and foremost i would tackle malaysian PRS at first. they exploit singaporea the most,  earn their money here and sent the money back to buy bigger house in malaysia. me and few of my friends are already feeling not happy about malaysian PRs. some have even become PRs for 7-9years.

              <p>they would probably rename singapore and abolish national service in order to tell everyone that spore dont need defence anymore as they claim they can protect spore with space age weapons which is more fiction than real.</p>

              <p>Angel,  going overseas are also for bosses. I am not referring to junior or mid level accountants who are currently working overseas. I am refering to all level of executives positions Singaporean who are working in PRC. I work as CFO for a UK gold mining company that invested in multi billions projects in PRC. I met with my Singapore often and many had return during the financial crisis to Singapore and still unemployed. Eventually, these friends of mine all reappear in PRC again last year and continue to work here. </p>
              <p>No one like to work away from home, at least, I look forward to returning home but given the current unemployment in Sg and ease of foreigners getting jobs in Sg, I believe I will continue to work in PRC for a long period.</p>

              <p>Dear Angel,</p>
              <p>Well first of all, I would like to say that I am in no position to comment on what you mentioned about "Marginal Utility" first of all because I am not an economist and neither am I an academic nor economist. Secondly, I would like to say that I don't really get your reasoning of the events you mentioned in your first paragraph. Mind to elucidate?</p>
              <p>I am also terribly sorry because I cannot follow your line of argument - which does not appear to be very sound at least to me - when you said "When you
              go US or british or aussie to find jobs, you dun demand alots
              because you want to be competitive with the locals there, you
              get the jobs, so the Aussies, Brits and Americans are facing
              the same problem, but are they complaining". </p>
              <p>But basically, I do agree that Singaporeans are leaving Singapore for other countries (is that what you meant?) and foreigners are coming into SIngapore, which is something you perceive to be "reasonable". (Do correct me if I misinterpreted what you were trying to convey.) However, that is not in the least "reasonable" or alright. Yes indeed, in an increasingly globalised world, everyone can go anywhere, but things should not be in such a situation where everyone <em>has </em>to go somewhere. Then we are not having the choice. With the continued influx of foreigners (suppose it remains unchecked), where would the other Singaporeans go? These people could be just as talented but because of the influx of foreigners (don't be mistaken. I am not xenophobic), Singapore may possibly suffer from a braindrain for second-tier "talents". I am not against Singaporean employers hiring foreign talent, but I just want to ensure these "talents" from India and countries of the ilk are indeed talents.</p>

We have to remember competitive in our wage flexibility, otherwise, as an industrial dependent country without any natural resources beside some rambutans, we would be history if we continuing to have a rigid wage structure of getting high and higher paid without knowing that the global market is not that much.</p>

              <p>What possibly has driven the Taiwanese hum to declare Singapore "<em>society and economy had reached a point of diminishing Marginal utility</em>" ?</p>
              <p>It is amazing that the hare-brained Mushroom from Oxford will accept the Taiwanese 'hum' interpretation that 'diminishing Marginal utility' means - <em>"we are overestimated ourselves, overpaid ourselves and over spoonfeeded ourselves that we had reach a point of thinking that we must be paid a higher salary in comparing to the cost of living,"</em> .....</p>
              <p>Shocking.</p>
              <p>Has Singaporeans "<em>over-estimated ourselves, overpaid ourselves, and over spoonfed ourselves</em>" ?</p>
              <p>How could this happen when Singaporeans have no say about wages to match the Cost of Living - and when industrial strikes are unheard of in Singapore ?</p>
              <p>Has it not been the case that the NWC has determined wages and wage increases - and the supposed Tripartite Agreements are heavily influenced and controlled by the PAP - with one seat representing Government, another seat by the PAP controlled NTUC and the third by the Employers' Federation ?</p>
              <p>The cost of living is well within the control and influence of the PAP Government that arbitrarily manipulate and authorise all price increases in Singapore - and this will include:- utilities, transportation, taxes, COE, ERP, land sales prices, stamp duties, development charges, public housing, bank interests rates.</p>
              <p>Only the dumb parasitical Mushroom from Oxford will succour on the stoooopidity of the Taiwanee 'hum' to accept the Taiwanese 'hum' bald and baseless statement that Japan's situation is due to the Japanese citizens refusal to accept lower wages to make themselves more competitive against the World.</p>
              <p>Why will the Taiwanese 'hum' not appreciate the Japanese problems by looking at the same situation in Singapore ?</p>
              <p>Has it not been the case - where the PAP Government has also refused to lower public housing prices in 2008 and 2009 - so as NOT to rock the foundations of the banking system that has been financing the HIGH Prices of Public Housing sold in the boom years in the early 1990s - resulting in Singaporeans being 'asset rich, but cash poor' when reaching retirement age ?</p>
              <p>Is this not the same in Japan, where the Japanese government cannot suddenly make a U-Turn in wage levels, and restructure industries to that of the 1950s - to get full employment ?</p>
              <p>When the bubble has been blown so big, can it be deflated safely without causing a sudden deflation - which the Japanese government has been attempting for the last 10 years ?</p>
              <p>What garbage homily is the Taiwanese 'hum' spreading in the big lump written ?  </p>

              <p>As i said again, in term of social economy, we also have to look at the society as a whole, we are in a diminishing birthrate and aging population, with less young in the market and more old leaving the market, the funnel had tilted upside down, previous being 10 youngs support 2 olds, now it is almost 5 youngs support 5 olds and in 10 years time it will be 2 youngs supporting 10 olds who are no more contributing to the economy. It will be a heavy burden on these youngs which i am also one of them. You may be right that we are not attracting first class talent here, and certainly not singaporean like your type of class here, but our population is at stake in near future, do you understand that in the first place??? Aren't we too selfish to let our youngs suffer later. And do you think the govt like to implement unpopular policies such as allow more immigrant in,...there is simply no choice. Govt dun mind call all foreigners go back and win a big margin election votes, but they take their chance, because they know the consquences of a diminishing population, by which singapore economy depend on it. Human resource.</p>

              <p><em>"Aren't we too selfish to let our youngs suffer later."</em> - is the Taiwanese 'hum' making an attempt to justify for the opening of the floodgates for more foreigners to enter Singapore ?</p>
              <p>What has been the cause for population decline in Singapore despite all the supposed incentives given by the PAP Government to encourage a higher birthrate ?</p>
              <p>Should Singaporeans not hold the PAP Government to be accountable for the present predicament that Singapore is facing ?</p>
              <p>Despite the larger land mass and low population, Sweden is not depending on low wage to find their own existence in the global economic competition, and are mindful to control immigrant flows to prevent lowering of their own Standard of Living.</p>
              <p>Why has it not been considered that despite the high tax environment in Sweden - the Swedish population has seen a steady growth in their birth rate since Year 2000 ?</p>
              <p>What is it that the Swedish Government has done correctly to encourage growth in the birth rates that the Singapore cannot acheive - despite all the supposed intelligent that draws the World Highest Wages as Ministers ?</p>

              <p>Changes and adjustment is never going to be easy, i understand that, going overseas are not for bosses, it is usually those lower in rank such as you, sg accountants are in great demand in China, why? because sg accountants are consider clean. That is your advantage, but dun take it so lightly, as you rightly put it, indian accountant are on the rise, but luckily, Chinese dun like indian, so Sing goes to China, Indian come to Sg. Nevertheless, like it or not, it is a global market, it is good actually for you or your friend to see for themselves how worthy is an accountant in a global market, from there you guys set your priorty, if you have been spending lavishly, think twice, santa claus days are over. You have market yourself, given you at your heyday of your career facing such problem, by the time we, the young ones come into the market, we would had prepared ourselves and knows our value. Therefore, for you and your friend, they need to adjust to the market a global market not just simply a Singapore market.</p>

              <p>Why will the Taiwanese 'hum' only limit its useless homily on the Singaporean workers alone to venture overseas ?</p>
              <p>Why will the Taiwanese 'hum' claim that "<em>going overseas are not for bosses</em>" ?</p>
              <p>It is typical selfish shrewdness of a Taiwanese that makes such a statement to be hypocritical, when her own father is the boss and have travelled overseas to make all the investments that the Taiwanese 'hum' has the loud mouth to claim in this forum.</p>
              <p>The fact that the Chinese enterprises accept accountants from Singapore - Chinese or otherwise - and not Indians from India, is largely due to the simple fact that most Singaporeans have a working ability to speak and perhaps write Mandarin.</p>
              <p>It has nothing to do with honesty of Singaporeans - as it is more to do with Personal Professionalism in the occupation which any individual is to be held accountable.</p>
              <p>The other reason for Chinese enterprise looking to Singapore for accounting skill is due to the fact that the UK Accounting System is gaining a foothold in Communist China - as it is gaining acceptance in Communist Vietnam.</p>
              <p>Both of these countries have only known Communist system and find the UK ACCA methods to be more efficient and pragmatic to implement for a modern economy.</p>
              <p>As much as it is important for individual Singaporeans to be prepared to travel overseas, it is even more essential for Singaporean bosses to go to - so as to spread the Singapore wing to compete more effectively in every territory.</p>
              <p>One can only be suspcious of the Taiwanese 'hum' intention to limit the spread of our wings and move further to have more depth for our economy.</p>
              <p>Amazing that it will show itself to be a fervent carpet beggar to LKY and the PAP.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Simply put it, as a boss, if an indian can delivery me a good accounting report and settle the auditors, i dun mind employing him at a lower rate than a Singaporeans, this tell you that the society as a whole, professionals are not peoples who can command a high paid, but simply a mere worker as any other working class. When you go US or british or aussie to find jobs, you dun demand alots because you want to be competitive with the locals there, you get the jobs, so the Aussies, Brits and Americans are facing the same problem, but are they complaining, no, because they understand what is globalisation, a bounderless economy and labour which they created.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p> The Taiwanese 'hum' - is clearly a pseudo-Singaporean - when it will employ a cheaper foreign labor to keep its accounts, even when a loyal fellow Singaporean can perform the job.</p>
              <p>Obviously, the Taiwanese 'hum' has much skeletons to hide in its operating accounts - and will need an Indian to help it settle any troublesome queries from the IRS.</p>
              <p>The Taiwanese 'hum' is not attempting to destroy the very structure of an orderly Singapore Society - when it will state that "<em>professionals are not people who can command a high paid, but simply a mere worker as any other working class</em>".</p>
              <p>Is the Taiwanese 'hum' treating Singaporean Doctors, Lawyers, Engineers, Architects and all such PROFESSIONALS as ordinary workers ?</p>
              <p>Obviously, the Taiwanese 'hum' familiarity with the oridinary professional prostitutes as working class will lead to her confusion over the term "Professional" - and it is amazing that the supposed professional from Oxford has no qualm to dissect the stooooopidity of the verbiage homily from the resident Taiwanese 'hum'.</p>
              <p>It is very obvious that the parasitical Mushroom from Oxford is infatuated with the whiff leaked from the Taiwanese 'hum' and has lost its ability to be more circumspect with such a childish piece of garbage.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is better for the Taiwanese 'hum' to stay out of Singapore Politics and do not attempt to spread its stooooopitiy in this forum.</p>
              <p>Get out of Singapore - and stay out.</p>
