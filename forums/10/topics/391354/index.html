              <h1>Indian national who obtained Singapore PR within half a year had reunion dinner with Chinese family</h1>
              <div class="date">
              <div class="dateleft">
              <p><span class="time">February 16, 2010</span></p>
              <p>Channel News Asia carried a prominent report yesterday on an Indian national, Charu Mehrotra being invited to a Chinese reunion dinner by a Singaporean.</p>
              </div>
              </div>
              <p>It waas revealed that she has been a permanent resident for the past two-and-a-half years and that she and her bank analyst husband arrived in Singapore three years ago. This means that she obtained her Singapore PR only within six months of application, an astonishing short period of time for a developed nation.</p>
              <p>For some strange reason, CNA was able to dig out such trivial news and even sent a crew to film Madam Mehrotra having dinner with the family which appeared to give the impression that it was stage-managed right from the very beginning.</p>
              <p>As expected, both the host and guest had only nice words for each other to paint a picture of harmonious co-existence between locals and the new arrivals.</p>
              <p>Madam Mehrotra said:</p>
              <p><em>“It was a fantastic reunion dinner by Angela and the first time I attended a Chinese New Year gathering like this. I enjoyed all Chinese food, I enjoyed steamboat, how they do the steamboat and how they mingle with each other and I met her friends from Indonesia. It was a fantastic evening for me, and I will always remember it throughout my heart.”</em></p>
              <p>The Singapore host Angela Lee returned the compliment:</p>
              <p><em>“I have been inviting foreigners to come to our reunion dinner for a while, for a few years, and I think it is very important for the foreigners to know how we Chinese celebrate our Chinese New Year. As a Singaporean, we should do more than what we are having it right now to welcome the foreigners, as well as the PRs in Singapore to know further about multi-racial and multi-culture of Singapore.”</em></p>
              <p>Due to the ruling party’s liberal immigration policies, foreigners now make up 36 per cent of Singapore’s population, up from 14 per cent in 1990. Two out of every three PR applicants are successful and many of them obtain it in less than a year, like Madam Mehrotra.</p>
              <p>As too many foreigners were allowed into Singapore within too short a period of time, the ruling party is now encountering problems trying to integrate all of them into the society.</p>
              <p>Such news are nothing more but propaganda to mislead unsuspecting readers into believing that the newcomers are mingling with the locals.</p>
              <p>If one had visited the NTUC supermarkets on Chinese New Year’s Eve, one would not fail to realize that a large proportion of the buyers were foreigners doing last-minute shopping together.</p>
              <p>The truth is: the China nationals were celebrating the festive season together while the Indians, Bangladeshi, Burmese, Filipinos and other minority races are simply enjoying their extended holidays in their own respective communities with little interaction with one another.</p>
              <p>Do you see Singapore families visiting their mainland Chinese neighbors or the vice versa? Or China nationals inviting Indian expats to join their steamboat dinners? The answer is obvious.</p>
              <p>Since Madam Mehrotra claimed she enjoyed Chinese food and steamboat, perhaps she should consider taking up Singapore citizenship and stay here for good. In this way, she can have ”reunion” dinner with her Chinese friends in Singapore every year.</p>

              <p>You dun want to take it as talent, they can alway change it to elites, same same.</p>
              <p>In term of our social economy, Singapore had reached a state of diminishing  Marginal Utility. If we marginalise within ourselves and set restriction on foreigner elites or talents, we are going to end up with nothing. A lose lose condition.</p>
              <p>Even as homogenous a country as S korea, whose Unions can go on months of strike if ever their companies employed foreigner are giving way to their employers to employ foreigners just to make up the workforce, Korea are also suffering from old age population and low birthrates.</p>
              <p>We may all be very frustrated about foreigners here, but we got to understand that we need them, be it that they leave after educated here or continue to work here, it is sure to contribute to our society as a whole, we may see the fruit of it now, may 10 or 20 years later, you will see it, LKY dun plan for the present, his envision is alway 20 years into the future, and he knows by that time, if we dun not have foreigners here today, we are finish in 20 years time.</p>
              <p>The competiveness of labour, both intellectual and physical is on the rise, in 5 years time, we may not even able to attrack peoples here, thank God that Japan is still very stubborn to allow foreigner in, but that will not be long, in 5 years time, Korea, Japan, taiwan or even vietnam will be snatching foreigners. At that time, we want foreigner also can hardly get...So, ladies and gentlemen, it is a blessing that we do it now, and enjoy the fruits of it later, because the more you delay in getting or attracting foreigners, the worst you will be in near future.</p>
              <p>The ideology of foreigners, be it they leave or stay, is to give them a feel of singapore, hopeful, for those elites/talented ones who stayed, they can contribute to our society and economy, and for those who left, they will remember us, and when they are CEO or MD of some companies, they will feel easy in doing business with Singapore. And for those Singaporeans who are studying with foreigners here, it is of a great blessing that you get the chance to learn their culture, understand them and perhaps, in later life, in a global economy, you may cross road with them as business peoples, and as former classmates, things can get done more easily, a good global networking.</p>

              <p>Angel,</p>
              <p>I am not against foreigners with talent working in Singapore. I am a 'talent' export from this country to PRC and I support qualify and capable individual that work in my country. The problem is that Singapore are importing less capable and qualify individual and they are NOT TALENT. The purpose as to hire them to compete with local citizens in lowering the wages/salary and the living standard in Singapore. NO COUNTRY IN THE WORLD adop this type of policy, not even in PRC where I am working.</p>
              <p>During CNY, I met with friends and ex-colleagues who are qualified Singapore Accountant in their mid 30s/40s. I counted 3 out of 10 who are now working overseas and the remainders are either in the public service or as Public Accountants. To my surprise, the Public Accountants are struggling to meet end needs after the rule changes where their main source of income, auditing are no longer compulsory. Accountants from Indian are taking employment at all level of positions in the financial industry now. I have serious doubt over these  ppl cabability or 'talent' given Singapore financial talent are widely known for their knowledge and international exposure. So the question is why are company taking accountants from elsewhere where local accountant are more superior in training and international experience???? There are probably two reasons 1) Singapore companies have access to cheap accountant from India, hence it does not make sense to pay more for local accountant to keep books. 2) The saying that all birds with same feather flock together...when I am in PRC, my preference is to take another Singapore accountant for the language and cultural behaviour if two candidates (both a local PRC and Singaporean Accountant) are competing for the same position. Unfortunately, in PRC, we can only take foreigner in key position. The reverse is probably happening in Singapore where the Indian CFO could take cheaper accountants to work for him rather than taking a Singaporean.</p>
              <p>I think most other jobs in Sinagapore, be in Engineers, HR etc are facing the same predicament that Singapore Accountants are facing.</p>

              <p>The reason why India is still so poor is mainly because of their religion which states that life is an illusion, hence people ultimately find no meaning in lives and so there is no point to work hard so the nation can prosper.</p>
