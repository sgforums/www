              <p><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>Shame on you, young bloggers</strong></span><br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>IT IRKS me that young people blog negatively about the Singapore Government</strong></span>.
              They live in an era where there is peace and harmony, they have a roof
              over their heads, plenty to eat and so much to enjoy. There is a need
              to realise that all these good things do not come naturally. Someone
              has to do the job and <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>we are fortunate to have a sound and honest government to take care of this place we call our home.</strong></span><br> <br> We live in a small place with no natural resources but we have done
              well. We have good infrastructure, a clean environment, a safe place
              and the list goes on. Our children are free to roam the streets and
              return home safely. We cannot take all that we enjoy now for granted.<br> <br> <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>The Government took great pains to mould this tiny island into a place of wonder.</strong></span> There is no one policy that suits everyone. It is not possible to
              please everyone all the time. We may not always benefit from some of
              the policies implemented but we should be happy that others do.<br> <br> Life was a struggle before but after years of persistent hard work and thrift, we managed.<span style="font-size: medium;"><strong> I travelled quite a bit but whenever I looked around, I could not help but feel blessed that I have a home called Singapore</strong></span><strong><span style="font-size: x-small;">.</span><span style="font-size: x-small;"><br> </span></strong> <br> <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>This is only possible because we have a government that cares to make this a better place.</strong></span> The question often asked is, 'What can the Government do for me?', but shouldn't it be, 'What can I do for my country?'<br> <br> <span style="font-size: large;"><strong>I am grateful to the Government,</strong></span> which has done a great job, and <span style="font-size: large;"><strong>in particular Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew,</strong></span> who has gone through so many trials and tribulations. <span style="font-size: large;"><strong>Even
              now, at his age, he has not stopped caring about Singapore. My
              heartfelt thanks to MM Lee and I wish him happiness and health.</strong></span><br> <br> Juliet Chua (Ms)</p>

              <p>Sg is easy to manage because of the size compared to other countries. Given the geographical position of out homeland, it really take a lazy retard to make the country into a developed country because of the revenue flows and such as in the past all the cargo ships comes in and out of sg's port.</p>
              <p>In a certain extend, we still have to like give thanks to the leader who had make this happened. Who knows we might still be another under developed country if some retard took over the place instead?</p>
              <p>Anyway, having developed till today. There is something that we must say that existed in the system. Why the reign of a dynasty? Why the crown is passed down the bloodline? Isn't there someone more capable than the current "king"? Or is it that fears of losing control? Had those capable of holding that position been eliminated without the public knowing?</p>
              <p>The media in SG is well known to be controlled. It is only when internet is so common that reports from other countries are not been able to witheld from the public. All these are now in the doubts of the mind of most thinking sg'rean.</p>
              <p>Why target certain opposition group. You will find more if you google on it and also in youtube where evidences are really kinda hinting to something that we are blinded of all these years.</p>

              <p><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>Shame on you, young
              bloggers</strong></span><br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>IT IRKS me that young people blog
              negatively about the Singapore Government</strong></span>. They
              live in an era where there is peace and harmony, they have a roof
              over their heads, plenty to eat and so much to enjoy. There is a
              need to realise that all these good things do not come naturally.
              Someone has to do the job and <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>we are fortunate to have a sound and
              honest government to take care of this place we call our
              home.</strong></span><br> <br> We live in a small place with no natural resources but we have done
              well. We have good infrastructure, a clean environment, a safe
              place and the list goes on. Our children are free to roam the
              streets and return home safely. We cannot take all that we enjoy
              now for granted.<br> <br> <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>The Government took great
              pains to mould this tiny island into a place of
              wonder.</strong></span> There is no one policy that suits everyone.
              It is not possible to please everyone all the time. We may not
              always benefit from some of the policies implemented but we should
              be happy that others do.<br> <br> Life was a struggle before but after years of persistent hard work
              and thrift, we managed. <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>I
              travelled quite a bit but whenever I looked around, I could not
              help but feel blessed that I have a home called
              Singapore</strong></span><strong><span style="font-size: x-small;">.</span><span style="font-size: x-small;"><br></span></strong><br> <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>This is only possible
              because we have a government that cares to make this a better
              place.</strong></span> The question often asked is, 'What can the
              Government do for me?', but shouldn't it be, 'What can I do for my
              country?'<br> <br> <span style="font-size: large;"><strong>I am grateful to the
              Government,</strong></span> which has done a great job, and
              <span style="font-size: large;"><strong>in particular Minister
              Mentor Lee Kuan Yew,</strong></span> who has gone through so many
              trials and tribulations. <span style="font-size: large;"><strong>Even now, at his age, he has not
              stopped caring about Singapore. My heartfelt thanks to MM Lee and I
              wish him happiness and health.</strong></span><br> <br> Juliet Chua (Ms)</p>

              <p>Somehow i felt that this pro-PAP forum letters are actually from the Government or the Editors pen. The names of the persons are always with Christian first names(not to flame any religion) and family surname and not in full like Mike Tan Ah Kow or something to that effect.</p>
              <p>Come on propaganda minister or person, Its has already been done in history. Josef Goebbels perfected this art of propaganda. Singaporeans are not that stupid.</p>
