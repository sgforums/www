They live in an era where there is peace and harmony, they have a roof over their heads, plenty to eat and so much to enjoy. There is a need to realise that all these good things do not come naturally. Someone has to do the job and <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>we are fortunate to have a sound and honest government to take care of this place we call our home.</strong></span><br><br>We live in a small place with no natural resources but we have done well. We have good infrastructure, a clean environment, a safe place and the list goes on. Our children are free to roam the streets and return home safely. We cannot take all that we enjoy now for granted.<br><br><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>The Government took great pains to mould this tiny island into a place of wonder.</strong></span> There is no one policy that suits everyone. It is not possible to please everyone all the time. We may not always benefit from some of the policies implemented but we should be happy that others do.<br><br>Life was a struggle before but after years of persistent hard work and thrift, we managed. <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>I travelled quite a bit but whenever I looked around, I could not help but feel blessed that I have a home called Singapore</strong></span><strong><span style="font-size: x-small;">.</span><span style="font-size: x-small;"><br></span></strong><br><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>This is only possible because we have a government that cares to make this a better place.</strong></span> The question often asked is, 'What can the Government do for me?', but shouldn't it be, 'What can I do for my country?'<br><br><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>I am grateful to the Government,</strong></span> which has done a great job, and <span style="font-size: large;"><strong>in particular Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew,</strong></span> who has gone through so many trials and tribulations. <span style="font-size: large;"><strong>Even now, at his age, he has not stopped caring about Singapore. My heartfelt thanks to MM Lee and I wish him happiness and health.</strong></span><br><br>Juliet Chua (Ms)</p>
