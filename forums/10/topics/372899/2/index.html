              <p><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>Shame on you, young
              bloggers</strong></span><br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>IT IRKS me that young people blog
              negatively about the Singapore Government</strong></span>. They
              live in an era where there is peace and harmony, they have a roof
              over their heads, plenty to eat and so much to enjoy. There is a
              need to realise that all these good things do not come naturally.
              Someone has to do the job and <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>we are fortunate to have a sound and
              honest government to take care of this place we call our
              home.</strong></span><br> <br> We live in a small place with no natural resources but we have done
              well. We have good infrastructure, a clean environment, a safe
              place and the list goes on. Our children are free to roam the
              streets and return home safely. We cannot take all that we enjoy
              now for granted.<br> <br> <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>The Government took great
              pains to mould this tiny island into a place of
              wonder.</strong></span> There is no one policy that suits everyone.
              It is not possible to please everyone all the time. We may not
              always benefit from some of the policies implemented but we should
              be happy that others do.<br> <br> Life was a struggle before but after years of persistent hard work
              and thrift, we managed. <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>I
              travelled quite a bit but whenever I looked around, I could not
              help but feel blessed that I have a home called
              Singapore</strong></span><strong><span style="font-size: x-small;">.</span><span style="font-size: x-small;"><br></span></strong><br> <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>This is only possible
              because we have a government that cares to make this a better
              place.</strong></span> The question often asked is, 'What can the
              Government do for me?', but shouldn't it be, 'What can I do for my
              country?'<br> <br> <span style="font-size: large;"><strong>I am grateful to the
              Government,</strong></span> which has done a great job, and
              <span style="font-size: large;"><strong>in particular Minister
              Mentor Lee Kuan Yew,</strong></span> who has gone through so many
              trials and tribulations. <span style="font-size: large;"><strong>Even now, at his age, he has not
              stopped caring about Singapore. My heartfelt thanks to MM Lee and I
              wish him happiness and health.</strong></span><br> <br> Juliet Chua (Ms)</p>
