              <p><br>how can your mini gun produce any effect, so mini...eeee...cannot even see..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>look mini, my Uncle was referring to Levy, and if you are employing skill workers, there is no levy to paid, do you know that? so when talking about levy, i have to refer to my bangalas and prc guys with no skill, unlike my cashiers and account admin, they are from malaysia and china, i dun hv to paid levy for them, they got diploma with them.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Singaporeans must go and upgrade themselves, e2i, WDA, Learning Hub, NTUC, CDC, CC, are venue where only Singaporeans can go for job matching and if not match, they can go for course immediately with payroll too, lower skill at $6 per hour of training, and executive or so call PMET people get $10 per hour of training, now you tell me, which govt paid it citizen for training which is also free, once you get trained, they match the jobs for you free. The govt is also giving employer job credit grant for employing Singaporeans, that means I get $200 extra  every month for taking a singaporean in, So instead of paying him 1k, I can paid him 1.2k.  Now you tell me which govt in this world paid an employer for employing it citizen??? I hv always believe that foreigners here is to help us to increase the pie so that all of us can have a job to go on with, but sad to say that many Singaporean, especially those Uncles in their 40s and above are giving endless whining and still refuse to move their butts.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For that, few things Singaporean Uncles have to overcome,</p>
              <p>1. the willingness to train and re train</p>
              <p>2. the willingness to work alongside foreigners who are helping us</p>
              <p>3. the willingness of changing mindset and adaptivity</p>
              <p>4. the willingness to take a job of lower paid and start a new</p>
              <p>5. the willingness to put in effort and remove the mental block</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And by the way, first prize today is 7030 not 7039 ya</p>

              <p>because sg recongnise these private school qualifications..so its easy for them to get it and get a job since they can accept lower pay then us</p>
              <p>my gf have a few class mates studying the same degree programme and they could not even speak english properly.but are still allowed to study!!!</p>
              <p>when they got their degree they will apply for jobs and compete with locals..........</p>
