              <p>so you are saying that you "guarantee" by offering something useless lah.</p>
              <p>Your guarantee failed already. I just need to find ONE person who get a better job after upgrading enough le. FOR EXAMPLE: a saf soldier sign on 5 year contract with NITEC cert. after contract end, he go poly, and sign on as officer. So you lose.</p>
              <p>Notice that i used caps lock once for emphasis. it works much better than caps locks all the way.</p>

              <p>I don't know how you come up with this 80% work force thing. In a typical manufacturing MNC, where the majority work force, in head count, are production workers, line supervisors..., then you can have close to 80% foreign force. Or in an MNC trading company, where the majority workforce are traders, you will also have majority foreign workers. But we cannot generalize.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I don't know where you get this idea that they work 12 hours a day but only work for 3 to 4 days. I do know many started working at 8 in the morning, then go to movie shows at 11, go back to work at 4 till midnight. this is because they started at 8 to be in touch with Japan, 4 to contact europe, and stay till midnight to work with their US counterpart. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Unless we have specific statistic, we should not generalize based on what we think we see.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Foreign managers usually are more expensive, because they are provided with housing and other benefits. Even if they are prepared to take local term, the companies should be wary that these people would leave after a few years...so why should these companies invest in people who are not likely to stay. We should ask why these companies are prepared to take  chances, why are they not taking in Singaporeans?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Don't get me wrong, I am not speaking for the foreigners. it is a fact that the japanese MNC always prefer Japanese or those who who speak Jap, american companies also prefer those who speak with american accent, and the french, will always want to make sure that french culture is respected in THEIR company.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and if you say that there are demons and monsters, who say the MNC are not? especially the banks and financial institutes. </p>

              <p>of course everybody has the right to dream. Tell us how beautiful your dream is, how are you pursuing it, not everytime talk about how sucked up you are, how bad your currently place is, and the dream is just any other place out of where you are.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you share your dream and everybody want to follow you, then your dream is truely a beautiful place worth pursuing. But if you are only trying to convince others that we are just as stuck as you are in this place, then good luck...hehehe.</p>

              <p>since you don't depend on the government, just go get a job and stop complaining about the foreigners. And learn better english, it helps your comprehension and composition.</p>
