              <p>I am also aware of that. The bus company even engaged inspectors during peak periods to squeeze these 'foreign workers' into the packed buses. So extra costs to help these free loaders to get their transport home. Ironical, ain't it?</p>

              <p>Public response to the forthcoming public transport fare adjustments has generally been positive?!</p>
              <p>Ok lah, what to do?</p>
              <p>"One feature of the formula is that the inflation that is put into the formula is last year's inflation.This year's inflation numbers will likely factor into next year's fare review.Because inflation has been higher this year, we would anticipate that next year the formula may allow for a higher increase."- Professor Paul Barter from the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy.</p>

              <p>The correlation is NO longer there between fare hikes and oil
              prices as in the 2007 hike, oil prices went down after the Lebanon
              war to around $80 and lower. the reason given by PTC : "There
              is no extenuating reason NOT to increase."</p>

              <p>When oil is up they capitalise on it .</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The fares has NEVER never been reduced before unlike
              petrol, irregardless of oil prices, cheaper wages of
              foreign drivers, CUT in CPF wages ,market domination and huge

              <p>The present price adjustments to travel fares - made at a seemingly insignificant 2 OR 3 CENTs - will only add to the profit margins of the very profitable transport companies; and these will probably not be reduced when the new stock of US$90 per barrel oil enters the pipeline.</p>

              <p>I wonder why are they talking about tranport fare increases right now. Oil was $150 per barrel when they conceived the idea, now oil is $100 and with the impending global economic issues, it seems unlikely that oil will hit $150 anytime soon.</p>
              <p>Now they are telling us that the new public transport fare price is beneficial to most of us. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>So what is their basis for increasing public transport fares during this time? To shore up Temasek's account from recent losses in overseas investments?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Seems like we are the proverbial sheep, therefore we have to be fleeced occasionally by the farmer.</p>

              <p>Seriously, this is really crap. I read the ST yesterday and they made it sound as though the fare increase was a positive happy thing! It showed how a pathetic family was actually not paying higher. What about the other millions of us who would be paying higher?</p>
              <p>And seriously, all excuses given by the govt is because they want to "help the lower income". From subsidies to GST to transport vouchers increase. Have they forgotten totally who are the ones paying for the running of this country? So what do majority middle income citizens stand to gain from all these increases?</p>
              <p>Its sad that the people are now taking all these price increases as though it is a annual tradition that should not be opposed. Is there anything else we can do to besides discussing it? Feelin so helpless...don't know what to do</p>
