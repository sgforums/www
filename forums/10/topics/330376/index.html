              <p>I wonder why are they talking about tranport fare increases right now. Oil was $150 per barrel when they conceived the idea, now oil is $100 and with the impending global economic issues, it seems unlikely that oil will hit $150 anytime soon.</p>
              <p>Now they are telling us that the new public transport fare price is beneficial to most of us. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>So what is their basis for increasing public transport fares during this time? To shore up Temasek's account from recent losses in overseas investments?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Seems like we are the proverbial sheep, therefore we have to be fleeced occasionally by the farmer.</p>

              <p>Makes no sense right, their reason for increase then was high oil price, but now oil dropped $50 to $100 per barrel. Still they want to increase to help the poor people. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p><br>The shares are expensive.   Was lower when it first started.   Voice out our unhappiness about it, others will complain.    Don't voice out, they the greedy evil take it that we accept it.  On the whole, this ruling party is just only interested to earn more and more money out of us.   The best solution is still to vote them out.</p>
              <p>It will reach $3 in time to come.    Whatever it is we have the right to voice out, we are citizens of this land.    Prob is when the pay and pay wants something out of it, they choose to ignore the voice from the people.   Very evil greedy toads they are.</p>

              <blockquote>
              <p><br><br><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;"><span>SINGAPORE: Public response to the forthcoming public transport fare adjustments has <strong>generally been positive. </strong><br> <br> But one transport analyst cautioned that there could be a higher fare increase next year.
              <br> <br> "Okay lah, what to do?" said a man, when asked about how he felt about
              the fare adjustments. That generally summed up the sentiment of most
              commuters.
              <br> <br>While commuters welcomed the higher rebates for transfers to get to
              their destinations, some said they would not mind paying more for
              direct journeys as transfers are too troublesome.
              <br> <br>"I don't really like taking multiple trips, because it wastes a lot
              of time. So I'd rather pay a few cents more, take a direct trip," said
              a commuter.
              <br> <br> Others felt that the fare hike came at a time when prices are rising.
              <br> <br>"I hope (they) don't increase anymore, because right now, (it is)
              very hard to find (a) job, some of them (the people have) financial
              problem also," said a Malay woman.
              <br> <br>Concession fares for children and students will remain the same, as
              will the cost of monthly passes for students and National Servicemen.
              As for senior citizens, concession hours on weekdays have been extended
              to include the evening rush hour for train services run by SMRT.
              <br> <br> "Sometimes, we go and visit our son, no need to rush to come back. Save money also," said an old man. 
              <br> <br>The government and transport operators, SBS Transit and SMRT Corp,
              are spending over S$5m to help low income families cope with the fare
              hike. They have jointly set aside S$5.2 million to fund an additional
              130,000 public transport vouchers for low-income families.
              <br> <br>A transport analyst said that removing the transfer penalty is an
              important step towards a hub-and-spoke transport system. But the issue
              is how to split the cost between operators and commuters.
              <br> <br>"There's always some sharing of the burden, and there'll be winners
              and losers. All of these numbers are relatively small, so the winners
              are not big winners, and the losers are not big losers," said Professor
              Paul Barter from the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy.
              <br> <br> He noted that this year's inflation numbers will likely factor into next year's fare review.
              <br> <br>Prof Barter said: "One feature of the formula is that the inflation
              that is put into the formula is last year's inflation. So we see that
              the fare increase that was allowed this year is only 3 per cent, and in
              actual fact the Public Transport Council has only allowed 0.7 per cent
              on average.
              <br> <br>"Because inflation has been higher this year, we would anticipate
              that next year the formula may allow for a higher increase." However he
              added that the burden of increase on commuters is likely to remain low.

              <p>I wonder why are they talking about tranport fare increases
              right now. Oil was $150 per barrel when they conceived the idea,
              now oil is $100 and with the impending global economic issues, it
              seems unlikely that oil will hit $150 anytime soon.</p>
              <p>Now they are telling us that the new public transport fare price
              is beneficial to most of us. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>So what is their basis for increasing public transport fares
              during this time? To shore up Temasek's account from recent losses
              in overseas investments?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Seems like we are the proverbial sheep, therefore we have to be
              fleeced occasionally by the farmer.</p>
