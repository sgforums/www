              <p>Don't think it's possible to make profits this way, because once
              the company goes public with IPO, the shares would already have
              been priced at the market level.</p>
              <p>i.e. If you own a company with an earning of say $200 and equity
              $1,000, your ROE is 20%. If say you own all the 1,000 shares, each
              share will give you a 20 cents (20%) earnings per share.</p>
              <p>But if you release the 500 shares into the market, the market
              will trade up the price of your $1 share to say $2, thereby making
              your earnings per share of 10%. The winners are the original
              owners, they have already profited from the difference.</p>

              <p>Don't be surprise even utility bills that we are using daily
              will be increased even when oil price is dropping. Thanks to
              Temasek and PAP that have sold it to private companies in the name
              of benefitting the public. They will work almost the same as
              privatising public transport to answer share holders. Singaporeans

              <p>U can buy shares on SBS, trans land and smrt, that is call privatisation, whereas formerly state owned are so rigid and do not offer IPO or limited shares or no shares. All these companies are runs by CEOs with a management hierrachy system same as all other private/limited companies, the only different is that govt hold the most shares.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Any business man can set up a bus or taxi company if he meet all legal aspects in running a transport company here, but so far there aren't much people keen on it. So it is not that there are no competition.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My dear Fuller, if u wish to invest in singapore transportation by opening a bus company, i am willing to be your underwriter if not your personal PA.</p>

              <p>Hike!! Fuller,</p>
              <p><br>In a business context, networking is important, to start a business in Singapore, especially in term of involving the public and govt sectors, u need 2 things, one being a super n finacially sound organsiation, the other being getting the right connection.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In the issue of transportation in Singapore, the singapore govt see it as a national level issue, a total disrupt of transportation can bring our economy and nation to it kneels, therefore govt involvement is naturally to ensure smooth running with no problem. If you look at our own Germany, one strike on bus services in 2002, the whole nation come into a standstill until the chancellor agreed to the Union demand of higher paid for bus drivers. We in Singapore cannot undertake such action to take place.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Therefore strict laws and criterias apply, as an SS woman officer, that is all i can let your know, my fuller, with all due respect, hope you understand the meaning of privatisation.</p>

              <p>what does privatisation has to do with what u have said? does it explain the meaning of privatisation?  anyway, u dont need to explain it. i understand it. i am against privatisation of public transport company.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>if the strike can improve the income of drivers, i am all for it. isnt it part and parcel of the free labour movement? isnt free labour movement is part and parcel of the free economy?</p>

              <p>yes the depot ruling regime wont allow it, but that doesnt mean it i not correct.</p>
