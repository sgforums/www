              <p>transport coupons or vouchers to help the needy absorb the transport cost increase, is only for this year.. the price increase is usually permanent.</p>
              <p>Against increased car population, public buses spent more time caught in jams and incur more fuel costs. ERP rates are increased, public buses also incur more costs. The decision to release more COEs and allow the car population to grow excessively in recent years, was a very bad decision. Carparks are now in serious shortage. Land is not not used efficiently. Now, users of public transport must partially bear the costs of private car users.</p>

              <p><br>PLease also take note that the approved formula to caluculate the fare increase contains a component which is linked to the productivity gains of SMRT. Any increase in productivity gains(Such as advertising or rental of SMRT premises to tenants) by SMRT will be factored into the formula to reduce the quantum of the fare hike.</p>

              <p>The correlation is NO longer there between fare hikes and oil prices as in the 2007 hike, oil prices went down after the Lebanon war to around $80 and lower. the reason given by PTC : "There is no extenuating reason NOT to increase."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When oil is up they capitalise on it .</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The fares has NEVER never been reduced before unlike petrol, irregardless of oil prices, cheaper wages of foreign drivers, CUT in CPF wages ,market domination and huge reserves.</p>

              <p><br>Losses they suffered? Are you sure it's losses or supernormal profits? SMRT had a Return on Equity** (ROE) of 22.1% for Financial Year 2007, while Hong Kong's MTR had a Return on Equity of 10.2% for Financial Year 2007. If you want to talk about investment risk (beta) for this stable industry, what is the appropriate return? Another comparable MTR is operating in the region of 10.2%, while SMRT is operating at more than 2 times the returns for this industry every year. Doesn't it prove to you that the government is exploiting us?</p>

              <p>Obviously you do not understand the meaning of the term productivity gains.</p>
              <p><em><strong>"Productivity</strong> in </em><a title="Economics" href="/wiki/Economics"><em><span style="color: #000000;">economics</span></em></a><em> refers to measures of output from production processes, per unit of input."</em></p>
              <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity</a></p>
              <p>What you describe here is law of dimishing returns, not productivity gains. How can one say that the maintenance schedule has increased per km travelled, yet claim that as a productivity gain? If you operated the trains at 10,000 km per maintenance schedule, subsequently it dropped to 5,000 km per maintenance schedule, it is a productivity loss.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>When compared to MTR (HK), SMRT (SG) not only make profits, they made extremely supernormal profits, twice the industry average for ROE. The sad thing is, some Singaporeans are still hoodwinked into thinking that the government has been fair in it's dealings with the Singaporean public.</strong></p>
