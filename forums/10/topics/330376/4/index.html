              <p>Seriously, this is really crap. I read the ST yesterday and they made it sound as though the fare increase was a positive happy thing! It showed how a pathetic family was actually not paying higher. What about the other millions of us who would be paying higher?</p>
              <p>And seriously, all excuses given by the govt is because they want to "help the lower income". From subsidies to GST to transport vouchers increase. Have they forgotten totally who are the ones paying for the running of this country? So what do majority middle income citizens stand to gain from all these increases?</p>
              <p>Its sad that the people are now taking all these price increases as though it is a annual tradition that should not be opposed. Is there anything else we can do to besides discussing it? Feelin so helpless...don't know what to do</p>

              <p>Yes, we can do something.  Vote PAP out.</p>
              <p>Pay and pay will come out with all craps to justify the increase.    Media is their favourite and useful tool for such propaganda/brainwashing.</p>
              <p>Life will not get better if we continue to vote them in.  </p>

              <p>What you describe here is law of dimishing returns, not productivity gains. How can one say that the maintenance schedule has increased per km travelled, yet claim that as a productivity gain? If you operated the trains at 10,000 km per maintenance schedule, subsequently it dropped to 5,000 km per maintenance schedule, it is a productivity loss.</p>

              <p>I love your statements. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>1) ROE MUST increase every year.</p>
              <p>ROEs are like benchmarks in particular industry. MTR (HK) which is equivalent to MRT has an ROE which approximates to 10%. You idea that ROE MUST increase every year, to what level may I ask? 100%, 200%, 300%? The ROE for Singapore Power is also extremely high by industry standards.</p>
              <p>2) Is it without money or without supernormal profits that trains cannot be acquired?</p>
              <p>When you buy trains, you can always take a loan from banks. Every year with your financial reporting, in the income and expenditure statement there is a deduction of depreciation. i.e. If your train say cost $100, with a useful life of 5 years, a straight line depreciation will charge $20 to the income &amp; expenditure account for 5 years. Therefore the ROE (which uses profits from the income &amp; expenditure account) already has a charge of the trains in the figure.</p>

              <p>Don't think it's possible to make profits this way, because once the company goes public with IPO, the shares would already have been priced at the market level.</p>
              <p>i.e. If you own a company with an earning of say $200 and equity $1,000, your ROE is 20%. If say you own all the 1,000 shares, each share will give you a 20 cents (20%) earnings per share.</p>
              <p>But if you release the 500 shares into the market, the market will trade up the price of your $1 share to say $2, thereby making your earnings per share of 10%. The winners are the original owners, they have already profited from the difference.</p>

              <p>They are stronger because they overcharge us, then make us squeeze like sardines, so they can get more profits. Above 20% ROE as compared to MTR (HK) 10%.</p>
