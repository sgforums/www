It is not pure academic or IQ or EQ ability or talents which count for such jobs. It is either you have or have not and such talent like Tiger Wood or Yao Meng have is in-born. These talents cannot be compared anywhere.<br><br>Let us not begrudge the CEOs who are earning ten times the salaries of a doctor in the private practice for not having a degree or basic education because of a combination of circumstances - good timing, opportunity bestowed upon him by a generous boss, or his other hidden talents not measured by books or studying.<br><br>Let us not begrudge the civil servants who have proven their worth due to their contributions to the economy who rise up the ranks and become permanent secretaries earning $300,000.00 pa.<br><br>However let us accept and establish one important overriding principle here : Be honest if you are the trustee of public monies. Do not just take public monies to pay yourself due to your power to sign cheques to give yourself $700,000.00 pa jump in salary just through some pretentious false benchmarking through sheer exercise of trustee or political power.<br><br>Let your worth as the trustee be assessed by an independent panel unconnected with the government so that people can accept your taking of public monies through such power.<br><br>Only this kind of government is honest fair and equitable and working for the largest good of the largest number not otherwise.<br><br>If the panel makes an apple-to-apple comparison of ministers' salaries to those who are doing similar type of jobs where funds are coming from internal sources with no necessity for winning funds (like Fund Managers) and spending of monies is no problem and not get carried away by assuming that bill collectors are the greatest of talents and deserve to be paid more.<br><br>Also make comparison with the best leaders' governing of larger nations who are equally or more successful than governing of our little red dot be gracious to accept that decision and don't start going around to say that Switzerland or Finland Leaders are mediocre.<br><br></div>
