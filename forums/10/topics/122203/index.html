            <div class='col-md body'>Though this article was written in 2003, I think it is still very relevant today.<br><br>Full Marx for Singapore's working class.<br><br>By Jake van der Kamp jakeva@s...<br>29 August 2003<br>South China Morning Post<br>(c) 2003 South China Morning Post Publishers Limited, Hong Kong. All<br>rights reserved.<br><br>AND HERE IS the latest gem from Singapore, straight from the front<br>page in this diehard bastion of central planning of the leading<br>English language newspaper, Pravda (Party Rendition and Authorised<br>Version of Daily Announcements).<br><br>Apparently the Singapore government is worried wages have gone too<br>high and some corrective action must be taken to bring them down.<br><br>That finding results in part from what some people in New York told<br>Deputy Prime Minister Tony Tan on a visit there (this counts for<br>detailed policy research in Singapore) and partly from a recent wage<br>survey by the Political and Economic Risk Consultancy (Perc), which<br>rated labour costs in Singapore as higher than those in the United<br>States or Australia.<br><br>Perc's methodology in this survey was to ask expatriates what they<br>thought of labour costs in different countries, another example of<br>the sort of detailed policy research that has little time for hard<br>statistics. The figures from both countries on employee earnings say<br>that average wages are at least 25 per cent greater in the US than in<br>Singapore and this is after taking the highest Singapore numbers I<br>could find.<br><br>For the flavour of what you get when basing a labour cost study on<br>expatriate opinion, notice from the table that Perc rates labour<br>costs in Vietnam higher than in Thailand. For a good laugh tell that<br>to people in Hanoi or Bangkok.<br><br>You may also wish to note that Singapore's gross domestic product per<br>capita is 25 times greater than Indonesia's while Perc says its<br>average labour costs are only 1.6 times as great. This sort of<br>disparity with neighbouring countries is common and suggests that<br>Singapore workers are underpaid for their level of productivity.<br><br>But why let the facts get in the way of a good scare story. The<br>Singapore government subscribes to the story and has come up with a<br>way to cut labour costs - cut back contributions to the Central<br>Provident Fund (CPF) from their present level of 36 per cent of<br>employee earnings. This does not mean, by the way, employees will<br>instead get this money. It is their employers who will.<br><br>Now if the Hong Kong government were to cut Mandatory Provident Fund<br>contributions in Hong Kong most people probably would applaud. It is<br>dead money anyway. Given the derisory rates of return that the CPF<br>gives Singaporeans, you would think they might share that sentiment.<br><br>But Singaporeans do not have to wait until retirement to get their<br>CPF money. They can use their contributions to pay for their homes<br>and other approved investments. Many of them are thus unhappy with<br>the proposed cut. In mortgage payments they will have to make up from<br>their direct income what previously they got from the CPF. It is all<br>rather highhanded and will hurt them.<br><br>And who will benefit? To answer this question you must first<br>appreciate two crucial differences between Singapore and Hong Kong.<br>The first is courtesy of the usual central planner's obsession with<br>making things, Singapore still has 25 per cent of its economy tied up<br>in manufacturing while the figure in Hong Kong is less than 5 per<br>cent.<br><br>The second is that 75 per cent of investment in manufacturing in<br>Singapore is foreign investment whereas that figure in Hong Kong is<br>negligible. What will happen in Singapore is foreign employers will<br>take what native Singaporean workers lose through this cut.<br><br>There will be a transfer of wealth from the people who worked for it<br>to the multinational corporations (MNCs). This could be excusable if<br>these MNCs then invested the money back in Singapore but the<br>difficulty is capital investment in Singapore is dropping faster than<br>a rock in freefall and has never been lower than it is now, relative<br>to the size of the economy. The MNCs are mostly in exit mode now.<br>They will not put the money back into Singapore. They will just take<br>it home with them.<br><br>Then you get to that fuzzy thinking that labour costs are an<br>obstruction to economic performance. If so, Mr Tan, may I ask you<br>what is the point of economic effort? Is it not to improve the<br>prosperity of those who participate? What sort of an achievement is<br>it if you instead make them poorer?<br><br>I have always maintained that Singapore is the one country to have<br>come closest to achieving communism in the classic Marxist sense.<br>This is now unfortunately also showing the classic result of central<br>planning put in practice, a steady grinding down of working class<br>disposable income.</div>
