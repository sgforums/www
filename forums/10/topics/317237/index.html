              <p>As Singaporeans, how many of us have ever considered this question- What can be considered peranakan? Some may reply, "Sure I do, it's just a half chinese half malay person and his or hers culture."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However, due to the standardization of language, Singaporean peranakans are classified as Chinese and this results in the loss of culture. For example, one classmate of mine is half chinese half indian. Although he holds an indian passport, but he takes chinese as his mother tongue and he knows nuts about indian culture.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So the question is- To what extent can we generally consider someone "genetically peranakan" to be a peranakan in the Singapore we know today?</p>

              <p>'Peranakan' is a community of Chinese migrants who have settled largely in Malacca during the 1800s, and taken Malay brides - without converting to Islam, as during that period Islam was not part of the Malay ''official'' religion, nor tradition, nor culture.</p>
              <p>Islam was not part of the Malay community from the days when they migrated from the hills of Yunan, China - {souce: Dr M Mahathir ''Malay Dilemma'' }</p>
              <p>The Chinese migrants - mostly from Guanzhou and Fuchien - who have taken Malay brides had accomodated their brides by allowing some Malay customs and practices into their Chinese traditional practices - which remain dominant in the relationship between the couple.</p>
              <p>This happy union also saw the Malay language being used with an easy mix and transfer between one spoken language to the other, and saw the development of new words that is a happy marriage of the Chinese dialect with the Malay language.</p>
              <p>Perhaps the 'Peranakans' are the representative of the Malaysian and Singaporean political reality - as family bonds run across the border.</p>

              <p>the very layman malay definition of `peranakan' stem from the word `anak', which means `child'. `per...an' typically connocts an action in the malay's word usage (sorry, i do not know the right terminology to explain this), so `peranakan', if is not a formal noun, simply means to `give birth to a child'.</p>
              <p>`Peranakan' hence is therefore refers to a child born here, i.e. in the Straits, and typically more in reference to Chinese as Malay would not associate themselves with this term `Peranakan'. I do not know the historical origin of the word, but it was probably used by the Chinese in days of old to indicate that they are 2nd generation chinese, not born in China. i am not sure if there is a malay blood lineage to these `Peranakans', but if there is, so be it.</p>
              <p>i am not malay nor peranakan btw, so forgive me if i messed up. i just want to give a stab at the meaning of the word and how it probably evolved.</p>

              <p>Exactly.</p>
              <p>A new community formed by the bonding of the Chinese migrants with the Malay women resulted in a new social, traditional and cultural practices with <em>new patois</em> formed from a mix of Malay, Chinese and even English languages and dialects.</p>
              <p>Over time, other Chinese born locally and descendants of the early migrants - not necessarily from the marriage with a Malay - may have further diluted the Chinese-Malay bloodline by marrying their offsprings, and will continue to be influenced by the new culture that is uniquely from this community.</p>

              <p>Sorry. I do not intend or wish to make it seem like "they were sub standard". In fact, the half chinese and half indian classmate I talk about is a high achiever and I'm sure you get to see him every now or then.</p>
              <p>What I want to highlight is- the peranakan culture is slowly disappearing as people of mixed heritage are only allowed a single mother tongue language to be taught in school, thus resulting in many peranakan students who do not know much of their distinct culture.</p>
              <p>Hence, should there be any changes implemented to our current educational system and our social mindset so as to preserve the unique peranakan culture?</p>

              <p>'Peranakan' is a community of Chinese migrants who have settled largely in Malacca during the 1800s, and taken Malay brides - without converting to Islam, as during that period Islam was not part of the Malay ''official'' religion, nor tradition, nor culture.</p>
              <p>Islam was not part of the Malay community from the days when they migrated from the hills of Yunan, China - {souce: Dr M Mahathir ''Malay Dilemma'' }</p>
              <p>The Chinese migrants - mostly from Guanzhou and Fuchien - who have taken Malay brides had accomodated their brides by allowing some Malay customs and practices into their Chinese traditional practices - which remain dominant in the relationship between the couple.</p>
              <p>This happy union also saw the Malay language being used with an easy mix and transfer between one spoken language to the other, and saw the development of new words that is a happy marriage of the Chinese dialect with the Malay language.</p>
              <p>Perhaps the 'Peranakans' are the representative of the Malaysian and Singaporean political reality - as family bonds run across the border.</p>

              <p>Hey, I have gone to the Peranakan museum yesterday and I looked through the exhibits. There was this short video clip being featured and inside, there was this man who said that there's not criteria (like wearing the traditional costume, eating the traditional food etc) for one to be considered a peranakan.</p>

              <p>I totaly agree with what the man says but a peranakan must recognize his /her roots and pass it on to his descendants.</p>
