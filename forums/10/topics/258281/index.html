            <div class='col-md body'>Even visitor also doesn't understand why is Singapore govt so desperate for foreigners!<br><br>Random notes on Singapore<br>Surya, 3quarksdaily<br>May 27, 2007<br><br>It is true that changes are afoot in a nation that Â– after the Asian Financial Crisis, and the terror caused by the spread of SARs Â– realised its government could never offer it complete protection.<br><br>The bargain for freedom from want in return for silent cooperation was not legitimately struck.<br><br>It was based on the false notion that Singapore was a nation in charge of its own destiny rather than a small sliver of land, smaller than the dot that represents it on the global map.<br><br>It made me think of my last trip to Singapore, a couple of months back. Every time I visit Singapore, I am surprised by the pace of change. I, in my nostalgia, try to seek out places I knew from before, and am constantly reminded that I am oh-so-outdated.<br><br>But this time, I was struck by the number of foreigners. I still remember the time I first came to Singapore.<br><br>The year was 1995 - sure, there were some foreigners around, but we felt like foreigners - I mean, we felt like we were a minority - as I assume, foreigners in any country are supposed to feel.<br><br>I was in Singapore for just a day and had way too many people to catch up with - so I set up shop at a cafe near Millenia towers and as I had cup of coffee after cup of coffee with friends who managed to sneak off work for a coffee break, I indulged in one of my favourite pastimes - people watching - and I was more than amazed by the proportion of foreigners - almost every other person seemed to be a foreigner!!<br><br>And for the first time, I heard murmurs of dissent among my Singaporean friends, and we had some lively discussions on the topic.<br><br>I donÂ’t quite get it - why is the Singapore Government so desperate for foreigners? Do they really need so many foreigners - to perhaps, the extent, that you have to ask who is the minority here?<br><br>I can only imagine the government has a plan - and a good one too - that is behind this mass import of Â“talentÂ”. But none of my Singaporean friends seemed quite able to explain to me the rationale behind the policy. Which begs a bigger question.<br><br>This is just one of the many policies that the Government makes on behalf of the citizens. I wonder, without due political participation and debate, why do the people assume that the Government will get it right every single time? What if they are wrong?<br>Posted by Surya</div>
