              <p>Me too. Funny how a few threads ago you were the one being realistic while I was the one being idealistic. Let me quote from Orwell:</p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">You understand well enough how the Party maintains itself in power. Now tell me why we cling to power. What is our motive? Why should we want power? Go on, speak,' he added as Winston remained silent. <br><br>Nevertheless Winston did not speak for another moment or two. A feeling of weariness had overwhelmed him. The faint, mad gleam of enthusiasm had come back into O'Brien's face. He knew in advance what O'Brien would say. That the Party did not seek power for its own ends, but only for the good of the majority. That it sought power because men in the mass were frail cowardly creatures who could not endure liberty or face the truth, and must be ruled over and systematically deceived by others who were stronger than themselves. That the choice for mankind lay between freedom and happiness, and that, for the great bulk of mankind, happiness was better. That the party was the eternal guardian of the weak, a dedicated sect doing evil that good might come, sacrificing its own happiness to that of others. The terrible thing, thought Winston, the terrible thing was that when O'Brien said this he would believe it. You could see it in his face. O'Brien knew everything. A thousand times better than Winston he knew what the world was really like, in what degradation the mass of human beings lived and by what lies and barbarities the Party kept them there. He had understood it all, weighed it all, and it made no difference: all was justified by the ultimate purpose. What can you do, thought Winston, against the lunatic who is more intelligent than yourself, who gives your arguments a fair hearing and then simply persists in his lunacy? <br><br>'You are ruling over us for our own good,' he said feebly. 'You believe that human beings are not fit to govern themselves, and therefore --' <br><br>He started and almost cried out. A pang of pain had shot through his body. O'Brien had pushed the lever of the dial up to thirty-five. <br><br>'That was stupid, Winston, stupid!' he said. 'You should know better than to say a thing like that.' <br><br>He pulled the lever back and continued: <br><br>'Now I will tell you the answer to my question. It is this. <strong>The Party seeks power entirely for its own sake. We are not interested in the good of others; we are interested solely in power. Not wealth or luxury or long life or happiness: only power, pure power.</strong> What pure power means you will understand presently. We are different from all the oligarchies of the past, in that we know what we are doing. All the others, even those who resembled ourselves, were cowards and hypocrites. The German Nazis and the Russian Communists came very close to us in their methods, but they never had the courage to recognize their own motives. They pretended, perhaps they even believed, that they had seized power unwillingly and for a limited time, and that just round the corner there lay a paradise where human beings would be free and equal. We are not like that. We know that no one ever seizes power with the intention of relinquishing it. <strong>Power is not a means, it is an end. One does not establish a dictatorship in order to safeguard a revolution; one makes the revolution in order to establish the dictatorship.</strong> The object of persecution is persecution. The object of torture is torture. The object of power is power. Now do you begin to understand me?' </span><br></p>

              <p>Actually idealistic would imply that i'm making a decision without
                      observing the stituation. Being realistic means i'm willing to accept
                      the possibilities of factors that's outside my normal field of belief
                      or control, even if i feel that field already covers alot of ground.</p>
              <p>I like your quotes, they're very interesting to read. But i
                      think you might get better responses if you posted more of your own
                      opinions instead of posting quotes and links. You post the link or
                      quotes, it gives a reader the sense of insincerity like you expect the
                      reader to come to the same conclusion as you did and it feels rude
                      somehow, like you're not willing to give the reader any room to come to
                      different conclusions. </p>
              <p>But now to actually respond to your quotes.</p>
              <p>I
                      find that the opinions of Orwell very typical of the Western mentality.
                      Because of their influence by the Bible, they believe that there can
                      only be good or evil, God or Satan. I believe that humans are
                      ultimately social creatures, they do not knowingly pursue a socially
                      destructive path because they still want to benefit from that
                      society.They are neither evil or good, they just function on what they
                      perceive as a need.</p>
              <p>A person working hard in order to buy his 3 storey bungalow, a
                      nice garden and 2 cars is doing nothing wrong. He wants to provide for
                      his family and give them a good life. But when you put it into
                      perspective that the infrastructure and resources (Water, Electricity,
                      Waste disposal, Road repairs, Police) to support thousands of families,
                      you realise what a gross abuse of resource it can come to be.</p>
              <p>That
                      is why the current state of affairs on this planet is so difficult. How
                      do you convince people who see how much comfort the guy next to them is
                      having that such an enjoyment is grossly impossible to support if
                      everyone lives like that? How do you tell the Third World that you
                      can't live like the First World, there isn't enough resources for all
                      of us to live like that.</p>
              <p>It's equivalent to the First World eating at a fancy restaurant ,
                      finishing the food letting the Third World have dessert and then
                      telling them they can't ever order the main course again. Then, the First World would laugh at the Third World for having poor table manners for not knowing the proper way to eat something they never ate in the first place</p>
              <p>How would you tell the First World that pursuing such a comfort 
                      when they have already come to accept such a way of life as standard
                      and normal for them?They want the freedom to enjoy, but do not
                      understand the amount of responsibility it takes to support their
                      lifestyle.  But how could you expect people to understand things
                      outside of their experience? it's equivalent to asking a IT person to
                      understand Picasso.</p>
              <p>That Orwell quote you used is very suitable
                      to use in a movie or drama. Because we've come to believe that there is
                      only 2 polarities in the world. Good and evil, immoral and moral. It is
                      this thinking that has brought the human race this far, because the
                      concept of good and evil makes it easy to incite populations to conquer
                      or survive difficult circumstances</p>
              <p>If we talk to every single
                      one responsible for the current crisis, i doubt you will still think
                      they are power hungry individuals but humans not far removed from you
                      and I. They are victims of legacy, circumstances and the foolish need
                      to stand out. That's how insidious that i feel the problem is, every
                      individual has done what they feel is correct but cannot see the damage
                      they can do when all of it connects to one big boom.</p>
              <p>Actually i'm far more pessimistic than you realise about humans.
                      I do not see a monolithic intention to take over the world, i see a
                      mass of individuals doing what they  each feel is right but a massive
                      disaster when it all comes together.  I see frightened children in the
                      power hungry men, you can at least try to reason with a power hungry
                      man but you cannot with a frightened child.</p>
              <p>With the power of
                      the Internet, we now know more of men like Hitler, Stalin, Mao Zedong
                      outside of what the Western media has chose to tell. We know that if
                      the circumstances were slightly different we might have called them
                      friends and comrades or they might have been hailed as visionaries in a
                      slightly different setting. </p>
              <p>I believe that it takes multiple
                      factors to create what we see and understand as an effect, not only one
                      single reason or cause. Rather than think of it as a single stone
                      hitting the water to create the ripple,i feel it's more of a mass of ripples hitting other ripples to create new and unexpected ripples. The stones that created the original ripples, being too ancient for us to do anything about it.</p>

                  to asking a IT person to understand Picasso.</p>
              <p>That Orwell quote you used is very suitable to use in a movie or
                  drama. Because we've come to believe that there is only 2
                  polarities in the world. Good and evil, immoral and moral. It is
                  this thinking that has brought the human race this far, because the
                  concept of good and evil makes it easy to incite populations to
                  conquer or survive difficult circumstances</p>
              <p>If we talk to every single one responsible for the current
                  crisis, i doubt you will still think they are power hungry
                  individuals but humans not far removed from you and I. They are
                  victims of legacy, circumstances and the foolish need to stand out.
                  That's how insidious that i feel the problem is, every individual
                  has done what they feel is correct but cannot see the damage they
                  can do when all of it connects to one big boom.</p>
              <p>Actually i'm far more pessimistic than you realise about humans.
                  I do not see a monolithic intention to take over the world, i see a
                  mass of individuals doing what they  each feel is right but a
                  massive disaster when it all comes together.  I see frightened
                  children in the power hungry men, you can at least try to reason
                  with a power hungry man but you cannot with a frightened child.</p>
              <p>With the power of the Internet, we now know more of men like
                  Hitler, Stalin, Mao Zedong outside of what the Western media has
                  chose to tell. We know that if the circumstances were slightly
                  different we might have called them friends and comrades or they
                  might have been hailed as visionaries in a slightly different
                  setting. </p>
              <p>I believe that it takes multiple factors to create what we see
                  and understand as an effect, not only one single reason or cause.
                  Rather than think of it as a single stone hitting the water to
                  create the ripple,i feel it's more of a mass of ripples hitting
                  other ripples to create new and unexpected ripples. The stones that
                  created the original ripples, being too ancient for us to do
                  anything about it.</p>

              <p>Alright, then what is your opinion of Orwell's quote? By the way, I suggest reading<em> 1984</em>, you can easily get it online. Orwell's <em>1984</em> is usually described as a warning against totalitarianism and in my opinion, that piece which I quoted is some straight talk that describes those in power.</p>
              <p>By your reply, I assume that you deny the existence of people like O'Brien? You think that no one can be that inhumane. You think that governments will never kill their own citizens to further their own political ambitions. You believe that people will never do anything that would intentionally harm another human being. Please correct me if I'm wrong.</p>
              <p><em>That</em> is idealism. Granted, that is the mentality of most of society, but not of its rulers. If only those in power shared such a mentality, the world would truly be better off because we have all the technology to solve the most pressing ills of the world. It only takes an understanding of the history of government false-flags to shatter that illusion. You may feel that seeing things in absolute terms is a wrong approach. Even if the ones implementing a decision may feel that it would benefit society, or some group, perhaps the ones that made the decision sought to pursue a selfish and inhumane goal.</p>
              <p>For instance, GM companies like Monsato purport to increase crop yields, resistance to diseases etc. Its employees likely believe that its actions are benefiting the world. However, the reality is different. Organic crops out-field GM crops. More importantly, GM crops act as mobile copyrights that are regularly used to sue non-GM farmers when they land on non-GM fields. In addition, the cost of GM seeds and related chemicals usually bankrupt farmers such that 1000 farmers in India commit suicide every month due to desperation. Of course, Monsato could solve this problem. But then, its goals are monopoly and profits. Knowing that they are causing massive suffering, the heads of Monsato sweep it all aside in the name of profits and monopolisation of the food industry.</p>
              <p>You may think I'm being arrogant, and its likely I am. But when a certain level of understanding has been reached, everything appears in black or white.</p>

              <p>Well, i read through the quick introduction for 1984. It does have
              some very interesting concepts and it is likely what we could head
              towards such a future. But for such a system to exist, the war needs to
              be fought for quite a few decades, long enough for the next generation
              to be borned and grow up without knowledge of the world before them.</p>
              <p>I
              don't deny that such a scenario would evolved, the more we continue to
              exhaust our natural resources such a future would only become more and
              more likely, even neccessary. Because there won't be enough natural
              resources left for us to live as luxuriously as we do now, rationing
              would become the rule not the exception.  </p>
              <p>You misunderstood
              me, i do not deny the existence of people like O'Brien. I'm sure there
              are more than enough sociopaths out there like him running around in
              the governments of the world. </p>
              <p>I believe a government is
              essentially a gang occupying a territory. They could chose to terrorize
              the populace, demand excessive protection money and beat others into
              submission. Very soon, people will start to flee from their territory
              leaving them nothing to subsist on.I'm sure this logic is hardly
              difficult to believe.</p>
              <p>Alternatively, they could demand a small amount of protection
              money (taxes), provide security from other gangs (the police), help
              settle problems between the inhabitants (court, justice system). By
              giving access to electricity, water and decent housing to attract more
              people to live here, they get more tax money and naturally they will
              also benefit more.</p>
              <p>In this world of globalisation, great and
              creative minds are just as valuable as gold, oil and military strength.
              If you intentionally chose to brain wash your people, you are shooting
              yourself in the foot because you're denying yourself an advantage.</p>
              <p>China
              has practiced what is basically totalitarian rule for milleniums, but
              yet they still put so much emphasis on education, yes?</p>
              <p>Even
              in the world of 1984, by denying your people proper education you lose
              the edge of gaining that one General, that one Scientist, that one
              Politician of ending the war in the first place.  </p>
              <p>I do not
              deny that occasionally there would be sociopaths that would think
              nothing of killing his own country for political advancement. However,
              i believe the vast majority are basically looking for what they can
              hope to gain from the system and will avoid socially destructive
              policies as much as possible (that is, if they can actually identify it
              as a socially destructive policy in the first place, like the War on
              Terror)</p>
              <p>Oh i believe any politician would gladly see you and i
              slowly die in agony in an acid pool if it saves their own skin. But i
              doubt they would do it for the power, only for tangible benefits. Even
              for O'Brien the benefits come from being able to do whatever he wants
              to you without persecution.</p>
              <p>Yes, i've heard the stories of
              genetically modified crop companies using their technology to extort
              farmers. Monsato can do that because it is a company, with no social
              obligations whatsoever and answering only to its shareholders and if
              the people gets upset that's the problem of the Indian government, not
              them. </p>
              <p>No, no i don't think you're arrogant. If you're arrogant
              you won't be having these discussions i enjoy so much, you would be
              saying that i'm <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">delusional</span></strong>, <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">licking the assdogs</span></strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"> </span>or "feeling sad that you don't understand the truth but it's ok i'm still willing to sacrifice myself to kill the terrorists."</p>
              <p>Arrogance
              i feel is a demonstration of ignorance. Something a person does when
              they are no longer capable of understanding more of the world and
              foolishly guard what little they know like some holy grail. They blare
              aloud of what they know because they are afraid the world does not
              agree with them.</p>
              <p>I merely wish to speak out my logic and see if
              others could poke holes into it. Because i see it as an advantage to
              know the flaws in my logic, i can only be a better person by knowing
              more of my flaws not by denying they exist.</p>
              <p>Seeing things in
              black and white is only the result of absorbing information at face
              value. The shareholders of Monsato also see their numbers in black and
              white no? If you want to be better than such men, you need to be able
              to see things in more colors than them.</p>
              <p>I would recommand
              Macolm Gladwell's Outliers to you, an excellent book.  You'd be
              surprised at how much external factors centuries old can play to shape
              us.</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>Let's just put the discussions about seeing things in black or white on hold first. I believe that human beings are <strong>emergent</strong>, that they have to constantly change, and in the process, upgrade their beliefs. Its not progressive to hold on to certain preconceptions about the world that have been obviously conditioned into people.</p>
              <p>The world that Orwell wrote of, an extreme form of totalitarian is, in my opinion, outdated, because other more efficient forms of governance have been developed. For Orwell's world to develop, a state of war has to be maintained to focus the peoples' hate on an external enemy, maintain a low standard of living (using up productive resources for war) and to provide the psychological basis for the despotic leadership to stay in power. As I said, while I find that Orwell's world is outdated, it holds certain elements of our society. In this regard, a <em>constant state of war</em> is a characteristic of our world. Think about it, in the last 50 years, we have the Cold War and numerous other relatively short conflicts. Post-Cold War, this state of war has persisted, in the Balkans, Somalia, Iraq, Afghanistan, giving rise to the so-called War on Terror. Our society is constantly in a state of war. If they were sponstaneous, then I wouldn't be making this point. However, the fact is that (using the example of) the Cold War was engineered for exactly the same reason that Orwell envisioned.</p>
              <p>Outside of the mainstream explaination of Cold War, which I hope you wouldn't call lies or "conspiracy theories", author and researcher Antony Sutton has exposed the fact that before, during and after the 1917 Russian Revolution, the US, giving tacit approval to corporations, have funded and built up the Soviet Union's military-industrial complex. Simply put, the US was merely creating an external enemy to focus society's hate for Orwellian purposes. Likewise, that situation was the same for the Afghan mujahedeen- the creation of an external enemy. While no one, as far as I know, has denied the accuracy of Sutton's work, this view has been ignored and shunned as "conspiracy theories", even in so-called 'academic' institutions in 'free' societies.</p>
              <p>When you say "education", there are different connotations to it. For me, "education" in society follows the mainstream path, which is usually <em>indoctrination of untrue beliefs and knowledge</em>. In countries like China, as you mentioned, how much of it is indoctrination or worker training than real education? By real education, I mean the objective presentation of facts without any motive to conceal or promote the so-called "mainstream" version. In the same breath, real education would never mock any "conspiracy" versions of an event, such as the example of the Cold War which I mentioned above. Unfortunately, your concept of education is grossly wrong.</p>
              <p>In our society, so-called "education" is mostly conditioning to accept certain ideas and to reject others, without giving much thought in it at all. Look up the Orwellian word "<em>crimestop</em>". I'm sure this forum has provided some good examples of that. In addition, our education system is designed, not to produce thinkers, but workers. To do this, the entire social system is always promoting consumerism and materialism through uncontrolled advertising, which after some time, conditions people to react emotionally rather than rationally. Why are people constantly competing to dress up better than another person? Why are peoples' worth as a <em>human being</em> measured by the clothes they wear and their material possessions? The ideal society should always treat another person as a fellow human being regardless of status. However, in today's society, not all men are created equal.</p>
              <p>And like you, I would wish to be proven wrong, not just condemned as a "conspiracy theorist", for I understand that being wrong allows one to be elevated to a higher level of understanding. However, our schools are designed to condition the mentality that being wrong, not producing results makes you worth less of a human being.</p>
              <p>Finally, there are more sociopaths in power than you think. Just because they are never, if rarely, mentioned by the MSM, criminal governments that carry out terrorist attacks to further their own political ambitions, dont think they do not exist. Why should they genuinely look after their peoples' concerns if they could just put up a superficial front while exploiting the ruled class? The object of power is power. As the old axiom goes, "Power corrupts, absolute power corrupts <em>absolutely</em>."</p>

              <p>Sorry to take this long, but it is a long post and i needed time to  gather and organize a proper response.</p>
              <p>I
              would not argue with you about the Cold War, because i do agree with
              you it's more about giving the military engine of the US more reasons
              to exist rather over communism and capitalism. </p>
              <p>However,  while i
              agree that it is a Orwellian characteristic i do not believe that is a
              part of a grand plan to create the totalitarian society. Too much
              factors have to come into play in order for that to be achieved. And if
              there is any group of individuals who are actually intelligent,
              disciplined and resourceful enough to actually make all this part of a
              grand plan then they rightfully deserve to rule the world.</p>
              <p>Yes,
              you've heard me right. If the Illumanti truly exist and they are
              deliberately doing this to achieve the totalitarian society, i would
              say in a evolution perspective they are exactly what we need to make
              sure the human race endures. The human race is wasting too much time
              bickering about differences of religion race and nationalities. We need
              men who could plan in decades, not only for the time in office.</p>
              <p>I
              do not believe that humans will ever coexist peacefully, we would never
              hold hands together and sing Kumbaya around a campfire unless there is
              someone with a big stick making sure that we do. We would not treat
              each other as equals if there is nothing making sure that we do.Because we are not.</p>
              <p><strong>Emergent </strong>is
              a new word to me. Thus i've check it up on wikipedia which i hope is
              accurate for me to base my opinion on. I hate posing quotes, but it's
              difficult to explain if i don't.</p>
              <blockquote>

              </blockquote>
              <p>that is what i feel the source of the chaos
              is from, groups of men with limited knowledge identifying a pattern or
              trend and doing everything in their power to make sure it happens. A
              self fulfilling Prophecy.</p>
              <p>In the eyes of these men they are
              doing what they feel is correct, increase the earnings of their
              companies can't be wrong. Looking for cheap labour can't be wrong and
              neither is looking for cheap natural resources. It's when you put the
              actions of these men together that the horrible results would become
              clear.</p>
              <p>I prefer to look at the results of history to make my
              judgement. China has culturally been the most advanced nation until the
              Ming Dynasty. When Zhu Di deployed his treasure ships to explore the
              worlds, Admiral Zheng He's men did not plunder, rape and burn every
              inferior culture they came across, they sought to open diplomatic ties
              and trade routes where ever they went.The West, however....</p>
              <p>The problems i have with your opinions on education is that you
              feel consumerism and materialism is only a recent thing, that it
              suddenly just sprung up the past century to become a problem.</p>
              <p>I
              believe that it is the survival instinct left over from our caveman
              ancestors. Even among animals there is a need to stand out in order to
              attract more mates. Females want to make sure their mate is capable of
              supporting offsprings while males look at the females "physical"
              capability to produce healthy offsprings.</p>
              <p>It
              is this need to constantly compete that we're so obsessed about looking
              like the super stars, and so happy when we see these super stars fall
              from grace.</p>
              <p>I don't doubt the existence of sociopaths in the governments of
              the world. It suits their need to dominate others. However, power is
              unlike material objects like oil, gold and weapons, it cannot be hoard
              it has to be shared.  You only get more power when you have more
              competent people working under you.</p>
              <p>There
              is no sense of morality influencing my logic, the competent people will
              only work under you if you satisfy their needs and wants, not just in
              the material sense. And you need their support to have actual power,
              that is politics because humans are social creatures and require a
              society to exist irregardless of whether it's totalitarian or
              democractic.  </p>
              <p>A government that do not look after their
              people's concerns would ultimately collapse, the same way an entire
              food chain will ultimately starve itself by overpopulation when you
              remove the main predator. If you deliberately make your population
              stupid you are ultimately going to weaken yourself.</p>
              <p>You can't have a slave population if your slaves aren't having their needs taken care of and actually reproducing.</p>
              <p>That
              is why i feel the world is in such a mess is precisely because it is
              non deliberate, that a series of short term answers(diverting money
              from education to the military, causing regime changes in order to gain
              access to resources..etc) is causing the problems.</p>
              <p>Humans still
              favor solutions that creates fast results and that problem is further
              made worse by the idea of Democracy because it gives in to the wants of
              the people, not the need. It does not install the competent, it install
              the more fluent speaking.</p>
              <p>My ideal objective is the continued existence of the race, there
              is no point talking about equality and freedom if the growing human
              population continues to consume itself into oblivion.</p>
              <p>Ironically, your idea of equality can only work in a totalitarian society under extensive social engineering. We can all only be equal in poverty or abundance and since abundance for 6 billion people is impossible, the answer is obvious.</p>

              <p>Don't mind. It only adds to an enjoyable debate.</p>
              <p>It's not that
                  I agree with you that totalitarianism is dead, but that a more
                  efficient method of governance has already been developed that
                  concentrates power in the hands of a power elite just like in a
                  totalitarian society without the explicit appearance of slavery. Total
                  control over most, if not all of the world does not require the grand
                  strategy that you referred to. Funnily enough, I don't have a name for
                  it so I request that you take a look at this clip- <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P772Eb63qIY">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P772Eb63qIY</a> and consider this quote from Aldous Huxley (The clip will shed more light on this quote):</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><em>"There
                  will be, in the next generation or so, a pharmacological method of
                  making people <strong>love their servitude</strong>, and producing dictatorship without
                  tears, so to speak, producing a kind of painless concentration camp for
                  entire societies, so that <strong>people will in fact have their liberties
                  taken away from them, but will rather enjoy it</strong>, because they will be
                  distracted from any desire to rebel by propaganda or brainwashing, or
                  brainwashing enhanced by pharmacological methods. And this seems to be
                  the final revolution."</em><br> - Aldous Huxley, Tavistock Group, California Medical School, 1961</span></span></p>
              <p>Just think of "pharmalogical methods" as today's entertainment, education, consumerism, fashion etc and the picture becomes clear. People can be slaves and yet, aren't aware of it. That's the beauty of the present system in creating a slave population. Free-range livestock is more productive than caged ones. This is <em>our</em> kind of freedom.</p>

              <p>I
                  dont deny your logic that a group of "Illuminated" ones should rule the
                  world. But as far as I can see, taking the example of the Bilderberg
                  Group, this 'Illuminati' just happens to be well-connected with power
                  and wealth. Their ability to rule is not of importance. True
                  meritocracy doesn't exist. As it was, and probably is, connections
                  matter more, especially when it comes to groups like the Freemasons.
                  Conspiracy theories aside, there're more in power than you might think.
                  Of course, the connection isn't really examined because it's looked
                  upon like any other religion (It isn't).</p>
              <p>If their goal is
                  beneficial for the masses that they rule, then I have no issues with
                  their secrecy. However, evil (stripped of its religious connotations)
                  is usually committed in the dark. Not only that, but their aim is more
                  power and wealth (not that they need more) for themselves. Whether its
                  intentional or not, the point is that this kind of rulers do not serve
                  the true interests of society as this thread has demonstrated time and time again</p>
              <p>While you are right that due to
                  sheer ignorance and disorganisation of the majority of the population,
                  it is inevitable that this elite will rule over us, I find it
                  absolutely galling that such an anti-humane approach to governance is
                  being perpetrated. This tragic state of the world makes the situation
                  more hopeless than ever. But then, I still feel when people discover
                  the world outside the Matrix, all will be solved. Perhaps that's how
                  I'm delusional.</p>
              <p>In the context I used it in, "emergent" doesn't
                  take on such a complicated definition that you think it is. Just like
                  how seeds develop into seedlings and then mature plants, human beings
                  change in the same way. By "emergent", I not only mean the physical
                  aspect, but the intellectual dimension as well. Thats why I'm against
                  using preconceived or mainstream beliefs to process new information.
                  Rather than doing that, I prefer to let information form my beliefs.
                  When one receives new information, beliefs can be updated. That is, and
                  should be, the emergent nature of human beings rather than the static
                  nature that society tries to impose on us through various institutions.</p>
              <p>Yes,
                  freedom and equality could be achived in a totalitarian society. That
                  was Orwell's world. But the elite class will always remain. Because of assymetrical information, the rest of society will always be at a disadvantage and will remain enslaved due to contributed, and their own ignorance. Classic divide and rule. Should they become aware of the fraudulent nature of presented reality, the elites will fall from power, something they will have to present at all cost. Moulding the future of our nation indeed.</p>

                  who are different.This is what history has repeatedly try to teach us,
                  it is always easy to dehumanise something that doesn't speak the same
                  language or share the same customs.</p>
              <p>That is the reason why LKY insisted that English is to become
                  the main language after Independence. It's much easier for the Chinese
                  to hate the Malays or the Indians to hate the Chinese if there is no
                  common channel of communications, so is the practice of allocating
                  racial quotas for HDB flats and NS (Though i feel there is still racism
                  in NS) </p>
              <p>I believe the human brain is hardly an objective tool
                  to process information like a computer. Imagine millions of different
                  versions of Linux, Windows and Macs, each forming an operating system
                  that's relevant to its unique geological and social environment and
                  have each process the same piece of information. They are going to come
                  up with radically different conclusions and ways of making use/dealing
                  with the information.</p>
              <p>To an outside observer, their base code
                  may be extremely similar but because of milleniums of evolution in a
                  different environment with different hazards, weather and resources
                  they will find it difficult to accept each other as equals.</p>
              <p>Why
                  do i type all this long texts for? Because in a nutshell, we fail to
                  recognize that how we process the graphical/vocal/electronic data is
                  automatically shaped by the environment around us and the history that
                  created our culture. Our idea of objectivity is going to be different
                  from the Americans and African tribalmen, because we have different
                  piorities shaped from our histories and the environment that shaped
                  that history. </p>
              <p>The Internet i feel is going to be the threshold
                  point for the human race. Never before as a generation are we able to
                  access so much information and perspectives. It is also a danger,
                  because it's so much easier for us to fall into the pittrap of what i
                  would call Self Fufilled Prophecy.</p>
              <p>It is now a race to see which idea would take root first in our
                  minds because it is now so easy for us to search for information that
                  favors our viewpoints. It would become easier for us to favor a
                  standpoint because we have already accumulated more knowledge that
                  favors it rather than contradict it. </p>
              <p>With the internet it has
                  become easier for us to see Hitler, Stalin or Mao Zedong as more of the
                  humans that they are, rather than the inhuman monsters that the media
                  likes to portray them as.That terrorists are not as simple as we like
                  them to be, but the product of historical / political / geological /
                  economical factors. It is also easier because English is our main
                  language and we are not exposed to history written by the Germans,
                  Russians and Chinese.</p>
              <p>If we continue to believe that some men are just going to be born evil and automatically monsters, instead of the creation of society and circumstances, we are just going to continue to create more monsters and continue to be shocked and surprised at why.</p>
              <p>It has always become easier for us to dehumanise others with the
                  wide spread of American movies, believing that there are humans who are
                  just born evil rather than the victim of circumstances. We are exposed
                  to a culture that believes good is the US way of life, anything that
                  contradicts that way is stupid and evil. This, from a 233 years old
                  culture.</p>
              <p>Professionally i work in the creative industry. It is
                  a professional neccessity for me to understand how the human brain
                  interprets body language/colors/sound/camera changes. So to me the
                  brain is hardly the mysterious well of knowledge and nobility that
                  Western culture likes to foster but the accumulation of million of
                  years worth of genetic traits that made our ancestors such excellent
                  survivors.</p>
              <p>That is why i hate Democracy.</p>
              <p>Do you think it
                  is a coincidence that Ma Ying Jeou( a lawyer) of Taiwan and Abhisit of
                  Thailand are both attractive men? That Obama, a lawyer by profession is
                  capable of delivering great speeches ? I do not see just a charismatic
                  man in Obama, i see a man who had great PR consultants training him
                  what/how to say and what gesture to use during a speech. </p>
              <p>We
                  believe that Democracy would automatically lead to a Meritocracy, then
                  why are we chosing lawyers to lead, not scientists and engineers? 
                  Because they can't deliver great speeches? Because scientists and
                  engineers cannot "inspire" us? If we need a government to inspire us to
                  do things, to improve ourselves and to help others then we rightfully
                  deserve any corrupted regimes we are getting.</p>
              <p>If we cannot accept that our brains are an ancient system of piority management, the remnants of
                  an era with radically different circumstances. If we believe without
                  external pressure we could handle abundant resources in a responsible
                  manner with a information processing system inherited from a time of
                  scarcity, then the human society deserves to fail. </p>

              <p>Exactly, that is why I was saying that social engineering was been refined to such a science, that maintaining a slave population becomes effortless. It is understandable that a mainstream idea which can unite peoples will inevitably develop. But what happens when that mainstream mentality becomes fraudulent and conceals the harsh reality from people? In the context of this thread, my point is that our reliance on the fractional reserve system has led to economic slavery which no one wants to acknowledge. After using it for hundreds of years, and disregarding many warnings, the threshold has been breached. However, it becomes a struggle..no not even a struggle, for as you said, people prefer information that conforms to their belief system, and thus, it is possible for masses of people to be held together (in bondage) by their own minds. The human mind is more malleable than is thought to be. If you saw that clip, this would be easy to comprehend.</p>
              <p>At this point, I can't know why we're continuing to argue because I agree with most, if not all, of your points, just that I tend to have a more extreme view about things.</p>
