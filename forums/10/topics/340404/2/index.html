              <p>Man, i'm not a student of Economics so i can't really give you a
                  good explanation of it. I'd probably be laughed at, so I'm hoping
                  there's a student of economics on this forum that can explain it in
                  better terms.</p>
              <p>http://vorort.bund.net/suedlicher-oberrhein/unlimited-growth-criticism.html</p>
              <p>This
                  is the best link that i could find so far. But in a nutshell, we all
                  expect to see our GDP grow by a few % every year. We have to, because
                  our children will grow up wanting jobs too and the economy has to
                  increase in order to provide jobs for them. That is why it's so
                  important for China to keep up its 8% - 9% economy growth, just to
                  stablize their society.</p>
              <p>AtÂ  <span class="text">3% the gross
                  national product doubles every 23 years, and at 5% GNP doubles in only
                  14 years. But where is the resources for all this going to come from? I
                  cut a tree, it takes at the very least 10 years for it to grow to
                  mature age, it takes far longer for higher quality wood like teak. When
                  you put in perspective that it takes millions of years for fossil fuel
                  to form, how long would it be before we run out?</span></p>
              <p>Our
                  current economics is based on that there must be growth, or the system
                  will eventually collapse. However since natural resources are not
                  replenishing themselves at a rate we're consuming, how long before this
                  system gives out?</p>
              <p>That, is the flawed assumption i feel economics is based on, it does not account for natural resources replenishment rate. Quite frankly, i don't think it could account even if it wanted to. There's just so much differing views on just how much reserves are there out there.</p>
              <p>I hope you can understand what i'm trying to say. This is probably the best i can do for now.</p>
              <p>And
                  to your last statement, i have to disagree. Humans do not evolve the
                  same way technology is evolving. Our next generation is not
                  neccessarily more intelligent or stronger in any way, evolution
                  dictates the ones with the more desirable genetic traits surviving to
                  continue to breed and prosper, while the less desirable will fail to
                  multiply and die out.</p>
              <p>If we cannot change, nature will decide our fate. It is not the strong who survives, it is the one who can adapt.</p>

              <p>I get your drift now.</p>
              <p>But that economics is based on "infinite growth" and resources is not correct, at least not totally.</p>
              <p>That growth is needed for stability belongs to the neo-liberalism class of view in economics. Proponents of such a view argue for the "trickle-down" effect. Essentially what it means is that they believe that growth is needed for all to enjoy. Such a view also entails that inequality within a society is ok, because they believe it is needed as an "incentive" to grow further, and that this growth will somehow "tricle-down" to the poor.</p>
              <p>Neo-liberalism is a narrow view within economics because all it will ever see is growth, and that growth begets growth.</p>
              <p>We all know that growth is not the only way to stabilise a country or the world as a whole and most economists actually don't quite believe that too.</p>
              <p>Economics doesn't just look at growth. It looks at other factors, such as social costs. And it recognises that social factors are just as important if not more important if we want to lift the poor upwards.</p>
              <p>Neo-liberalism ignores the enormous social and environmental costs caused by the push for free-market forces, and even go to the extent of ignoring market failures. Unfortunately, these people are also among the more influential and vocal, hence that's possibly why you have this idea of economics...</p>

              <p>Economic growth is not carried out merely by exploiting primary resources and in the process exhauting them. <br><br>Economic growth can also means using the same or a lesser unit of an input but giving rise to a larger unit of output. All these unit of measurements in term of value, utility and consumption.</p>
              <p>Vis-a-vis, Singapore is more resource poor, smaller and more lacking in resource than any one single African country. The point on exhaustable resource is true but it is not 100% correct to say we have outbid poorer African countries to access internationalÂ goods and services that we are consuming.</p>
              <p>Poverty has its root in many areas. I list some<br>1) corruption in rank and file, <br>2) corruption by office bearer,<br>3) inefficient bidding/sourcing system of the poorer nation.<br>4) economoic/social priority of the poorer nation. For example, some poorer nationsÂ  value tradition preservation moreÂ over economic growth. <br>5) better access to international aid. One only has to read International publication to realize that some govt would rather feed their people the easy way - reliancy. It is easier to rely on handout from the wealthy nations than to sweat and toil for food. <br>6) the work ethos/ethics of the citizens.Â Â Â <br>etc etcÂ </p>
              <p>The concept on economic ills is sound but it is not the only ills and it is not the only cause.</p>

              <p>In a cybernated society, where our technology is used entirely in a humane way, the resources of the planet can provide for everyone. Saying that we need a massive population reduction is just what the malthusians want. The same malthusians that want to stiffle development in the Third World and to usher the world into the post-industrial age.</p>
              <p>Recently, there was a report that concluded that for everyone to live like the affluent First World, 3 Earths are needed. I agree that with our present lifestyle, collapse is inevitable. With rampant consumerism fueled by materialism, our society has been corrupted to the core. And what is sustaining this destructive trend? Economic growth, or what we've need told what constitutes economic growth. To supposedly continue prospering, we need to SHOP andÂ CONSUME and further plunge the planet deeper into anÂ irrepairable state. As long as social fundamentals do not change, there will never be a real solution.</p>

              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The Neo-Alchemy of the Federal Reserve<br><br>By Ron Paul</span></strong><br><strong><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><a href="http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article21468.htm">http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article21468.htm</a></span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>December 15, 2008 "ICH" -- - A</strong>s the printing presses for the bailouts run at full speed, those in power are no longer even pretending that the new giveaways will fix our problems. Now that we are used to rewarding failure with taxpayer-funded bailouts, we are being told that this is âjust a start,â more funds will inevitably be needed for more industries, and that things would be much worse had we done nothing.<br><br>The updated total bailout commitments add up to over $8 trillion now. This translates into a monetary base increase of 75 percent over the last two months. This money does not come from some rainy day fund tucked away in the budget somewhere â it is created from thin air, and devalues every dollar in circulation. Dumping money on an economy, as they have been doing, is not the same as dumping wealth. In fact, it has quite the opposite effect.<br><br>One key attribute that gives money value is scarcity. If something that is used as money becomes too plentiful, it loses value. That is how inflation and hyperinflation happens. Giving a central bank the power to create fiat money out of thin air creates the tremendous risk of eventual hyperinflation. Most of the founding fathers did not want a central bank. Having just experienced the hyperinflation of the Continental dollar, they understood the power and the temptations inherent in that type of system. It gives one entity far too much power to control and destabilize the economy.<br><br>Our central bankers have had a tremendous amount of hubris over the years, believing that they could actually manage a paper money system in such a way as to replicate the behavior and benefits of a gold standard. In fact, back in 2004 then Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan told me as much. People talk about toxic assets, but the real toxicity in our economy comes from the neo-alchemy practiced by the Federal Reserve System. Just as alchemists of the past frequently poisoned themselves with the lead or mercury they were trying to turn to gold, todayâs bankers are poisoning the economy with accelerated fiat money creation. <br><br>Throughout the ages, gold has stood the test of time as a consistently reliable medium of exchange, and has frequently been referred to as âGodâs moneyâ, as only God can make more of it. Seeking superhuman power over money in the way alchemists did in ancient times caused society to shun them as charlatans. In much the same way, free people today should be sending the message that this power and control over our money is no longer acceptable. <br><br>The irony is that even had the ancient practice of alchemy been successful, and gold was suddenly, magically made abundant, alchemists still would have failed to create real wealth. Creating gold from lead would have cheapened its status to that of rhinestones or cubic zirconia. It is unnatural and dangerous for paper to be considered as precious as a precious metal. Our fiat currency system is crumbling and coming to an end, as all fiat currencies eventually do.<br><br>Congress should reject the central bank as a failure for its manipulations of money that have brought our economy to its knees. I am hoping that in the 111th Congress my legislation to abolish the Federal Reserve System gains traction so that the central bank can no longer destroy our money.</span></p>

              <p>In a cybernated society, where our technology is used entirely in a humane way, the resources of the planet can provide for everyone. Saying that we need a massive population reduction is just what the malthusians want. The same malthusians that want to stiffle development in the Third World and to usher the world into the post-industrial age.</p>
              <p>Recently, there was a report that concluded that for everyone to live like the affluent First World, 3 Earths are needed. I agree that with our present lifestyle, collapse is inevitable. With rampant consumerism fueled by materialism, our society has been corrupted to the core. And what is sustaining this destructive trend? Economic growth, or what we've need told what constitutes economic growth. To supposedly continue prospering, we need to SHOP andÂ CONSUME and further plunge the planet deeper into anÂ irrepairable state. As long as social fundamentals do not change, there will never be a real solution.</p>

              <p>The Malthusian ideology got its name from Thomas Malthus, who believed that a massive drought wiping out millions, if not billions, is the solution to the 'over-population' problem.</p>
              <p>How is this a 'chicken and egg problem'. According to you, there has to be a "massive dieoff" in the Third World for a resource-based economy to emerge. But if the First World can get weaned off consumerism and materialism, our present rate of consumption would gradually become sustainable. Of course, that would be the end of the fashion industry and the advertising behemoths that spend billions of dollars a year trying to get people to consume more and more to boost their self-esteem. Also, our concept of economic growth will have to change. The question should be, can this message be introduced into a system that is totally antithetical to it and, will the consuming fucks accept it?</p>
              <p>The idea that millions more Third World people must die is a lie, perpetrated by said Malthusians like Henry Kissinger, who wrote in the 1974Â NSSM 200 that "depopulation" has to be the highest population for the Third World. In straight-speak, isn't that similar to Hitler's Final Solution? The way I see it, this malthusian ideology works on the premise that the less unproductive peasants you have, the better off you are.</p>

              <p>Likewise, it is quite an enjoyableÂ debate without being called a "conspiracy theorist".</p>
              <p>I understand that your argument is more realistic than mine considering the sad state of the world today. However, <em>as a human being</em>, it is galling to accept the concept ofÂ half of the worldÂ suffering and dying so that the other half can enjoy its present affluence and consumerism. As I have argued in many threads, the real change has to come, not from the top-down, but from within the individual. Without understanding the true nature of society, it is impossible to wake up and behold the fields of human beings, having their lives sucked out of them like batteries.</p>
              <p>As the article by Ron Paul discusses, it is the fraudulent fractional reserve system that is the root of the financial crisis. Ultimately, it is also the source of all, if not most, of the ills in the world. Exploitation and competition, causing suffering and death worldwide, is the result of subverting value and creating money as debt.</p>

But even up to the 70s, the US capital market is strictly regulated and only in the 80s, and more in the 90s, were the capital controls lifted by and large.</p>
              <p>Yet, many proponents for liberalisation fail to see that. They would see Wall St and exclaim: Oh! Look at the free market at work! We should get everyone to do the same!</p>
              <p>As you have pointed out, opening up your market leaves you vulnerable. But it depends on how much and just as importantly how fast you open up.</p>
              <p>China is a very good example. It emphasises on growth AND stability. By opening up their markets slowly, they have managed to mantain high growth and a fairly stable one at that. They were barely touched by the Asian Financial Crisis.</p>
              <p>Look at Russia which tried the "shock therapy" at the recommendation of the western powers. It privatised practically everthing less natural resources without having even the regulations and institutions it needed. With oil prices now at a low, I think they can put their aircraft carrier construction on hold.</p>
              <p>Japan, China etc can afford to ignore western influences to a certain degree. Can others do so? Can you imagine IMF condemning you just because you refuse their "prescriptions"? It would be tough then to do things your way, because it takes 2 hands to clap and where then would be the other hand?</p>
              <p>Democracy can happen in Asia to the extent of the west. Because they did it the slow way. Why can't we? Don't tell me democracy happens overnight? Sadly, proponents always overlook this.</p>
