            <div class='col-md body'>On the Homepage of our leading tertiary educational institution in Singapore Â– NUS, it's hard not to notice the line that says "NUS among World's Top 20 Universities".<br><br>As a Singaporean, I should feel proud of the academic achievement our young nation achieves. But unfortunately, the policy of NUS does not, in any way, justify why I should join my fellow country mates and take pride in the system in NUS.<br><br>Well, I am a Singaporean student who was offered an overseas scholarship after A Levels in 2002 to study in Monash University in Melbourne. I am currently in my last semester, and will be graduating in July with a degree.<br><br>Unfortunately, my scholarship does not cover the Honours year, hence leaving me with 2 options if I am to further my education.<br><br>My first option would be to stay in Monash and do an Honours in Psychology.  However, I would have to wait for 6 - 8 months before the course starts as the academic year in Australia starts in early March. Furthermore, due to the HECS changes in University tuition fees in Melbourne, there is close to a $6000 increment if I re-enroll for Honours in 2006.  Without a scholarship, it is almost impossible for me to pursue this option.<br><br>With that, I thought I was left with my second and final option, which was to apply for the fourth year (Honours year) in Psychology in NUS. I enquired with both the Psychology department and the Office of Admissions, and someone actually directed me to apply when the online application starts in February 2005.<br><br>I was elated. To be able to study in my home country, not only lightens my family's financial burden, but also allows me to constantly stay in close contact with my family and friends here.<br><br>So, imagine my horror when I called the admissions office in NUS to double check the validity of the reply I received much earlier on, I was informed that there is practically no way that I can just do one  Honours year in NUS.<br><br>Well, the 2 reasons being (as told by one admissions officer):<br><br>1)	The minimum number of years of studies in NUS is two. This has been achieved consensually by all the faculties in NUS. No faculty offers any course that lasts only a year.<br><br>2) 	(This is the most ridiculous one) There is no such thing as credits transfer in NUS. I was flabbergasted when I heard this. The lady told me that, irregardless of any qualifications I attain in any foreign university, everyone, and anyone, HAS to start from scratch, meaning<br>first year in NUS.<br><br>I was dumbfounded and the whole policy makes no sense to me.  NUS is	indeed the first ever University I have heard of in my life that offers no credits transfers to students.<br><br>Does NUS feel that the courses it offers are so fantastic that they are in no way comparable to foreign Universities? Is NUS practicing discrimination in a society which calls for equality in education? Why is it not at all possible that the respective department and the office of admissions do a case-to-case review? How about assessing the subjects I have done and then decide from there if I qualify for the Honours year? Where is the flexibility in one of the top twenty universities in the world? Does a 'leading global university' (words of NUS President Professor Shih Choon Fong on NUS Website) work with such a rigid system?<br><br>No flexibility, no creativity. What exactly has NUS produced in its thousands and possible millions of graduates when its system is one that discriminates against foreign universities?<br><br>And mind you, Monash's Psychology degree is as prestigious, if not more reputable than the one at NUS.<br><br>And one may ask, why not go straight into Masters in Psychology if Honours is not a feasible thing to do for now. But well, the answer is, in order to become a professional in the field of Psychology, one must possess a degree with Honours before one is allowed to enrol in Masters.  Well, this is at least what I was informed in Australia.<br><br>If you do come across this article and able to provide any solutions, please advise.<br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I highly doubt they will turn away a Harvard student. Maybe they feel that Monash is not as good as them. On the other hand, it is true that there is no one year course in NUS.<br><br>Anyway, why be so insistent on getting into NUS?

It depends on the overall result and the type of masters you are doing. I have classmates who don't have an honor degree but achieved 80% and above in average for their undergrad degree to enter masters (Master of Public Health/Master of Social Health/Master of Public Policy/Master of Business Admin) .I cannot say much for masters of psychology because I am not well acquainted with any one who did it before. Maybe Gedanken can help - he is a psychologist.</div>

Monash has its strength somewhere.<br><br>To me there is nothing great about Monash , but then again I studied in University of Melbourne and I seen monash students transferring from monash to us....so you can call it subjectivity. University of Melbourne has produced good researchers and one or two nobel prize winners and a lot of political leaders as with University of Sydney.  University of New south wales is up and coming young university while Australian National University has produced more researchers than the rest.<br><br>Princeton produced a few academics here and there but it is the kin of Harvard and Columbia - it sort of piggyback onto them. Yale laughs at Harvard all the time because  Harvard is almost like an old boy's club and is also known for skewed marking ( hardly anyone will get less than a b+ for their assignments or exams).  However to be fair , Harvard have produced researchers who published alot of work. It is well known in law and medicine as well as the sciences for the publications it contributed .<br><br>MIT is well renowned for mathematics and engineering while Caltech in physics and mathematics . Both are competing rivals and both are equally hard to get into.</div>

Its assessing cases individually, and be fair to those who deserves a right to study in the uni, and not discriminate everyone on the same basis and deprive ppl of a chance, just becos of the rigid system.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The value of NUS degree is subjective. It is only valued for civil service and within Singapore.<br><br>A moderately famous university degree from overseas whether of US, UK or Australia will command a better value across the globe than degrees from NUS or NTU.<br><br>Many employers overseas do not hear of our universities. So it is necessary to keep a perspective and not get too obsessed with value of NUS or NTU degrees.<br><br>It is more important to use the opportunity of a moderate job and do well to secure results and recognition of one company or two than hope for good degree recognition. Once one clears the first hurdle, he will be an asset in the real world and leapfrog the academic measurement.<br><br>Use what one has and not think too long and hard about what one does not have. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

I was flabbergasted when I heard this. The lady told me that, irregardless of any qualifications I attain in any foreign university, everyone, and anyone, HAS to start from scratch, meaning<br>first year in NUS.<br><br>I was dumbfounded and the whole policy makes no sense to me. NUS is indeed the first ever University I have heard of in my life that offers no credits transfers to students. </span></blockquote>hihi, jiahui, i think the person who tell you this is talking nonsense.<br><br>from what i know in NUS, the poly people come in, can less 1 yr.<br>also from what i know, we have the student exchange programme thinggy also, that allows credit transfers, to foreign univs or vice versa, so that they can check total how many modular credits you have and therefore can see if you eligible to graduate or not.<br><br>But i think most prob, Monash has not linked up with NUS, therefore, NUS dont know how to credit the modules you have taken to the NUS programme. You see, both may have different credit systems, etc, and CAP points, and about the difficulty of the modules. All these have to be tied down by both Univs then can do.<br><br>therefore, all the foreign exchange programme people also go to those that have already like signed MOU with nus to be able to do mutual credit transfers.<br><br>I think this may be the same for most univs bah... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
