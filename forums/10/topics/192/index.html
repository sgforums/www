            <div class='col-md body'>First and foremost, NS is not so much as to make money but rather learn some skill to defend thy country when in need.  Agree that the pay is low but there's a large amt of singaporean serving it at anyone time.  It's not justifable to pay them "market rate".  Basing on some simple cal : 20,000 nsmen say drawing $1K per month will sum up to 20 million...  To fuel these expenses, the govt will therefore have to increase gst to 25%, income tax 40% and so on.  You want that?<br><br>My feeling for NS had being a mixed one..  During my days in NS, i join the crowd and start cursing and swearing.  Looking back now, i realised how much i have learned from it.  Setting aside the duty as a singaporean to serve my country, i had become more independent.  Have learned the hardship of life and the fact that mom and dad are not alway there to give me whatever i want.  Somehow.. i grown up after NS.<br><br>Looking at the bright side, unreaseanable treatment befall on us gave us also an oppoturnity to learn how to cope with it.  Lookink back again, i had much more unreasonable traetment from my boss now then in NS.<br><br>Don't be depress.  Take the responsbility like a man and go thru the 2 yrs with your head up.  Treat it like a part of growing up journey.  At the end, you will not regret those lessons and experiences gain.</div>

Book in time is 2359 hrs LATEST, which means that assuming worst case 45 mins from Jurong to Pasir Ris MRT there will still be sufficient time for baby boy to take a bus from MRT to camp and report in on time and when bus/MRT services ARE STILL RUNNING. Which is not necessary because I know for a fact most if not all units(esp those which are housed in more remote places) provide chartered bus services to and from the nearest MRT nowadays. So theres no one else to blame but your own son for being lazy or not having enough brains to calculate the time he needs to get to camp on time by bus/MRT. I have cousins who stay in Jurong and were recruits at Tekong recently, if they had the ability to take MRT from home to Pasir Ris in time to catch the chartered bus by 1900 to book in on time why can't your son?<br><br>Stay out unit? Big fucking deal. I made $450 at most while serving NS even as a 3SG in 1999, in a stay out unit. I never had to ask my parents for a single cent from the minute I entered NS, even as a recruit making $200(or $180 including deductions) I stayed at Bt Timah and was based in Tekong for BMT, traveled to and from the island, had to pay my own pager/mobile bills, all my expenses and even had savings to buy my own scanner using my own earnings(remember this is 1997 where a $500 scanner is considered cheap). Not a single cent came from my parents, though I turned down repeated offers from them to supplement my income.<br><br>Blame your own baby boy for not knowing how to live within his means, and you for indulging him.<br><br>My monthly expenses in Australia, excluding utilities and rent, don't even approach $700. I can only imagine what kind of lifestyle baby boy leads.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Viper52 (edited 17 May 2002).]</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Well, I think heartlander's opinions reflect those that many singaporeons have, in that since we all have to serve NS and have no choice and are forced to, that the government "owes us one". In a sense, it is true which is why America stopped conscription after a while due to human rights issues. (conscription is actually a violation of human rights)<br><br>However, if everyone were to adopt this kind of attitude, then who is going to serve NS, and how is the government going to be able to pay for it? Some compromises have to be made. We can choose to compare ourselves to women who don't have to serve NS at all, or the well-paid soldiers in countries where conscription is not practiced; but why not compare ourselves to the conscripts in Russia who have it worse than us? Or the people living in third-world dictatorships where they would willingly trade some of their rights if that could buy them a better and safer life?<br><br>I guess what I am trying to say is that I can understand where heartlander is coming from, but that doesn't mean I agree with it, at least not entirely. Just try to compromise a bit, and see why the government has to do what its doing now. Also, like I said earlier, just try to appreciate what you have instead of complaining about what you don't have. I think NSmen in Singapore can be considered well-paid mercenaries by conscription standards already. As a sidenote, I think women should serve NS too but that's a completely different issue.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>[This message has been edited by chamenos (edited 19 May 2002).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>nsf allowance is definitely due for a raise. but the rate is too high. 75% is such a tremendous jump. i would say a rate of 30% would be better.<br>the rest of the money should be sent to where they really need, if we are talking about welfare to our soldiers: upgrading and renovation of the old camps. some of our old camps are in a terrible state. the buildings are in dire need of repainting, they are still using decades-old beds and cupboards, facilities are not working, etc, etc. perhaps this is due to the fact that upkeep of the camp is the responsibiltity of the camp's resident unit, and money for upkeep comes from the annual budget allocated to these camps. this money goes into a lot of other things and is often not enough for upkeep. i say it would be better if money is allocated to such camps specifically for upgrading or renovation to make them more comfortable for our troops.</div>

I have no grouses except that his morale is depressing! It's high time that the govt is looking into their welfare or try to prop up their courage. Many feels that their allowances are worst than Sri Lakan maids. Their sacrifices are tremendous and training tough, make them happy so that they will stay on and defend a country called home.</div></blockquote>I believe that if you are claiming to be supporting your son for a good cause, you wouldn't be posting this here.<br><br>Everyone is surviving on what they have, and some with even worse financial situations. Don't you think that by 'helping' your son in this way is just saying that he has all the financial backing to do what he wants? Everyone has their kind of lifestyle, what your son has, is definitely luxurious, considering he only need to pay for transport and necessities.<br><br>The only solution is for him to curb his lifestyle, or to change his camp from Tekong to Changi, where he will pride from wearing a red beret and having $500 more than all of his peers. I believe with the increments, he can expect at least $600 more.<br><br>Good luck to you and i hope your son is enjoying his time in NS. Everyone goes through this phase, so we'd know what he's been through and where he's coming from. Maybe you can even ask him to post some comments for us?? We'd be most glad to provide solutions, don't we???  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br></div>

The similarity present is that people in general do not like conscription since it violates their "right of choice", and provokes the same emotions. I did not at all mention that conscription in Singapore should be scrapped, as it was in America, just because it is a violation of human rights.<br><br>No where did I obnoxiously and arrogantly try to blanket-generalize what is and is not a human rights violation. A human right violation, is a human violation in any country, and in any unique condition that may exist in said countries. A human right violation, may however be more excusable and understandable in the different countries, if the unique situations that exist in them are taken into account.<br><br>For example, conscription in Singapore, though a violation of human rights, is excusable and understandable when viewed in a local context where the population is just too small to support a regular (non-conscription) armed force. Same way, the lack of freedom of speech in China, though a violation of human rights, is excusable and understandable when viewed in China's context, where the population is way too large to effectively control or allow dissent and rebellion, or other forms of anarchy.<br><br>In either example stated above, a violation of human rights is -still- a violation of human rights, just that these violations are excusable and understandable in the unique conditions that exist in both countries.<br><br>As a more direct comparison, giving someone a death sentence does violate his right to life. But when taking in consideration that person killed 10 other people when unprovoked and with malicious intent, this violation of human rights becomes more excusable and understandable.<br><br>I think you have misinterpreted what I have said in my earlier post and perhaps you should re-read what I said.<br><br>Blanket generalizations of what is and what is not a blanket generalization of human rights violation, without taking into account the unique situation that may exist in the different contexts of different arguments, is not only wrong, but obnoxiously arrogant.<br><br><blockquote>Chamenos, the terms "conscripted mercenary" is an oxymoron. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></blockquote>Again, I don't think you've taken into consideration where I used the idea of a "conscripted mercenary"<br><br>This is what I wrote: "Also, like I said earlier, just try to appreciate what you have instead of complaining about what you don't have. I think NSmen in Singapore can be considered well-paid mercenaries by conscription standards already."<br><br>From the above, I was trying to draw a comparison between well-paid merceneries, and conscripts who aren't paid a cent. Singapore NSmen obviously fall into the middle, where we are conscripts, but are still paid; or given "allowance", etc. We are still given money for serving time in the military. Like I said in the earlier post, NSmen in Singapore can be considered well-paid mercenaries <strong>by conscription standards</strong> already.<br><br>I was trying to put our situation in perspective of how conscripts usually are not paid a cent, in trying to address Heartlander's complaints that NSmen were not getting "paid" enough, since NSmen are considered conscripts.<br><br>What I said is akin to saying, "I think cats in Singapore can be considered well-taken care of pets by wild-animal standards already." So yes, a "conscripted mercenary" is an oxymoron, and so is a "well-taken care of wild animal", and neither make sense.<br><br>However, if the context in which these terms are used is taken into consideration, such as a comparison intended to put a situation into perspective, then it makes sense.<br><br>To repeat myself again, blanket generalizations of what is and what is not an oxymoron, without taking into account the unique situation that may exist in different contexts in different arguments, is not only wrong, but obnoxiously arrogant.<br><br>Perhaps you should read more carefully and practice what you preach  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
