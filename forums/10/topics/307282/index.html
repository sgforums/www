              The EU involves the free movement of people across borders. If it expands to the Middle East, hundreds of millions of Muslims will have free access to Germany, Italy, France, Britain, Sweden, the Czech Republic and Austria. If Turkey becomes a member, it means that Greeks, Bulgarians and others who have fought against oppression by Ottoman Turks for centuries will now be flooded with Muslims from a rapidly re-Islamizing Turkey. The same goes for Poles, Hungarians, Romanians and others who fought against Muslims for centuries.
              
              The EUâ€™s Justice and Security Commissioner Franco Frattini states that Europe must relax its immigration controls and open the door to an extra 20 million â€œAfricans and Asiansâ€� during the next two decades. Most of these â€œAfricans and Asiansâ€� come from the predominantly Muslim countries of North Africa and the Greater Middle East. The EU thus decided to flood Europe with tens of millions of Muslims at the same time as peaceful Europeans demonstrating against the Islamization of Europe were brutally harassed by the police in the EU capital of Brussels. Frattini has also banned the use of the phrase Islamic terrorism: â€œPeople who commit suicide attacks or criminal activities on behalf of religion, Islamic religion or other religion, they abuse the name of this religion.â€� He thinks we shouldnâ€™t use the word â€œimmigration,â€� either, we should talk about â€œmobility.â€�
              
              While Dutch politicians, in what was until recently a peaceful country, have been killed for being too critical of Islam, while Islamic terror attacks have murdered people in London and Madrid, while more terror attacks are planned every single day from Italy via Paris to Denmark, and while people from Sweden to Germany are subject to Muslim street violence and harassment, EU leaders want to increase Europeâ€™s Muslim population by tens of millions in a few years. This is criminal and evil, pure and simple.

              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">I don't see it that way at all. We must remember that we are looking at a symptom, not the cause.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">Think of it in an economic context. In a community, you own a business that utilizes labor from the neighborhood. As your business grew, you have to bid for labor to take them away from competing use and your cost of labor rises. Imagine it rises sufficiently that people from other neighborhood find it worthwhile to travel to your neighborhood to work. As your business increases and you increase wages to pull in more labor, the labor may opt to live where they work and starts to bid for living areas in your neighborhood so prices of property rises. Other businesses also find there is more demand for their goods so they start expanding their business to provide for the increase in demand. In the short term we may see prices in the neighborhood increase as there is a demand for goods that is higher then supply. If wages don't increase, the labor may move back to their own neighborhoods, preferring instead to commute. However if wages are high enough to pay for these higher prices, labor continues to stay in the neighborhood and the new higher prices become standard. Because of higher profit margins for these businesses, we see other companies springing up. The foreigners integrate into the neighborhood. We start to see a variety of good tailored to specific groups and tastes. We see the neighborhood economy improve and residents becoming relatively affluent compared to other neighborhoods.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">When governments step in, they anticipate the stages. So to ease the flow of labor, they remove boundaries between countries, removing the need for visas, work permits etc. To ensure that a strong currency doesn't keep people from moving into the neighborhood and preferring to live away where the exchange rate is in their favor, they create a common currency. Laws become common to facilitate easier understanding and enforcement of contract agreements.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">Firstly, an economic model’s only concerns are economic in nature. Culture, religion, tradition, family values, patriotism, moral values, the arts etc are not economic in nature. Economic policy does not address any other issue and more properly seeks to wipe these out in favor of a more homogeneous economic outlook. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">So one may argue what the new values are, ie the impact of non-economic values on traditional ones towards a new homogenous economic based standard. But it is pointless to argue about maintaining those values when the entire environment has changed so drastically from the one that originally bred those values.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">The reason for taking such a drastic step in the first place was to create an entity similar to the United States with States and a Federal Government. I assume because that geopolitical make up was viewed as the appropriate economic model. All the answers to the questions you raise may be found by examining the American analogy. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">The most interesting of which is who will wear the one ring to rule them all?</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Edited: I think America's founding fathers were mainly Aetheists or Agnostic but now the country is predominantly Christian. You'll find your answer in that bit of history.</p>
