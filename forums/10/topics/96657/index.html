            <div class='col-md body'>Got it dated 4th Oct from ST Interactive.<br><br><span class="large"><strong>SIA flight diverted to UK airport after bomb threat </strong></span><br><br>MANCHESTER -- A Singapore Airlines passenger jet was diverted to Manchester Airport in northern England on Monday after a bomb threat, police said, adding that it may have been a hoax.<br><br>The Frankfurt to New York flight landed safely at 11 am (1000 GMT) without a military escort, Greater Manchester Police said.<br><br>Advertisement<br><br>The pilot of Singapore Airlines flight SQ26 declared a 'full emergency' mid-flight, a spokesman for Manchester Airport said. The Boeing 747-400, bound for New York's JFK airport, was carrying 293 passengers and 19 crew.<br><br>'Early indications are that it could be a hoax but we cannot confirm that one way or another until full checks are carried out,' a spokesman for Greater Manchester Police said.<br><br>'We got a security warning from the German security authorities,' said Peter Menkel, an official with Singapore Airlines in Frankfurt. He said he did not have details, but added that 'it had nothing to do with a passenger on board - it was external.'<br><br>In Germany, federal police spokesman Klaus Ludwig said a bomb threat against the flight was made in a call to police in the south-western German city of Tuebingen.<br><br>It was the fourth commercial flight diverted as a security precaution in Europe in the last eight days.<br><br>One was diverted to Stansted airport north of London, while another was diverted to Shannon in western Ireland and a third to Amsterdam's Schiphol airport in the Netherlands.<br><br>All three flights resumed their journeys after searches concluded there was no threat to security. -- AP<br><br></div>

That is why I ask. I could only refer to news report via Internet.<br><br>Secondly, I am interested in making comparison in news reporting from HK, Taiwan as well as Singapore. It is not uncommon for differences to be found in reports from both sides. SIA bomb threat is being reported as headline news via the radio here. DBS HK blunder has been splashed all over HK media as headlines.

            <div class='col-md body'>Maybe you have been away from Singapore for a very, very, very, very , very long time. The news report in Singapore are timely and sometimes on a "live" basis. The CNA has correspondents in other parts of the world, including HongKong. The Iraqi war was reported live from Bagdad.<br><br>The newspapers have a time lag which I think is normal. It will take time to print and distribute them. There is also a cut-off time for news article to be included. The online version of these papers do provide the latest updates.<br><br>The news coverage of different countries and regions may differ because the forcus and interest of their readers are different. . By giving the hoax news a low profile coverage is appropriate otherwise it would give other copycats the encouragement to make such hoaxs in future.<br><br>In respond to the video taping of executions of the hostages in Iraq, major media in the world has decided not to carry such footages in future. Does that mean the world has become "less open" after 911 ? The role of the media is to provide the public with information but at the same time it has a social responsibility as well.<br><br>I dont think we shd emulate the sensational reporting styles of the press in other countries. The current reporting style is fine with me.</div>
