I believe that the style of soliciting for donation was copied from Hong Kong and with ideals of many NKF colleages and form a ''success'' today. And by using lucky draws to entice donors to donate...... No big deal.  More importantly, are the kind hearted singaporeans whom are willingly to support.<br><br><span style="color: red;"><strong>We are more interested in how new NKF going to treat its patients with better subsidaries, should the land that occuppied by NKF be given free, should there be no GST charges, to be given subsidy on utilities bills for NKF; I strongly believe that if those I have mentioned here on geniunely subsidise; the costs for operating NKF will be brought down tremendously and surely all patients will benefit much. More patients will also be qualified for subsidy from the new passionate officer-in-chagre.</strong></span><br><br>I hope those high ranking officers of singapore government who are browsing here; please read this and have passionate in considering what I am suggesting here.<br><br>Inform the public what is targeted amount to be raised in the reserve, how is the money re-invested and accoutable for report of profit / loss statements.  For the past, it seemed that there were no limit in collecting funds <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> .<br><br>I would also like to suggest that the public accountants must audit all past transactions of NKF that what have had been spent. The accumulated amount may have hit hundred of millions and to-date, it has only left with S$260 millions in the reserve? The purpose of suggestion here is to ensure all monies are manage properly in future.<br><br>The marine aquariums in NKF are really high maintenance; can they reveal how does it cost to maintain?  Do the patients really need that kind of luxuries?  Why not save the unnecessary expeditures and have more flexibilties in acceptance of patients for subsidaries?<br><br>I won't donate until there are transparency in accounting and all patients should get 35%- 50% subsidaries.<br></div>
