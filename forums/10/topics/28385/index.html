Singapore has NS not because it has a choice, but because its professional army is simply not sufficient in manpower. Isreal and Taiwan case is that they each face a very dire threat. Their reasons of fostering social cohesion and instilling greater responsibility in their boys really tickle me. HUH?!? just because of these reasons you force them to do NS??? Come on, these things can be better done by reviewing their education system.

Consider their lower defense budget, and their larger number of boys a year. Lots of money will have to be spent yearly to sustain and train their NSFs to be a viable fighting force. Its not the size of the army, but the quality of the army that matters. This is the golden lesson China learnt from the Gulf War, and the reason why they have substantially reduced their force size. What Malaysia is doing will just result in a boys camp with a little gun handling, which will in the end produce *ahem* half-f*** 'soldiers' which are 'for show'.<br><br>End result? More resources is diverted from their real fighting force, and the end result is a lower capability armed force. If they can implement it, a BIG if, I believe it won't be implemented for long.

Sg was not THAT comfortable with each other in the immediate post independence period... we were pushed into it by the brits leaving us in the lurch cos they want to balance their budget  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  kinda lan lan rather than good timing really...<br><br>Sg that time could either leave itself naked to aggression or do something about it...<br><br>the thing is, Sg was founded (and expelled from the federation) on the priniples of a secular state that advocates equal threatment of all ethnic groups and meritocracy. its a lot easier to justify using NS as a means of nation building and defence.<br><br>In M'sia, u have the exact opposite: institutionalised discrimination. special privileges based on skin colour. NS as a means of defence is plain stupid in that context: no visible direct threats other than terrorism and that is not one u can solve with sheer numbers alone.<br><br>NS as a means of nation building in that context would only meet limited success because people still see themselves to a great extent based on colour and it is clear that they are NOT equal.<br><br>u expect NS to threat them any different? even so, it doesn't change the big picture. u threat them all equal and based on merit in NS and they face the same crap in society. if anything, it will certainly put the malay position under fire either way. will KL change its bumiputra policy after that?<br><br>it won't be without social consequences and once u unleash the national emotions of the people through a massive socialization program like NS, u can't control all of its consequences.</div>

President Tran Duc Luong visited Singapore in March 1998, and in turn, President S R Nathan became the first Head of State from Singapore to visit Vietnam when he made a State Visit in February 2001. The expansion of trade and business contacts between Singapore and Vietnam over the years has also been a significant factor in forging strong bilateral ties. As an indication of the strength of this commercial relationship, Singapore remains the largest investor in Vietnam, having made cumulative investment of US$7.26 billion by end 2001. Singapore also ranks consistently as one of Vietnam's most important trading partners. The Vietnam-Singapore Industrial Park and the Vietnam-Singapore Technical Training Centre in Binh Duong province are concrete symbols of the close cooperation between the two countries. Other than working closely together in ASEAN, Vietnam and Singapore also cooperate closely in other fora such as ASEM, APEC and FEALAC.<br><br>Singapore is also honoured to play a role in Vietnam's human resource development. Since 1992, more than 2500 Vietnamese have received training in Singapore under the Singapore Cooperation Programme in areas such as healthcare, environment, finance and trade, productivity, public administration and English language training. In February 2002, Singapore formally established the Vietnam-Singapore Training Centre in Hanoi, with a focus on capacity building for Vietnamese officials. Singapore has also been providing scholarships to Vietnamese students to pursue academic courses including, among others, the ASEAN Secondary Three Scholarships, the Singapore Scholarship (undergraduate studies) and the NUS' Master in Public Management and Master in Public Policy Programmes (post-graduate studies<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Is Vietnam a Singapore ally? Even if that is the case, they can't be a great help. They won the vietnam war because the Americans do not how to fight in the jungle. On the top of that, the Americans are out numbered. Look at the1979 China-Vietnam war, China won. The reason is simple enough.<br><br>Besides that, I think no country in South East Asia has the ability to launch a war against another without bearing the full consequences of the UN. Look at Iraq now. In this realistic world, only that Big 5 (US, UK, China, Russian and France) can talk about wars.  If any country has the audacity to launch a war today, I can guarantee one of the Big 5 or even all the Big 5 will get involved, and the country that launch the war will definitely lost, if the country that launch the war is one of the Big 5, than it will become world war again. Small or medium countries don't even stand a chance to win. Even with a combined forces of all ASEAN members, the answer is,  .........not a high chance to win.<br><br>So I think everybody can seat back and no need to worry about Malaysia NS, because it is their business, they can't do anything with their army anyway. Besides that, whether the people there will support it or not is also the problem the government there facing.</div>

Nobody likes to know that 2million vietnamese infantry are out there in their backyard SOMEWHERE.<br><br>We are not exactly allies.  But think about it this way.  If Singapore goes, there goes their largest investor.  And thats just the investments, not to mention the help we render them with rebuilding their economy and infrastructure.<br><br>With help from the Thais, we can move the Vietnamese friends down, to northern M'sia easily.<br><br>Currently, Vietnam has 482,000 regulars, and over 4 million in reserve.
