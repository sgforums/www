            <div class='col-md body'>It is EXTREMELY unlikely that any ally of Singapore would intervene militarily on our behalf, particularly Vietnam. This would require force projection capability, which Vietnam completely lacks. Do you realize how hard it is to transport *millions* of people? Then add in their weaponry, equipment and logistics. Then think how we are going to feed and house them. Then consider the fact that we have not trained with them and imagine the fuckups if they were to try to "help". No.<br><br>The only "ally" that is able and likely to intervene is the USA, since they actually do have power projection capability. Those carrier battle groups are the greatest power projection platforms in the history of mankind! Whether or not they would be willing to help is something completely different. The USA is a very fickle ally.<br><br>What is more likely is that some other regional power would "backstab" a foe we are fighting. This is particularly tempting because Singapore is so strong that we are sure to distract them. Thailand might decide to snatch some territory while Malaysia is occupied trying to fend off the SAF. East Timor (which currently loves us a lot!) might decide to settle some old scores with Indonesia (and become simply "Timor" ) while we are engaging the bulk of their armed forces. Malaysia and Indonesia might even decide to take bites of Borneo from each other, depending on whom we are fighting (if it isn't both of them, and maybe even if). Being a regional doomsday machine means that you attract vultures.<br><br>However, in the end, we CANNOT and MUST NOT count on the support of any nation in the case of war. We have to be prepared to fight to the end on our own if necessary. Not even the UN may save us, though this is EXTREMELY unlikely. So we have to be prepared for anything.</div>
