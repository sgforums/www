Parliament will also automatically have Nominated MPs. <br><br>Mr Lee added that the Nominated MP scheme will be expanded to include Singaporeans from civil society like young activists or those in the environmental movement. <br><br>He also said that there will be fewer six-member GRCs and a range of smaller GRCs in the next election, while the number of Single Member Constituencies will be increased to 12 from the current nine. <br><br>Prime Minister Lee explained that he is making the changes now, not because he is about to call elections, but so that the matter can be discussed and changes made in ample time before the next election. <br><br>- CNA/yt </span><br></span></p></div>

              <p><br>Simple -  though these ministers are highly educated, not many of them are capable so the GRC system suits the PAP.     With the GRC system the newly appointed ministers are mollycuddled.   </p>
              <p>Sissy pm lee hsien loong is mollycuddled, too.   He has SM and MM to guide him and 1, 2 or 3 special assistants in his office to assist him.     If this is not mollycuddled I don't know what you will call this.</p>
