              <p>As we can see throughout the last few elections, the % of winning for PAP has not been increasing.   I wonder will it continue to drop in the next election.  </p>
              <p>PAP are such arrogant toads that they refuse to take the dropping % as a guide to meet the needs of the people.    To sissy lhl, 66.6% is strong mandate, ha ha ha haha, he just simply closed a blind eye to the continuous drop in their winning %  throughout the years.  How arrogant, self centred they are!</p>

              <p><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_EyUJPEY24Sc/SVmU5c9xNNI/AAAAAAAAAKw/jAsQEMLhXtk/s1600-R/n575575815_142824_8562.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p>Yaw Shin Leong</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I refer to the news article ‘Changes to Electoral System to encourage wider range of views in Parliament’ (CNA, 27th May 2009) <br><br>It
              is reported that PM Lee has announced proposed changes in Parliament to
              encourage a wider range of views in Parliament, including opposition
              and non-government views, specifically:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">1)
              Each Parliament will have at least nine opposition members and nine
              Nominated Members of Parliament. The number of Non-Constituency MPs
              (NCMPs), who did not win a seat during an election but have the next
              highest percentage of votes, will increase from six to nine. <br><br>2)
              A proposal will be made to the Parliamentary Elections Act to set a cap
              of two NCMPs to come from any Group Representation Constituency (GRC).
              Parliament will also automatically have Nominated MPs. <br><br>3)
              There will be fewer six-member GRCs and a range of smaller GRCs in the
              next election, while the number of Single Member Constituencies will be
              increased to 12 from the current nine. </span><br><br>Reduction in the
              size of GRCs and the increased number of SMCs are welcomed changes.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> However to increase opposition representation via means of expanding
              the NCMP scheme is but a superficial proposal.</strong></span> In mandarin, this is
              likened to the analogy of 'æ�¢æ±¤ä¸�æ�¢è�¯' (making changes without changing the
              essence). <br><br>It is apparent that the objective of the PAP is to
              ensure that whilst a wider range of views in Parliament can be assured,
              but the change is <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>designed in the hope that PAP's parliamentary
              dominance remains as it is.</strong></span><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Therefore I repeat MP Low Thia
              Khiang’s call that it is certainly not sufficient for an unelected
              opposition candidate to become a NCMP to speak up and reflect public
              sentiment in Parliament. </strong></span></p>
              <p>The reason is because the role of the
              opposition also includes the mandate of ensuring that democracy
              operates soundly.<br><br>Time and space is required to develop an
              effective check and balance mechanism in a truly democratic
              parliamentary system. Voters must reject PAP’s ‘similar medicine,
              different preparation’ approach to Singapore’s electoral system. In a
              period of political stability, the time can never better for
              Singaporeans to vote in more WP candidates into Parliament in the next
              General Elections.</p>

              <p>GE2011<br><strong>PAP takes in less seats, but better than expected<br></strong>Straits Times<br>12 Sep 2011<br><br>The results of the GE show that the political change initiated by the PAP to include more opposition has seen some form of success. Back in 2009, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong proposed that each Parliament will have at least nine opposition members and nine Nominated Members of Parliament (NMPs), so that there will be at least 18 Members of Parliament (MPs) who are not from the ruling party. In addition, he proposed that there will be fewer six-member GRCs and a range of smaller GRCs in the next election, while the number of Single Member Constituencies will be increased to 12 from 9.</p>
              <p>Even though the political situation is more favourable to the opposition as compared to the previous few General Elections, the opposition has put up a rather disappointing performance by winning only 6 of the seats.</p>

              <p>If PM LHL is sincere about having true representative voice in Parliament that allow ordinary Singaporean views to be effectively voiced and heard - it is not good enough to tweak the election system to allow only 9 Members from the Alternative Political Parties and 9 NMPs from Singapore Society to enter Parliament.</p>
              <p>The entire Singapore political format crafted by LKY has to be revamped - as it was designed to perpetuate the interests of only the PAP.</p>
              <p>Revisions should be made to lift restrictions and legislations passed to prevent Singaporeans giving any large financial contributions to political parties.</p>
              <p>The PAP Government should reassess their "political pettiness" in taking punitive administrative reprisal actions against businesses and private individuals making any large financial contribution to the other Political Parties and not to the PAP.</p>
              <p>The PAP Government should show more political maturity and relax on their paranoia in placing strict controls on the print and broadcast medias giving any positive publicity to Alternative Political Parties.</p>
              <p>It was sheer arrogance for LKY to believe that the Government is not answerable to newspapers and will not be subjected to the scrutiny of the Press, when the press is used by LKY's Government to be the PAP watchdog over Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>The PAP leadership should separate party politics from the Government body, and depoliticize the Civil Service, the Police Force, and the SAF.</p>
              <p>The PAP should allow professionals to run these critical National Institutions as non-political supporting bodies to any incoming Government formed by any Political Party.</p>
              <p>If MM LKY had built Singapore to what it is today, PM LHL should leave a longer lasting political stability by dismantling the deep penetration of PAP Political Appointees holding executive powers in the various Government-linked Companies - that will pose conflicts of interests to the Government formed by any Political Party other then the PAP.</p>
              <p>If PM LHL is sincere about changing the Rules of Politics in Singapore, he should go deeper and make the necessary change to inject strength and fresh quality into the present status quo, where the present air is already stale from 52 years of monotonous rule by the PAP that had purposefully stifled all other voices.</p>
