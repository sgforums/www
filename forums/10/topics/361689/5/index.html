              <p><br>I agree with you on the above.</p>
              <p>Every eligible voter should vote and get to vote regardless a ward is uncontested.</p>
              <p>When there is no opposition party member to compete, the VOTER still should vote to indicate clearly how many of these support the ruling party.</p>
              <p>So, to me, it is very clear that even when a ward is uncontested, an Election is about the voters actually VOTING. </p>
              <p>Singapore is just too tiny a dot.</p>
              <p>Why break it up into smaller bits ?</p>
              <p>Since the population is so tiny, the more reason EVERYONE should vote to make the result more CONVINCING.</p>

              <p>We can all continue to rant and live on the hot air of frustration and be deluded by fantasies. But sometimes, we really need to wake up and accept facts.</p>
              <p>1. Ask yourself why were there walkovers?</p>
              <p>Are the opposition so happy with the way the ruling party is running, they feel not needed to stand up and be voted, but instead to snipe from blogs and forums, where their views are not heard, let alone be acted upon on?</p>
              <p>Is it so difficult to find 5 or 8 opposition figures in a ward to contest elections? The whiners are so loud, I had thought there ought to be more than 10,000 opposing figures in any ward, or had my presumptions been wrong?  They only want to complain, but not serve?</p>
              <p>If they truly care about the People, is there a need to fear the ruling party, if they are as principled as they claim themselves to be? Why did MP Chiam and NCMP Sylva served?</p>
              <p>Let us all accept the fact that the ruling party has the mandate of the people. Some ask, does cold exists? The answer is no, it is only the absence of heat. Similar logic, does one party rule exist in Singapore? The answer is no, it is only the absence of credible opposition.</p>
              <p>Stick to facts and rationality, and you will not be disappointed, and know full well where and who to blame for the dearth of opposition voices in our Parliament. Nothing is fair in politics,  and fairness is never a virtue  from armchair hypocrite opposition politicians who talk loudly but do not have the heart to serve our people in our legislative council.</p>
              <p>It is ridiculous in politics for any country to 'invite' the opposition, and entrench themselves to speak up in parliament, in any country, when they clearly do not have the mandate of the people to serve.</p>
              <p>And instead of cherishing this opportunity, they decry the good intentions of the ruling party, further alienating themselves from the minority of people who had hopedfor some credible opposition. Almost like a wish that they do not and have no intention to serve the people.</p>
