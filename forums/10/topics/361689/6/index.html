              <p>No, regardless if I am a corporate person or not, it's only simple logic. Nothing complex with it. We are not talking about an SMU course here, so no need to hide before presumed complexities and hide away from your illogical perceptions, which you had been freely expounding to others for the past few posts.</p>

They dun even give tips cos they use corporate cards, and sometime, these cards cannot be authorise due to their overspending or budget control, and then all get panicked call here and there...wha lau, sebei cham, come steady steady go out like a lamb.

              <p><strong>The Real Political Change That Singapore Needs</strong></p>
              <p><strong>By Dr Wong Wee Nam<br> 29 May 2009</strong></p>
              <p>When the President opened the new session of the 11th Parliament
              last week, he said, “Our political system is not set in stone.
              Singapore politics must evolve over time, as the world and our society
              change. It must respond to new circumstances and goals and continue to
              deliver good government to Singapore.”</p>
              <p>For the optimists, this statement gave a glimmer of hope that our political system is evolving for the better.</p>
              <p>A few days later, Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong gave a glimpse of
              what is to come when he outlined three principles that will guide the
              changes to be made to the political system. One, they must be fair to
              all political parties. Secondly, they should result in a strong and
              effective Government after an election; and thirdly, they must ensure
              that diverse views are represented in Parliament. Without the details,
              all these sounded reasonable.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However when Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong fleshed out the details
              in Parliament, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>anyone who had wished for a more democratic system and a
              system that could produce better political leaders ended up with
              nothing to celebrate about.</strong></span></p>
              <p>True, the number of seats for the opposition would be increased to
              nine with the extension of the NCMP scheme, 3 more single seats will be
              up for grabs, and the size of some 6 member GRCs would be reduced. But
              these are not drastic changes. They are mere tweakings of the existing
              system. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>However, the media and the PAP would like Singaporeans to see
              these as huge concessions.</strong></span></p>
              <h2><strong>Why the Change?</strong></h2>
              <p>On the surface of it, the PAP government appears very magnanimous.
              Losers now get to have 9 seats when previously they could only have
              three. Smaller parties and independents now get to contest 3 more
              single seats. And the sizes of the GRCs are going to be reduced when
              all of us thought that they would be increased. Nevertheless, all these
              are nothing but to tell the skeptics to stop complaining about the
              unevenness of the playing field since the PAP has become so generous.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The PAP has never been known to give concessions to the opposition.
              With draconian laws still in place and demonstrations by even one
              person now illegal, and filming of such acts could lend one into
              trouble, it is obvious they are not becoming more democratic than what
              they were before.</strong></span></p>
              <p>However, recently there has been a lot of public discontent on
              various issues and the grumbling citizens feel that their problems are
              inadequately aired. People now feel that there is the need for more
              opposition voices in Parliament. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The PAP is probably thinking that by
              giving all these token concessions, the voters, particularly the
              younger generation, who are now more outspoken and more ready to make
              changes, would be appeased.</strong></span></p>
              <p>Whether the voters will buy into this or not is left to be seen.</p>
              <p>Recently, there too has been talk of opposition unity and a lot of
              discussions on the ground to get the opposition parties to come
              together and contest the election as a united front. In fact the focus
              of many opposition members has been on winning a GRC in order to make a
              psychological breakthrough. The opposition parties realise they are too
              small in terms of resources, manpower and candidates to take on the PAP
              effectively without coming together.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><strong>Now with these changes, it is probably the PAP’s hope that
              all the small parties would stop talking about opposition unity and go
              it alone.</strong> <strong>Perhaps the stronger candidates from the
              various opposition parties will now go for the single seat wards,
              leaving the GRCs to be contested by weak teams.</strong> <strong>It is
              better for the PAP to have nine fragmented NCMPs in Parliament than to
              have five strong, duly-elected, unified opposition Members of
              Parliament.</strong></strong></span></p>
              <p>Will these changes halt all the talk about opposition unity and send
              the opposition parties back to their fragmented stage? <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>It is difficult
              to say.</strong></span></p>
              <h2><strong>What the Opposition Parties Need To Realise</strong></h2>
              <p>However one thing is clear. The opposition parties must realize that
              they are like small market stalls struggling to make a living by
              scrambling against each other for morsels and yet have to compete
              against a giant hypermarket at the same time. With such an uneven
              contest, it is inevitable that Parliament will end up overwhelmingly
              dominated by the PAP with a motley bunch of 9 opposition MPs/NCMPs each
              with his/her own disparate views acting as discordant accompaniments —
              just like bells and cymbals in an orchestra.</p>
              <p>In such a parliamentary composition, the PAP will always look like
              the only party capable of governing and the opposition will always look
              fragmented and not capable of providing an alternative.</p>
              <p>No matter what, NCMPs and NMPs will always be seen as objects of
              PAP’s creations. They will never have the status and dignity as elected
              members of Parliament.</p>
              <p>The last Malaysian General Election should serve as a good lesson
              for our opposition parties. In the past, they were fragmented and
              bickered against each other and did not make much headway against the
              ruling party. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Then in the last GE, they decided to fight the Barisan
              Nasional as a united front. Now they are truly an alternative, capable
              of ruling the country should the time come.</strong></span></p>
              <p><strong>Thus, these changes that the PAP intends to introduce will
              not change the status quo. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>In fact, it will entrench the PAP even more.</strong></span> Unless the opposition parties realize this and get their act together,
              they would be consigned perpetually to the role of political
              bridesmaids.</strong></p>
              <h2><strong>The Change that is Needed</strong></h2>
              <p>Sadly for Singapore and Singaporeans, the changes proposed will do
              nothing to improve their democratic aspirations. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The lives of
              Singaporeans will not be less controlled, the climate of fear will not
              go away, and our citizens will remain politically immature and
              apathetic.</strong></span></p>
              <p>Rather than tweaking the electoral process to appease voters as
              opposed to giving them a choice, what Singapore needs is a system that
              can help us produce plenty of good political leaders and not worry
              about the dearth of it all the time.</p>
              <p>Instead of constantly stressing of the need for “our leadership
              team” (read PAP) to continually self-renew by inducting new leaders and
              mollycoddle their entry into Parliament, we should create an
              environment where young people with leadership qualities can bloom and
              come forth naturally.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>For Singapore to succeed in future, we need to have strong political
              leaders, and strong political leaders can only be forged and emerge by
              fighting the electoral battles by themselves. </strong></span>Strong leaders will
              provide strong governments. For this reason, GRCs should be done away
              completely. Any political worth his salt should not be afraid to face
              the electorate and try to carry the ground by himself.</p>
              <p>The right change to be made then is to provide an environment where
              the young are taught to have a sense of service to the country, to have
              a sense of justice, to have an independence of mind and to be imbued
              with a spirit to right wrongs and to allow ideas to contend so that
              leaders will naturally surface. The right change to be made is to
              remove the climate of fear that discourages political participation so
              that all these idealism can be expressed freely.</p>
              <p>Another change that is needed is to make sure that people with
              leadership qualities will be able to fight an election fairly and not
              ostracized fro his political conviction. For this you need a free and
              fair press, a civil service that is neutral and an electoral process
              that does not catch a candidate by surprise by not giving him ample
              time to prepare.</p>
              <p>How about fairness to the young candidates who wish to contest the
              general election? Would the hefty election deposit required be reduced
              to allow more young people, who are yet to be settled in their career
              to join in the fray? Would the government set up a Political
              Arbitration Court, so that employees who are victimised by their
              employers for their political affiliations can get their problems
              redressed? How about the Political Donation Act? Not only is a young
              candidate hampered by hefty deposits, victimized by employers, he would
              also will have difficulty getting donations. It does not need a clever
              man to know which party’s candidate will get donations easily now that
              donors can no longer remain anonymous.</p>
              <p>We should be fair to all candidates who are willing to come forward
              to serve in what I consider to be the highest form of national service.
              If we can encourage the growth of political talents by treating
              everyone of whatever political affiliations fairly, there would not be
              any need to feel anxious about strong political leaders emerging in
              future.</p>
              <p>Then there would not be any need to keep thinking about how to keep the PAP in perpetuity in order to save Singapore.</p>
