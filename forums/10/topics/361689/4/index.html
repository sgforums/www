              <p>Thursday, 28 May 2009</p>
              <p>Singapore Democrats<br><br><img src="http://www.yoursdp.org/images/stories/election.jpg" border="1" alt="" width="120" align="left">If
                  there is any indication that the Government is nervous about the
                  unhappiness of the people, it is the latest increase in the number of
                  NCMP and NMP seats.<br><br>Anxious to avoid facing an angry electorate,
                  the PAP is desperately trying to divert the attention of the voters by
                  telling them that they don't have to vote for the opposition because
                  seats will be allocated to opposing voices.<br><br>In the first place,
                  Parliamentary seats are not for the Government to give out. They are
                  legislative positions to be earned by competing parties and candidates
                  whose power is derived from the voters.<br> <br>The problem with the such schemes is that parliamentary seats given
                  by the Government also means that they can be taken away at a whim.
                  Unfortunately this epitomises all that plagues Singapore's politics.
                  The PAP runs the country like a fiefdom and appoints law-makers rather
                  than have them elected.<br><br>In the second place, all these changes
                  are purely cosmetic aimed at trying to prettify the ugly face of an
                  election system that is neither free nor fair.<br><br>Parliament, if
                  the PAP needs to be reminded, is not a feedback session to canvas for a
                  “wider range” of views. It is an institution where laws are made and
                  where the Executive is called to account for its actions and policies.<br><br>As
                  such, rigorous debate is called for and each legislator brings his
                  popular power to bear on the arguments that he makes. Even then, if the
                  PAP is truly desirous of a wider range of views in Parliament, then it
                  should implement five simple measures:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <ol>
              <li>abolish the GRC system</li>
              <li>announce the constituencies at 	least 6 months before elections</li>
              <li>ensure that there is at least 	three weeks for the official campaign period</li>
              <li>give at least one month between 	the dissolution of parliament and polling day </li>
              <li>free up the media </li>
              </ol>
              <p><br>There
                  is no need to conduct this wayang exercise by increasing the number of
                  NCMP and NMP seats. Do the right thing by ensuring that the electoral
                  process is transparent, free and fair.<br><br><strong>Electoral process: Best practices</strong><br><br>Below
                  are some existing commitments for democratic elections in the
                  Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE)
                  participating states. Compare them to the ones in Singapore.<br><br><em><strong>OSCE</strong></em>:
                  When necessary, redrawing of election districts shall occur according
                  to a predictable timetable and through a method prescribed by law and
                  should reflect reliable census or voter registration figures.
                  Redistricting should also be performed <em>well in advance</em> of elections, be based on transparent proposals, and allow for public information and participation. (emphasis added)<br><em><strong>Singapore</strong></em>:
                  In the 1997 GE, the Election Boundaries Review Committee (EBRC), after
                  substantial alterations of the boundaries, presented the redrawn
                  electoral map less than a month before elections were called. In the
                  2001 GE the boundaries were announced 1 (yes, one) day before the
                  elections were called.<br><br><em><strong>OSCE</strong></em>: The
                  administration of elections must be conducted autonomously, free from
                  government or other interference, by officials or bodies operating
                  transparently under the law.<br><em><strong>Singapore</strong></em>: Elections are conducted by the Elections Department which is supervised by the Prime Minister's Office.<br><br><em><strong>OSCE</strong></em>:
                  No additional qualification requirements, beyond those applicable to
                  voters, may be imposed on candidates except, for certain offices,
                  concerning age and duration of citizenship and/or residence.<br><em><strong>Singapore</strong></em>:
                  A candidate for the presidential elections must have been a Minister,
                  Chief Justice, Speaker, Attorney-General, Chairman of the Public
                  Service Commission, Auditor-General, Accountant-General or Permanent
                  Secretary, chairman or CEO of a statutory board, chairman or CEO of a
                  company with a paid-up capital of at least $100 million. Or anyone who
                  in the opinion of the Presidential Elections Committee is qualified to
                  do the job of president.<br><br><em><strong>OSCE</strong></em>: States
                  should provide an adequate opportunity, on an equitable and
                  non-discriminatory basis, for election contestants to inform the public
                  about their candidacies and political programmes, including through the
                  state media.<br><em><strong>Singapore</strong></em>: All media
                  organisations are controlled by the PAP. Reporters Without Borders
                  consistently rank Singapore's media amongst the lowest in the world.<br><br><em><strong>OSCE</strong></em>:
                  States must ensure that equal access and fair treatment of election
                  contestants is provided by all state-owned media outlets, including all
                  electronic and print media. This obligation extends to news reports,
                  editorial comment, and all other content.<br><em><strong>Singapore</strong></em>: See above.<br><br><a href="http://www.osce.org/documents/odihr/2003/10/772_en.pdf"><em>http://www.osce.org/documents/odihr/2003/10/772_en.pdf</em></a></p>

              <p>The question is what you do when you see? Offer of 9 opposition MPs seats is hardly anything sweet to the common citizens, because ultimately the PAP still running the show the way they want it, pay themselves the way they see fit, you still won't get chance to vote when there is a walkover in your constituency.</p>

              <p><br>9 opposition MPs is also part of the sweet for kids like you peoples, the funny part is that no ruling party in the world would had said that 9 opposition MPs will be coming into the parliament, most ruling party would had trashed and slaughtered them out.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Did you all ever wonder how he, LHL arrive to the figure of 9, why not 20, 15 or 6??? I believe we are seeing a very unique political system whereby even nos oppositions in the Parliament is controlled by the ruling party. Dun u think so??</p>

              <p><br>I agree with you on the above.</p>
              <p>Every eligible voter should vote and get to vote regardless a ward is uncontested.</p>
              <p>When there is no opposition party member to compete, the VOTER still should vote to indicate clearly how many of these support the ruling party.</p>
              <p>So, to me, it is very clear that even when a ward is uncontested, an Election is about the voters actually VOTING. </p>

              <p>Why break it up into smaller bits ?</p>
              <p>Since the population is so tiny, the more reason EVERYONE should vote to make the result more CONVINCING.</p>

              last Monday as well as remarks made by other PAP MPs on how Singapore
              politics had to evolve over time to accommodate the changing
              aspirations of the electorate.</p>
              <p>Mr Low however hastened to add that “<strong>we <span style="text-decoration: underline;">cannot blame</span> the ruling party</strong>” for its “<strong>winner takes all, loser is a bandit</strong>” mindset, because the electorate had given it a clear mandate at every election.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">I disagree with Mr Low Thia Khiang. </span>As long as elections are neither
              free nor fair, as long as the ruling clique regularly resorts to
              pork-barrel strategies like the HDB upgrading carrot, and as long as
              our media is not independent, the PAP’s self-serving attitudes should
              be met with <em>disdain</em> rather than token respect. Mr Low should not miss the forest for the trees.</strong></span></p>
              <p>Mr Low was however correct to say on Thursday, a day after PM Lee
              Hsien Loong had announced the changes to the Parliamentary system, that
              “<strong>Parliament should consist of elected members … and should not
              become just a token of airing the people’s view without any significant
              working of the system</strong>“.</p>
              <p>Both <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Low Thia Khiang and Sylvia Lim, as well as SDA’s Chiam See
              Tong, were also right in asking for the GRC system to be abolished.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p>But as usual, these points were drowned out by a chorus of silly arguments advanced by PAP MPs.</p>
              <p>Indranee Rajah, Deputy Speaker and MP for Tanjong Pagar GRC, replied
              on Tuesday that the citizens of Singapore have the right to vote
              against the PAP, and that <strong>Mr Low’s suggestion of having more opposition to provide checks and balances is unsound</strong>, because if the day ever comes that the PAP becomes corrupt, then “<strong>the people are at liberty to vote out the PAP government and should do so in that situation</strong>“.</p>
              <p>Indranee Rajah said: “<strong>The premise of Mr Low’s suggestion is
              flawed … … if you apply the same logic, then the argument can also be
              made that if you vote in the opposition, then they may become corrupt
              in the future, so in order to avoid that, you might as well vote for
              PAP now.</strong>”</p>
              <p>I am unsure what to make of this twisted logic.</p>
              <p>If the electorate does not first take the initial steps of
              progressively installing more opposition MPs in Parliament, how can
              they be realistically expected to peacefully change Governments
              overnight without any major upheavals if the ruling party is one day
              shown to be unfit for office? Our political system has to be
              progressively adapted to one of multi-party democracy if the will of
              the people is to be effectively expressed.</p>
              <p>Ms Indranee Rajah also said that going by Low Thia Khiang’s logic,
              we might as well vote PAP to check on the opposition in case the
              opposition becomes corrupt. What nonsense is this? If you have a
              multi-party system, each party should check on one another. Besides,
              what is this ludicrous logic of having a House of 95% PAP MPs check on
              the remaining 5% Opposition MPs?</p>
              <p>Ms Rajah asserted: “<strong>Going by Mr Low’s argument, the logical
              outcome is that every other country in the world with an opposition in
              it should be squeaky clean, and in Singapore, in which a large majority
              of the Parliament comes from a single party, then Singapore should be
              the most corrupt country in the world. That as we know is not the case.</strong>”</p>
              <p>Indranee Rajah should seriously take English lessons. That argument
              here is not that the lack of Parliamentary opposition directly results
              in the ruling party becoming corrupt, although the unchanging laws of
              human nature often suggests that is a likely outcome. The crux of the
              issue here is that without true democracy and a robust system of checks
              and balances, the electorate is disempowered and have no way of
              protecting their rights or defending themselves should the ruling party
              misgovern the country.</p>
              <p>Josephine Teo, MP for Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC, said: “<strong>Is it
              better for Singapore to support an opposition — even if it is not up to
              mark — in the hope that it could govern well when it overthrows a
              corrupt PAP? Or is it better to make sure that the PAP does not fail
              Singaporeans, that it has the strongest team to serve Singaporeans?</strong>”</p>
              <p>My reply to her is that it is laughable notion to think that people
              will be able to prevent the ruling party from failing Singaporeans if
              they at the same time allow the ruling party to enact repressive laws
              that deny them their fundamental liberties and democratic rights.</p>
              <p>In an apparent response to the flurry of criticisms directed at the
              political changes tabled by PM Lee Hsien Loong, Youth and Sports
              Minister Vivian Balakrishnan told Parliament on Thursday that these
              changes are not aimed at keeping the PAP in power, and stressed that “<strong>Singapore’s
              political system is one that is slanted in favour of ensuring that only
              political parties which can form strong governments will be serious
              contenders in the general elections</strong>“.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Again, this is blatant disregard for the basic tenets of
              parliamentary democracy, which is supposed to give a fair fighting
              chance to any prospective candidate, not just to political parties whom
              in the eyes of the ruling elite have the necessary clout to form the
              Government.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>As you can see, the parliamentary debates about the supposed
              opening-up of political space and making cosmetic changes to the system
              to allow more opposition voices to be heard is going nowhere, because
              the fundamental issues of electoral reform and upholding the tenets of
              democracy remain unaddressed.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The token goodies dished out by the ruling party can easily be taken
              away at whim. That is the real crux of the issue — that while the
              ruling party still holds on to the ability to employ undemocratic means
              to stifle dissent and deny citizens their constitutional rights, the
              supposed liberalization of political space is nothing more than a
              mirage aimed at distracting the people, including opposition
              candidates, from the real issues that matter.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Make no mistake, the ruling party has no intention of restoring democracy.</strong></span></p>
