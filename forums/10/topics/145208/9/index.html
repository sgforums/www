It's not just really advertisement for gays events. The fact is I did not even put down the time and venue of these events. Those events is a civil movement within the gay comm to help us understand ourselves better. All these events are publicly announced. Whether the police moves in to close down these events will help us to understand the government's stand on this issue.<br><br>And beyond the events, I did highlight the political movement in areas nearer to us. From China, to Thailand, to Japan, etc etc... Which might serve as a model for Singapore to follow suit soon. Which is related to politics, isn't it? Even in Singapore, we have seen the HDB finally giving more space to the gay comm and the rights to hold indoor talks. Aren't all these related to politics? But then, it's just sad that not many people commented on these policies.<br><br>My intention of starting this thread is clear. There are gays in Singapore (hope this statement does not come as too much of a surprise). Currently, there's lack of integration into the mainstream. There are efforts being done to help the integration (e.g., SPACES). Which is a non-profit organisation which help raise funds for the handicaps. Over 50% of volunteers in SPACES are gays. The society and country can move forth only when there's more understanding or else the great divide will always be there.<br><br>And gays, in Singapore, contribute as much to the society as anyone else. In fact, the contribution is even much higher. Being gays, we are immediately labelled as singles, and hence, have to contribute more taxes. And we do not get the $20,000 tax rebated that child-bearing heterosexual counterparts are receiving. But then, we do not get to participate much in the other privileges as a Singaporean. HDB is one such privilege. Edusave accounts. And many other disbursements by the government to only married heterosexual couples.</div>

(They) are demeaning of gay men who are, through the<br>legislation, stereotyped as deviant.''<br><br>Existing laws prohibit ''gross indecency,'' or sexual intimacy, between<br>men if one or both are aged under 21, while heterosexual and lesbian<br>couples who are 16 or older may do so lawfully.<br><br>Men who engage in consensual sodomy with another when either is under<br>21 face life imprisonment.<br><br>Although a similar law also applies to heterosexual sodomy, Hartmann<br>said the law is discriminatory toward gay men. He said in the case of<br>homosexual sodomy, both men are criminally liable, but in the case of<br>heterosexual sodomy only the man, not the woman, is liable.<br><br>The judge ruled the laws are inconsistent with Hong Kong's<br>mini-constitution, the Basic Law, and the Bill of Rights, which provide<br>that all Hong Kong residents are equally protected by the law. He<br>determined the laws are a ''grave and arbitrary interference with the<br>right of gay men to self-autonomy in the most intimate aspects of their<br>private lives.''<br><br>Leung told reporters after the ruling: ''The difference is I can<br>finally have a loving relationship without being scared of (being)<br>thrown into jail for life imprisonment. That would be what we've been<br>asking for.''<br><br>Gay activist Roddy Shaw also welcomed the ruling. He said police have<br>arrested 65 men under gay sex laws in the past five years and 26 were<br>convicted.<br><br>''It is a landmark case and a long overdue judgment. It's the first<br>time that sexual orientation has been upheld as a protected ground<br>against discrimination in a Hong Kong court,'' he said.<br><br>The ruling comes as debate over a proposed law prohibiting<br>discrimination toward homosexuals rages between gay and religious<br>groups in the former British colony. </strong></div>

I don't think he can, and if he can't, he will just try to ignore it. This has been proven in past debates here. Such as when he mistakenly thought that "siggy" which is a slang for "signature" was meant as an insult aimed at him. When confronted about this, as proof that he was either so narrow-minded that he couldn't see it as anything else but an insult, or that he was so foolish that he couldn't see it as anything else but an insult, he totally ignored, smoked and skirted his way around it.</div>

There are gays in Singapore (hope this statement does not come as too much of a surprise). Currently, there's lack of integration into the mainstream. There are efforts being done to help the integration (e.g., SPACES). Which is a non-profit organisation which help raise funds for the handicaps. Over 50% of volunteers in SPACES are gays. The society and country can move forth only when there's more understanding or else the great divide will always be there. </strong></blockquote>With 50% of volunteers in SPACES being gays, does it take so much to stretch one's imagination that its efforts will surely be self-serving towards the interests of their own kind ?<br><br>Society and country can move forth if gays can understand that it is against the order of nature for such attitudes to be cultivated and accepted, and the consequence that blight society and country is in the incurable disease such as AIDS - and what other mutated forms that will follow.<br><blockquote>:<strong><br>And gays, in Singapore, contribute as much to the society as anyone else. In fact, the contribution is even much higher. Being gays, we are immediately labelled as singles, and hence, have to contribute more taxes. And we do not get the $20,000 tax rebated that child-bearing heterosexual counterparts are receiving. But then, we do not get to participate much in the other privileges as a Singaporean. HDB is one such privilege. Edusave accounts. And many other disbursements by the government to only married heterosexual couples. </strong></blockquote>Let us call 'a stick, simply as a stick' - why hide under the cleverly disguised happier and innocuous but misleading term of the word - 'GAY' ?<br><br>If  the other meaning for the word 'GAY' is to be 'HAPPY' - is HOMOSEXUALITY and LESBIANISM happiness ?<br><br>Is it in the order of Nature for two HUMANS from the SAME SEX to be united?<br><br>If it is intended by Nature for two HUMANS from the SAME SEX to be sexually united for the continued process of renewal of human-kind, then humans should have taken the form of being amoeba or protozoa.<br><br>If two HUMANS from the SAME SEX can be effective in child-bearing activities to achieve Singapore's national goal, surely it will not tax the national resources to provide tax rebates to such unions by mono-sexual marriages by those inclined to being homosexuals or lesbians ?<br><br>Are homosexuals and lesbians the only Singaporeans being labelled singles ?<br><br>There remain a larger number of males and females - who are NOT homosexuals or lesbians, and continue to be SINGLE; and individually or as a group, they will contribute as much or even more then the homosexual and lesbian community; and yet will require less from the State in terms of MEDICAL HELP or HOUSING.<br><br>The many Government incentives afforded to there NORMAL Singapore SINGLES are intended to "push" these individuals into legal union, so as to be able to fulfill their natural role of procreation.<br><br>Surely, this role is better suited for NORMAL HUMANS who do not indulge into deviant 'GAY' fantasies of fulfillment ?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>First of all, thank you for responding to my post.

And if they are gays, they have so many more channels to find out what they need to know. There are more than 10 gays emailing lists in Singapore, each group serving different needs and purposes. And for friends of gays (straights who are pro-gays), you are definitely welcomed to join the discussion. Again, these people would most likely have subscribed to any one of the groups mentioned. People coming into sg forum are most likely net savvy. A simple search using "gay Singapore" will give you the information u need.

I had shared with the rest some articles from American Psychological Association. Will post again later.

Especially not straight.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> There are indeed some dangers for uninformed teenagers to get trap into a homosexual circle if they are uncertain of their sexuality (especially for bisexuals)..

            <div class='col-md body'>btw, the source:http://www.apa.org/pubinfo/answers.html . APA is the biggest psychological association of the world since 2/3 of psychologists come from United States.<br><br>This is to address atobe's concerns about gays being "troubled". According to the professionals, as long as the homosexual concerned can reconcile his/her sexual orientation, he/she will most likely live a successful and happy lives.<br><br>Problems will arise only for those who, for one reason or another, tried to hide their sexual orientation.<br><br><strong>Is Sexual Orientation a Choice?</strong><br>No, human beings can not choose to be either gay or straight. Sexual orientation emerges for most people in early adolescence without any prior sexual experience. Although we can choose whether to act on our feelings, psychologists do not consider sexual orientation to be a conscious choice that can be voluntarily changed.<br><br><strong>Can Therapy Change Sexual Orientation?</strong><br><br>No. Even though most homosexuals live successful, happy lives, some homosexual or bisexual people may seek to change their sexual orientation through therapy, sometimes pressured by the influence of family members or religious groups to try and do so. The reality is that homosexuality is not an illness. It does not require treatment and is not changeable.<br><br>However, not all gay, lesbian, and bisexual people who seek assistance from a mental health professional want to change their sexual orientation. Gay, lesbian, and bisexual people may seek psychological help with the coming out process or for strategies to deal with prejudice, but most go into therapy for the same reasons and life issues that bring straight people to mental health professionals.<br><br><strong>What About So-Called "Conversion Therapies"?</strong><br><br>Some therapists who undertake so-called conversion therapy report that they have been able to change their clients' sexual orientation from homosexual to heterosexual. Close scrutiny of these reports however show several factors that cast doubt on their claims. For example, many of the claims come from organizations with an ideological perspective which condemns homosexuality. Furthermore, their claims are poorly documented. For example, treatment outcome is not followed and reported overtime as would be the standard to test the validity of any mental health intervention.<br><br>The American Psychological Association is concerned about such therapies and their potential harm to patients. In 1997, the Association's Council of Representatives passed a resolution reaffirming psychology's opposition to homophobia in treatment and spelling out a client's right to unbiased treatment and self-determination. Any person who enters into therapy to deal with issues of sexual orientation has a right to expect that such therapy would take place in a professionally neutral environment absent of any social bias.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ah sorry, unrelated singles can now purchase private properties using CPF together under the <strong>joint</strong>-singles scheme.. it's not about getting rid of unwanted flats anymore.. =p<br><br><strong>July 20, 2005<br>change in singapore private housing policy advantageous to gay couples<br>By News Editor<br><br>Eased restrictions on property financing and foreign home ownership will benefit same-sex couples who are planning to jointly purchase private residential properties using their pension funds and foreigners looking to buy private homes in Singapore.<br><br>Thirty-something couple, Jann and Wei, who have been together for two years were ecstatic when the Government announced that two non-related parties can now jointly purchase a private residential home using their Central Provident Fund (CPF) savings or pension funds.<br><br>Â“WeÂ’ve been mulling over buying a condo unit together for some time but have been unable to do due to previous restrictions on using both our CPF monies,Â” Jann said. Â“ItÂ’s wonderful that we now utilise our CPF funds as not being able to do so would really limit our options.Â”<br><br>In a surprise announcement on Tuesday, the Government revealed that two non-related parties such as same-sex couples can now jointly purchase private residential properties using their pension funds as a longstanding rule that prohibits non-related parties from using their CPF savings jointly in the purchase of private properties was lifted.<br><br>The move is part of its package of policy changes relating to the property market announced by Singapore Minister of National Development Mah Bow Tan in parliament.<br><br>Previously, only joint owners who are immediate family members (i.e., spouse, children, siblings and grand-parents) may utilise their CPF monies in the purchase of a private property. Same-sex couples who wished to finance their property jointly could only do so if they were both unmarried Singapore citizens, 35 years of age or above and purchased a Housing &amp; Development Board (HDB) or public housing flat from the open market.<br><br>The measure attracted garnered some debate. According to the Singapore Business Times, Ho Geok Choo (West Coast GRC) asked in parliament if the new CPF ruling went against the Government's 'pro-family policy' and if making CPF savings available to non-related singles for buying private property would "promote homogenous gender or heterogenous gender" partnerships.<br><br>National University of Singapore Environmental Management Programme director (School of Design and Environment) Dr Malone-Lee Lai Choo, said in reply, "If people want to live together, they don't need to buy their own property to do it."<br><br>The longstanding rule that only single citizens who are at least 35 years old can purchase a HDB flat from the open market remains unchanged.<br><br>The new regulations would also permit foreigners to buy apartments in non-condominium developments with fewer than six floors in addition to condominium units Â– although they will still need approval to buy landed property.<br><br>As there appears to be no restriction on the use of CPF savings by non-Singaporeans, it is expected that non-related singles, Singaporean or not, would be allowed to use their CPF savings to jointly purchase private residential property.<br><br>Foreigners seeking permanent residency (PR) status can now invest up to S$1 million (US$590,000) in a private residential property as part of the S$2 million they need to invest in the city-state to be considered for PR, provided he meets other conditions.<br><br>Under the revised regulations, buyers will be able to borrow up to 90 per cent of the total purchase price instead of the previous 80 per cent for both private and public residential properties. Cash downpayments will be cut to five per cent from 10 per cent, with the remaining paid from the buyerÂ’s CPF account. For HDB flat buyers, the cash downpayment now at four per cent Â– which was originally planned to reach 10 per cent in 2008 Â– will be capped at five percent from 2006.<br><br>Buyers can now tap on their CPF savings to buy properties with remaining leases of between 30 and 60 years. Previously, buyers could not use CPF funds to buy 99-year leasehold properties with less than 60 years left on the lease. CPF withdrawal limits for the purchase of such properties will however be pegged to the age of the purchaser and the remaining lease of the property to ensure that an owner will not outlive his property, based on the average human lifespan of 80 years.<br><br>Nearly all the policy change will come into effect immediately.<br><br>Property-related stocks on the Singapore stock exchange soared to multi-year highs yesterday as analysts called the move an effort to revive one of Asia's most sluggish markets.<br><br>Mah however maintained that revising the policies was Â“neither to boost nor depress the property marketÂ” but changes Â“from time to time is necessary to ensure their continued relevance to broader social and economic objectivesÂ” and to Â“improve structural rulesÂ” and Â“functioning of the property market.Â”<br><br>Observers say gays and lesbians living in Singapore will greatly benefit from the change in regulations, especially the large number who are in long-term relationships. Now that they are newly eligible to combine their incomes and CPF to purchase private residential property, developers and those selling their property are likely to see a spike in gay and lesbian couples shopping for their first home. This will apply across the board to all classes of property, from economical to high-end luxury developments, as there is a broad range of income levels in the gay and lesbian community.<br><br>In 2001, Fridae polled its gay and lesbian members residing in Singapore. Of the 595 respondents, 39 per cent declared that they were "attached" or "living with partner." Furthermore, 40 per cent of the respondents who were in relationships have been with the same partner for more than six months at the time of the survey.<br><br>The same survey revealed that a high proportion of respondents lived with parents, while only 22 per cent indicated that they own or rent their homes. This is despite the relatively high income levels of the respondents, with 50 per cent earning more than S$80,000 (US47,00) per annum Â– 20 per cent reporting income levels of more than S$180,000 per annum, 11 per cent between S$120,000 to S$180,000 and 19 per cent between S$80,000 to S$120,000.<br><br>The low percentage of home ownership is thus likely a direct result of regulations that have until now restricted non-related singles from jointly owning private or HDB property.<br><br>Some 80 percent of the 4.5 million people in the city-state live in public housing. Ninety-three percent of the population owns a home Â– the highest ownership level in Asia. </strong><br></div>

Homosexuality was only taken off the list of mental disorders in 1973 and the act of sexual intercourse between two homosexuals were lifted in 1974.In Singapore's context, having homosexual intercourse is a crime, and if you are homosexual, and you so happen to make a few enemies, they might just report you to the authorities. ( Yes, it may be an exaggeration but it is true)<br><br>In addition, discrimination against homosexuals are rife in our society. Being a gay man would mean that you would have to weak wrist, wear tight clothes and have a high pitched nasal voice. Not that some of them are, but it a stereotype that is imposed on all homosexuals. Its like saying that all black people are stupid, as was much the case during the the 50s and the 60s in america.<br><br>PRP,<br><br>whether homosexuals are born or not does not matter.The thing is, as i said before,a homosexual does not choose what sex he/she/he-she is attracted to, its like being heterosexual, you don't make the descision to feel attracted to opposite sex, it just happens naturally.<br><br>Whether homoseuxals are born is still widely argued and reasons that you gave against it is pathetic.<br><br>Growth and development plays a part, so does genes, as they not onle determine how physical body, but also determine certain aspects of our behaviour. It is obvious that almost any behaviour/action have some link to our genes, directly or indirectly.<br><br>For those who say that if there is a gay gene, and send gays don't reproduce, then they shouldn't exist.<br><br>You are wrong.<br><br>There is some thing called heredity.It happens all over the world to almost every1, it is the reason why sometimes when diabetes runs through the family but someone doesnt get it.The gene is simply passed on, whether it manifests itself is a wholly different matter.<br><br>(PS: Sexual Act does not mean Sexuality)</div>
