It is a group committed to bringing people of different backgrounds and experiences together to work together in an open environment for the betterment of society at large.  While it was started by two gay people, namely my partner Han and myself, it was not intended to be membered primarily by gay people or to be primarily for the purpose of the gay community. The objective of SPACES is to bridge different communities together in OPENNESS in social service - all our projects involve building bridges between old-young, Malay-Indian-Chinese, gay-straight and poor-rich.
