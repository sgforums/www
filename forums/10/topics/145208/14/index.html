Period. Unless you have evidences to show that all homosexuals are promiscuous, not all homosexuals will be affected. But I do admit that the gay comm need to buck up in this area. Again, I believe if gays are allowed marriage and housing, we will see a drop in promiscuity.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Atobe:</div><div class="quote_body">You will have to TRY HARDER to convince the NORMAL SEXUALLY INCLINED Singaporeans that THE HOMOSEXUALS deserve to be treated much better then they ALREADY ARE .<br></div></blockquote>I have provided the evidences in the earlier post liao.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Atobe:</div><div class="quote_body">Should a MALE be allowed to marry another MALE, or a FEMALE marrying a FEMALE ?<br><br>What is the objective of MARRIAGE ?<br><br>Was MAN created to marry another MAN, or a WOMAN created to marry another WOMAN ?<br></div></blockquote>Unless Singapore is a Christian/Islam state, the above view does not stand. Furthermore, marriage is beyond religion. It is a legal status. This legal status is tie to housing (in Singapore) and inheritance.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Atobe:</div><div class="quote_body">Will legal Marriage and Public Housing help to reduce the incidence of AIDS ?<br><br>At present, with AIDS being so pervasive, there is also an equal number of AIDS patients who are MARRIED to opposite sex - and obviously owning properties.<br><br>Did it prevent AIDS from those who are married to opposite sex but remain promiscuous ?<br></div></blockquote>But didnt you assume that homosexuals are more promiscuous? Sorry, I'm completely lost in your argument now.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Atobe:</div><div class="quote_body">If the Gay community is granted easy access to public assisted housing (such as HDB), will the incidence of AIDS drop, or will it allow an easier environment for more homosexual activities to take place Â– BEHIND PRIVATE DOORS ?<br><br>Are you suggesting that presently homosexual activities are already taking place in the OPEN, and NOT behind CLOSED and PRIVATE doors ?<br><br>WITH or WITHOUT PUBLIC HOUSING, and this is already causing the high incidence of AIDS amongst the Gay Community.<br><br></div></blockquote>The question is whose house? I'm 32. I'm staying in my parents place. My partner is staying in his parents place. Why? Because we do not co-own a house. Just imagine if a couple is separate physically, isn't this one factor that  might contribute to promiscuity? I'm lucky to have a partner who is believe in monogamy, but when a ccouple are separated most of the time, would that create extra pressure for them to split up?</div>

Unless you claimed that you know a great deal about gays to make those accusations. What I was trying to show is simply that most of such accusations are baseless. And I rely on public access information (scientific and newspapers) to show how wrong your views were. Should this be labelled as defensive?<br><br>Homosexual - Bisexual - Heterosexual continuum should not be confused with<br><br>Masculine - Androgenous - Feminine continuum<br><br>You did not specify whether you use masculine/feminine to refer to emotion? physical traits? appearance? mannerisms, etc?

So if they do not follow laws as dictated by religion, how to understand their morality framework?<br><br>[b]Criticisms of Kohlberg </strong><br><strong>Measurement Criticisms</strong><br>There have been many criticisms of Kohlberg's theory of moral development and his methods.<br><br>The first criticizes his means of measuring levels of moral reasoning.<br><br>Some critics claim that <strong>the use of hypothetical situations skews the results because it measures abstract rather than concrete reasoning. </strong><br><br>When children (and some adults) are presented with situations out of their immediate experience, they turn to rules they have learned from external authorities for answers, rather than to their own internal voice.<br><br>Therefore, young children base their answers on rules of "right" and "wrong" they have learned from parents and teachers (Stages 1 and 2 according to Kohlberg's theory).<br><br>If young children are presented with situations familiar to them, on the other hand, they often show care and concern for others, basing their moral choices on the desire to share the good and maintain harmonious relations, placing them in Stage 3 or 4 (which Kohlberg claimed was impossible at their age).<br><br>Therefore, the criticism is that his measuring tool is faulty - people actually operate differently in real life situations.<br><br><strong>The next criticism is based on the "social desirability" bias that confounds hypothetical based research questions. </strong><br><br>Kohlberg's emphasis on abstract reasoning in his research creates confounds in which habitual juvenile delinquents can score at a higher stage of moral development than well-behaved children.<br><br>Because behaviors are not considered and reasoning is determined through hypothetical situations, children who behave in immoral ways may be able to answer hypothetical moral dilemmas in a more advanced fashion than better-behaved children who think less abstractly.<br><br>Early criticisms of Kohlberg's lack of attention to behaviors led Kohlberg to add an emphasis on moral action to his Just Community educational program.<br><br><strong>For those who are looking for concrete help in developing moral values in children, however, <span style="color: red;">Kohlberg's theory is still of little practical use</span></strong>.<br><br><strong>"Universality" criticisms and Gender criticisms </strong><br>The next criticims attack Kohlberg's claim that his stages of moral development are universal, applying equally to all human beings (and genders) across cultural divisions.<br><br>Carol Gilligan was the first to attack this aspect of Kohlberg's theory, pointing out that <strong>there were difference between men and women in how they reasoned morally</strong>.<br><br><strong>Gilligan pointed out that all of Kohlberg's original subjects were male, as was Kohlberg himself</strong>, and that they therefore failed to place a high value on the morality of care, sacrifice and community. (All excellent point!)<br><br><strong>Western Bias Criticism </strong><br>Another criticism pointed out that Kohlberg, as a member of the educated, elite, white, male, Western culture, viewed individual autonomy and justice as the premier moral values.<br><br>He even went so far as to equate morality with justice (ignoring other moral values such as courage, self-control, empathy, etc.).<br><br>Members of the working and rural classes, however, tend to have a more communitarian approach to life, viewing the common good as the highest value, promoting care and harmonious relationships over individual justice. (Women, having been relegated to "lower class" status for centuries, may have developed a more communitarian approach to life for that reason, rather than simply because they are female.)<br><br><strong><span style="color: red;">Non-Western</span> and tribal societies also frequently  <span style="color: red;">see the community as more important than the individual</span>.</strong><br><br><strong>"Individualistic" Criticisms </strong><br>According to Kohlberg's upper-class Western view of moral reasoning, communitarian morality is doomed to rest forever at a lower stage of development (Stages 3 and 4).<br><br><strong>This view disregards the possibility that communitarian morality may be as advanced as individualistic morality, if not more so</strong>.<br><br>It also can be seen to place Western culture at the top of the scale, with little room for cross-cultural inclusion, although Buddhist philosophy and Taoism can be viewed as postconventional.<br><br>Although Kohlberg insisted that his theory was culturally inclusive, he found little empirical evidence to back this up.<br><br>In all of his interviews, only a few people showed Stage 5 reasoning, and nearly all were well-educated Westerners.<br><br>Stage 6 reasoning was never substantiated in interviews; Kohlberg created it as an "ideal" and pointed to examples such as Gandhi to support its existence.<br><br>After a tremendous amount of criticism over the fact that Stage 6 was purely hypothetical, Kohlberg removed it from the empirical stages but retained it as a "theoretical construct in the realm of philosophical speculation."<br><br>Despite equally heavy criticism, Kohlberg refused to remove Stage 5 from his system.<br><br><a href="http://www.candleinthedark.com/kohlberg.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.candleinthedark.com/kohlberg.html</a><br>[/b]</blockquote>It will take a long while to defend the theory. It stated an ideal state of society. What's important in this theory is the understand of social contracts. Is euthanasia, abortion, capital punishment right or wrong? If you based it on laws, you will be forced into a certain position. But if u understand that all such cases much be judge on a case by case basis, you will understand where is he coming from.<br><br>The criticisms focus very much on how this has not been observed in the real world. Please be reminded that this theory was proposed some time back (and some as the criticisms). But with the progress of humanity, we can see more and more people gearing towards the liberal end and hence will use a social contract based reasoning rather than a rule and law based reasoning.<br><br>Maybe in 50 years time, we can find the lefties become more dominant than the righties.</div>

These decisions are a tremendous victory for children, for parental responsibility, and for common sense.Â”<br><br>------------------------<br><br>This morning the California State Supreme Court issued groundbreaking opinions in three cases involving the legal status of children born to same- sex parents. The three cases are Elisa B. v. Superior Court, K.M. v. E.G., and Kristine H. v. Lisa R. The National Center for Lesbian Rights (NCLR) was counsel for Emily B., a mother seeking child support from her former partner, in the Elisa B. case and filed amicus briefs in the K.M. and the Kristine H. cases.<br><br>In all three cases, the Court held that when a couple deliberately brings a child into the world through the use of assisted reproduction, both partners are legal parents, regardless of their gender or marital status. The California Supreme Court is the first state Supreme Court to reach this issue, and its holding in these three cases inevitably will influence courts in other states.<br><br>In the Elisa B. case a same-sex couple Â– Emily B. and Elisa B. Â– had children together using artificial insemination by an anonymous sperm donor. Emily gave birth to twins in 1998, one of whom has Down Syndrome.<br><br>After the twinsÂ’ birth, the couple decided that Emily would stay home to care for the children and Elisa would be the familyÂ’s breadwinner. When the couple split up 18 months later, Elisa eventually cut off all contact and support, prompting Emily to apply for assistance from the state, which brought a child support action against Elisa. In todayÂ’s ruling, the California Supreme Court strongly affirmed the trial courtÂ’s ruling that Elisa is a legal parent who cannot simply walk away from her obligation to support the two children she agreed to bring into the world.<br><br>Â“I am elated beyond words that the Court recognized the reality that my children have two parents,Â” said Emily B. Â“This is a tremendous victory not only for my family but for all children born to same-sex couples.Â”<br><br>In its decision today, the Court held: Â“A person who actively participates in bringing children into the world, takes the children into her home and holds them out as her own, and receives and enjoys the benefits of parenthood, should be responsible for the support of those children Â– regardless of her gender or sexual orientation.Â”<br><br>In the K.M. v. E.G. case, a fertilized egg from K.M. was implanted in her partner E.G., who gave birth to twins in 1996. When the couple broke up in 2002, E.G. denied K.M. any access to the children and took the position that she was the childrenÂ’s only parent. In its decision today, the Court held that both women are legal parents.<br><br>In the Kristine H. v. Lisa R. case, a same-sex couple had a child using assisted reproduction. Before the child was born, the couple sought and were granted a court judgment declaring that both women were the childÂ’s legal parents. After the couple ended their relationship 2 Â½ years later, the birth mother filed an action seeking to vacate the judgment and have the court declare that she is the childÂ’s only parent.

            <div class='col-md body'>Atobe, you switched your position regularly. It's kind of hard to follow your logic. In case you are wondering why Heng and I were confused, I will point out just a few of these contradictions:<br><br>1) You stated that gay issues are non-political, but you failed to show that those issues I had raised had no social-political implications<br>2) You suggested Heng to look at psychiatric studies, but you failed to accept how the current psychology/psychiatry community look at this issue<br>3) You claim that gay genes cannot be passed on, but you went on to suggest that even handicapped, people of lower intelligence can negate their conditions<br>4) You claim that Asian religion does not accept homosexuality, without addressing why scriptures from these religions did not mention anything about same-sex behaviours<br>5) You claim that gays are not discriminated, but you are hurling insults after insults and also, you had not demonstrated that those national policies I've brought up are not discriminating gays<br>6) You claim that gays are abormal, but you failed to argue against APA's stance on this issue<br>7) You claim that gays are unnatural, but you failed to show that why homosexualism can be found in animals (and these animals are not extinct even until today)<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> "Tolerance of gays" will give way to "Promotion of homosexualism" when Psychologists had clearly articulated that "Change therapy" is dangerous. If gay can change to become straight, the reverse is true as well.<br>etc<br><br>I mean if we want to have a fruitful discussion, shouldn't we at least have a clear stand?<br><br>Further, it is also important to show why you came to such assumptions:<br>1) All gays have nothing to do other than sex<br>2) All gays are effeminate<br>3) All gays are promiscuous<br>4) All gays are rapers and paedophiles<br>etc</div>

And when one adult homosexual meets another, its "Hey, I am like you, why don't we get together."<br>The courts have decreed that what homosexuals do in private is their own business, and the law have no business regulating the goings-on of the bedroom.<br>Since then, homosexuals have been comming out of the closet expousing their sexual orientation theory. Much study has been carried out and nothing is conclusive or proven. Homosexuality is a psychological phenomena, not a physical or biological development.<br>They know they are an abnormality. Therefore they hijack what is deemed normal. Manners and marriage. They crave normalcy. The current same sex marriage/weddings is proof of this.<br>Homosexuals are self gratifying individuals. They seek to indulge in their pleasure. There is nothing wrong in that, except that in their quest for normalcy they are destroying the fragile institution of the family. When a significant number of families are dyfunctional, the community suffers, then the nation deteriorate. They can do their own thing, but going on to propagate their lifestyle as normal is going too far, and to the detriment of all, homosexuals included.<br></div>

I have taken a homosexual subject and successfully turned them into a healthy heterosexual; this event surely demonstrates that science does in fact have practical uses. But this is more than a scientific victory; it is also a personal victory, for the subject was my own pot-holing daughter, Elizabeth Jane Maxwell.<br><br>Fervent fans may recall that my daughter betrayed me by turning into a vile lesbian, I have successfully ended this heresy through a determined and considered programme of heterosexual reconditioning, offering bouncy and shiny heterosexuality. The split ends have been sealed through this programme of conditioning which is truly a cleansing of the soul and mind on a most magnificent scale. I am aware of the feelings of amazement and joy that will be overwhelming you now, so you may want to take a break here.<br><br>Take a break in an effort to absorb this truly astounding information.<br><br>Welcome back, I hope you have now absorbed this discovery so I will endeavour to explain how this amazing achievement came about. After being left heartbroken by my daughter's pot-holing, I made the important decision of instigating a scientific project in an effort to resolve the issue of homosexuality and offer a final solution. The tools that were required for my project were a loud, authoritarian, i.e. male, voice (for shouting threats and derisory comments), a shotgun (for lesbian hunting), and a determined and rational scientific mind. This was clearly a deep responsibility that had been thrust upon me by the lord and I was determined to do my holy service as a devout English protestant. So I set out to do GodÂ’s work, and rid our earth of the scourge of homosexuality. Homosexuality has torn apart numerous good Christian families and I realised that my mission was a crusade against the infidels of sexuality. I have provided a diagram to explain my methodology for curing homosexuality.<br><br>As we can see the process for curing homosexuality is not a complicated one but nevertheless takes a certain strength of character and the legal right to brandish a gun. Let us do the sum together below, you may want to note this down if you have a poofter son or pot holing daughter, or you have suspicions about a relative (flamboyant clothing etc).<br><br>HOMOSEXUALITY<br>Minus<br>GAY PRIDE<br>Plus<br>MORALITY<br>Equals<br>RESPECTABLE HETEROSEXUALITY<br><br>So we see, if this method is employed you can regain the moral ground over these heretic homosexuals. This can be seen in my daughter who yesterday came back to me protesting her innocence and heterosexuality. Apparently her Â“girlfriendÂ” accused Elizabeth of being a spy for the Â“normsÂ” and it was then that my daughter realised that she belonged inside the straight tent. My threatening behaviour with a shotgun shocked her brain into fight or flight mode, my taunts of Â“heresyÂ” and Â“sex fiendÂ” shamed her into self doubt, it was then that my wisdom on morality embedded in ElizabethÂ’s mind, by this time the struggle was over and sexual sanity had won the day. These effects combined with ElizabethÂ’s disgust at living in a seedy flat in Cheltenham with muscle-bound dykes sealed the deal and she contacted her brother Richard H. Maxwell who promptly went to collect her in the Bentley I had bestowed upon him. As Elizabeth sat on the plush leather seats she knew that she had made the correct decision to submit to her fatherÂ’s will, silly little thing.<br><br>As she approached the main entrance with her bag, I stood waiting. I greeted her with the words Â“Welcome back to the winning side my dear sweet daughterÂ”. We hugged and wept in each otherÂ’s arms as my serving staff vigorously applauded. I promptly put an end to the clapping and told the lazy peasants to get back to work before I sacked them all!<br><br>I hope that my discovery has given hope to the parents of homosexual heretics, and may these despicable poofters be reunited with their parents as soon as my programme becomes well known. I hope that the parents experience the same joy as I did yesterday when I was reunited with my precious little girl.<br><br><a href="http://www.glossynews.com/artman/publish/printer_curing-homosexuality-1102.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.glossynews.com/artman/publish/printer_curing-homosexuality-1102.shtml</a><br><br>Other reference reading of "Cures for Homosexuality" are :-<br><br><strong>God's Cure for Homosexuality</strong><br><a href="http://www.shakinandshinin.org/Homosexuality.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.shakinandshinin.org/Homosexuality.html</a><br><br><strong>Aetheistic Realism's 'Cure' for Homosexuality</strong><br><a href="http://michaelbluejay.com/x/homosexuality.html" rel="nofollow">http://michaelbluejay.com/x/homosexuality.html</a><br><br><strong>Dr Dobson's Newsletter:<br>Can Homosexuality be Treated and Prevented ?</strong><br><a href="http://www.family.org/docstudy/newsletters/a0021043.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://www.family.org/docstudy/newsletters/a0021043.cfm</a><br><br><strong>Is Homosexuality a Choice ? </strong><br><a href="http://%20http://salmon.psy.plym.ac.uk/year1/psychobiology_site_backups/homosexuality-debate/choice.html" rel="nofollow"> http://salmon.psy.plym.ac.uk/year1/psychobiology_site_backups/homosexuality-debate/choice.html </a><br><br><strong>Homosexuality : the Scientific Evidence</strong><br><a href="http://www.whyprophets.com/prophets/gay_gene.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.whyprophets.com/prophets/gay_gene.htm</a><br><br></div>
