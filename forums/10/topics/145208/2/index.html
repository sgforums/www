            <div class='col-md body'>Legal issues are always linked to the housing policies.. For straights, the marriage itself takes care of legal issues.. For gays, we need to be more careful with such issues.. Gotta draw an explicit will real soon..<br><br><strong>legal update on revised housing policies in s'pore<br>By Thomas Ng<br><br>Fridae's legal columnist, Thomas Ng, provides an update on policy changes which allow non-related persons to jointly purchase private residential properties using their pension funds and how it can benefit same-sex couples.<br><br>On 19th July 2005, Mr Mah Bow Tan, Minister for National Development made an announcement in Parliament in his Ministerial Statement on Policy Changes Affecting The Property Market which has a direct effect on the issue of gay and lesbian couples.<br><br>He announced that non-related singles would be allowed to use their Central Provident Fund (CPF) savings to jointly purchase private residential property with immediate effect. Prior to this, non-related parties were not allowed to use their CPF savings jointly in the purchase of private properties. Previously, only joint owners who are immediate family members (i.e., spouse, children, siblings and grand-parents) may utilise their CPF monies in the purchase of a property.<br><br>With the relaxation of this rule, gay and lesbian couples who wish to purchase private property jointly, may now use their CPF savings. In the past, while there was no restriction to 2 unrelated persons buying private property in joint names, they could not utilise their CPF savings in the purchase. Well, now they can!<br><br>As there appears to be no restriction on the use of CPF savings by non-Singaporeans, it means that non-related singles, Singaporean or not, would be allowed to use their CPF savings to jointly purchase private residential property.<br><br>Of course, certain issues will inevitably arise when 2 unmarried persons purchase property together. E.g., how will my share in the property be determined if I break up with my partner? How can I ensure that my partner gets my share in the property when I die?<br><br>Basically, your share in the property will be determined by the proportion of your financial contribution to the purchase of the property itself. If you and your partner break up, the both of you can decide to sell the property and split the net sale proceeds in accordance to the proportion of each partyÂ’s financial contribution. Alternatively, one party could also buy out the other partyÂ’s share at market value. If both parties cannot agree on what to do, there may be a stale-mate. While one party is entitled to sell his share to another 3rd party, no one would want to buy part of a property. While it is possible to apply to Court to partition the property, again, no one would want to buy part of a property. So, itÂ’s really in both partiesÂ’ best interest to talk and come to an agreement on how to deal with the property even if the break-up is so acrimonious that you want to spit in the face you used to adore.<br><br>Now, many will ask : how can I make sure my partner inherits my share in the property when I die? Well, you should make a will stating who the beneficiaries to your estate will be after your death. Basically, the will sets out who inherits your existing assets and only comes into operation upon your death. If you die without leaving a Will, you are said to die intestate. Your property and assets will be distributed according to the rules of intestacy. The rules set out the beneficiaries of the estate, the proportion in which they will inherit and the order of priority that a person has or the next-of-kin have to administer the estate of the deceased. Here, next-of-kin means surviving family members. Your partner who is of the same sex and is not related to you will not qualify as the next-of-kin.<br><br>You could also determine that your partner inherits your share in the property by the manner in which the both of you hold the property. You and your partner can hold the property as joint tenants. Joint tenancy is a form of co-ownership where upon the death of one joint tenant, the surviving joint tenant inherits the entire interest in the property. This is called the right of survivorship. Because of this right, a joint tenant cannot give away his interest in a will. His interest in the property will automatically go to the surviving joint tenant.<br><br>Alternatively, you and your partner could hold the property as tenants-in-common. This means that they own the property in undivided shares e.g., 50-50 or 60-40. There is no right of survivorship. Upon the death of one party, the share which he/she owns will go to his estate to be divided according to his will or the rules of intestacy, if there is no will. </strong><br></div>

The Roman Catholic Church, the predominant Christian denomination in Canada, vigorously opposed the legislation.<br><br>The new legislation grants gays and lesbians the right to full civil marriages however religious officials would not be obliged to marry same-sex couples.<br><br>Prime Minister Paul Martin's minority Liberal Party government said it had to draw up the legislation to allow same-sex marriages across the country after courts in eight of the 10 provinces ruled that a heterosexual-only definition of marriage was unconstitutional.<br><br>Martin, a Roman Catholic, has said that despite anyone's personal beliefs, all Canadians should be granted the same rights to marriage.<br><br>In a speech addressing the House of Commons on February 16, 2005, Martin quoted the British Columbia Court of Appeal: "Marriage is the only road to true equality for same-sex couples. Any other form of recognition of same-sex relationships... falls short of true equality."<br><br>Canadian residency requirements are less strict than those in other countries that allow gay marriage resulting in gay men and lesbians travelling to Canada to get married despite the unions not being recognised in the couples' home countries. </strong><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Homosexuality or heterosexuality for that matter, does not have anything to do with values, Esatern or Western.

It kicked off yesterday with a four-day exhibition of children's book illustrations by artist Martin Loh.<br><br>Other events include a talk on classical Chinese literature, a poetry recital and a forum.<br><br>The programme will end on Aug 26.<br><br>There is no official committee organising the festival, said Mr Alex Au of activist group People Like Us, adding: 'It's very grassroots. Different people are organising different events.'<br><br>The organisers are: People Like Us, bible study group Safehaven, sports group Adlus and individuals including Dr Tan Chong Kee, activist and academic Russell Heng, artist Martin Loh and poet Dominic Chua.<br><br>IndigNation was organised after the Nation party, billed as Asia's largest gay celebration and held here annually since 2001, was banned. Police here declared it 'contrary to public interest' and denied organiser Fridae.com, an online gay network, a public entertainment licence. The event will now be held in Phuket in November.<br><br>'The gay community is indignant and extremely unhappy. All the talk about society opening up is just empty words,' said Mr Au. He stressed that the campaign was not a retaliation.<br><br>Fridae.com chief executive Stuart Koe also insisted that the online portal 'did not organise nor call for' the festival.<br><br>Commenting on the events, Member of Parliament for Tampines GRC Sin Boon Ann said the groups and individuals are free to speak as long as they are 'mindful that our nation has certain constraints, boundaries'. He added: 'There is freedom of speech here as long as speakers don't incite violence and are sensitive to the views of others.'<br><br>When contacted, the police said none of the event organisers has applied for a public entertainment licence with the police or the Media Development Authority. A police spokesman said: 'Public entertainment activities, unless otherwise exempted, require a permit.<br><br>'The licensing authorities will have to assess activities on a case-by-case basis before deciding if an event can be approved.'<br><br>Dr Heng, who plans to speak at one of the events, said he had not applied for a licence because Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong had said in his National Day Rally speech last year that licences would not be needed for talks that are held indoors and do not cover subjects of race or religion.</strong><br></div>

But then, Christian gay forum and workshop on Biblical Interpretation on homo are Â“political perspectiveÂ”??<br><br>Allow me to quote from Pikamaster, Â“Thus, unless Christian uniques (to use the more politcally correct term) are not meant to follow the instructions of the Bible, which strangely enough means rejecting Christianity as a religious belief, then I suggest that you ignore this entire forum.Â”<br><br>You are not a Christian, you donÂ’t accept the Bible and you donÂ’t understand Christianity, so stop using as Christian, the Bible or Christianity for publicity or to support your own course!!<br><br>Thank you very much.<br></div></blockquote>Ah.. that's why i suggested to dreamy to use the other thread too..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>And if I want to raise issues with the bible, I will do it in Eternal Hope too..</div>
