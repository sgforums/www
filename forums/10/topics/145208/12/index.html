            <div class='col-md body'>More on Asian Religions' views on Homosexuality:<br><br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexuality" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexuality</a><br><br><strong>Buddhism</strong><br>One of the five precepts of Buddhism states that one is to refrain from sexual misconduct or, more accurately, one is to refrain from indulging in sexual desire. Most Buddhist schools construe this to mean that monks and nuns are to practice celibacy. However, there has been a diversity of opinions on this matter ranging from strict vows of celibacy to Japanese Buddhist schools that taught heterosexuality was to be avoided for clergy.<br><br>For laypersons today, this precept mainly applies to adultery. However, wide ranges of interpretations are possible about what exactly constitutes "sexual misconduct" and therefore the different schools of Buddhism - or even different individual monks - at different periods of time have offered varying opinions.<br><br>Interpretations of what constitutes misconduct include sex outside marriage (relatively modern idea), sex with another person without the consent of your life partner(s), or the historically prevalent view that it was limited to describe rape, incest and bestiality.<br><br><span style="color: red;">Buddhist schools condemning homosexuality is a recent development and there is no scriptural basis upon which it is to be condemned. Prior to colonialism under Abrahamic countries homosexuality was sanctified by Buddhist leaders throughout Asia.</span><br><br>Different countries held various views, for example in China where believers often belong to Confucianism as well, exclusive homosexuality was discouraged because it would prevent a son from carrying out his Confucian religious duty to reproduce, all at the same time non-exclusive homosexuality was permissible and widely practiced. Monogamy was an unsual and foreign idea to many Asians until contact with the West.<br><br>Within Japanese traditions homosexuality was said to have been started by the Bodhisattva Manjusri of wisdom and the sage Kukai while in China it is attributed to the Yellow Emperor, the father of China.<br><br><span style="color: red;">In India, Tibet, China, Southeast Asia and Japan, areas where Buddhism was or remains one of the chief religions their cultures have been historically unconcerned with the gender of sexual activity or the object of desire.</span><br><br><strong>Taoism</strong><br><br>Homosexuality is not forbidden by the Taoist Holy Books (the Tao Te Ching and the Zhuang Zi). However, many Taoists believe that exclusive homosexuality is wrong, but many others see nothing wrong with it.<br><br>To understand why this is, one must understand Taoism's intertwined status with Confucianism and Buddhism in many adherents. A great many Taoists combine Confucian thought that requires sons to further the family lineage by reproduction.<br><br><span style="color: red;">Both Taoism and Buddhism do not forbid exclusive homosexuality but Confucianism did by insisting that a sonÂ’s religious duty included reproduction to further the family lineage. Taoists who find nothing wrong with exclusive homosexuality usually do not believe in Confucianism or have dropped their requirement of heterosexual relations due to medicinal advancements that allow reproduction without such sex, using IVF and/or surrogacy.</span><br><br>This has been the traditional view of homosexuality in Taoism, that homosexual acts in it self are not wrong but all men are still required to reproduce. For example, Taoists may have homosexual relations as long as they continue the family tree by having a child with at least one woman.<br><br><strong>Hinduism</strong><br><br>Monk performing auparashtika on a visiting prince. Khajuraho, Madhya Pradesh.Main article: Homosexuality and Hinduism<br><br>The Indian Kama Sutra written in the third century CE contains passages describing hijras performing oral sex to men with tips to maximize pleasure. Prior to British colonization of India hijras were not the only homosexual activity, many engaged in a form of pederasty which was openly practiced by Muslims and Sikhs in the north while being overlooked in the south by Hindus. The terms gand-mara (anus beater), gando (ass-taker) and ganga ("anuser") were coined during this time period. During British control Hinduism became markedly antagonistic to homosexuality.<br><br><span style="color: red;">In Hinduism many divinities are androgynous with some changing sex to participate in homoerotic behavior.</span></div>

According to his model it is not possible to regress backwards in stages. It is also not possible to 'jump' stages; each stage provides new perspective and is "more comprehensive, differentiated and integrated than its predecessors."<br><br>Other models resemble Kohlberg's, including James Fowler's six stages of faith and Jane Loevinger's nine stages of ego development.<br><br>Level 1 (Pre-Conventional)<br>1. Obedience and punishment orientation<br>2. Self-interest orientation<br>Level 2 (Conventional)<br>3. Interpersonal accord and conformity<br>(a.k.a. The good boy/good girl attitude)<br>4.

Principled conscience)<br>[edit]<br>Pre-Conventional<br>The pre-conventional level of moral reasoning is especially common in children, although adults can also exhibit this level of reasoning. Reasoners in the pre-conventional level judge the morality of an action by its direct consequences. The pre-conventional level consists of the first and second stage of moral development.<br><br>Stage one, individuals focus on the direct consequences that their actions will have for themselves. For example, they think that an action is morally wrong if the person who commits it gets punished.<br>Stage two espouses the what's in it for me position; right behavior being defined by what is in one's own best interest. Stage two reasoning shows a limited interest in the needs of others, but only to a point where it might further one's own interests, such as "you scratch my back, and I'll scratch yours." Concern for others is not based on loyalty or intrinsic respect in stage two.<br>[edit]<br>Conventional<br>The conventional level of moral reasoning is typical of adolescents and adults. Persons who reason in a conventional way judge the morality of actions by comparing these actions to social rules and expectations.<br><br>The conventional level consists of stages three and four of moral development.<br><br>In Stage three, individuals whose moral reasoning is in stage three seek approval from other people. They try to be a good boy or good girl having learned that there is inherent value in doing so. Stage three reasoning may judge the morality of an action by evaluating its consequences in terms of a person's relationships.<br>For Stage four, it is important to obey the laws and social conventions because of its importance to maintaining society. Moral reasoning in stage four is thus beyond the need for approval exhibited in stage three.<br>[edit]<br>Post-Conventional<br>The post-conventional level consists of stages five and six of moral development.<br><br>In Stage five, persons have certain principles to which they may attach more value than laws, such as human rights or social justice. In this reasoning, actions are wrong if they violate these ethical principles. Laws are regarded as social contracts rather than dictums, and must be changed when necessary (provided there is agreement). By this reasoning laws that do not promote general social welfare, should be changed. Democratic governments are ostensibly based on Stage five reasoning.<br>In Stage six, moral reasoning is based on the use of abstract reasoning using universal ethical principles. One way to do this is by imagining oneself in everyone else's shoes, imagining what they would decide if they were doing the same. While Kohlberg insisted that stage six exists, he had difficulty finding participants who use it. It appears that people rarely if ever reach stage six of Kohlberg's model.<br>[edit]<br>Other<br>Kohlberg also observed that there is a stage 4Â½ or 4+ which is a transition from stage four to stage five. This stage is where people have become disaffected with the arbitrary nature of law and order reasoning and become moral relativists. This transition stage may result in either progress to stage five or in regression to stage four.<br><br>Kohlberg further speculated that a seventh stage may exist (Transcendental Morality) which would link religion with moral reasoning (See James Fowler's stages of faith).<br><br>[edit]<br>Examples<br>Kohlberg used moral dilemmas to determine which stage of moral reasoning a person uses. The dilemmas are short stories in which a person has to make a moral decision. The participant is asked what this person should do. A dilemma that Kohlberg used in his original research was the druggist's dilemma:<br><br>A woman was near death from a unique kind of cancer. There is a drug that might save her. The drug costs $4,000 per dosage. The sick woman's husband, Heinz, went to everyone he knew to borrow the money and tried every legal means, but he could only get together about $2,000. He asked the doctor scientist who discovered the drug for a discount or let him pay later. But the doctor scientist refused.<br>Should Heinz break into the laboratory to steal the drug for his wife? Why or why not?<br>From a theoretical point of view, it is not important what the participant thinks that Heinz should do. The point of interest is the justification that the participant offers. Below are examples of possible arguments that belong to the six stages. It is important to keep in mind that these arguments are only examples. It is possible that a participant reaches a completely different conclusion using the same stage of reasoning:<br><br>Stage one (obedience): Heinz should not steal the medicine, because he will consequently be put in prison.<br>Stage two (self-interest): Heinz should steal the medicine, because he will be much happier if he saves his wife, even if he will have to serve a prison sentence.<br>Stage three (conformity): Heinz should steal the medicine, because his wife expects it.<br>Stage four (law-and-order): Heinz should not steal the medicine, because the law prohibits stealing.<br>Stage five (human rights): Heinz should steal the medicine, because everyone has a right to live, regardless of the law. Or: Heinz should not steal the medicine, because the scientist has a right to fair compensation.<br>Stage six (universal human ethics): Heinz should steal the medicine, because saving a human life is a more fundamental value than the property rights of another person. Or: Heinz should not steal the medicine, because that violates the golden rule of honesty and respect.<br>Stage seven (transcendental morality):Heinz should choose to spend more time with his wife in their remaining days, both acknowledging the cycle of life-and-death which is a part of the human condition. </strong><br></div>

But anyways, lets look at this biologically, lets say there is a gay gene, and since gays cant procreate, and most dont try to make a baby, then it would be very likely that this"gay gene" would be transferred to lesser people and so on so forth. But somehow, even through countless of centuries of not having children of thier own, gays continue to exist.<br><br>That is, if your definition of something natural is something inborn. But you see, even is the gene is heredity and sometimes only manifesting itself in some, then would the existence of the gene itself prove a point in the first place?<br><br>What im saying is that, homosexuality is a natural phenomenon, albeit not a very common one. Its like your talents within the community, u cant argue that champion swimmers arent natural can you? (Ok i know the comparison puts just make gays look good).<br><br>Homosexuality happens, it has been happening since ancient times, it has been happening between other animals, and i don't see why people are still arguing that it is against nature.<br><br>But then again, if you look at our biological strucure, you could say that homosexual act is not natural in that sense. But think again,our bodies weren't made for just typing in front of the computer on an online forum, neither was our body specifically made for jumping high up.Yet you still see people doing that. Wouldnt that be unnatural? Wouldnt doing anything and everything be unnatural then. Even sex with just the aim for pleasure is unnatural.But with that, you are just saying that the act is unnatural.<br><br>The thing is, to actually see whether certain parts brain is supposed to only function for heterosexual people and different ones for homosexuals. Till now, i donh't think theres any difference, and that is probably why they removed it from the list of mental conditions in the first place.<br><br>Nature does not mean common, if it was like that, then according to nature, we would all be born looking alike, with the same temprements and the same intellect.<br><br>And according to you, we should all just be savages, with no clothes, with our asses running wild and free.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>if homosexual marriages arent legalized, according to you, boy in blue, the homosexuals will then go get married and have children like other heterosexuals.<br><br>Then if it is legalized,more heterosexuals will turn gay? Look here, not all homosexuals are flaming queens (not that i have anything against flaming queens), most are still closet cases, not revealing thier sexualities due to discrimination. These are the people who would act straight, while having discreet sexual lives. And definitely, if being gay is accepted, i have no doubt that these "closet cases" would "come out." It wouldnt be because they were straight and found that being homosexual was more fashionable.<br><br>What im saying here is that people dont turn gay, because sexuality itself is innate, whether straight or gay.<br><br>now the question to ask here for all the straight people in this thread would be, if being gay was fashionable, would you turn gay? It would be asking if being a a woman was fashionable, would you as a man ,become one,and vice versa?<br><br>if not, i think you have just contradicted with yourself.<br><br>your statement that if being gay was accepted suddenly our world population would decline is just far too ridiculous. homosexuality presents far less a threat to our world population then the latex condom. For to human population to actually die out, we would all have to not reproduce for 3 generations.And thats with ignoring the idea that some gay couples actually do have children.<br><br>Its just that most of those who do adopt.<br><br>The funny thing is, why are you arguing on this when the world's population of 6 billion is still growing at an exponetial rate? There wasnt any significant difference in the population demographics in those countries when gay marriage was legalized there.<br><br>Im my opinion, the world could use a few more homos in any case, especially in china n india.<br><br>(srry for long post)</div>
