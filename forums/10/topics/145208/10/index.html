And they regularly organised trips to visit the socially marginalised individuals in our society. However, since most gays are affluent to begin with, these money does not go to further a gay cause.

Never. It did incur the wrath of some gays within the community.

I've deleted that email. If you are interested to read more, I will go find from the mailing list.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Atobe:</div><div class="quote_body">Society and country can move forth if gays can understand that it is against the order of nature for such attitudes to be cultivated and accepted, and the consequence that blight society and country is in the incurable disease such as AIDS - and what other mutated forms that will follow. </div></blockquote>Ah, the idea of "order of nature" comes out again. We have tonnes of studies to show that homosexuals behaviours are found in many many animal species.. Will share just one article with you later.<br><br>And AIDS is not exclusively gays problem. In Singapore, 70% of HIV positive are straights. AIDS does not discriminate sexual orientation. As long as you are faithful to a single parent (no matter whether you are gay or straigt), you will have a lower chance to contact AIDS. WIll share something from APA later..<br><br></div>

Wallabies do it. Even penguins and dolphins in the sea do it. They all engage in homosexual activity.<br><br>Dr Geoff MacFarlane, a lecturer in biological sciences at the University of Newcastle, said it had been argued that sexual behaviour between members of the same sex was against the laws of nature, and unusual or deviant in wild animals. But recent scientific evidence "forcefully demolishes these assumptions ".<br><br>Dr MacFarlane, who will give a public lecture on the topic tomorrow in Sydney, said more than 450 species worldwide had been identified as exhibiting some homosexual behaviour. This included 25 mammal and 45 bird species from Australia, New Zealand and Antarctica.<br><br>The most frequent occurrence was in bonobos, or pygmy chimpanzees. About 50 per cent of their sexual encounters were between the same sex, he wrote in an article with a colleague, Dr Kevin Markwell, published in the journal Nature Australia.<br><br>Dr MacFarlane said female-female mounting had been observed in koalas, sometimes accompanied by distinct sexual behaviour such as holding the nape of the neck in the jaws and performing pelvic thrusts.<br><br>Advertisement<br><br>Advertisement<br>Female redneck wallabies also mounted each other on occasions, as did male Agile wallabies.<br><br>As well, "wild bottlenose dolphins can form long-lasting male-male pair bonds", he said.<br><br>And male Adelie penguins have also been seen mounting each other, taking turns to reverse their positions.<br><br>Dr MacFarlane said that in the past, instances of homosexual behaviour in animals may have been "ignored, dismissed or misinterpreted by scientists due to a moral, religious or biological bias". There had also been a tendency to explain them away as just play, or practice for later heterosexual encounters.<br><br>He said the homosexual activity, which few animals engaged in exclusively, could be linked to a genetic tendency for heightened sexual activity, giving the animals a reproductive advantage, or it could have social benefits such as reducing tension, aggression , and promoting alliances.</strong><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This is taken from APA. To resolve the issue of HIV, the whole nation must see it as a disease that will affect everyone and anyone. There's an active group of volunteers within the gay community trying to help spread the importance of prevention. Other groups are also trying to get their hands dirty. The ministry must eventually help educate the people rather than by pushing the blames to gays.<br><br><strong>Are All Gay and Bisexual Men HIV Infected?<br><br>No. This is a commonly held myth. In reality, the risk of exposure to HIV is related to a person's behavior, not their sexual orientation. What's important to remember about HIV/AIDS is it is a preventable disease through the use of safe sex practices and by not using drugs. </strong><br><br></div>

Gay can be also used as a plural collective-like noun: "Gays are opposed to that policy", but this use is rare and deprecated.

It goes to show that we are indeed trying to discuss political issues here. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> Will address some of your concerns here and leave the others till tomorrow. </strong></blockquote>Are these gay issues that you have brought up 'POLITICAL' ?<br><br>Do you understand what does the term 'POLITICS' mean ?<br><blockquote>:<strong><br>Nope.. It's a gay Pride month.. To celebrate the Arts, the Sports, the PRIDE of being a Singaporean.. This is not exactly gay rights movement per se.. Since the society is not ready for it yet.. </strong></blockquote>It does not take too much imagination for the INTENT of the movement is to get social acceptance to this 'unfortunately un-natural' behavior of a group of individuals, who happen to have 'unusual' preferences and value systems.<br><br>If society can condone and accept such 'un-natural' behaviour and value systems, it merely open the doors to subvert the next generation, who are natural.<br><br>Why not at the same time liberalise to allow all age groups to freely access and watch pornography - encouraging fantasies of heterosexual romps, homosexualism, lesbianism, human-animal sexualism, sadism, masochism, and even with the occult ?<br><blockquote>:<strong><br>Err.. I dont think u follow the recent HDB rules that closely.. There are some specifics which help "2 singles" to buy flats more easily.. Why would "2 singles" want to share a flat in the first place.. I will post that article later.. </strong></blockquote>Desparation will lead one to twist and snatch thin straws from the air to strengthen one's position.<br><br>This HDB rules were made flexible with not intention of specifically benefitting the Homosexual and Lesbian community, but were targetted at young Singaporeans, who prefer not to commit themselves into a legal knot through legal marriage - and all done to help HDB to rid the large overstock of HDB flats that have been accumulated.<br><br>Try harder to convince anyone that this HDB rule was specifically targetted for the benefit of the Homosexual and Lesbian Community.<br><blockquote>:<strong><br>Last year, LHL announced that all indoor talks do not have to apply for license anymore, except for talks on religions and races..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> Which is a move to give more freedom to the people.. See, they are more worried about religious fanatics and racial extremists than gays.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> Will try to post the article on this if I can find.. =p </strong></blockquote>Again, unless LHL is a firm liberal and supporter to the Homosexual and Lesbian Community, this Rule was merely to facilitate his goal of creating a freer political society, and defuse the pent up political emotion by allowing Singaporeans an opening to vent their feelings.<br><br>Again, you and your Homosexual-Lesbian Community have simply been handed an opportunity that was not intended for your kind of activities, which will undoubtedly be watched over by the Police - who are also watching those who are political vocal at such indoor talks.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>If two HUMANS from the SAME SEX can be effective in child-bearing activities to achieve Singapore's national goal, surely it will not tax the national resources to provide tax rebates to such unions by mono-sexual marriages by those inclined to being homosexuals or lesbians ?</blockquote>Ah.. I believe most gays have accepted the fact that they cant procreate.. because, as a human being, you do not have sex just to procreate.. sex is a form of showing your love and affections.. how do u make yourself have sex with someone you do not love?<br><br>What I'm arguing is that there is an equal need for gays to have a roof over the head. Just imagine if you are married and you need to have an apartment for yourself. Of course, this is related to your other point which I will address next.<br><br><blockquote>Are homosexuals and lesbians the only Singaporeans being labelled singles ?<br><br>There remain a larger number of males and females - who are NOT homosexuals or lesbians, and continue to be SINGLE; and individually or as a group, they will contribute as much or even more then the homosexual and lesbian community; and yet will require less from the State in terms of MEDICAL HELP or HOUSING.</blockquote>Yes, that's why homosexuals should be differentiated from singles. For homosexuals, there are many who are into a dyad, monogamous relationship, which is what the society accept as a marriage. Of course, we have to take one step at a time. 4 countries so far, have given gays the equal rights in marriage: Spain, Holland, Belgium and Canada. Other countries like UK have civil partnership arrangement to allow gays to form an union.<br><br>Why housing is important has been addressed in my earlier paragraph. If 2 persons come together, they will want to build their own place. Currently, this might be one of the main reason why relationships in gay comm is not long lasting. Because it's tough to build a shared life without a place of your own to start with.<br><br>As for medical help. I will talk about it in the next paragraph.<br><br><blockquote>What I'm arguing is that<br>The many Government incentives afforded to there NORMAL Singapore SINGLES are intended to "push" these individuals into legal union, so as to be able to fulfill their natural role of procreation.<br><br>Surely, this role is better suited for NORMAL HUMANS who do not indulge into deviant 'GAY' fantasies of fulfillment ?</blockquote>APA has removed homosexuality from their list of mental illness since decades ago. I've stated that in quite a number of articles previously. I will post again. Even China had removed the homosexuality from their own list and decriminalised gays 5 years back. Again, this can be found in an earlier article I've posted.<br><br>All in all, gays are not seen as "abnormal" in psychiatric terms anymore. However, there's still a great deal of stigmatisation and discrimination against the gay comm.. It will take some more time for people to finally understand and to be aware of these issues.<br><br>As for the idea on procreation. Are you going to say that those people who remain single (straights), those who cannot reproduce, those who would rather not reproduce as less patriotic?<br><br>As for your point about fantasies, are you arguing that straights do not have sexual fantasies? Why is Patpong so popular? Why is geylang sex industry still surviving?</div>

Furthermore, the usage of any word changes dramatically as the culture in which it is embedded changes.<br><br>The word gay has had a sexual orientation meaning since at least the nineteenth century, and possibly earlier.<br><br>A quote from Gertrude Stein's Miss Furr &amp; Mrs. Skeene (1922) is possibly the first traceable use of the word, though it is not altogether clear whether she uses the word to mean lesbianism or happiness:<br><br>They were ...gay, they learned little things that are things in being gay, ... they were quite regularly gay.<br>Noel Coward's 1929 musical Bitter Sweet has the first uncontested use of the word: in the song "Green Carnation", four overdressed, 1890s dandies sing:<br><br>Pretty boys, witty boys, You may sneer<br>At our disintegration.<br>Haughty boys, naughty boys,<br>Dear, dear, dear!<br>Swooning with affectation...<br>And as we are the reason<br>For the "Nineties" being gay,<br>We all wear a green carnation.<br>Coward uses the "gay nineties" as a double entendre. The song title alludes to the gay playwright Oscar Wilde, who famously wore a green carnation himself.<br><br>Gay was originally used purely as an adjective ("he is a gay man" or "he is gay"). Gay can be also used as a plural collective-like noun: "Gays are opposed to that policy", but this use is rare and deprecated. It is rarely as a singular noun "he is a gay" and sounds unusual in this context, hence its use by the Little Britain comedy character Daffyd Thomas (a gay man who believes himself "the only gay in the village" despite abundant evidence to the contrary).<br><br>By 1963, the word was known well enough by the straight community to be used by Albert Ellis in his book The Intelligent Woman's Guide to Man-Hunting.</strong><br><br>No one knows precisly how the term came about the describe homosexuals. But then is it an important question to ask? What about "woman"? and "female"? both having to use man and male as if man is the dominant sex and woman need to take reference from man? shouldn't we change the terms? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> especially when science has shown that we are all female at one stage of our lives before our external genetalia was formed..<br><br>I'm not arguing for any changes in terms, of couse.. words came about in very strange manner.. What's important is how we use it and how other people have come about to learn it and to understand what it means. If "Gay" is used as a term to describe people who engage in homosexual activities and the society in large has accepted it's usage, why change?<br><br><span style="color: darkblue;">From the following referenced site:</span><br><a href="http://www.brainyencyclopedia.com/encyclopedia/h/ho/homosexuality.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.brainyencyclopedia.com/encyclopedia/h/ho/homosexuality.html</a><br><br><span style="color: blue;">The term homosexuality appears in print for the first time in 1869 in an anonymous German pamphlet 143 des Preussischen Strafgesetzbuchs und seine Aufrechterhaltung als 152 des Entwurfs eines Strafgesetzbuchs fÃ¼r den Norddeutschen Bund ("Paragraph 143 of the Prussian Penal Code and Its Maintenance as Paragraph 152 of the Draft of a Penal Code for the North German Confederation") written by Karl Maria Kertbeny. This pamphlet advocated the repeal of Prussia's sodomy laws (Bullough et. al. ed. (1996)). Kertbeny had previously used the word in a private letter of 1868 written to Karl Heinrich Ulrichs. Kertbeny used HomosexualitÃ¤t in place of Ulrichs's Urningtum; Homosexualisten instead of Unringe, and Homosexualistinnen instead of Urninden. The term was first used in English by Charles Gilbert Chaddock in his translation of Richard von Krafft-Ebing's Psychopathia Sexualis'', a study on deviant sexual practices, and was popularized in the 1906 Harden-Eulenburg affair.<br><br>The word homosexual translates literally as "of the same sex," being a hybrid of the Greek prefix homo- meaning "same" (as distinguished from the Latin root homo meaning human) and the Latin root sex meaning "sex." Although some early writers used the adjective homosexual to refer to any single-gender context (such as the Roman Catholic clergy or an all-girls' school), today the term implies a sexual aspect, and the term homosocial is used for single-sex contexts that are not specifically sexual. Older words for homosexuality, such as homophilia and inversion have fallen into disuse.</span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="color: brown;">Western people who regard themselves as having a same-gender sexual orientation tend to prefer the terms gay and lesbian</span>;</span> <span style="color: blue;">the latter term (noun or adjective) refers specifically to women. The term gay can apply to both men and women, but it is often used only for males (hence the expressions gays and lesbians and gay men and lesbians) and its inclusive use is common but not standard. Other terms include same-gender-loving, and same-sex-oriented. Less frequently, the terms queer, homo, and fag or faggot, and dyke are used positively among gay men and lesbians; these terms may be considered derogatory when used by non-gays. </span><br><br><span style="color: darkblue;">So why not simply call a stick, simply a stick ?<br><br>Let us not mislead those kids - who are normally sexually inclined - into thinking that it is GAY to be homosexual, or to be a lesbian.</span><br><blockquote>Originally posted by earthlings73:<strong><br>Quoted from Atobe's post:<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Is it in the order of Nature for two HUMANS from the SAME SEX to be united?<br><br>If it is intended by Nature for two HUMANS from the SAME SEX to be sexually united for the continued process of renewal of human-kind, then humans should have taken the form of being amoeba or protozoa. </span></strong></blockquote><strong>I've addressed this question earlier.

Such individuals are called zoophiles. The more recent terms zoosexual and zoosexuality also describe the full spectrum of human/animal attraction. A separate term, bestiality (more common in mainstream usage), refers to human/animal sexual activity. To avoid confusion about the meaning of zoophilia Â– which may refer to the dictionary definition, paraphilia, or sexual activity Â– this article uses zoophilia for the former, and zoosexuality for the sexual act. The two terms are independent: not all sexual acts with animals are performed by zoophiles, and not all zoophiles engage in sexual activity.<br><br>Zoophilia is usually considered to be unnatural, and sexual acts with animals are often condemned as animal abuse and/or outlawed as "crimes against nature". However, some, such as philosopher and animal rights author Peter Singer, argue that this is not inherently the case.<br><br>The activity or desire itself is no longer classified as a pathology under DSM-IV (TR) (the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the American Psychiatric Association) unless accompanied by distress or interference with normal functioning on the part of the person. Critics point out that that DSM-IV opinion says nothing about the well being of the animal; defenders, on the other hand, argue that a human/animal relationship can go far beyond sexuality, and that animals are capable of forming what is claimed to be a loving relationship that can last for years, and they do not consider it functionally different from any other love/sex relationship.</strong><br><br>It depends on whether you see the animal involved as having a conscience, rights of their own..

It is customary to refer to persons exhibiting what we could call sexual deviations, or departures from what modern society agrees to be normal, as sex perverts. Thus many persons, otherwise well informed in their own minds, have categorised and speak of them casually as perverts, sexual psychopaths, sex neurotics and so on, often without understanding very clearly the condition to which they refer. Our social customs seem to compel society to look upon a sex deviant as one bringing disgrace to his family.<br><br>Sex deviations such as homosexuality, bisexuality, transvestism have long been taboo subjects rarely brought up in polite conversation by respectable society. Strange as it may seem, teenagers today however are far more well-informed and open minded in their views on this subject.<br><br>More often than not, one associates the word 'homosexual' with effeminate men or men in drag. This is the stereotypical image of homosexuality that, like most stereotypes, conveniently obscures its complexity.<br><br>The word 'homosexuality' applies to people who are sexually and emotionally attracted to others of the same sex. Both men and women can be called 'homosexual' or 'gay', but these are only umbrella terms under which lie many shades of distinctions.<br><br>Broadly speaking, homosexuals comprise gay men, transvestites (both male and female), trans-sexuals (female and male) and lesbians.<br><br>And to complicate things further, there is a very fine distinction between the interchangable terms, 'transvestite' and 'trans-sexual'. As most dictionaries explain it, a transvestite is a person who dresses in the clothes of the opposite sex, often deriving gratification from this practice.<br><br>On the other hand, a trans-sexual is (as commonly understood) someone who has decided to live as a person of the opposite sex. Sometimes, a trans-sexual's identification with the opposite sex is so strong that he or she goes for a sex-change operation.<br><br>Some people who practise transvestism may not be gay; they may just enjoy wearing the clothes of the opposite sex without being sexually attracted to members of the same sex.<br><br>A gay is attracted to men of his own kind- gays, and not 'straight' men. When asked why a normal looking man would fall in love with another, he would say that there is nothing abnormal about him. Most people however find it difficult to accept gays as normal people.<br><br>Transvestites and trans-sexuals, on the other hand, consider themselves, and are considered by the gay community, as women. They generally feel that they are women trapped in male bodies. And as women, they are attracted to straight men, and not to gay man.<br><br>The world is indeed very much a lonely and hostile place for transvestites and trans-sexuals. It is difficult for them to have meaningful relationships as very few straight men are willing to face the social stigma and emotional hassles that come with having a transvertite partner.<br><br>What causes a person to be gay? According to some researchers, sexual and emotional attraction for a partner of the same sex may be a genetic trait, although social factors and upbringing are also thought to play a role. Homosexuality is not a medical or psychiatric disorder, although regarded as abnormal by many. Homosexuality was removed from the list of mental disorders in the early 1970s when it was obvious that homosexuals are as psychologically welladjusted as heterosexuals are. They have the same capacity to function in society, to achieve goals, to have their needs met, and to develop a sense of identity.<br><br>However, transvestism is considered a mental disorder, as transvestites have the feeling of being trapped in a man's body, causing a lot of inner turmoil, whereas gay men are totally comfortable with their maleness.<br><br>Although homosexuals may have accepted their sexual orientation, society may not be ready to accept them. They may be prepared to share their thoughts and feelings with family members and close friends, but not so in public. A homosexual person may go through several stages before coming to terms with himself or herself. They probably can't do anything about their 'condition', and we should not contribute to the prevailing social pressure that forces many of them to hide their true selves in the closet. From the Buddhist point of view this kind of sexual act can be regarded as sexual misconduct to those who try to renounce sensual pleasure in order to lead a holy life. For others this can be regarded as sex abuse. </span></span><br><br><strong>Human Life and Problems - Buddhism Perspective</strong><br><a href="http://www.buddhanet.net/budsas/ebud/life/life-02.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.buddhanet.net/budsas/ebud/life/life-02.htm</a><br><br><strong>Homosexuality and Theravada Buddhism</strong><br><a href="http://www.buddhanet.net/homosexu.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.buddhanet.net/homosexu.htm</a><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Let's look at AIDS:<br><br><strong>AIDS is thought to have originated in sub-Saharan Africa during the twentieth century<br><br>Two species of HIV infect humans: HIV-1 and HIV-2. HIV-1 is more virulent and more easily transmitted. HIV-1 is the source of the majority of HIV infections throughout the world, while HIV-2 is less easily transmitted and is largely confined to West Africa. [1]<br><br>Both species of the virus (HIV-1 and HIV-2) are believed to have originated in West-Central Africa and jumped species (zoonosis) from primates to humans. HIV-1 evolved from a Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIVcpz) found in the chimpanzee subspecies Pan troglodytes troglodytes. [2] DNA sequencing indicates that HIV-1 (group M) entered the human population in the early 20th century, probably sometime between 1915 and 1941. [3] [4] HIV-2 crossed species from a different strain of SIV, this one found in sooty mangabeys (an Old World monkey) of Guinea-Bissau. [5]<br><br>The earliest documented HIV-1 infection dates from 1959, and was discovered in the preserved blood sample of a man from Kinshasa in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.[6] In 1969, a 15-year-old African-American male died at the St. Louis City Hospital from aggressive Kaposi's sarcoma. AIDS was suspected as early as 1988, and in 1999, researchers at Tulane University School of Medicine confirmed this, finding HIV-1 in his preserved blood and tissues. [7] [8] [9]<br><br>In 1976, a Norwegian sailor, his wife, and his nine-year-old daughter died of AIDS. The sailor had first presented symptoms in 1966, four years after he had spent time in ports along the West African coastline. Tissue samples from the sailor and his wife were tested in 1988 and found to contain the HIV-1 virus (Group O). [10] [11] The next documented western death from AIDS was that of Dr. Grethe Rask in 1977. Rask, a Danish surgeon, had worked in the Congo in the early 1970s.<br><br>The official date for the beginning of the AIDS epidemic is marked as June 18, 1981, when the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported in its Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report newsletter that unusual clusters of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia had been discovered in gay men in Los Angeles in the early 1980s. [12] Over the next eighteen months, more Pneumocystis carinii clusters were discovered among otherwise healthy men in cities throughout the country, along with other opportunistic diseases (such as Kaposi's sarcoma [13] and lymphadenopathy [14]), common in immunosuppressed patients.<br><br>In June 1982, a report of a group of cases amongst gay men in Southern California suggested that a sexually transmitted infectious agent might be the etiological agent (MMWR Weekly, 1982) and was initially termed 'GRID' (Gay Related Immune Deficiency). However, the same opportunistic infections also began to be reported among hemophiliacs [15], heterosexual IV drug users, and Haitian immigrants [16]. By August 1982, the disease was being referred to by it's new name of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) (Marx et al., 1982). An anagram of AIDS, SIDA, was then created for use in French (Syndrome d'Immuno-DÃ©ficience Acquise) and Spanish (SÃ­ndrome de Inmunodeficiencia Adquirida) (Direction GÃ©nÃ©rale De La SantÃ©, 1982).<br><br>In May 1983, doctors at the Institute Pasteur in France reported that they had isolated a new retrovirus from lymphoid ganglions that they believed was the cause of SIDA (Barre-Sinoussi et al., 1983). The virus was later named lymphadenopathy-associated virus (LAV) and a sample was sent to the CDC, which was later passed to the National Cancer Institute, USA (Connor and Kingman, 198<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">. In May 1984, Dr Robert Gallo of the National Cancer Institute also isolated a virus that caused AIDS, and named it Human T-cell Lymphotropic Virus-III (HTLV-III) (Popovic et al., 1984). In January 1985 a number of more detailed reports were published concerning LAV and HTLV-III, and by March it was clear that the viruses were the same, from the same source, and was the etiological agent of AIDS (Marx, 1985; Chang et al., 1993). In May 1986, the International Committee on the Taxonomy of Viruses ruled that both names should be dropped and a new name, HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus), be used (Coffin et al., 1986).</strong><br><br>This is a disease pass from the chimps to us. This point is clear..<br><br>However, what's no clear is how this jump took place.. Through sex? air-borned? through food contamination? We know that the medium through which a disease spread among the animals should be differentiated between a disease spread cross species.. even though in the human species, the disease is spread through sex and blood infusion.. It does not mean that the "jump" across species is through sexual activities too (or at least no scientists have demonstrated that yet)..<br><br>There have been multi-carriers to different parts of the world.. The idea that the first documented case of AIDS is in gays has not been proven.. The first case in US is most likely through the gay community.. But that's just US.. Along the way (or even before the first documented case in US), it's not definitely through the gay community..<br><br>THis is the global plague of our century.. Blaming the gays but not addressing how to contain will not get us any where..</div>

The Chinese government need to address this issue separately..<br><br>In fact, their position is not dissimilar from the article I've posted earlier.. About the conference to be held in Malaysia..<br><br>However, China had decriminalised gays 5 years ago.. This is the first step towards a more tolerant society.. Yes, we cannot expect all Chinese to suddenly accept homosexuality as part of the sexual continuum.. However, this is just the first step.. It will take another 10 or 20 years for the society to learn and to understand..<br><br>In order for the society to learn.. there must voices from the gay comm must be heard (which incidentally is the same position of the article you have posted).. if the gay comm is constanly ignored.. the root of the problem will not be addressed.. and the HIV spread will still continue..<br><br>Locally, there are gays who volunteered their time at AFA to help promote safe sex.. This group functions independently from the rest of the groups.. so that gays can be targetted for "practice safe sex" (anti casual sex, use condom, regular screening for AIDS, etc) campaign..</div>

Can you try explaining the presence of gay Chinese emperors in history?<br><br>I feel that the present attitude towards gays is a by-product of the turbulent 1960s era of counterculture. Back then, Singapore had just become independent and LKY was seeking to eliminate all elements of European (or Birtish) influence on Singapore. Since it was fashionable during the flower-power Beatles era to be gay, it was seen as blindly aping the West, which by then, had fallen into decadence. The anti-colonial mindset that everything from the West was terrible has more or less been indoctrinated into subsequent generations.</div>
