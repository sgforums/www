Homosexuality means liking or loving someone of the same gender. Your saying that it is not natural because sex is a conscious act is like saying its not natural to be straight either because sex is a conscious act. So u're saying that attraction to same sex is not controllable but one can control having sex with the same sex? Then why dun straight people control themselves also? Why should people with an uncontrollable attraction to the opposite gender go ahead and have sex while people who have an uncontrollable attraction to the same gender control themselves? Double standards? Hypocrisy? Heterosexualism? This is just downright disgusting, this sort of double standards. Homosexuality does not refer to homosexual acts. Homosexuality refers to a person being attracted to another person of the same gender. I'm surprised u cannot differentiate distinctly between the 2 different terms and their definations. That again is your fallacy, and where your argument flounders because u don't even understand the terms and definations. And since u've agreed that attraction to the same gender is uncontrollable, u've effectly agreed that homosexuality is natural. End of discussion. Of course u can say more and show yourself to be a sore loser. I'd like that very much. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

HIV-1 is more virulent and more easily transmitted. HIV-1 is the source of the majority of HIV infections throughout the world, while HIV-2 is less easily transmitted and is largely confined to West Africa. [1]<br><br>Both species of the virus (HIV-1 and HIV-2) are believed to have originated in West-Central Africa and jumped species (zoonosis) from primates to humans. HIV-1 evolved from a Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIVcpz) found in the chimpanzee subspecies Pan troglodytes troglodytes. [2] DNA sequencing indicates that HIV-1 (group M) entered the human population in the early 20th century, probably sometime between 1915 and 1941. [3] [4] HIV-2 crossed species from a different strain of SIV, this one found in sooty mangabeys (an Old World monkey) of Guinea-Bissau. [5]<br><br>The earliest documented HIV-1 infection dates from 1959, and was discovered in the preserved blood sample of a man from Kinshasa in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.[6] In 1969, a 15-year-old African-American male died at the St. Louis City Hospital from aggressive Kaposi's sarcoma. AIDS was suspected as early as 1988, and in 1999, researchers at Tulane University School of Medicine confirmed this, finding HIV-1 in his preserved blood and tissues. [7] [8] [9]<br><br>In 1976, a Norwegian sailor, his wife, and his nine-year-old daughter died of AIDS. The sailor had first presented symptoms in 1966, four years after he had spent time in ports along the West African coastline. Tissue samples from the sailor and his wife were tested in 1988 and found to contain the HIV-1 virus (Group O). [10] [11] The next documented western death from AIDS was that of Dr. Grethe Rask in 1977. Rask, a Danish surgeon, had worked in the Congo in the early 1970s.<br><br>The official date for the beginning of the AIDS epidemic is marked as June 18, 1981, when the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported in its Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report newsletter that unusual clusters of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia had been discovered in gay men in Los Angeles in the early 1980s. [12] Over the next eighteen months, more Pneumocystis carinii clusters were discovered among otherwise healthy men in cities throughout the country, along with other opportunistic diseases (such as Kaposi's sarcoma [13] and lymphadenopathy [14]), common in immunosuppressed patients.<br><br>In June 1982, a report of a group of cases amongst gay men in Southern California suggested that a sexually transmitted infectious agent might be the etiological agent (MMWR Weekly, 1982) and was initially termed 'GRID' (Gay Related Immune Deficiency). However, the same opportunistic infections also began to be reported among hemophiliacs [15], heterosexual IV drug users, and Haitian immigrants [16]. By August 1982, the disease was being referred to by it's new name of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) (Marx et al., 1982). An anagram of AIDS, SIDA, was then created for use in French (Syndrome d'Immuno-DÃ©ficience Acquise) and Spanish (SÃ­ndrome de Inmunodeficiencia Adquirida) (Direction GÃ©nÃ©rale De La SantÃ©, 1982).<br><br>In May 1983, doctors at the Institute Pasteur in France reported that they had isolated a new retrovirus from lymphoid ganglions that they believed was the cause of SIDA (Barre-Sinoussi et al., 1983). The virus was later named lymphadenopathy-associated virus (LAV) and a sample was sent to the CDC, which was later passed to the National Cancer Institute, USA (Connor and Kingman, 198<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">. In May 1984, Dr Robert Gallo of the National Cancer Institute also isolated a virus that caused AIDS, and named it Human T-cell Lymphotropic Virus-III (HTLV-III) (Popovic et al., 1984). In January 1985 a number of more detailed reports were published concerning LAV and HTLV-III, and by March it was clear that the viruses were the same, from the same source, and was the etiological agent of AIDS (Marx, 1985; Chang et al., 1993). In May 1986, the International Committee on the Taxonomy of Viruses ruled that both names should be dropped and a new name, HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus), be used (Coffin et al., 1986).</strong><br><br>This is a disease pass from the chimps to us. This point is clear..<br><br>However, what's no clear is how this jump took place.. Through sex? air-borned? through food contamination? We know that the medium through which a disease spread among the animals should be differentiated between a disease spread cross species.. even though in the human species, the disease is spread through sex and blood infusion.. It does not mean that the "jump" across species is through sexual activities too (or at least no scientists have demonstrated that yet)..<br><br>There have been multi-carriers to different parts of the world.. The idea that the first documented case of AIDS is in gays has not been proven.. <span style="color: red;"><strong>The first case in US is most likely through the gay community.. But that's just US..</strong></span> Along the way (or even before the first documented case in US), it's not definitely through the gay community..<br><br>THis is the global plague of our century.. Blaming the gays but not addressing how to contain will not get us any where..[/b]</blockquote>The speculation had been that AIDS had originally infected the sub-species - like the apes, which happened to be in the food chain of the African diet.<br><br>It is acknowledged that Africa is the source of AIDS from which maritime workers first caught the disease and spread it unwittingly through the continents.<br><br>However, when AIDS was first detected, it was the HOMOSEXUAL (not the LESBIAN nor the HETEROSEXUAL) community which had the highest detection rate of AIDS sufferers.<br><br>It was only when knowledge and understanding of AIDS became more intense that more discoveries from the HETEROSEXUAL community were made, but still the LESBIAN community do not seem to be so badly infected - UNLESS the Lesbians had sexual relations with infected males.<br><br><strong><span style="color: blue;">Try reading this article that is dated 25 August 2005 :</span> </strong> - the following is only a partial extract from the publication:<br><br><strong><span style="color: red;">The Negative Health Effects of Homosexuality</span></strong><br><a href="http://www.frc.org/get.cfm?i=IS01B1&amp;v=PRINT" rel="nofollow">http://www.frc.org/get.cfm?i=IS01B1&amp;v=PRINT</a><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Gay Bowel Syndrome (GBS):[32] The Journal of the American Medical Association refers to GBS problems such as proctitis, proctocolitis, and enteritis as "sexually transmitted gastrointestinal syndromes."[33] Many of the bacterial and protozoa pathogens that cause gbs are found in feces and transmitted to the digestive system: According to the pro-homosexual text Anal Pleasure and Health, "[s]exual activities provide many opportunities for tiny amounts of contaminated feces to find their way into the mouth of a sexual partner . . . The most direct route is oral-anal contact."[34]<br><br>Â·  Proctitis and Proctocolitis are inflammations of the rectum and colon that cause pain, bloody rectal discharge and rectal spasms. Proctitis is associated with STDs such as gonorrhea, chlamydia, herpes, and syphilis that are widespread among homosexuals.[35] The Sexually Transmitted Disease Information Center of the Journal of the American Medical Association reports that "[p]roctitis occurs predominantly among persons who participate in anal intercourse."</span><br><br></div>

Using the term heterosexism highlights the parallels between antigay sentiment and other forms of prejudice, such as racism, antisemitism, and sexism.<br>Like institutional racism and sexism, heterosexism pervades societal customs and institutions. It operates through a dual process of invisibility and attack. Homosexuality usually remains culturally invisible; when people who engage in homosexual behavior or who are identified as homosexual become visible, they are subject to attack by society.<br><br>Examples of heterosexism in the United States include the continuing ban against lesbian and gay military personnel; widespread lack of legal protection from antigay discrimination in employment, housing, and services; hostility to lesbian and gay committed relationships, recently dramatized by passage of federal and state laws against same-gender marriage; and the existence of sodomy laws in more than one-third of the states.<br><br>Although usage of the two words has not been uniform, homophobia has typically been employed to describe individual antigay attitudes and behaviors whereas heterosexism has referred to societal-level ideologies and patterns of institutionalized oppression of non-heterosexual people. </strong><br><br>And she did not psychoanalyse you..

How did you manage to come to this conclusion while reading the website you had posted?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>But thanks for highlighting this website.. =p Some excerpts from the website:<br><br><strong>Same-sex love was celebrated in Chinese art, many examples of which have survived the book burnings of the Cultural Revolution. Though no large statues are known to still exist, many hand scrolls and paintings on silk can be found in private collections[2].<br><br>In the year 1944, the scholar Sun Cizhou published a work stated that one of the most famous ancient Chinese poets, Qu Yuan, was a lover of his King. Sun cited the poetry of Qu Yuan to prove his claim. In Qu Yuan's most important work Li Sao (Sorrow of parting), Qu Yuan called himself a beautiful man (or woman, mei ren). A word he used to describe his king was used at that time by women to characterize their lovers.<br><br>Since the policy of Reform and Opening Up in 1979, the communist party has been loosening its control over this kind of behavior. But the practice of homosexuality is still libeled as a "moldering life style of capitalism".<br><br>A notable change occurred during the late 1990s and early 2000s, when sodomy was decriminalized in 1997, and the new Chinese Classification and Diagnostic Criteria of Mental Disorders removed homosexuality from its list of mental illnesses on April 20, 2001. The situation has continued to evolve in 2004. Many consider the magazine "Menbox" [3] to be a gay magazine in all but name. Recently, a transsexual woman, Chen Lili was allowed to compete in the China selection pageant for the Miss Universe competition.<br><br>An internet survey in 2000 showed that Chinese people are becoming more tolerant towards homosexuality: among the 10,792 surveyed, 48.15% were in favor, 30.9% disapproved, 14.46% were uncertain, and 7.26% were indifferent. There are no radical conservatives or radical liberation activists, so gay-bashing is rare. But some scholars complain that the government is too indifferent on this issue, doing nothing to promote the situation of homosexuality in China. During the 2002 Gay Games, only 2 persons from the mainland were sent to take part in, and apart from gay websites the media gave little coverage to the event. Many gay men admit having unsafe sex, and more than one sex partner, which worsens the spread of AIDS in China, because the Chinese government makes little effort to educate citizens about the danger of AIDS among gay people. The authorities still refuse to promote either gay issues or gay rights in China. Although there is no explicit law against homosexuality or same-sex acts between consenting adults, neither are there laws protecting gays from discrimination, nor are there any gay rights organizations in the PRC.</strong><br><br>I do not disagree with you on certain principles:<br><br>To address the issue, you have to recognise the issue. I have posted the article about Asia-Pac's efforts to recognise the need to address that special efforts need to be targetted at the gay comm. But then, to address this, the government need to realise that there are gays in the society, which is by itself an affirmation of the existence of gays. But then, it's important to educate gays about safe sex practices.<br><br>But I disagree with you on one issue:<br><br>The position from accepting that there are gays and special efforts are needed to address the issue do not mean that they are targetting at changing their orientation.. This is a logical leap.. Nothing in the article I've read suggested such a stand at all..</div>

According the scholar Ji Yun of the Qing Dynasty, already at the very beginning Huang Di (The Yellow Emperor, 2697? - 2597? BCE), legendary king and founder of the Chinese culture, had male lovers. This is naturally not very trustworthy because whether there was really a person called Huang Di is not very clear. Two notable royal examples come from a formulaic expression, yÃƒÂºtÃƒÂ¡o duÃƒ nxiÃƒÂ¹ (Ã¤Â½Â™Ã¦Â¡ÂƒÃ¦Â–Â­Ã¨Â¢Â–). YÃƒÂºtÃƒÂ¡o, or "the leftover peach", recorded in Hanfeizi, speaks of Mi Zixia (Ã¥Â½ÂŒÃ¥Â­Â�Ã§Â‘Â•), a beautiful youth cherished by Duke Ling of Wei (Ã¨Â¡Â›Ã©Â�ÂˆÃ¥Â…Â¬) who once shared an already bitten but very delicious peach with the duke, who appreciated the gesture (although once the growing Mi Zixia lost his beauty, the duke looked back on this event and said Mi was being insincere [1].) DuÃƒ nxiÃƒÂ¹, or "breaking the sleeve", refers to Emperor Ai of Han China's act of cutting his sleeve, on which his adored male concubine Dongxian (Ã¨Â‘Â£Ã¨Â³Â¢) was sleeping, in order not to wake him.<br><br>Scholar Pan Guangdan (Ã¦Â½Â˜Ã¥Â…Â‰Ã¦Â—Â¦) came to the conclusion that nearly every emperor in the Han Dynasty had one or more male sex partners. There are also descriptions of lesbians in some history books. It is believed homosexuality was popular in the Song, Ming and Qing dynasties. Chinese homosexuals did not experience high-profile persecution comparing with that was received by homosexuals in Europe during the Middle Ages.</strong><br><br>Then, China borrowed the values/morals from the West, which includes homophobia:<br><br><strong>The first law against homosexuals in China went into effect in 1740. There was no record in the history as to how effectively the law was enforced. The more devastating thing for Chinese homosexuals was, ironically, the enlightenment that came after the Self-Strengthening Movement, when homophobia was imported to China along with Western science and philosophy.</strong><br><br>Now China had delisted homosexuality from their list of mental disorders, and decriminalised homosexuality.. And mind you, as a communist regime, they are mindful about carefully research into such areas through scientific means before deciding on what position they should take.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> China, as far as I know, is one country that will not Kow Tow to another country in the politics of the modern world..<br><br></div>
