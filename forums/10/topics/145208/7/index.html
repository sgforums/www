There will never be a case when all humans are gay. Our diversity amongst our genes see to that. So there is no need to worry about humans dying out due to non reproduction. If anything in fact, we have to worry about humans increasing at a rate which will one day be no longer sustainable by our planet's resources. This homosexuality trait in certain humans seem to be nature's way of staving off that unwelcome and inevitable fate.</div>

I will address your concerns in 2 segments.<br><br><strong>How does being gay harmful to oneself?</strong><br><br>In contrary to what the "gays can be cured" org proposed, the gays under treatment will be in greater harm if he forces himself to be straight. Since it has been shown that reparative therapy doesn't work (from many many health organisations whose professional ethics dictate them to adopt a position that well help others), it becomes dangerous if gays on the one hand, hate gays (internalised hatred). But on the other hand, can't remove their attraction towards the same gender. You see the dilemma there.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>An article about the so-called "reparative therapy"<br><br><strong>washingtonpost.com<br>Vowing to Set the World Straight<br>Proponents of Reparative Therapy Say They Can Help Gay Patients<br>Become Heterosexual. Experts Call That a Prescription for Harm<br><br>By Sandra G. Boodman<br>Washington Post Staff Writer<br>Tuesday, August 16, 2005; HE01<br><br>Nicholas Cavnar said he tried everything he could think of in his 30-<br>year quest to become heterosexual. He spent years in therapy, paying<br>thousands of dollars for treatment designed to overcome his<br>homosexuality. He faithfully attended meetings of Christian self-help<br>groups for "strugglers." He married and fathered three children, a<br>metamorphosis featured on the cover of a Catholic magazine.<br><br>Yet every day, the 54-year-old Washington publishing executive<br>recalled, he had to suppress his deepest feelings about who he really<br>was -- emotions he thought he had left behind at 20 when, to the<br>delight of his devout family, he abruptly renounced his openly gay<br>life in San Francisco.<br><br>Three years ago, Cavnar said, after soul-searching prompted by the<br>Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, he decided his days of "white-knuckling<br>it" were over. "I told my wife I couldn't not be gay anymore,"<br>recalled Cavnar. His biggest regret, he said, was the devastating<br>impact ending their 26-year marriage had on the woman who had<br>struggled with him.<br><br>Cavnar's odyssey -- from gay to ex-gay to ex-ex-gay -- is<br>inextricably linked to his long involvement in reparative therapy, a<br>controversial form of psychotherapy aimed at making gays straight.<br><br>While its supporters cite success stories from their clinical<br>practices as well as a recent and much debated study showing that<br>conversion therapy can work, the treatment is opposed by virtually<br>every medical and mental health organization, including the American<br>Medical Association, the U.S. Surgeon General and the American<br>Psychiatric Association (APA), which removed homosexuality from its<br>list of mental disorders in 1973.<br><br>Until the early 1990s the treatment, also known as reorientation<br>therapy, was largely relegated to religious groups or to the fringes<br>of mental health. Mainstream therapists have been taught to help<br>patients distressed about their homosexuality work toward self-<br>acceptance, to overcome the internalized homophobia thought to be the<br>cause of much emotional turmoil.<br><br>Reparative therapists reject the views held by an overwhelming<br>majority of mental health practitioners. They regard homosexuality as<br>a pathological preference forged in the crucible of a troubled<br>childhood and not, as most scientists believe, an inborn orientation<br>significantly influenced by biological factors such as genetics and<br>exposure to hormones in the womb.<br><br>"I don't think sexual orientation is genetically determined, but like<br>a lot of preferences we have in life is a complicated and<br>idiosyncratic mix of temperament and experience," said Warren<br>Throckmorton, a supporter of reparative therapy who is an associate<br>professor of psychology at Grove City College in Pennsylvania and<br>former president of the American Mental Health Counselors<br>Association. "The other reason I think change is possible is that<br>I've worked with a lot of clients who've done it."<br><br>In the past decade, the growing influence of religious conservatives<br>and the national debate over gay rights, especially gay marriage, has<br>revived interest in the therapy, significantly raising its public<br>profile, spawning new practitioners and igniting debate about a<br>matter that had been considered settled, supporters and critics agree.<br><br>"Reparative therapy is the laetrile of mental health," said New York<br>psychiatrist Jack Drescher, referring to the quack cancer cure banned<br>in the United States in the 1970s.<br><br>To gay rights activist Wayne R. Besen, the author of "Anything But<br>Straight," a 2003 book that tracks the history of ex-gay groups, the<br>therapy is "a kinder, gentler form of homophobia. The argument has<br>shifted from 'You're harming society' to 'You're harming<br>yourselves.' "</strong><br></div>

(Men are far more likely than women to receive the<br>treatment.)<br><br>"I see people who've been very hurt by this," said Drescher, who said<br>some people do manage to temporarily change their behavior, often by<br>becoming celibate, but not their sexual orientation.

Prayer is<br>often recommended.<br><br>NARTH co-founder Joseph Nicolosi, a clinical psychologist in Encino,<br>Calif., who coined the term reparative therapy and is one of its<br>leading practitioners, emphatically rejects the view that it is<br>ineffective and potentially damaging. He points to a study published<br>in 2003 by Columbia University psychiatrist Robert L. Spitzer which<br>found that therapy seemed to work for some highly motivated patients.<br><br>"It can only be damaging if the agenda of the therapist supersedes<br>that of the patient," said Nicolosi, who added that it should never<br>be forced on unwilling participants.<br><br>Although no rigorous outcome studies have been published, Nicolosi<br>estimates that one-third of patients treated at the Thomas Aquinas<br>Psychological Clinic, of which he is founding director,<br>experience "significant improvement -- they understand their<br>homosexuality and have some sense of control" but may still have gay<br>sex.

"This is about making a choice."<br><br>Although reparative therapists sometimes differ about the causes of<br>homosexuality, they are united in saying it is not inborn and it is<br>never normal.<br><br>Nicolosi maintains it is the result of a defective bond with the same-<br>sex parent. Boys who feel rejected by their fathers develop<br>a "defensive detachment" -- they reject them and identify with their<br>mothers and other females. Because opposites attract, he theorizes,<br>they are sexually drawn to men, even though what they are searching<br>for is their lost masculinity. Once they find it, he said, their<br>attraction to women will follow, although lifetime vigilance is<br>required to avoid slipping.<br><br>Even though reparative therapists say they support "free choice,"<br>they see nothing contradictory in their view that homosexuality is<br>pathological.

Let's examine moral issues (without a religious undertone). The following is the most well-known moral development theory by Kohlberg:<br><br><strong>Kohlberg's stages of moral development were developed by Lawrence Kohlberg to explain the development of moral reasoning. He created it while at University of Chicago when becoming fascinated with children's reactions to moral dilemmas. He wrote his doctoral dissertation there in 1958, outlining what is now his stages of moral development.<br><br>Kohlberg's theory holds that moral reasoning, which he thought to be the basis for ethical behavior, has developmental stages. Building upon Jean Piaget's previous work, he concluded that there are six identifiable stages of moral development. Later his model was revised and reduced to five stages given there was a lack reponses in studies owning to a clear boundary of the last stage of moral development.<br><br>Stages<br>Kohlberg's stages were broken into 3 different levels, pre-conventional, conventional and post-conventional. According to his model it is not possible to regress backwards in stages. It is also not possible to 'jump' stages; each stage provides new perspective and is "more comprehensive, differentiated and integrated than its predecessors."<br><br>Other models resemble Kohlberg's, including James Fowler's six stages of faith and Jane Loevinger's nine stages of ego development.<br><br>Level 1 (Pre-Conventional)<br>1. Obedience and punishment orientation<br>2. Self-interest orientation<br>Level 2 (Conventional)<br>3. Interpersonal accord and conformity<br>(a.k.a. The good boy/good girl attitude)<br>4. Authority and social-order maintaining orientation<br>(a.k.a. Law and order morality)<br>Level 3 (Post-Conventional)<br>5. Social contract orientation<br>6. Universal ethical principles<br>(a.k.a. Principled conscience)<br><br>to be continued...<br></strong><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Pre-Conventional<br>The pre-conventional level of moral reasoning is especially common in children, although adults can also exhibit this level of reasoning. Reasoners in the pre-conventional level judge the morality of an action by its direct consequences. The pre-conventional level consists of the first and second stage of moral development.<br><br>Stage one, individuals focus on the direct consequences that their actions will have for themselves. For example, they think that an action is morally wrong if the person who commits it gets punished.<br>Stage two espouses the what's in it for me position; right behavior being defined by what is in one's own best interest. Stage two reasoning shows a limited interest in the needs of others, but only to a point where it might further one's own interests, such as "you scratch my back, and I'll scratch yours." Concern for others is not based on loyalty or intrinsic respect in stage two.<br>[edit]<br>Conventional<br>The conventional level of moral reasoning is typical of adolescents and adults. Persons who reason in a conventional way judge the morality of actions by comparing these actions to social rules and expectations.<br><br>The conventional level consists of stages three and four of moral development.<br><br>In Stage three, individuals whose moral reasoning is in stage three seek approval from other people. They try to be a good boy or good girl having learned that there is inherent value in doing so. Stage three reasoning may judge the morality of an action by evaluating its consequences in terms of a person's relationships.<br>For Stage four, it is important to obey the laws and social conventions because of its importance to maintaining society. Moral reasoning in stage four is thus beyond the need for approval exhibited in stage three.<br>[edit]<br>Post-Conventional<br>The post-conventional level consists of stages five and six of moral development.<br><br>In Stage five, persons have certain principles to which they may attach more value than laws, such as human rights or social justice. In this reasoning, actions are wrong if they violate these ethical principles. Laws are regarded as social contracts rather than dictums, and must be changed when necessary (provided there is agreement). By this reasoning laws that do not promote general social welfare, should be changed. Democratic governments are ostensibly based on Stage five reasoning.<br>In Stage six, moral reasoning is based on the use of abstract reasoning using universal ethical principles. One way to do this is by imagining oneself in everyone else's shoes, imagining what they would decide if they were doing the same. While Kohlberg insisted that stage six exists, he had difficulty finding participants who use it. It appears that people rarely if ever reach stage six of Kohlberg's model.<br>[edit]<br>Other<br>Kohlberg also observed that there is a stage 4Â½ or 4+ which is a transition from stage four to stage five. This stage is where people have become disaffected with the arbitrary nature of law and order reasoning and become moral relativists. This transition stage may result in either progress to stage five or in regression to stage four.<br><br>Kohlberg further speculated that a seventh stage may exist (Transcendental Morality) which would link religion with moral reasoning (See James Fowler's stages of faith).</strong><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Examples<br>Kohlberg used moral dilemmas to determine which stage of moral reasoning a person uses. The dilemmas are short stories in which a person has to make a moral decision. The participant is asked what this person should do. A dilemma that Kohlberg used in his original research was the druggist's dilemma:<br><br>A woman was near death from a unique kind of cancer. There is a drug that might save her. The drug costs $4,000 per dosage. The sick woman's husband, Heinz, went to everyone he knew to borrow the money and tried every legal means, but he could only get together about $2,000. He asked the doctor scientist who discovered the drug for a discount or let him pay later. But the doctor scientist refused.<br>Should Heinz break into the laboratory to steal the drug for his wife? Why or why not?<br>From a theoretical point of view, it is not important what the participant thinks that Heinz should do. The point of interest is the justification that the participant offers. Below are examples of possible arguments that belong to the six stages. It is important to keep in mind that these arguments are only examples. It is possible that a participant reaches a completely different conclusion using the same stage of reasoning:<br><br>Stage one (obedience): Heinz should not steal the medicine, because he will consequently be put in prison.<br>Stage two (self-interest): Heinz should steal the medicine, because he will be much happier if he saves his wife, even if he will have to serve a prison sentence.<br>Stage three (conformity): Heinz should steal the medicine, because his wife expects it.<br>Stage four (law-and-order): Heinz should not steal the medicine, because the law prohibits stealing.<br>Stage five (human rights): Heinz should steal the medicine, because everyone has a right to live, regardless of the law. Or: Heinz should not steal the medicine, because the scientist has a right to fair compensation.<br>Stage six (universal human ethics): Heinz should steal the medicine, because saving a human life is a more fundamental value than the property rights of another person. Or: Heinz should not steal the medicine, because that violates the golden rule of honesty and respect.<br>Stage seven (transcendental morality):Heinz should choose to spend more time with his wife in their remaining days, both acknowledging the cycle of life-and-death which is a part of the human condition.<br>[edit]<br>Theoretical assumptions<br>The stages of Kohlberg's model refer to reasoning, not to actions or to people themselves. Kohlberg insists that the form of moral arguments is independent of the content of the arguments. According to Kohlberg, moral reasoning is a necessary, but not a sufficient, condition for moral action. Additionally, Piaget's stages of cognitive development are a necessary but not a sufficient condition for the development of moral reasoning. It is important to remember that he posits justice as the a priori summum bonum (justice is assumed to be equal with moral virtue).<br><br>According to Kohlberg, a person who progresses to a higher stage of moral reasoning cannot skip stages. For example, a person cannot jump from being concerned mostly with peer opinions (stage three) to being a proponent of social contracts (stage five). However, when persons encounter a moral dilemma and find their current level of moral reasoning unsatisfactory, they will look to the next level. Discovery of the limitations of the current stage of thinking promotes moral development.</strong><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>From Kolhberg's theory, it not difficult to see that moral reasoning goes beyond laws. Yes, laws might help to set things most right but, it is just an approximation of justice, but never justice itself.<br><br>If we can see the homosexual issue from this angle, we will realise that an argument like "all straights are good; all gays are bad" has no ground. True, there's a sub-culture within the gay community that seems to be promiscuious. But you can still promiscuity in the straight population too (e.g., geylang. 70% of HIV patients are straight.)<br><br>There is a higher percentage of gays who are not promiscuious (me! me!) who are not that visible, because we are just like common folks who lead a normal life like everyone else.
