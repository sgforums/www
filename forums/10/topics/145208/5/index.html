Specifically, I'll be interested to know the incidence rates of HIV on gays throughout the world. Also heard from a friend that in Africa, there's this belief that the "cure" for AIDS is through a man having sex with a virgin woman. And hence, Africa has some much problems with the AIDS issue now.<br><br>In Singapore, 30% of the HIV patients are gays. In absoute terms, the problems of AIDS within the straight community is still a serious one. However, nothing substantial was being proposed to curb this number. Earlier this year, one of the senior minister link AIDS with NATION party, which is an attempt to simplify the issue. Redirect the population's attention towards the gays community again (scapegoating) without addressing the seriousness of the problem in the general population.<br><br>However, if we assume that the incidence rates of gays is ard 10%, the chances of contacting AIDS within the gay circle is still much higher. It's not the time for gays to let our guards down in any way.<br><br>My stance: AIDS is a disease that bugs the whole world, and AIDS do not discriminate their victims. Instead of always trying to scapegoat the gay community. The government should attack this issue head on.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To help address and moderate ben's and heng's debate: I've found the public info page regarding homosexuality from American Psychological Association. It's a long read, I will provide my thoughts after sharing the article:<br><br><strong><span style="color: red;">What Is Sexual Orientation?</span><br><br>Sexual Orientation is an enduring emotional, romantic, sexual or affectional attraction to another person. It is easily distinguished from other components of sexuality including biological sex, gender identity (the psychological sense of being male or female) and the social gender role (adherence to cultural norms for feminine and masculine behavior).<br><br>Sexual orientation exists along a continuum that ranges from exclusive homosexuality to exclusive heterosexuality and includes various forms of bisexuality. Bisexual persons can experience sexual, emotional and affectional attraction to both their own sex and the opposite sex. Persons with a homosexual orientation are sometimes referred to as gay (both men and women) or as lesbian (women only).<br><br>Sexual orientation is different from sexual behavior because it refers to feelings and self-concept. Persons may or may not express their sexual orientation in their behaviors.<br><br><span style="color: red;">What Causes a Person To Have a Particular Sexual Orientation? </span><br>There are numerous theories about the origins of a person's sexual orientation; most scientists today agree that sexual orientation is most likely the result of a complex interaction of environmental, cognitive and biological factors. In most people, sexual orientation is shaped at an early age. There is also considerable recent evidence to suggest that biology, including genetic or inborn hormonal factors, play a significant role in a person's sexuality. In summary, it is important to recognize that there are probably many reasons for a person's sexual orientation and the reasons may be different for different people.<br></strong><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>btw, the source:<a href="http://www.apa.org/pubinfo/answers.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.apa.org/pubinfo/answers.html</a><br><br><strong><span style="color: red;">Is Sexual Orientation a Choice? </span><br>No, human beings can not choose to be either gay or straight. Sexual orientation emerges for most people in early adolescence without any prior sexual experience. Although we can choose whether to act on our feelings, psychologists do not consider sexual orientation to be a conscious choice that can be voluntarily changed.<br><br><span style="color: red;">Can Therapy Change Sexual Orientation?</span><br><br>No. Even though most homosexuals live successful, happy lives, some homosexual or bisexual people may seek to change their sexual orientation through therapy, sometimes pressured by the influence of family members or religious groups to try and do so. The reality is that homosexuality is not an illness. It does not require treatment and is not changeable.<br><br>However, not all gay, lesbian, and bisexual people who seek assistance from a mental health professional want to change their sexual orientation. Gay, lesbian, and bisexual people may seek psychological help with the coming out process or for strategies to deal with prejudice, but most go into therapy for the same reasons and life issues that bring straight people to mental health professionals.<br><br><span style="color: red;">What About So-Called "Conversion Therapies"? </span><br><br>Some therapists who undertake so-called conversion therapy report that they have been able to change their clients' sexual orientation from homosexual to heterosexual. Close scrutiny of these reports however show several factors that cast doubt on their claims. For example, many of the claims come from organizations with an ideological perspective which condemns homosexuality. Furthermore, their claims are poorly documented. For example, treatment outcome is not followed and reported overtime as would be the standard to test the validity of any mental health intervention.<br><br>The American Psychological Association is concerned about such therapies and their potential harm to patients. In 1997, the Association's Council of Representatives passed a resolution reaffirming psychology's opposition to homophobia in treatment and spelling out a client's right to unbiased treatment and self-determination. Any person who enters into therapy to deal with issues of sexual orientation has a right to expect that such therapy would take place in a professionally neutral environment absent of any social bias. </strong><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="color: red;">Is Homosexuality a Mental Illness or Emotional Problem? </span><br>No. Psychologists, psychiatrists and other mental health professionals agree that homosexuality is not an illness, mental disorder or an emotional problem. Over 35 years of objective, well-designed scientific research has shown that homosexuality, in and itself,is not associated with mental disorders or emotional or social problems. Homosexuality was once thought to be a mental illness because mental health professionals and society had biased information. In the past the studies of gay, lesbian and bisexual people involved only those in therapy, thus biasing the resulting conclusions. When researchers examined data about these people who were not in therapy, the idea that homosexuality was a mental illness was quickly found to be untrue.<br><br>In 1973 the American Psychiatric Association confirmed the importance of the new, better designed research and removed homosexuality from the official manual that lists mental and emotional disorders. Two years later, the American Psychological Association passed a resolution supporting the removal. For more than 25 years, both associations have urged all mental health professionals to help dispel the stigma of mental illness that some people still associate with homosexual orientation.<br><br><span style="color: red;">Can Lesbians, Gay Men, and Bisexuals Be Good Parents?</span><br><br>Yes. Studies comparing groups of children raised by homosexual and by heterosexual parents find no developmental differences between the two groups of children in four critical areas: their intelligence, psychological adjustment, social adjustment, and popularity with friends. It is also important to realize that a parent's sexual orientation does not dictate his or her children's.<br><br>Another myth about homosexuality is the mistaken belief that gay men have more of a tendency than heterosexual men to sexually molest children. There is no evidence to suggest that homosexuals are more likely than heterosexuals to molest children.<br></strong><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="color: red;">Why Do Some Gay Men, Lesbians and Bisexuals Tell People About Their Sexual Orientation? </span><br><br>Because sharing that aspect of themselves with others is important to their mental health. In fact, the process of identity development for lesbians, gay men and bisexuals called "coming out", has been found to be strongly related to psychological adjustmentÂ—the more positive the gay, lesbian, or bisexual identity, the better one's mental health and the higher one's self-esteem.<br><br><span style="color: red;">Why Is the "Coming Out" Process Difficult for Some Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual People?</span><br><br>For some gay and bisexual people the coming out process is difficult, for others it is not. Often lesbian, gay and bisexual people feel afraid, different, and alone when they first realize that their sexual orientation is different from the community norm. This is particularly true for people becoming aware of their gay, lesbian, or bisexual orientation as a child or adolescent, which is not uncommon. And, depending on their families and where they live, they may have to struggle against prejudice and misinformation about homosexuality. Children and adolescents may be particularly vulnerable to the deleterious effects of bias and stereotypes. They may also fear being rejected by family, friends,co-workers, and religious institutions. Some gay people have to worry about losing their jobs or being harassed at school if their sexual orientation became well known. Unfortunately, gay, lesbian and bisexual people are at a higher risk for physical assault and violence than are heterosexuals. Studies done in California in the mid 1990s showed that nearly one-fifth of all lesbians who took part in the study and more than one-fourth of all gay men who participated had been the victim of a hate crime based on their sexual orientation. In another California study of approximately 500 young adults, half of all the young men participating in the study admitted to some form of anti-gay aggression from name-calling to physical violence.<br></strong><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="color: red;">What Can Be Done to Overcome the Prejudice and Discrimination the Gay Men, Lesbians, and Bisexuals Experience? </span><br>Research has found that the people who have the most positive attitudes toward gay men, lesbians and bisexuals are those who say they know one or more gay, lesbian or bisexual person wellÂ—often as a friend or co-worker. For this reason, psychologists believe negative attitudes toward gay people as a group are prejudices that are not grounded in actual experiences but are based on stereotypes and prejudice.<br><br>Furthermore, protection against violence and discrimination is very important, just as it is for other minority groups. Some states include violence against an individual on the basis of his or her sexual orientation as a "hate crime" and 10 U.S. states have laws against discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.<br><br><span style="color: red;">Why is it Important for Society to be Better Educated About Homosexuality? </span><br><br>Educating all people about sexual orientation and homosexuality is likely to diminish anti-gay prejudice. Accurate information about homosexuality is especially important to young people who are first discovering and seeking to understand their sexualityÂ—whether homosexual, bisexual, or heterosexual. Fears that access to such information will make more people gay have no validityÂ—information about homosexuality does not make someone gay or straight.<br><br><span style="color: red;">Are All Gay and Bisexual Men HIV Infected? </span><br>No. This is a commonly held myth. In reality, the risk of exposure to HIV is related to a person's behavior, not their sexual orientation. What's important to remember about HIV/AIDS is it is a preventable disease through the use of safe sex practices and by not using drugs.<br></strong><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes, Sciences had not given us the conclusive evidence that whether gays are made or born (even though there are accumulating evidence of the biological effects, will share this article later), however, psychologists are rather unison in recognising the fact that:<br><br>1) Homosexuality is not a choice.<br>2) Orientation change therapy will potentially harm the person under "treatment" rather than to help. In fact, they are so disgusted with the so-called conversion therapy that they had to publicly denounced it's usefulness.<br>3) Psychologists can still help homosexuals, but not by addressing the homosexuality itself. They will treat homosexuals as any other patients and would address their possible depressions and other mood disorders just like they help other one else in the general population.<br>4) The way for us to go forth is, ironically, to make more straight friends.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> For me, I will try my best to come out to my close friends.. This is one of the most effective way for the general population to understand that homosexuals are just like heterosexuals, other than the fact that we are drawn sexually to the same gender.<br>5) There will be of course, people who do not want to befriend gays at all. Let them be. No point getting upset over others who accept cant diversity.</div>

Just minutes<br>after meeting me outside a coffee shop, he punches me in the upper arm,<br>yells, "Gray punch buggy!" and then points to a Volkswagen Beetle<br>cruising past us. It's a hard punch. They horse around like typical<br>brothers, but Patrick's punches are less forceful and his voice is<br>higher. Thomas charges at his brother, arms flexed in front of him like<br>a mini-bodybuilder. The differences are subtle - they're 7-year-old<br>boys, after all - but they are there.<br><br>When the twins were 2, Patrick found his mother's shoes. He liked<br>wearing them. Thomas tried on his father's once but didn't see the<br>point.<br><br>When they were 3, Thomas blurted out that toy guns were his favorite<br>things. Patrick piped up that his were the Barbie dolls he discovered<br>at day care.<br><br>When the twins were 5, Thomas announced he was going to be a monster<br>for Halloween.

"Then I'll be Batman," he said.<br><br>Their mother - intelligent, warm, and open-minded - found herself<br>conflicted. She wanted Patrick - whose playmates have always been<br>girls, never boys - to be himself, but she worried his feminine<br>behavior would expose him to ridicule and pain. She decided to allow<br>him free expression at home while setting some limits in public.<br><br>That worked until last year, when a school official called to say<br>Patrick was making his classmates uncomfortable. He kept insisting that<br>he was a girl.<br><br>Patrick exhibits behavior called childhood gender nonconformity, or<br>CGN. This doesn't describe a boy who has a doll somewhere in his toy<br>collection or tried on his sister's Snow White outfit once, but rather<br>one who consistently exhibits a host of strongly feminine traits and<br>interests while avoiding boy-typical behavior like rough-and-tumble<br>play. There's been considerable research into this phenomenon,<br>particularly in males, including a study that followed boys from an<br>early age into early adulthood. The data suggest there is a very good<br>chance Patrick will grow up to be homosexual. Not all homosexual men<br>show this extremely feminine behavior as young boys. But the research<br>indicates that, of the boys who do exhibit CGN, about 75 percent of<br>them - perhaps more - turn out to be gay or bisexual.<br></div>

As identical twins, Patrick and Thomas began<br>as genetic clones. From the moment they came out of their mother's<br>womb, their environment was about as close to identical as possible -<br>being fed, changed, and plopped into their car seats the same way,<br>having similar relationships with the same nurturing father and mother.<br>Yet before either boy could talk, one showed highly feminine traits<br>while the other appeared to be "all boy," as the moms at the<br>playgrounds say with apologetic shrugs.<br><br>"That my sons were different the second they were born, there is no<br>question about it," says the twins' mother.<br><br>So what happened between their identical genetic starting point and<br>their births? They spent nine months in utero. In the hunt for what<br>causes people to be gay or straight, that's now the most interesting<br>and potentially enlightening frontier.<br><br>WHAT DOES IT MATTER WHERE HOMOSEXUALITY COMES FROM? Proving people are<br>born gay would give them wider social acceptance and better protection<br>against discrimination, many gay rights advocates argue. In the last<br>decade, as this "biological" argument has gained momentum, polls find<br>Americans - especially young adults - increasingly tolerant of gays and<br>lesbians. And that's exactly what has groups opposed to homosexuality<br>so concerned. The Family Research Council, a conservative Christian<br>think tank in Washington, D.C., argues in its book Getting It Straight<br>that finding people are born gay "would advance the idea that sexual<br>orientation is an innate characteristic, like race; that homosexuals,<br>like African-Americans, should be legally protected against<br>'discrimination;' and that disapproval of homosexuality should be as<br>socially stigmatized as racism. However, it is not true."<br><br>Some advocates of gay marriage argue that proving sexual orientation is<br>inborn would make it easier to frame the debate as simply a matter of<br>civil rights. That could be true, but then again, freedom of religion<br>enjoyed federal protection long before inborn traits like race and sex.<br><br>For much of the 20th century, the dominant thinking connected<br>homosexuality to upbringing. Freud, for instance, speculated that<br>overprotective mothers and distant fathers helped make boys gay. It<br>took the American Psychiatric Association until 1973 to remove<br>"homosexuality" from its manual of mental disorders.<br><br>Then, in 1991, a neuroscientist in San Diego named Simon LeVay told the<br>world he had found a key difference between the brains of homosexual<br>and heterosexual men he studied. LeVay showed that a tiny clump of<br>neurons of the anterior hypothalamus - which is believed to control<br>sexual behavior - was, on average, more than twice the size in<br>heterosexual men as in homosexual men. LeVay's findings did not speak<br>directly to the nature-vs.-nurture debate - the clumps could,<br>theoretically, have changed size because of homosexual behavior. But<br>that seemed unlikely, and the study ended up jump-starting the effort<br>to prove a biological basis for homosexuality.<br><br></div>

Michael<br>Bailey announced the results of their study of male twins. They found<br>that, in identical twins, if one twin was gay, the other had about a 50<br>percent chance of also being gay. For fraternal twins, the rate was<br>about 20 percent. Because identical twins share their entire genetic<br>makeup while fraternal twins share about half, genes were believed to<br>explain the difference. Most reputable studies find the rate of<br>homosexuality in the general population to be 2 to 4 percent, rather<br>than the popular "1 in 10" estimate.<br><br>In 1993 came the biggest news: Dean Hamer's discovery of the "gay<br>gene." In fact, Hamer, a Harvard-trained researcher at the National<br>Cancer Institute, hadn't quite put it that boldly or imprecisely. He<br>found that gay brothers shared a specific region of the X chromosome,<br>called Xq28, at a higher rate than gay men shared with their straight<br>brothers. Hamer and others suggested this finding would eventually<br>transform our understanding of sexual orientation.<br><br>That hasn't happened yet. But the clear focus of sexual-orientation<br>research has shifted to biological causes, and there hasn't been much<br>science produced to support the old theories tying homosexuality to<br>upbringing. Freud may have been seeing the effect rather than the<br>cause, since a father faced with a very feminine son might well become<br>more distant or hostile, leading the boy's mother to become more<br>protective. In recent years, researchers who suspect that homosexuality<br>is inborn - whether because of genetics or events happening in the womb<br>- have looked everywhere for clues: Prenatal hormones. Birth order.<br>Finger length. Fingerprints. Stress. Sweat. Eye blinks. Spatial<br>relations. Hearing. Handedness. Even "gay" sheep.<br><br>LeVay, who is gay, says that when he published his study 14 years ago,<br>some gays and lesbians criticized him for doing research that might<br>lead to homosexuality once again being lumped in with diseases and<br>disorders. "If anything, the reverse has happened," says LeVay, who is<br>now 61 and no longer active in the lab. He says the hunt for a<br>biological basis for homosexuality, which involves many researchers who<br>are themselves gay or lesbian, "has contributed to the status of gay<br>people in society."<br><br>These studies have been small and underfunded, and the results have<br>often been modest. Still, because there's been so much of this<br>disparate research, "all sort of pointing in the same direction, makes<br>it pretty clear there are biological processes significantly<br>influencing sexual orientation," says LeVay. "But it's also kind of<br>frustrating that it's still a bunch of hints, that nothing is really as<br>crystal clear as you would like."<br><br>Just in the last few months, though, the hints have grown stronger.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Page 4 of 11 --In May, Swedish researchers reported finding important<br>differences in how the brains of straight men and gay men responded to<br>two compounds suspected of being pheromones - those scent-related<br>chemicals that are key to sexual arousal in animals. The first compound<br>came from women's urine, the second from male sweat. Brain scans showed<br>that when straight men smelled the female urine compound, their<br>hypothalamus lit up. That didn't happen with gay men. Instead, their<br>hypothalamus lit up when they smelled the male-sweat compound, which<br>was the same way straight women had responded. This research once again<br>connecting the hypothalamus to sexual orientation comes on the heels of<br>work with sheep. About 8 percent of domestic rams are exclusively<br>interested in sex with other rams. Researchers found that a clump of<br>neurons similar to the one LeVay identified in human brains was also<br>smaller in gay rams than straight ones. (Again, it's conceivable that<br>these differences could be showing effect rather than cause.)<br><br>In June, scientists in Vienna announced that they had isolated a master<br>genetic switch for sexual orientation in the fruit fly. Once they<br>flicked the switch, the genetically altered female flies rebuffed<br>overtures from males and instead attempted to mate with other females,<br>adopting the elaborate courting dance and mating songs that males use.<br><br>And now, a large-scale, five-year genetic study of gay brothers is<br>underway in North America. The study received $2.5 million from the<br>National Institutes of Health, which is unusual. Government funders<br>tend to steer clear of sexual orientation research, aware that even<br>small grants are apt to be met with outrage from conservative<br>congressmen looking to make the most of their C-Span face time. Relying<br>on a robust sample of 1,000 gay-brother pairs and the latest<br>advancements in genetic screening, this study promises to bring some<br>clarity to the murky area of what role genes may play in homosexuality.<br><br>This accumulating biological evidence, combined with the prospect of<br>more on the horizon, is having an effect. Last month, the Rev. Rob<br>Schenck, a prominent Washington, D.C., evangelical leader, told a large<br>gathering of young evangelicals that he believes homosexuality is not a<br>choice but rather a predisposition, something "deeply rooted" in<br>people. Schenck told me that his conversion came about after he'd<br>spoken extensively with genetic researchers and psychologists. He<br>argues that evangelicals should continue to oppose homosexual behavior,<br>but that "many evangelicals are living in a sort of state of denial<br>about the advance of this conversation." His message: "If it's<br>inevitable that this scientific evidence is coming, we have to be<br>prepared with a loving response.

They found that while straight men were aroused by<br>film clips of two women having sex, and gay men were aroused by clips<br>of two men having sex, most of the men who identified themselves as<br>bisexual showed gay arousal patterns. More surprising was just how<br>different the story with women turned out to be. Most women, whether<br>they identified as straight, lesbian, or bisexual, were significantly<br>aroused by straight, gay, and lesbian sex. "I'm not suggesting that<br>most women are bisexual," says Michael Bailey, the psychology professor<br>whose lab conducted the studies. "I'm suggesting that whatever a<br>woman's sexual arousal pattern is, it has little to do with her sexual<br>orientation." That's fundamentally different from men. "In men, arousal<br>is orientation. It's as simple as that. That's how gay men learn they<br>are gay."<br><br>These studies mark a return to basics for the 47-year-old Bailey. He<br>says researchers need a far deeper understanding of what sexual<br>orientation is before they can determine where it comes from.<br><br>Female sexual orientation is particularly foggy, he says, because<br>there's been so little research done. As for male sexual orientation,<br>he argues that there's now enough evidence to suggest it is "entirely<br>in-born," though not nearly enough to establish how that happens.<br><br>Bailey's 1991 twin study is still cited by other researchers as one of<br>the pillars in the genetic argument for homosexuality. But his<br>follow-up study using a comprehensive registry of twins in Australia<br>found a much lower rate of similarity in sexual orientation between<br>identical twins, about 20 percent, down from 50 percent.

Because it's unclear what percentage of homosexuals and<br>lesbians showed CGN as children, Bailey and his colleagues are now<br>running a study that uses adult participants' home movies from<br>childhood to look for signs of gender-bending behavior.<br><br>Cornell psychologist Daryl Bem has proposed an intriguing theory for<br>how CGN might lead to homosexuality. According to this pathway, which<br>he calls "the exotic becomes erotic," children are born with traits for<br>temperament, such as aggression and activity level, that predispose<br>them to male-typical or female-typical activities. They seek out<br>playmates with the same interests. So a boy whose traits lead him to<br>hopscotch and away from rough play will feel different from, and<br>ostracized by, other boys. This leads to physiological arousal of fear<br>and anger in their presence, arousal that eventually is transformed<br>from exotic to erotic.<br><br></div>

BECAUSE IT'S UNCLEAR why twin<br>brothers with identical genetic starting points and similar post-birth<br>environments would take such divergent paths, it's helpful to return to<br>the beginning.<br><br>Males and females have a fundamental genetic difference - females have<br>two X chromosomes, and males have an X and a Y. Still, right after<br>conception, it's hard to tell male and female zygotes apart, except for<br>that tucked-away chromosomal difference. Normally, the changes take<br>shape at a key point of fetal development, when the male brain is<br>masculinized by sex hormones. The female brain is the default. The<br>brain will stay on the female path as long as it is protected from<br>exposure to hormones. The hormonal theory of homosexuality holds that,<br>just as exposure to circulating sex hormones determines whether a fetus<br>will be male or female, such exposure must also influence sexual<br>orientation.<br><br>The cases of children born with disorders of "sexual differentiation"<br>offer insight. William Reiner, a psychiatrist and urologist with the<br>University of Oklahoma, has evaluated more than a hundred of these<br>cases. For decades, the standard medical response to boys born with<br>severely inadequate penises (or none at all) was to castrate the boy<br>and have his parents raise him as a girl. But Reiner has found that<br>nurture - even when it involves surgery soon after birth - cannot trump<br>nature. Of the boys with inadequate penises who were raised as girls,<br>he says, "I haven't found one who is sexually attracted to males." The<br>majority of them have transitioned back to being males and report being<br>attracted to females.<br><br>During fetal development, sexual identity is set before the sexual<br>organs are formed, Reiner says. Perhaps it's the same for sexual<br>orientation. In his research, of all the babies with X and Y<br>chromosomes who were raised as girls, the only ones he has found who<br>report having female identities and being attracted to males are those<br>who did not have "receptors" to let the male sex hormones do their<br>masculinizing in the womb.<br><br>What does this all mean? "Exposure to male hormones in utero<br>dramatically raises the chances of being sexually attracted to<br>females," Reiner says. "We can infer that the absence of male hormone<br>exposure may have something to do with attraction to males."<br></div>

Other scientists have offered<br>fascinating but unpersuasive explanations, most of them focusing on<br>some kind of compensatory benefit, in the same way that the gene<br>responsible for sickle cell anemia also protects against malaria. A<br>study last year by researchers in Italy showed that female relatives of<br>gay men tended to be more fertile, though, as critics point out, not<br>nearly fertile enough to make up for the gay man's lack of offspring.<br><br>But there will be plenty of time for sorting out the evolutionary<br>paradox once - and if - researchers are able to identify actual genes<br>involved in sexual orientation. Getting to that point will likely<br>require integrating multiple lines of promising research. That is<br>exactly what's happening in Eric Vilain's lab at the University of<br>California, Los Angeles. Vilain, an associate professor of human<br>genetics, and his colleague, Sven Bocklandt, are using gay sheep,<br>transgenic mice, identical twin humans, and novel approaches to human<br>genetics to try to unlock the mystery of sexual orientation.<br><br>Instead of looking for a gay gene, they stress that they are looking<br>for several genes that cause either attraction to men or attraction to<br>women. Those same genes would work one way in heterosexual women and<br>another way in homosexual men. The UCLA lab is examining how these<br>genes might be turned "up" or "down." It's not a question of what genes<br>you have, but rather which ones you use, says Bocklandt. "I have the<br>genes in my body to make a vagina and carry a baby, but I don't use<br>them, because I am a man." In studying the genes of gay sheep, for<br>example, he's found some that are turned "way up" compared with the<br>straight rams.<br><br>The lab is also testing an intriguing theory involving imprinted genes.<br>Normally, we have two copies of every gene, one from each parent, and<br>both copies work. They're identical, so it doesn't matter which copy<br>comes from which parent. But with imprinted genes, that does matter.<br>Although both copies are physically there, one copy - either from the<br>mom or the dad - is blocked from working. Think of an airplane with an<br>engine on each wing, except one of the engines is shut down. A recent<br>Duke University study suggests humans have hundreds of imprinted genes,<br>including one on the X chromosome that previous research has tied to<br>sexual orientation.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Page 10 of 11 --With imprinted genes, there is no backup engine. So if<br>there's something atypical in the copy from mom, the copy from dad<br>cannot be turned on. The UCLA lab is now collecting DNA from identical<br>twins in which one twin is straight and the other is gay. Because the<br>twins begin as genetic clones, if a gene is imprinted in one twin, it<br>will be in the other twin as well. Normally, as the fetuses are<br>developing, each time a cell divides, the DNA separates and makes a<br>copy of itself, replicating all kinds of genetic information. It's a<br>complicated but incredibly accurate process. But the coding to keep the<br>backup engine shut down on an imprinted gene is less accurate.<br><br>So how might imprinted genes help explain why one identical twin would<br>be straight and the other gay? Say there's an imprinted gene for<br>attraction to females, and there's something atypical in the copy the<br>twin brothers get from mom. As all that replicating is going on, the<br>imprinting (to keep the copy from dad shut down) proceeds as expected<br>in one twin, and he ends up gay. But somehow with his brother, the<br>coding for the imprinting is lost, and rather than remain shut down,<br>the fuel flows to fire up the backup engine from dad. And that twin<br>turns out to be straight.<br><br>IN THE COURSE OF REPORTING THIS STORY, I EXPERIENCED A good deal of<br>whiplash. Just when I would become swayed by the evidence supporting<br>one discreet theory, I would stumble onto new evidence casting some<br>doubt on it. Ultimately, I accepted this as unavoidable terrain in the<br>hunt for the basis of sexual orientation. This is, after all, a<br>research field built on underfunded, idiosyncratic studies that are met<br>with full-barreled responses from opposing and well-funded advocacy<br>groups determined to make the results from the lab hew to the scripts<br>they've honed for the talk-show circuit.<br><br>You can't really blame the advocacy groups. The stakes are high. In the<br>end, homosexuality remains such a divisive issue that only thoroughly<br>tested research will get society to accept what science has to say<br>about its origin. Critics of funding for sexual orientation research<br>say that it isn't curing cancer, and they're right. But we devote a lot<br>more dollars to studying other issues that aren't curing cancer and<br>have less resonance in society.<br><br>Still, no matter how imperfect these studies are, when you put them all<br>together and examine them closely, the message is clear: While<br>post-birth development may well play a supporting role, the roots of<br>homosexuality, at least in men, appear to be in place by the time a<br>child is born. After spending years sifting through all the available<br>data, British researchers Glenn Wilson and Qazi Rahman come to an even<br>bolder conclusion in their forthcoming book Born Gay: The Psychobiology<br>of Sex Orientation, in which they write: "Sexual orientation is<br>something we are born with and not `acquired' from our social<br>environment."<br></div>

She says her<br>son's feminine behavior suggests he will grow up to be gay, and she has<br>no problem with that. She just worries about what happens to him<br>between now and then.<br><br>After that fateful call from Patrick's school, she says, "I knew I had<br>to talk to my son, and I had no clue what to say." Ultimately, she told<br>him that although he could play however he wanted at home, he couldn't<br>tell his classmates he was a girl, because they'd think he was lying.<br>And she told him that some older boys might be mean to him and even hit<br>him if he continued to claim he was a girl.<br><br>Then she asked him, "Do you think that you can convince yourself that<br>you are a boy?"<br><br>"Yes, Mom," he said. "It's going to be like when I was trying to learn<br>to read, and then one day I opened the book and I could read."<br><br>His mother's heart sank. She could tell that he wanted more than<br>anything to please her. "Basically, he was saying there must be a<br>miracle - that one day I wake up and I'm a boy. That's the only way he<br>could imagine it could happen."<br><br>In the year since that conversation, Patrick's behavior has become<br>somewhat less feminine. His mother hopes it's just because his<br>interests are evolving and not because he's suppressing them.<br><br>"I can now imagine him being completely straight, which I couldn't a<br>year ago," she says. "I can imagine him being gay, which seems to be<br>statistically most likely."<br><br>She says she's fine with either outcome, just as long as he's happy and<br>free from harm. She takes heart in how much more accepting today's<br>society is. "By the time my boys are 20, the world will have changed<br>even more."<br><br>By then, there might even be enough consensus for researchers to forget<br>about finger lengths and fruit flies and gay sheep, and move on to a<br>new mystery.<br></div>
