When have the gay community ever requested for special status?<br><br>You are basing all of your arguements on the idea that homosexuality is a disease. It is not, and that would be the reason why all of your arguements sound like something coming out from someone who is deluded and believes that his/her/whatever 's opinion is the only opinion and therefore ultimate truth.<br><br>Don't construct arguements where you quote yourself to pove your point.<br><br>They are as thin as paper and break like thin ice.</div>

In different universities, it might be classified differently from the arts to social sciences to sciences to medicine (psychiatry).<br><br><strong>Are you talking about the subject matter?</strong><br>Psychology is the study of human mind and behaviours. Homosexuality falls under this discipline. Not that it's "everything" that Psychologists are interested in. But still, the studies in this area are numerous enough for APA to start a new division to handle homosexuality issues.<br><br><a href="http://www.apa.org/divisions/div44/" rel="nofollow">http://www.apa.org/divisions/div44/</a><br><br>I can agree that the subject matter might be "subjective", however, this is true for most sciences isn't it? Just like the study of black holes (by stephen hawking). But for the field of psychology, the opinion of homosexuality has been gradually moving from an "homosexuality is a sexual disorder" camp to a "homosexuality is not an emotional disorder" camp through careful research and the replication of studies.<br><br><strong>Or are you talking about the research methods?</strong><br>Psychologists are trained rigorously in research methods. It is a scientific enterprise. Whenever any theory is being proposed, it will be closely scrutinised by other psychologists doing the same area of research. Hence, i would disagree that the research methods are "inexact", unless the researchers are out to conduct a research with a very specific agenda, and he intentionally introduce contamination in the study design to produce the results he wanted. But then again, such studies will be hammered straight away by the others in the same profession.<br><br><strong>Role of APA</strong><br>The role of an organisation like APA (or BPS; 2 of the biggest psych org in the world covering at least 2/3 of world's psychologists) is to ensure that psychologists adhere to their professional standards.<br><br><a href="http://www.apa.org/ethics/code.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.apa.org/ethics/code.html</a></div>
