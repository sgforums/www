Vigorous debate about such issues and exception to the views of religious leaders such as the Dalai Lama are neither heresy or disrespectful in Buddhist traditions.<br><br>"In fact, it's the practitioner's duty to examine dogmatic views and to determine their validity," Hunt said. During the private session, the religious teacher told the activists they would have a harder time changing Buddhist scripture and tradition than advocating for their human rights based on Buddhist principles, according to Peskind.<br><br>Organized for the Office of Tibet by attorney Eva Herzer, president of the International Committee of Lawyers For Tibet, the historic meeting included Herzer, Peskind, Buddhist Peace Fellowship activist and Claremont Graduate School Professor of Education Lourdes Arguelles, and Jose Ignacio Cabezon, a gay Buddhist scholar and professor at Iliff School of Theology in Denver, Colorado.<br><br>Other participants included the Ven. K.T. Shedrup Gyatso, a fully ordained and openly gay Buddhist monk and teacher who is the spiritual director of the San Jose Tibetan Temple; International Gay And Lesbian Human Rights Commission co-chair Tinku Ali Ishtiaq; and former Congregation Sha'ar Zahav Rabbi Yoel Khan.<br><br>"There is still room for movement," Ishtiaq told the Bay Area Reporter. But the human rights activist said the Dalai Lama's support for lesbian and gay rights is "very significant."<br><br>Ishtiaq said that the Nobel laureate commands tremendous respect around the world and hoped the leader's historic statement would have "considerable impact on non-Buddhist religious traditions."<br><br>A conference on Buddhism, sex, gender, and diversity issues is being planned, following the historic meeting with the world religious leader. </span><br><br><strong><span style="color: red;">Are these the views of the Dalai Lama, or that the opinions and interpretations of the perception of the Dalai Lama's statements ? </span></strong><br><br>Is the Dalai Lama the accepted titular head of the Budhist Community ?<br><br>Is he the final authority on such views from the Religious Community ?<br><br></div>

Drs. Byne and Parsons at Columbia University believe it is important to "appreciate the complexities of sexual orientation and resist the urge to search for simplistic explanations, either psychosocial or biologic."44 They emphasize that</span> <span style="color: red;">in addition to the influences of genetics or the environment, the individual plays an important role in determining his or her identity.</span><br><br><span style="color: blue;">Dr. John Money stated, "Many wrongly assume that whatever is biological cannot be changed, and whatever mental can be. Both propositions are in error.</span> <span style="color: red;">Homosexuality is always biological and always mental, both together. It is mental because it exists in the mind. It is biological because the mind exists in the brain. The sexual brain through its extended nervous system communicates back and forth with the sex organs</span>."45<br><br><strong><span style="color: red;">Our character is the net result of our choices and life experience</span></strong>. <span style="color: blue;">An article in Harvest News stated, "Some of us are shy, some anxious, some have problems with anger or chemical dependence, some of us fear commitment. Did we Â‘chooseÂ’ any of these things? Actually, all of our adult personality is the result of a complex interplay of heredity and family environment with thousands of small personal decisions dating back as far as we can remember. The results are deeply entrenched ways of feeling, thinking, acting."46 Although you may have had no control over the emergence of homosexual attractions, you can choose how to respond to them.<br><br>Elder Dallin H. Oaks has said that "some kinds of feelings seem to be inborn. Others are traceable to mortal experiences. Still other feelings seem to be acquired from a complex interaction of Â‘nature and nurture.Â’ All of us have some feelings we did not choose, but the gospel of Jesus Christ teaches us that we still have the power to resist and reform our feelings (as needed) and to assure that they do not lead us to entertain inappropriate thoughts or to engage in sinful behavior."47</span><br><br><a href="http://www.evergreeninternational.org/causes.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.evergreeninternational.org/causes.htm</a><br></div>

I'm not arguing categorically, saying that "marriage will eradicate the problem", I'm just stating that it will be more difficulty for one partner to be unfaithful to the other...<br><br><blockquote><br>Did you not read two other referenced reports that I had posted from the Ministry that the 'GAY COMMUNITY is facing an AIDS epidemic - due to unsafe sex practises'; and 'Thirty-one of the 138 new cases of HIV infections reported in the first-half of 2004 were through homosexual transmission, compared to 40 cases for the whole of 2003'.<br><br>Singapore facing Â“alarming AIDS epidemicÂ” : Government Â– 11-11-2004<br>http://www.singapore-window.org/sw04/041111af.htm<br><br>Increase in HIV infection in Singapore amongst Gays<br>http://www.singapore-window.org/sw04/040919a1.htm </blockquote>You changed your position again, you claimed earlier that ALL homosexuals have AIDS, now you are switching your position about the spike last year.. Btw, before the spike, only 15-18% of gays contact AIDS.<br><br>I did not deny the fact about this spike.. Or did I? I was cautionly iveco about it earlier too... I did not deny that gays are more promiscuous, but isn't it because there's no chance to settle down to a "married" status?<br><br><blockquote>Have you not heard that condoms will not provide any TOTAL FAIL SAFE GUARANTEE to getting the AIDS/HIV virus ? </blockquote><a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9118071/" rel="nofollow">http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9118071/</a><br><a href="http://news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;u=/nm/20050829/hl_nm/aids_africa_dc" rel="nofollow">http://news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;u=/nm/20050829/hl_nm/aids_africa_dc</a><br>Again, abstinence program does not work...

If it's so simple, why not the whole nation operate on a non-default inheritance scheme? If one partner of a heterosexual couple pass on, the money will go back to the state (in the event that he/she has no blood relatives left)... Cant you see that the need for one to make this arrangement is by itself discrimination? Why singles dont need? Because the assets will flow back to blood relatives, which is the intended target recipients anyway... For gays, the target recipients are non-related individuals...<br><br><blockquote><br>There are two known routes of AIDS transmission - promiscuity outside marriage, and one directly from HOMOSEXUAL SEXUAL ACTIVITIES in the 'B_L_ACK HOLE' - period. </blockquote>Yes, there are 2 routes to AIDS transmission: Blood transfusion and sexual intercouse, be it from the front or from the back... If anal sex is the biggest problem, why are there more heterosexuals contacting AIDS?<br><br><blockquote><br>Lesbians are similary exposed to AIDS/HIV virus as much as the HOMOSEXUAL MALES, do they need my approval ? </blockquote>This is from the MOH report, the bulk of the female comes from Married status... Unless you want to show that the 21% singles are all lesbians, your argument doesn't stand.. And mind you, lesbians do not practice sexual intercourse, and hence, isn't it true that they will have lower chance to contat AIDS?

My argument was "given 2 indivuduals with the same income", those with Children will contribute less to tax... due to all kinds of rebates...<br>Whether the Child Tax Rebates are sufficient or not has no relation with the fact that money is flowed from those without Children to those with Children under the current tax scheme...<br><br>I'm not against such an arrangement, but then, if I do contribute more than my peers with same income, shouldn't I have the same basic rights of buying public housing like him?<br><br><blockquote><br>Public Housing is NEUTER BLIND - and housing rules have changed to benefit SINGLES who reach 35 years, this affects ALL SINGLES - whether NORMAL or HOMOSEXUALLY inclined.<br><br>If you cannot wait why #^%%^ - (ah, of course the effeminated characteristics taking effect ) . </blockquote>This is because single is a subset of Heterosexuals...
