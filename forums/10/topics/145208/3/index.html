Gays are born? May be, but is it natural, or  sickness of the mind itself, a birth defect, a medical condition?<br><br>No more discussion for me.<br></div></blockquote>that's because genetic influence does not happen in every generation.. you do not take on each and every traits that you parents passed on to you.. but by and large, you are more similar than you parents than any other individuals walking down the street..<br><br>the gay genes theory was one of the biggest opponent to darwin's theory of evolution.. remember you yourself also believe that gay genes will one day die of natural death?

The reality is that homosexuality is not an illness. It does not require treatment and is not changeable." [4] (http://www.apa.org/pubinfo/answers.html#cantherapychange)<br>Some religious organisations also oppose reparative therapies, including The Interfaith Alliance, New Ways Ministries and People for the American Way.<br><br>In 1999, the American Academy of Pediatrics, American Counseling Association, American Association of School Administrators, American Federation of Teachers, American Psychological Association, American School Health Association, Interfaith Alliance Foundation, National Association of School Psychologists, National Association of Social Workers, and National Education Association developed and endorsed a statement reading:<br><br><strong>The most important fact about 'reparative therapy,' also sometimes known as 'conversion' therapy, is that it is based on an understanding of homosexuality that has been rejected by all the major health and mental health professions. The American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Counseling Association, the American Psychiatric Association, the American Psychological Association, the National Association of School Psychologists, and the National Association of Social Workers, together representing more than 477,000 health and mental health professionals, have all taken the position that homosexuality is not a mental disorder and thus there is no need for a 'cure.' ...health and mental health professional organizations do not support efforts to change young people's sexual orientation through 'reparative therapy' and have raised serious concerns about its potential to do harm.</strong></div>

And yet many of our most talented performers have had to remain closeted or ambiguous for fear of having their livelihoods threatened.<br><br>But things are changing. Come for a night of poetry where some of our openly gay and upcoming poets read you the beautiful words they have penned birthed from within the ecstatic, the agonies and even the mundanities of their lives and discuss with you how their sexual orientation impacts their works as poets.

This might be one of it's first kind in Singapore.<br><br>I have this feeling that MDA has started to be more accepting than before, especially when SommerSturm and Mysterious Skin were both approved to be screen in Cathay Cineleisure (One of the most gay-friendly theatre around).<br><br>Are we seeing a history here? let's keep our fingers crossed and hope that the rest of the programmes will be run successfully.<br><br>For pictures of this event, pls see:<br><br>http://www.plu.sg/main/index2.htm<br><br></div>

As the Adlus anniversary is a private by-invitation only event please write to Nick for an invitation. </blockquote>On the contrary, there are some unhappiness with ADLUS members for IndigNation to include their annual bash into the IndigNation's programme. Within the gay community, there's still this diversity when it comes to "open" or "closet". Putting ADLUS bash as an event (open to media coverage) might "force" the more closeted gays away from their traditional annual bash.<br><br>I used to be part of the group, played volleyball every week with the group.

This does not mean that the volunteer acquired HIV infection in his role as a volunteer.<br><br>Our investigations have also revealed that the other four individuals only started volunteering some time after they were diagnosed with HIV infection.<br><br>AfA runs the Anonymous HIV testing and counselling site at which it is claimed the five tested positive. We would definitely know of volunteers who test positive, and we can therefore categorically state that at most only one of our volunteers tested positive after becoming a volunteer.<br><br>We emphasise that AfA does not require volunteers to undergo HIV testing before recruitment, or at any other juncture during their involvement with the organisation. Doing so will violate the principle of non-discrimination on the basis of HIV status, as well as the basic rights of any individual, volunteer or otherwise.<br><br>If any of our volunteers would like to have an HIV test, they are treated like any other client at the Anonymous testing and counselling site.<br><br>If any of our volunteers test positive, our response will not be to blame and chastise him or her, but to ensure that they receive the best medical and psychological support.  If they express a desire to continue offering their help, we will not turn them away.<br><br>If we hear of any volunteer repeatedly engaging in high risk behaviour, we will investigate the matter and ask the person to leave the organization if the allegations are substantiated.<br><br></div>

Such training includes providing detailed information about sexual health and safer sex behaviour. Volunteers are expected to maintain the highest standards of personal behaviour in this regard.<br><br>Reminders and updates are periodically sent out to volunteers from the MSM Outreach Programme as well as other programmes in relation to practising safer sex and other matters.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>TNP allegation #3:<br><br>Â“There is a possibility, no matter how remote, that these young male volunteers are coming forward because they see the MSM outreach programme as another avenue for them to meet other gay menÂ”. Volunteers are having unsafe sex because Â“they can't resist the temptationÂ” and that Â“when they pull down their zips, their brains also dropÂ”<br><br>FACT:<br><br>Volunteers may have different reasons for sacrificing their time and energy to the cause of AIDS prevention. Some may have friends and loved ones who have contracted the infection and died. Others volunteer because they want to contribute to society.<br><br>We are sure that their motives are honourable and decent. Our volunteers are selfless, hardworking, committed and responsible individuals who do their best to raise awareness of safer sex and who would protect themselves and others.<br><br>To say that volunteers are willing to undergo rigorous training, selection and monitoring in order to meet others for ignoble reasons is ludicrous.

To question the intentions of volunteers who spend time with distraught clients is an affront to the dedication of volunteers and counsellors everywhere, and demonstrates the accusers' ignorance of the nature and purpose of counselling.<br><br>AfA volunteers who handle clients have to undergo a screening process and comprehensive training before they take on duties on their own.<br><br></div>

"People have had a year<br>of legal marriage in Massachusetts to see how ending marriage<br>discrimination helps gay and lesbian families and hurts no one."<br><br>During 2003, Massachusetts' high court ruled that gay couples in that<br>state could get married, which they began doing in 2004. Following that<br>decision, 11 states passed anti-gay marriage amendments, and poll data<br>showed a slip in support for marriage rights.<br><br>The poll also showed a slight increase in religious groups' support for<br>marriage rights.<br><br>The poll questions were part of a broader study of national issues that<br>may face the incoming US Supreme Court nominee.

            <div class='col-md body'>This is found in a Thai newspaper..<br><br><strong>10 Aug 2005<br>The Nation newspaper, Thailand<br>Opinion section<br><br>40 years of Singapore's nationhood<br><br>Singapore will celebrate its 40th anniversary of nation-building today<br>with a great spectacle that perfectly symbolises the story of its<br>economic success and the social harmonisation among its ethnically<br>diverse population. Forty years ago, Singapore separated from Malaysia<br>with an uncertain future. Today, Singapore has emerged as one of the<br>most developed economies of Asia an object of envy among its<br>neighbours.<br><br>Forty years of independence has witnessed a gradual process of<br>Singapore's national identity construction. Reborn in the age of Cold<br>War, Singapore imagined its sense of nationhood as a society where<br>political and economic centralisation was looked to as a prerequisite<br>of national progress. This aspect of Singaporean nationhood responded<br>well to the Cold War norms whereby one-man rule was believed to be able<br>to achieve rapid economic and social development.<br><br>In the 1990s, the promotion of economic nationalism that became<br>foundational to Singapore's national identity in the early years was<br>transformed into a more internationally-oriented economy with an<br>attempt to enlarge its economic presence on the global stage.<br><br>Singaporean corporations have played a predominant role in<br>strengthening the local economy not only in laying strong business<br>foundations domestically but being assertive in international trade<br>through overseas investments too. Singapore's economic success also has<br>very much to do with the government's support for the private sector<br>and the maximum use of human resources in ultimately placing Singapore<br>in the world-class league.<br><br>Throughout the four decades of nation-building, Singaporeans have<br>enjoyed a high living standard and been voted the best city in Asia,<br>alongside Tokyo, in terms of quality of life. It is known as one of the<br>most globalised cities in the world on the basis of its superb<br>infrastructure and the dependence on state-of-the-art technology<br>connecting it to the global network.<br><br>Singapore has retained its status of one of the world's largest oil<br>processing centres. Singapore ranks among the top three of the world's<br>busiest seaports. In the aviation sector, Singapore International<br>Airline has been voted the world's best carrier for 10 consecutive<br>years by the Travel and Leisure Magazine and offered the fourth<br>position by the World Airline Award of 2005. Changi International<br>Airport has also been listed as the most efficient airport in the<br>world.<br><br>Singapore is eager to declare itself as the global hub of various kinds<br>of business. It houses the world's best R&amp;D operation in biomedical and<br>pharmaceutical sciences. Despite its lack of water resources, Singapore<br>has been chosen to lead the world research on water recycling and<br>desalination of water. Singapore has truly become a preferred<br>international meeting point and a favorite regional and international<br>headquarters for many multinational conglomerates.<br><br>Here, business achievements were made possible due to the successful<br>policy of ethnic harmonisation. Singaporeans have been segregated at<br>birth into ethnic groups but conditioned to think of ethnic diversity<br>as one Singaporean-ness. The government has upheld a strict ethnic<br>pluralistic policy with a guaranty of a freedom of expression of ethnic<br>identities. Apparently, during the National Day speech, the prime<br>minister is expected to give his remarks in English, Chinese and Malay.<br><br>However, what is so extraordinary about the 40th year anniversary of<br>Singapore is not about its socio-economic accomplishments.<br><br>This year's National Day slogan, "The Future is Ours to Make" loudly<br>conveys a message of a higher level of political openness. Since Prime<br>Minister Goh Chok Tong stepped down in August 2004, his successor, Lee<br>Hsien Loong who is the son of Singapore's founding father Lee Kuan Yew,<br>has adopted a more liberal approach in the handling of both domestic<br>and foreign affairs.<br><br>A greater political openness is closely related to improvement in<br>certain aspects of social and political life of Singapore, such as<br>political participation, national pride, success values and social<br>mobility. In the past, Singaporean society was reluctant to talk about<br>politics. Nowadays, people more openly discuss government policies.<br><br>A emerging new political model also means that the government has<br>loosened grip on some social issues. Though law and order is still in<br>place, Singapore is no longer "sanitised and lifeless" society, much<br>the butt of jokes in the past. Nightlife is ever more vibrant to serve<br>the need of globalised consumers. <span style="color: red;">And although homosexuality remains a taboo subject within Singapore's society, the gay community is<br>increasingly visible and seeking to augment its voice in politics. </span><br><br>Ideologically, the new perspective of Singaporean politics sits<br>comfortably with nation-building in a capitalist economy a wonderful<br>reason for Singaporeans to rejoice the National Day this year.<br><br>Dr Pavin Chachavalpongpun is a Singapore-based Thai academic.</strong><br></div>

As for alcoholism and drug abuse, it harms the individual as well, but if u want to tell me homosexuality is harmful because it helps spread AIDS i suggest u reconsider your argument because loose straight people help spread AIDS as well.<br><br>so only if it leads to a case where something happens to the detriment of another individual, your saying that "liking for the same gender, if not corrected, will lead to lust and sex with the same sex." is in the same vein as "Quick temper, if unchecked, can lead to murder" is simply wrong. A quick look at the logic doesn't even hold up to scrutiny, because in the case of a quick temper, another individual loses out at his expense, but that doesn't happen in lust and sex with the same sex does it?<br><br>I think the problem u people have is that in your own minds u think of sex with the same sex as being a crime on par with murder. That is definately bigoted, and heterosexist. Seriously, what are u? Neanderthals?</div>
