The reason we OWE having only some humans homosexual is because these are natural instinctive feelings! you can't force a straight person to have feelings for someone of the same sex as much as u can't force a gay person to have feelings for someone of the opposite sex. It has NOTHING to do with heterosexism denouncing being gay as wrong or homosexual acts as unnatural. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>The introduction of homosexual marriages will NOT threaten heterosexual reproduction. Why should it? Straight people will still have sex and have babies. The number of gay people aren't big enuf to threaten the survival numbers of our species. Besides, u just claimed in another post that u aren't talking about species numbers but moral breakdown. Fine, I give it to u that morality is a touchy topic depending on what u consider right or wrong, but this is evidence that u DID talk about homosexuality threatening the species' survival numbers and I am here to tell u that you are wrong about that. Because the mathemical possibility just rules out either one sort of sexual preference totally overwhelming the other. U are going to have straight people, u are going to have gay people. You won't have an excess of gay people, ever, because thats how nature controls things. Period.<br><br>the only thing heterosexist does is to make people who are gay feel uncomfortable in coming out and lead miserable lives trying to be "normal"</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>So people, tell me. How does one argue against someone who keeps making unsubstantiated claims, who doesn't provide any evidence of his own, who hopes that the failure of his opponents to provide sufficent and satisfactory evidence as substantiation of his claims? How does one debate with someone who is not playing clean, who resorts to the most far-fetched of accusations of his opponents sending him a virus just to win an online argument? To be honest I couldn't care less if this were an argument about trivial things, but we have here something that affects society as a whole, something that would make the quality of some people's lives better or worse, which is why I put in so much time replying and providing evidence. On the other hand, PRP sits there and make short, unsubstantiated claims and statements, and expects to get away with it? He gets a virus, which, I ask u, who hasn't gotten one b4? And he BLAMES ME?! How do u think I feel agruing against someone as dirty and lowdown as him? I would walk away if the topic on debate here wasn't as important to society as a whole. I don't like fighting dirty, I fight fair. If I say something, I show evidence why I think so, and I show it to EVERYONE here. PRP on the other hand, doesn't! He simply fights dirty.<br>"For fairness, righteousness &amp; kindness"??? He has neither been fair, not righteous, and definately NOT kind. If thats not hypocriticism, WHAT IS? People, u BE the JUDGE.</div>

Just to say that homosexuality can be found in nature. So far, homosexuality can be found in the animal kingdom...<br><br>And, dont worry ah... There's this saying in the gay circle:<br><br>1) Don't fall in love with straight<br>2) Don't fall in love with those who are confused (closeted? fear?)<br>3) Don't fall in love with bi-sexual (oops, a bit biased... ha... but societal pressure might force them to get married... But be careful, the hike in HIV cases were caused mainly by the sharp increase in this group)<br><br>Most gays get to know each other through gay websites, social activities and inner circles... And they will not invest their emotions unless they know there's reciprocity...<br><br>If there's a problem, it might most likely come from the younger ones who are still denying their gayness but kept having to confront this attraction they have with the same gender.<br><br>If this ever happens to you, just tell them that you are straight, and you can't reciprocate the feelings, they will most likely back-off...

The reality is that homosexuality is not an illness. It does not require treatment and is not changeable.<br><br>However, not all gay, lesbian, and bisexual people who seek assistance from a mental health professional want to change their sexual orientation. Gay, lesbian, and bisexual people may seek psychological help with the coming out process or for strategies to deal with prejudice, but most go into therapy for the same reasons and life issues that bring straight people to mental health professionals.<br><br>What About So-Called "Conversion Therapies"?<br><br>Some therapists who undertake so-called conversion therapy report that they have been able to change their clients' sexual orientation from homosexual to heterosexual. Close scrutiny of these reports however show several factors that cast doubt on their claims. For example, many of the claims come from organizations with an ideological perspective which condemns homosexuality. Furthermore, their claims are poorly documented. For example, treatment outcome is not followed and reported overtime as would be the standard to test the validity of any mental health intervention.<br><br>The American Psychological Association is concerned about such therapies and their potential harm to patients. In 1997, the Association's Council of Representatives passed a resolution reaffirming psychology's opposition to homophobia in treatment and spelling out a client's right to unbiased treatment and self-determination. Any person who enters into therapy to deal with issues of sexual orientation has a right to expect that such therapy would take place in a professionally neutral environment absent of any social bias.<br><br>And 2/3 of world psychologists are from US. They had denounced the use of reparative therapy, similar to the Brits and Chinese.<br><br>What medical/psychological help are you referring to? I'm a psychologist by training. Shouldn't I know about it if a psychological cure has been found?<br></strong></blockquote>You seem to be desparately clinging to the US as the ONLY and FINAL ARBITER in the psychological understanding and treatment - (medical or otherwise) - of HOMOSEXUALS; and perhaps with your statement that you are a psychologist by training, can one assume you have graduated from the US, and which explains for your fondness towards the APA ?<br><br>As was mentioned before, US psychological qualifications, nor methods of treatment, nor training and thinking are accepted nor recognised as the FINAL GOSPEL by the Singapore authorities, and most authorities across the globe.<br><br>So what if 2/3 of the WorldÂ’s psychologists are from the USA Â– does it prove that there are more Americans with psychological problems, or that psychological consultations is similar to seeing a regular GP, OR simply that it is easier to graduate as a psychologist then in any other field ?<br><br>Do you realize that India has the biggest output of degree holders, but what is their status in the world order ?<br><br>So what if you are a psychologist by training ?<br><br>Is that suppose to intimidate my position or does it make you an exclusive authority ?<br><br>If it is of any help in this discussion, there are at least two psychiatrist, three psychologists and five doctors in my family tree, and there are casual friends within my own generation, who are practicing psychiatrists too.<br><br>Most of my relations have their basic degrees in medicine from NUS, and have completed post-graduate education overseas - Australia, UK, and USA.<br><br>While the US may be in the forefront of medicine and science, their approach is not necessarily approved nor accepted by others in the same fraternity.<br><br>In any case, professional courtesy has been extended as a basic rule.<br><br></div>
