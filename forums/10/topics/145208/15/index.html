But is religion the sole explanation for morality? But for those without religion? Do you intend to show that all of those without religions are immoral? So if they do not follow laws as dictated by religion, how to understand their morality framework?<br><br>[b]Criticisms of Kohlberg </strong><br><strong>Measurement Criticisms</strong><br>There have been many criticisms of Kohlberg's theory of moral development and his methods.<br><br>The first criticizes his means of measuring levels of moral reasoning.<br><br>Some critics claim that <strong>the use of hypothetical situations skews the results because it measures abstract rather than concrete reasoning. </strong><br><br>When children (and some adults) are presented with situations out of their immediate experience, they turn to rules they have learned from external authorities for answers, rather than to their own internal voice.<br><br>Therefore, young children base their answers on rules of "right" and "wrong" they have learned from parents and teachers (Stages 1 and 2 according to Kohlberg's theory).<br><br>If young children are presented with situations familiar to them, on the other hand, they often show care and concern for others, basing their moral choices on the desire to share the good and maintain harmonious relations, placing them in Stage 3 or 4 (which Kohlberg claimed was impossible at their age).<br><br>Therefore, the criticism is that his measuring tool is faulty - people actually operate differently in real life situations.<br><br><strong>The next criticism is based on the "social desirability" bias that confounds hypothetical based research questions. </strong><br><br>Kohlberg's emphasis on abstract reasoning in his research creates confounds in which habitual juvenile delinquents can score at a higher stage of moral development than well-behaved children.<br><br>Because behaviors are not considered and reasoning is determined through hypothetical situations, children who behave in immoral ways may be able to answer hypothetical moral dilemmas in a more advanced fashion than better-behaved children who think less abstractly.<br><br>Early criticisms of Kohlberg's lack of attention to behaviors led Kohlberg to add an emphasis on moral action to his Just Community educational program.<br><br><strong>For those who are looking for concrete help in developing moral values in children, however, <span style="color: red;">Kohlberg's theory is still of little practical use</span></strong>.<br><br><strong>"Universality" criticisms and Gender criticisms </strong><br>The next criticims attack Kohlberg's claim that his stages of moral development are universal, applying equally to all human beings (and genders) across cultural divisions.<br><br>Carol Gilligan was the first to attack this aspect of Kohlberg's theory, pointing out that <strong>there were difference between men and women in how they reasoned morally</strong>.<br><br><strong>Gilligan pointed out that all of Kohlberg's original subjects were male, as was Kohlberg himself</strong>, and that they therefore failed to place a high value on the morality of care, sacrifice and community. (All excellent point!)<br><br><strong>Western Bias Criticism </strong><br>Another criticism pointed out that Kohlberg, as a member of the educated, elite, white, male, Western culture, viewed individual autonomy and justice as the premier moral values.<br><br>He even went so far as to equate morality with justice (ignoring other moral values such as courage, self-control, empathy, etc.).<br><br>Members of the working and rural classes, however, tend to have a more communitarian approach to life, viewing the common good as the highest value, promoting care and harmonious relationships over individual justice. (Women, having been relegated to "lower class" status for centuries, may have developed a more communitarian approach to life for that reason, rather than simply because they are female.)<br><br><strong><span style="color: red;">Non-Western</span> and tribal societies also frequently  <span style="color: red;">see the community as more important than the individual</span>.</strong><br><br><strong>"Individualistic" Criticisms </strong><br>According to Kohlberg's upper-class Western view of moral reasoning, communitarian morality is doomed to rest forever at a lower stage of development (Stages 3 and 4).<br><br><strong>This view disregards the possibility that communitarian morality may be as advanced as individualistic morality, if not more so</strong>.<br><br>It also can be seen to place Western culture at the top of the scale, with little room for cross-cultural inclusion, although Buddhist philosophy and Taoism can be viewed as postconventional.<br><br>Although Kohlberg insisted that his theory was culturally inclusive, he found little empirical evidence to back this up.<br><br>In all of his interviews, only a few people showed Stage 5 reasoning, and nearly all were well-educated Westerners.<br><br>Stage 6 reasoning was never substantiated in interviews; Kohlberg created it as an "ideal" and pointed to examples such as Gandhi to support its existence.<br><br>After a tremendous amount of criticism over the fact that Stage 6 was purely hypothetical, Kohlberg removed it from the empirical stages but retained it as a "theoretical construct in the realm of philosophical speculation."<br><br>Despite equally heavy criticism, Kohlberg refused to remove Stage 5 from his system.<br><br><a href="http://www.candleinthedark.com/kohlberg.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.candleinthedark.com/kohlberg.html</a><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>It will take a long while to defend the theory. It stated an ideal state of society. What's important in this theory is the understand of social contracts. Is euthanasia, abortion, capital punishment right or wrong? If you based it on laws, you will be forced into a certain position. But if u understand that all such cases much be judge on a case by case basis, you will understand where is he coming from.<br><br>The criticisms focus very much on how this has not been observed in the real world. Please be reminded that this theory was proposed some time back (and some as the criticisms). But with the progress of humanity, we can see more and more people gearing towards the liberal end and hence will use a social contract based reasoning rather than a rule and law based reasoning.<br><br>Maybe in 50 years time, we can find the lefties become more dominant than the righties.

but were there any POLITCAL issues related to the HOMOSEXUAL activities that YOU have CLAIMED this thread to be ?<br><br>Should it not be YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to prove the POLITICAL PERSPECTIVES on the HOMOSEXUAL ISSUES that you have raised ?<br><br>Should I be helping you to prove your preferred variety of HOMOSEXUAL positions in your postings ?<br><blockquote>:<strong><br>2) You suggested Heng to look at psychiatric studies, but you failed to accept how the current psychology/psychiatry community look at this issue </strong></blockquote>Do all discussion need to end in a concesus ?<br><br>Each of us have our own position, and if you can show the relevance of your postings to qualify your thread to have a POLITICAL PERSPECTIVE, perhaps we could see a concensus.<br><br>Can the Psychological/Psychiatric reports of HOMOSEXUALS prove your point of this HOMOSEXUAL THREAD having a POLITICAL PERSPECTIVE ?<br><blockquote>:<strong><br>3) You claim that gay genes cannot be passed on, but you went on to suggest that even handicapped, people of lower intelligence can negate their conditions  </strong></blockquote>Did I mention that handicapped people of lower intelligence can negate their conditions - and perhaps become LKY - or did my postings suggest that at least these handicap people will HELP THEMSELVES to overcome or NEGATE their condition ?<br><br>If you prefer to argue for the sake of argument, what is the point ?<br><blockquote>:<strong><br>4) You claim that Asian religion does not accept homosexuality, without addressing why scriptures from these religions did not mention anything about same-sex behaviours </strong></blockquote>Has the Singapore Education System deteriorated to the extent of spoon-feeding of specific facts ?<br><br>Have not all the reference sites that I have referred you to - concerning the great Religions of Christianity, Islam, Budhism, Hinduism - made references to HOMOSEXUALITY - and that such HOMOSEXUALITY is to be condemned ?<br><blockquote>:<strong><br>5) You claim that gays are not discriminated, but you are hurling insults after insults and also, you had not demonstrated that those national policies I've brought up are not discriminating gays </strong></blockquote>Will you care to read my text in reply to your post concerning discriminations in jobs, housing, and inheritance ?<br><br>Did I not address your repeated lamentation that only the HOMOSEXUAL Community has been discriminated ?<br><br>Did I not indicate that the NORMAL Bachelors and Spinsters are also discriminated by the same National Policies that have affected HOMOSEXUALS ?<br><br>"Claims of Insults " - is the last act of defense to one's untenable and desparate position in an argument, and is the most face saving way out of a cul-de-sac argument.<br><blockquote>:<strong><br>6) You claim that gays are abormal, but you failed to argue against APA's stance on this issue  </strong></blockquote>APA's stance is not GOD's Final Word on this issue - why are you so drawn to the liberal views of a Foreign Society ?<br><br>Should you not make such views relevant to your own community - not the narrow HOMOSEXUAL Community that you associate with, but to the larger community that you are tangled up with in your daily dealings ?<br><blockquote>:<strong><br>7) You claim that gays are unnatural, but you failed to show that why homosexualism can be found in animals (and these animals are not extinct even until today)  </strong></blockquote>Have you not heard of some sub-species that are designed to self-replicate and self-produce ?<br><br>Are you suggesting that HOMOSEXUALS can perform the same tasks of giving BIRTH to PREVENT SELF-EXTINCTION, by way of SEXUAL EFFORTS from two persons of the SAME SEX ?<br><br>If HOMOSEXUALS can perform this miraculous task as the sub-species have been design, then it will not be rude to say that HOMOSEXUALS are part of the SUB-SPECIES  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><blockquote>:<strong><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> "Tolerance of gays" will give way to "Promotion of homosexualism" when Psychologists had clearly articulated that "Change therapy" is dangerous.
