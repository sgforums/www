            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by PRP:</div><div class="quote_body">Are u an intellectual?Do u want to discuss rationally or to quarrel?<br><br>Yes,a person may has an inclination to becomes a homo when young.But if his parrent tell him that such behaviour is wrong and give him a right sex education,then he may not develop into gay when he grows up.But for u,u keep saying homo is born &amp; homo is  right.If the majority of the society accept your belief,then all youngsters who have homo inclination would not be taught  to change their sexual behaviour.<br><br>Is homosex a learned act?So am i a fool?<br><br></div></blockquote>Yup, you have proven to be a fool. At least according to scientific research.<br><br>There's no point arguing so passionately about something, but without reading up on the issue. Most people will realise their sexual orientation around the age of puberty, when their body started to change. As can be seen in other articles I've posted. Such sexual orientation cannot be changed, if you scrutinise the findings from "ex-gay" groups (these are your religious people), you will realised that nothing has changed. The so-called "successful" group is compose of people who has more and more "Denial".. They still cant rid themselves of the attraction towards the same sex, they are just denying themselves to lead a life that has been given to them.<br><br>The following is from APA public info website:<br><br><strong>Is Sexual Orientation a Choice?</strong><br>No, human beings can not choose to be either gay or straight. Sexual orientation emerges for most people in early adolescence without any prior sexual experience. Although we can choose whether to act on our feelings, psychologists do not consider sexual orientation to be a conscious choice that can be voluntarily changed.<br><br><strong>Can Therapy Change Sexual Orientation?</strong><br><br>No. Even though most homosexuals live successful, happy lives, some homosexual or bisexual people may seek to change their sexual orientation through therapy, sometimes pressured by the influence of family members or religious groups to try and do so. The reality is that homosexuality is not an illness. It does not require treatment and is not changeable.<br><br>However, not all gay, lesbian, and bisexual people who seek assistance from a mental health professional want to change their sexual orientation. Gay, lesbian, and bisexual people may seek psychological help with the coming out process or for strategies to deal with prejudice, but most go into therapy for the same reasons and life issues that bring straight people to mental health professionals.<br><br><strong>What About So-Called "Conversion Therapies"?</strong><br><br>Some therapists who undertake so-called conversion therapy report that they have been able to change their clients' sexual orientation from homosexual to heterosexual. Close scrutiny of these reports however show several factors that cast doubt on their claims. For example, many of the claims come from organizations with an ideological perspective which condemns homosexuality. Furthermore, their claims are poorly documented. For example, treatment outcome is not followed and reported overtime as would be the standard to test the validity of any mental health intervention.<br><br>The American Psychological Association is concerned about such therapies and their potential harm to patients. In 1997, the Association's Council of Representatives passed a resolution reaffirming psychology's opposition to homophobia in treatment and spelling out a client's right to unbiased treatment and self-determination. Any person who enters into therapy to deal with issues of sexual orientation has a right to expect that such therapy would take place in a professionally neutral environment absent of any social bias.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>News from Thailand. An attempt to reduce discrimination. Locally, we have the rather degrading "302" category to take care of gays, but then, most gays would rather not "out" themselves during medical classification for fear of being humiliated, discriminated.<br><br><strong>Thailand OKs Gay, Transsexual Soldiers<br>by 365Gay.com Newscenter Staff<br><br>(Bangkok) Thailand on Wednesday removed restrictions on gays and transsexuals serving in the military. Thailand has a draft but gays and transsexuals have been barred from serving under the "mental disorder" exemption.<br><br>All Thai men at the age of 20 are required by law to register to serve. Recruits are selected through a lottery system, but each year thousands of LGBT draftees are rejected. Wednesday the military announced that it was removing homosexuality and transgenderism from its list of mental disorders following years of complaints from the LGBT community that the ban was discriminatory.<br><br>The military said that the change was part of a program to keep up with a changing society. "The existing conscription law has been promulgated since 1954, when there were few homosexuals and transvestites, but society is changing very fast, so the army is in the process of amending the law and omitting those words from the certificate," said Lt. Gen. Arthorn Lohitkul, director general of the Army Reserve Command.<br><br>The campaign to amend the requirements for conscription was launched by LGBT civil activist Natee Theerarojnaphong. "No employer wants to hire anyone with a record of mental disorder to work in his company," Natee said, adding that people with mental disorders are also unable to make certain legal agreements.<br><br>A celebrity Thai-style kickboxer who underwent surgery to become a woman, Parinya Charoenphol, complained on local television after being exempt from the military. "The words 'mental disorder' marked on the certificate seriously affects our lives," said Parinya. Thailand is a Buddhist country where homosexuals, transvestites and transsexuals are largely tolerated. Gay and transvestite actors play key roles in Thai movies and television soap operas.<br><br>The change was hailed in the US by gays fighting for inclusion in the military.<br><br>"Neither sexual orientation nor gender identity has any impact on a service member's ability to get the job done," Steve Ralls, a spokesperson for the Servicemembers Legal Defense Network  told 365Gay.com. "The United States armed forces should follow the Thai military's example and place qualification above prejudice. Our armed forces should end to the military's unfair discrimination against lesbian, gay bisexual and transgender military personnel."<br><br>A bill is pending in Congress to repeal the military's ban and allow lesbian and gay Americans the opportunity to serve openly. A study done by the Government Accountability Office shows that more than 10,000 service members have been discharged over the last 10 years under "don't ask, don't tell".</strong><br></div>

Being gay is never fashionable. You will start to realise you are different once you hit puberty. While classmates of yours are busy looking at the opposite gender, you have to hide your inner feelings towards the same gender. If you are found out, you will be ostracised.<br><br>In fact, lots of gays do not ever want others to find out that they are gays.<br><br>If you have time, talk to your cousin, but without passing judgements.

            <div class='col-md body'>Your immediately wrong if you treat homosexuality as a fundamental mistake in the nature of things,you see, there are no mistakes in science and nature.<br><br>Some say homosexuality is a learned behaviour, other argue that it is its a part of a person's innate instincts.Common belief that it is a combination of the 2.<br><br>Sure, you can change the behaviour, as it is but just the execution of the thought. And since the mind controls the thought, the behaviour can similarily be controlled, but it is as far as that.<br><br>An individual may be able to repress his homosexuality by not acting out,and "learn" heterosexuality,but he is not forgotten of his original sexuality. That the behaviour can cease to exist but the thought which causes it remains.The problem with this arguement is that it treats homosexuality as a learned behaviour. Sure, it may be true, but if homosexuality is a learned behaviour, wouldnt heterosexuality  similarily be a learned behaviour too?<br><br>If you regard it as a matter of genes, then theres no arguement at all.They were born way, so were you and I, and neither of any of us did have a choice on who we wanted to be, and if we wanted to be something else, we had to repress our innermost, or rather our fundamental physiology.<br><br>Now that would be wrong<br></div>

In the past, we have Philosophy to do that. But then, in modern days, we have Sciences to help address these issues.<br><br>so far, we have not seen how did you construct your arguments. Rather, you have accepted that gays are wrong and refuse to read or listen to any comments that follow.<br><br>I do not need to show that you are a fool. The references I quoted help me to do the job. Hey wait, did you even read those articles? do u have any comments on those articles?</div>
