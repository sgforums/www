            <div class='col-md body'><br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by earthlings73:<strong><br>Heng did not invent the term Heterosexism. It's refer to the anti-gays sentiments at a societal level. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> I dont think it's fair to call someone bullshitting without doing a thorough research on this area.<br><br><a href="http://psychology.ucdavis.edu/rainbow/html/prej_defn.html" rel="nofollow">http://psychology.ucdavis.edu/rainbow/html/prej_defn.html</a><br><br>[b]Heterosexism     Around the same time, heterosexism began to be used as a term analogous to sexism and racism, describing an ideological system that denies, denigrates, and stigmatizes any nonheterosexual form of behavior, identity, relationship, or community (Herek, 1990). Using the term heterosexism highlights the parallels between antigay sentiment and other forms of prejudice, such as racism, antisemitism, and sexism.<br>Like institutional racism and sexism, heterosexism pervades societal customs and institutions. It operates through a dual process of invisibility and attack. Homosexuality usually remains culturally invisible; when people who engage in homosexual behavior or who are identified as homosexual become visible, they are subject to attack by society.<br><br>Examples of heterosexism in the United States include the continuing ban against lesbian and gay military personnel; widespread lack of legal protection from antigay discrimination in employment, housing, and services; hostility to lesbian and gay committed relationships, recently dramatized by passage of federal and state laws against same-gender marriage; and the existence of sodomy laws in more than one-third of the states.<br><br>Although usage of the two words has not been uniform, homophobia has typically been employed to describe individual antigay attitudes and behaviors whereas heterosexism has referred to societal-level ideologies and patterns of institutionalized oppression of non-heterosexual people. </strong><br><br>And she did not psychoanalyse you.. Psychoanalysis is a field in Psychology found by Freud.. I will talk about it a little bit later..<br><br>But then, there are scientific studies to suggest that homophobic males do react sexually when they are exposed to pictures of male genitals.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><a href="http://www.oogachaga.com/downloads/homophobia_and_homosexual_arousal.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.oogachaga.com/downloads/homophobia_and_homosexual_arousal.pdf</a>[/b]</blockquote>No, certainly the word Â‘HETEROSEXISMÂ’ existed before Heng@ and certainly before earthlings came into this World.<br><br>Unfortunately, my response was to correct Heng@ Â‘s wonderful attempt to B.S. with his Â“part definitionÂ” of the word Â‘HETEROSEXISMÂ’ Â– which is repeated as follow :<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="color: blue;">HETEROSEXISM is...<br>......It's the idea that lesbian, gay and bisexual people are demanding "special status" when they ask for basic civil rights...... </span></span><br><br>Compare this part definition from Heng@ to yours, it certainly make more B.S. out of a small mole hill to justify basic civil rights for Gays.<br><br>Incidentally, it seems that despite the Gays being empathized and accepted by the majority of Singaporeans, and with their Â‘unusualÂ’ attitudes and life style being tolerated and accommodated Â– even by the Government, it seems that Â“<strong>given a MILIMETER</strong>, you Â– the Gays Â– <strong>are now pushing to have a whole KILOMETER </strong>Â” .<br><br></div>

How did you manage to come to this conclusion while reading the website you had posted?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>But thanks for highlighting this website.. =p Some excerpts from the website:<br><br>[b]Same-sex love was celebrated in Chinese art, many examples of which have survived the book burnings of the Cultural Revolution. Though no large statues are known to still exist, many hand scrolls and paintings on silk can be found in private collections[2].<br><br>In the year 1944, the scholar Sun Cizhou published a work stated that one of the most famous ancient Chinese poets, Qu Yuan, was a lover of his King. Sun cited the poetry of Qu Yuan to prove his claim. In Qu Yuan's most important work Li Sao (Sorrow of parting), Qu Yuan called himself a beautiful man (or woman, mei ren). A word he used to describe his king was used at that time by women to characterize their lovers.<br><br>Since the policy of Reform and Opening Up in 1979, the communist party has been loosening its control over this kind of behavior. But the practice of homosexuality is still libeled as a "moldering life style of capitalism".<br><br>A notable change occurred during the late 1990s and early 2000s, when sodomy was decriminalized in 1997, and the new Chinese Classification and Diagnostic Criteria of Mental Disorders removed homosexuality from its list of mental illnesses on April 20, 2001. The situation has continued to evolve in 2004. Many consider the magazine "Menbox" [3] to be a gay magazine in all but name. Recently, a transsexual woman, Chen Lili was allowed to compete in the China selection pageant for the Miss Universe competition.<br><br>An internet survey in 2000 showed that Chinese people are becoming more tolerant towards homosexuality: among the 10,792 surveyed, 48.15% were in favor, 30.9% disapproved, 14.46% were uncertain, and 7.26% were indifferent. There are no radical conservatives or radical liberation activists, so gay-bashing is rare. But some scholars complain that the government is too indifferent on this issue, doing nothing to promote the situation of homosexuality in China. During the 2002 Gay Games, only 2 persons from the mainland were sent to take part in, and apart from gay websites the media gave little coverage to the event. Many gay men admit having unsafe sex, and more than one sex partner, which worsens the spread of AIDS in China, because the Chinese government makes little effort to educate citizens about the danger of AIDS among gay people. The authorities still refuse to promote either gay issues or gay rights in China. Although there is no explicit law against homosexuality or same-sex acts between consenting adults, neither are there laws protecting gays from discrimination, nor are there any gay rights organizations in the PRC.</strong><br><br>I do not disagree with you on certain principles:<br><br>To address the issue, you have to recognise the issue. I have posted the article about Asia-Pac's efforts to recognise the need to address that special efforts need to be targetted at the gay comm. But then, to address this, the government need to realise that there are gays in the society, which is by itself an affirmation of the existence of gays. But then, it's important to educate gays about safe sex practices.<br><br>But I disagree with you on one issue:<br><br>The position from accepting that there are gays and special efforts are needed to address the issue do not mean that they are targetting at changing their orientation.. This is a logical leap.. Nothing in the article I've read suggested such a stand at all..[/b]</blockquote>As was mentioned in my post that you have quoted, the Communist Government of China had little choice but to realize that the AIDS epidemic had to be fought by getting all the HOMOSEXUALS to surface into the OPEN.<br><br>Having instituted programs to accommodate the HOMOSEXUALS, and to encourage their appearance from hiding, it <strong>does not </strong>necessarily mean that HOMOSEXUAL activities are to be encouraged and its PRACTICES to be PROMOTED.<br><br>There is a difference between "ACCOMMODATING " and "PROMOTING" .<br><br>Surely, you are NOT trying to prove my point that when Â‘a MILLIMETER is given, you want to have a WHOLE KILOMETERÂ’ ?<br><br></div>

According the scholar Ji Yun of the Qing Dynasty, already at the very beginning Huang Di (The Yellow Emperor, 2697? - 2597? BCE), legendary king and founder of the Chinese culture, had male lovers. This is naturally not very trustworthy because whether there was really a person called Huang Di is not very clear. Two notable royal examples come from a formulaic expression, yÃƒÂºtÃƒÂ¡o duÃƒ nxiÃƒÂ¹ (Ã¤Â½Â™Ã¦Â¡ÂƒÃ¦Â–Â­Ã¨Â¢Â–). YÃƒÂºtÃƒÂ¡o, or "the leftover peach", recorded in Hanfeizi, speaks of Mi Zixia (Ã¥Â½ÂŒÃ¥Â­Â�Ã§Â‘Â•), a beautiful youth cherished by Duke Ling of Wei (Ã¨Â¡Â›Ã©Â�ÂˆÃ¥Â…) who once shared an already bitten but very delicious peach with the duke, who appreciated the gesture (although once the growing Mi Zixia lost his beauty, the duke looked back on this event and said Mi was being insincere [1].) DuÃƒ nxiÃƒÂ¹, or "breaking the sleeve", refers to Emperor Ai of Han China's act of cutting his sleeve, on which his adored male concubine Dongxian (Ã¨Â‘Â£Ã¨Â³Â¢) was sleeping, in order not to wake him.<br><br>Scholar Pan Guangdan (Ã¦Â½Â˜Ã¥Â…Â‰Ã¦Â—Â¦) came to the conclusion that nearly every emperor in the Han Dynasty had one or more male sex partners. There are also descriptions of lesbians in some history books. It is believed homosexuality was popular in the Song, Ming and Qing dynasties. Chinese homosexuals did not experience high-profile persecution comparing with that was received by homosexuals in Europe during the Middle Ages.</strong><br><br>Then, China borrowed the values/morals from the West, which includes homophobia:<br><br><strong>The first law against homosexuals in China went into effect in 1740. There was no record in the history as to how effectively the law was enforced. The more devastating thing for Chinese homosexuals was, ironically, the enlightenment that came after the Self-Strengthening Movement, when homophobia was imported to China along with Western science and philosophy.</strong><br><br>Now China had delisted homosexuality from their list of mental disorders, and decriminalised homosexuality.. And mind you, as a communist regime, they are mindful about carefully research into such areas through scientific means before deciding on what position they should take.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> China, as far as I know, is one country that will not Kow Tow to another country in the politics of the modern world..  [/b]</blockquote>China had delisted homosexuality from their list of mental disorders and decriminalized homosexuality Â– only for the purpose of combating the AIDS epidemic that will inflict more then a MILLION in their midst.<br><br>The China Government are filled with Persons who are REALISTS and PRAGMATISTS; and when the AIDS epidemic is licked, the PURITAN ideals of a HEALTHY lifestyle will surely be revived.<br><br>Another Cultural Revolution will surely straigthen some who prefer to be bent.<br><br></div>

Most Buddhist schools construe this to mean that monks and nuns are to practice celibacy. However, there has been a diversity of opinions on this matter ranging from strict vows of celibacy to Japanese Buddhist schools that taught heterosexuality was to be avoided for clergy.<br><br>For laypersons today, this precept mainly applies to adultery. However, wide ranges of interpretations are possible about what exactly constitutes "sexual misconduct" and therefore the different schools of Buddhism - or even different individual monks - at different periods of time have offered varying opinions.<br><br>Interpretations of what constitutes misconduct include sex outside marriage (relatively modern idea), sex with another person without the consent of your life partner(s), or the historically prevalent view that it was limited to describe rape, incest and bestiality.<br><br><span style="color: red;">Buddhist schools condemning homosexuality is a recent development and there is no scriptural basis upon which it is to be condemned. Prior to colonialism under Abrahamic countries homosexuality was sanctified by Buddhist leaders throughout Asia.</span><br><br>Different countries held various views, for example in China where believers often belong to Confucianism as well, exclusive homosexuality was discouraged because it would prevent a son from carrying out his Confucian religious duty to reproduce, all at the same time non-exclusive homosexuality was permissible and widely practiced. Monogamy was an unsual and foreign idea to many Asians until contact with the West.<br><br>Within Japanese traditions homosexuality was said to have been started by the Bodhisattva Manjusri of wisdom and the sage Kukai while in China it is attributed to the Yellow Emperor, the father of China.<br><br><span style="color: red;">In India, Tibet, China, Southeast Asia and Japan, areas where Buddhism was or remains one of the chief religions their cultures have been historically unconcerned with the gender of sexual activity or the object of desire.</span><br><br><strong>Taoism</strong><br><br>Homosexuality is not forbidden by the Taoist Holy Books (the Tao Te Ching and the Zhuang Zi). However, many Taoists believe that exclusive homosexuality is wrong, but many others see nothing wrong with it.<br><br>To understand why this is, one must understand Taoism's intertwined status with Confucianism and Buddhism in many adherents. A great many Taoists combine Confucian thought that requires sons to further the family lineage by reproduction.<br><br><span style="color: red;">Both Taoism and Buddhism do not forbid exclusive homosexuality but Confucianism did by insisting that a sonÂ’s religious duty included reproduction to further the family lineage. Taoists who find nothing wrong with exclusive homosexuality usually do not believe in Confucianism or have dropped their requirement of heterosexual relations due to medicinal advancements that allow reproduction without such sex, using IVF and/or surrogacy.</span><br><br>This has been the traditional view of homosexuality in Taoism, that homosexual acts in it self are not wrong but all men are still required to reproduce. For example, Taoists may have homosexual relations as long as they continue the family tree by having a child with at least one woman.<br><br><strong>Hinduism</strong><br><br>Monk performing auparashtika on a visiting prince. Khajuraho, Madhya Pradesh.Main article: Homosexuality and Hinduism<br><br>The Indian Kama Sutra written in the third century CE contains passages describing hijras performing oral sex to men with tips to maximize pleasure. Prior to British colonization of India hijras were not the only homosexual activity, many engaged in a form of pederasty which was openly practiced by Muslims and Sikhs in the north while being overlooked in the south by Hindus. The terms gand-mara (anus beater), gando (ass-taker) and ganga ("anuser") were coined during this time period.

(All excellent point!)<br><br><strong>Western Bias Criticism </strong><br>Another criticism pointed out that Kohlberg, as a member of the educated, elite, white, male, Western culture, viewed individual autonomy and justice as the premier moral values.<br><br>He even went so far as to equate morality with justice (ignoring other moral values such as courage, self-control, empathy, etc.).<br><br>Members of the working and rural classes, however, tend to have a more communitarian approach to life, viewing the common good as the highest value, promoting care and harmonious relationships over individual justice. (Women, having been relegated to "lower class" status for centuries, may have developed a more communitarian approach to life for that reason, rather than simply because they are female.)<br><br><strong><span style="color: red;">Non-Western</span> and tribal societies also frequently  <span style="color: red;">see the community as more important than the individual</span>.</strong><br><br><strong>"Individualistic" Criticisms </strong><br>According to Kohlberg's upper-class Western view of moral reasoning, communitarian morality is doomed to rest forever at a lower stage of development (Stages 3 and 4).<br><br><strong>This view disregards the possibility that communitarian morality may be as advanced as individualistic morality, if not more so</strong>.<br><br>It also can be seen to place Western culture at the top of the scale, with little room for cross-cultural inclusion, although Buddhist philosophy and Taoism can be viewed as postconventional.<br><br>Although Kohlberg insisted that his theory was culturally inclusive, he found little empirical evidence to back this up.<br><br>In all of his interviews, only a few people showed Stage 5 reasoning, and nearly all were well-educated Westerners.<br><br>Stage 6 reasoning was never substantiated in interviews; Kohlberg created it as an "ideal" and pointed to examples such as Gandhi to support its existence.<br><br>After a tremendous amount of criticism over the fact that Stage 6 was purely hypothetical, Kohlberg removed it from the empirical stages but retained it as a "theoretical construct in the realm of philosophical speculation."<br><br>Despite equally heavy criticism, Kohlberg refused to remove Stage 5 from his system.<br><br><a href="http://www.candleinthedark.com/kohlberg.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.candleinthedark.com/kohlberg.html</a><br><br></div>

Look here, not all homosexuals are flaming queens (not that i have anything against flaming queens), most are still closet cases, not revealing thier sexualities due to discrimination.

It wouldnt be because they were straight and found that being homosexual was more fashionable.<br><br>What im saying here is that people dont turn gay, because sexuality itself is innate, whether straight or gay.<br><br>now the question to ask here for all the straight people in this thread would be, if being gay was fashionable, would you turn gay?
