            <div class='col-md body'>basically, there is no right or wrong to be gay, just as there is no right or wrong in being straight. Its not a conscious choice, not unless a straight person decides to live a gay lifestyle or a gay person decides to live a straight lifestyle. Its foolish on both cases and its wrong, because u're living a lie.</div>
