Our thoughts are that, they might be looking at a bond issued by say, Temasek, which has typically in previous years averaged returns more than 4 percent. So we can probably enjoy higher returns in that way," said Alvin Liew, economist at UOB Treasury Research.<br><br>Singapore Government Bonds are currently yielding between a modest 3 percent and 4 percent, prompting some analysts to suggest a benchmark that included a guaranteed portion.<br><br>Some economists suggested that the government could provide a fixed 1-2 percent base, plus a variable component tied to the Singapore Government Bond yield.<br><br>As the rates would be pegged to the market, fluctuations in returns could be expected.<br><br>"It is conceivable that CPF members can expect, in the long term, maybe more than 4 percent per annum. On the risk side, if these new rates are variable and it falls below 4 percent, that is a worry for CPF members," said Roy Varghese, Director of Financial Planning, IPAC.<br><br>The changes to the CPF interest rates will be effective in 2008.<br><br>They will cost the government S$700 million a year, initially.<br><br>Meanwhile, the government also wants to provide an "extreme longevity protection" for citizens by making annuities compulsory for those below 50 years old.<br><br>Said Dr Ng: "We are basically looking at <span style="color: red;"><strong>compulsory annuities </strong></span>to protect members from outliving their retirement savings. Let me first say that we'll consult widely. We do not intend to, when we start this scheme, to put the major proportion of your minimum sum into annuities. That's the first thing that needs to be said.<br><br>"In fact, a smaller proportion of your minimum sum will be put into annuities, so the major portion of your minimum sum will still be drawn out, drawn down by members at the draw-down age."<br><br>An example of this annuity is that the CPF member pays a basic premium of X dollars which goes into a pool.<br><br>That money will be paid out from age 85 - for life.<br><br>But if the member doesn't live till 85 years old, the money will then be <span style="color: red;"><strong>used to support others in the pool, who are still alive</strong></span>.<br><br>It's not determined if the CPF Board or private companies will administer the compulsory annuities scheme.<br><br>The Manpower Minister stressed that the basic idea of the compulsory annuities is to insure members for the latter part of their lives, that is after 85 years old.<br><br>The aim is to provide a subsistence payout amount first, of possibly between $250 and $300 monthly.<br><br>Dr Ng said more details on this scheme will be announced next month.<br><br>On the additional one percentage point interest for the first $60,000 in CPF members' combined accounts, Dr Ng said this will be placed in the Special Account and not the Ordinary Account.<br><br>He said: "These changes will help Singaporeans work longer, save more, and help give them a peace of mind for their golden years. It will significantly strengthen our economic and social system to better address the ageing population... These new tools, new aspects can be effective, it will give us a lot of hope and optimism as we move forward, even as we age."<br><br>Dr Ng said this will give Singapore a more responsive and robust system to address changes as the workforce ages.<br><br>The Manpower Minister said the extra one percentage bonus interest will not affect CPF members who are already investing their funds.<br><br>He added that "tens of billions" are still available for investing.<br><br>The government is not preventing members from investing their CPF funds. - CNA /ls </blockquote>look at their "solutions" to look after the aged..... your CPF!!!
