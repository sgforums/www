              <p>President<a class="topiclink" href="http://www.nypost.com/t/Richard_Nixon"> Richard Nixon </a>didn't
              want any Jewish members of his staff involved in policy-making
              decisions on Israel -- including legendary national security adviser
              Henry Kissinger, formerly classified documents reveal.</p>
              <p>"No Jew can handle the Israeli thing," notes from a July 1971 meeting taken by Nixon's Chief-of-Staff Bob Haldeman read, the<a class="topiclink" href="http://www.nypost.com/t/Wall_Street_Journal"> Wall Street Journal </a>reported.</p>
              <p>Haldeman later wrote in another missive, "Forget the Jews. They're against [the administration]."</p>
              <p>Kissinger, the most powerful members of Nixon's team, tried
              to meddle in Israeli policy.</p>
              <p>Nixon also strongly hinted that his 
                reluctance to consider amnesty for Americans fled to Canada to 
                avoid the draft for Vietnam War was because so many 
                of them were Jewish.</p>
              <p>"I didn't notice many Jewish names returning from Vietnam on any of 
                those lists........... I don't know how the hell they avoid it,"</p>
              <p>"If 
                you look at the Canadian contingent, they were very 
                disproportionately Jewish. The deserters."</p>
              <p>"The Jews are just a very 
                aggressive and abrasive and obnoxious personality."</p>

              <p><br>malaysians are our traditional source, they arrived since the begining of industrialisation in Singapore, they have helped us to build the economy, I dun mind malaysians, cos they are in a way, cultured and orientated just like Singaporeans, moreover, they have lots of talent too.</p>
              <p>for FT, most also fly back home once a while, they also make money here and sent back...by the end of their few years contract or permit here, they go back as king and queen, so far different from slaves and serf, all thanks to Singapore, the land of gold and opportunities at the expend of locals</p>
