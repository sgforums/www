            <div class='col-md body'>Personally, I feel Singapore remain an independent country.  However, building strong ties with China or a Greater China, will not cause us any harm.  Not only will it favor us in terms of commerce, but also security in the region.  In the times ahead, I feel Singapore will require good friends, and China has not been a fickle friend so far.  Unlike the United States with every elections, will reevaluate our status.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This "Greater China" term is not defined well. It can mean seperated states like Hong Kong, or it can also mean a militaristic and political projection of power from the Chinese to beyond their borders. I do not agree to any country be called as part of "Greater China", it just doesn't make any sense and to the rest of the world, it may seem that China has a large and overriding presence in Asia. This may create stability issues especially in our "Islamic" region. I can't imagine China playing the role of the USA here.</div>
