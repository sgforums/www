The individual cells that lose their original functioning now turn cancerous. Better leave the cells as they are to function and grow healthy and that way they will grow into good cells looking after each cell with loving care. Doing less is more as someone has just told me in another thread.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Other than Robert, I like to find out who supports city-level voting compared to GRC level voting where anything can happen in that if criteria not met, may even technically have the case of 100% walkovers. or to the extent that only 1 GRC has election held.   More voters fairer or less voters fairer result?<br><br>u tell the me.</div>
