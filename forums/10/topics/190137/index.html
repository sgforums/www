            <div class='col-md body'>Agreed. As much as many here in this forum share a consensus of a need of an alternative voice, but little can be done to bring about this change if it is the will the majority that the status quo should be kept. I am apalled and disappointed by the mentality that many Singaporeans have taken in excercing their votes. However, I believe instead of criticizing their choices, we should accept this, move on and pherhaps on our own part, bring about a sense of the political happenings and realities in this country to these individuals, to allow them to make better and well-informed choices.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well. reading comments here and there. First of all, to all my dear Singaporeans, you people keep on talking about who to vote and why we vote, and what we vote for even the elections is over. You people always demand things here and there. Demand good oppositions, demand good government, demand low tax, demand upgrading, demand government to low the price of this and that. BUT in the other way, have you all give it a thought? Did you people contribute back to the society? Not just the money you make when there is charity show or flag day. Just ask yourself, what have you all done that have really help Singapore and the mankind.</div>
