Monetary tightening has therefore been accompanied by non-monetary measures to keep domestic inflationary pressures under control," Citigroup said.<br><br>Recent measures, such as the relaxation of rules governing the hiring of foreign labour and the scrapping of the deferred payment scheme for property buyers, are aimed at easing capacity constraints and moderating demand pressures.<br><br>"The Government has so far refrained from imposing outright price controls on food and utility prices. But with inflation in these basic necessities having a disproportionate impact on the lower income groups, social ramifications may be significant", it warned, adding that "measures to help the lower income groups offset rising costs of living are therefore likely to be announced, possibly during or even before the upcoming budget".<br><br>Singapore's inflation surged to a 16-year high of 3.6 per cent in October, and is expected to hit 4.5 per cent next year.</div>

The firm paid about $12 million and collects monthly rent of $6,000 from each stall.<br><br>The sale price works out to $2,553 per square foot for the 4,700 sq ft premises - well above the old reported record set by an 8,000 sq ft coffee shop in Ang Mo Kio which sold for $17.8 million, or $2,225 psf, in 2004.<br><br>The payback period for Koufu's latest buy is about 13 to 14 years.<br><br>Mr Pang said the deal was its biggest purchase but added that it was a long-term investment.<br><br>'It was a high price, but we need good locations and in the long term, it'll be worth it,' said Mr Pang.<br><br>PropNex chief executive Mohamed Ismail told The Straits Times that the value of coffee shops depends purely on traffic. 'Good business locations will always command a premium,' he said.<br><br>Mr Nicholas Mak, head of research and consultancy at Knight Frank, said bullish market expectations paved the way for the record deal.<br><br>This was especially so as the recent slowdown in residential property has not touched the retail and food and beverage scene.<br><br>'This is likely to be few and far between, however,' he added, 'as few shops get transacted at such a high price.'<br><br>Earlier this year, a coffee shop in Block 501, Jurong West Street 51, sold for $9 million.<br><br>Three coffee shops - in Tampines, Yishun and Bukit Batok - are on the market for $15 million apiece with no takers to date.<br><br>Copyright, 2007, Singapore Press Holdings Limited</div>

"Generally speaking the market is oversold."<br><br>Ministers of the 13-member Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries began arriving Monday in the United Arab Emirates for a key meeting Wednesday to decide on output levels, signalling they were divided over the need to raise output to meet strong global demand.<br><br>Ali al-Nuaimi, the oil minister of OPEC kingpin Saudi Arabia, said it was premature to talk about a possible increase in crude production by the cartel.<br><br>"Right now it will be very premature to tell you what the assessment is" of oil data the cartel expects to study ahead of Wednesday's output decision, he said.<br><br>"We have not looked at the data yet. Tomorrow and the day after we will have an opportunity to look at all the data. We will assess and decide," he said on his arrival in Abu Dhabi, the UAE capital.<br><br>OPEC, which supplies roughly 40 percent of the world's oil, is concerned that increasing output could oversupply the market, further damping prices.<br><br>But leaving output quotas unchanged on Wednesday could send oil prices to recent record highs above 99 dollars a barrel and even above the psychological 100-dollar mark for the first time, crimping global economic growth, analysts said.<br><br>MF Global's Mike Fitzpatrick said: "We remain sceptical OPEC will raise production again given the slide in oil prices off the highs and since the Saudi oil minister thinks the oil market is 'absolutely' well supplied."<br><br>Libya's oil chief Shukri Ghanem, arriving in Abu Dhabi, dismissed the idea of a production hike.<br><br>Asked whether OPEC would decide to increase oil output on Wednesday, Ghanem told reporters: "I don't think so," adding that "the market is very well supplied."<br><br>"I don't think that the market needs more oil," said Ghanem when asked if Libya would oppose an attempt to hike output. "If demand is going down, why should we increase."<br><br>The pressure on OPEC to raise output has eased considerably because prices are now off recent record levels.<br><br>"Ahead of the OPEC meeting later this week, our view is that OPEC members are now unlikely to raise the output quota," said Sucden analyst Michael Davies.<br><br>"Oil prices have dropped below 90 dollars a barrel on expectation of weaker US oil demand growth, which could give OPEC an excuse not to raise quotas," he said, adding: "General sentiment amongst OPEC members is that the world oil market is well supplied."<br><br>Analysts believe the upcoming output decision Wednesday hinges on Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest oil producer and exporter and the only OPEC member with spare output capacity.<br><br>Last week, prices fell heavily, with New York crude plunging by almost 10 percent amid concerns over slowing global energy demand sparked by remarks from US Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke, who warned that strains in world financial markets may lead to broader economic problems.<br><br>New York crude hit a record high of 99.29 dollars last month on the back of a weakening US currency and tight global energy supplies.<br><br>- AFP /ls<br><br></div>

The last time the world experienced such food price increases was in 1973 to 1974...but today, the situation is completely different.<br><br>'For one, the climate risk and climate change situation has increased, the climate vulnerability has increased.'<br><br>The institute also said in its report - The World Food Situation - that hunger and malnutrition could rise as poor agricultural communities most sensitive to the environment are hurt.<br><br>And it predicted that the world's agricultural production will decrease by 16 per cent by 2020 because of global warming, with land used for certain crops shrinking.<br><br>'With the increased risk of droughts and floods due to rising temperatures, crop-yield losses are imminent,' it said.<br><br>Prof von Braun said that global cereal stocks, a key buffer used to fight famines around the world, have already sunk to their lowest level since the 1980s.<br><br>'The world eats more than it produces currently, and over the past five or six years, that is reflected in the decline in stocks and storage levels,' he said.<br><br>'That cannot go on, and exhaustion of stocks will be reached soon.'<br><br>And while hundreds of millions of people have emerged from poverty through better agricultural techniques, rising standards of living mean that more grain is being used to produce high-value food such as meat and dairy products, the report said.<br><br>This, in turn, causes grain prices to rise as demand grows, making it harder for poorer people in the developing world to fulfil their daily food needs.<br><br>The rising cost of oil is also contributing to the problem, as using crops to produce bio-fuels will further reduce the amount of available food and increase prices, the report said. - ASSOCIATED PRESS, AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE, REUTERS<br><br>------------------------------------------------------<br><br><strong>'The world eats more than it produces currently, and over the past five or six years, that is reflected in the decline in stocks and storage levels.

There are four other coffee shops in the vicinity.<br><br>VariNice has 13 lots. Some are taken up by a single stall paying about $6,000 a month. Other lots are split between two operators, each paying about $3,000. This gives Koufu an annual rental yield of 7 per cent to 8 per cent.<br><br>The rents compare with $5,000 to $8,000 for a typical food stall in a 'good mall' such as Marina Square, said Mr Ku Swee Yong, director of marketing and business development at Savills Singapore.<br><br><span style="color: red;">Madam Ren Huai Zhen, who runs a zi char - cooked food - stall at VariNice, is now paying $6,000 a month, $1,000 more than before.<br><br>'Everything became more expensive, except the price of our food,' she told The Straits Times yesterday.</span><br><br>'We can survive, but our profit margins are low.'<br><br>Mr Xue Mingshou, who runs the Pin Wei Fishball Noodles stall, said he raised the prices of some dishes but had to lower them again when customers did not bite.<br><br>'Competition here is very stiff,' he said. 'If I can break even, it's very good already.' His rent has gone up by $400 to $3,200 a month.<br><br>Mr Xue shares his lot with a duck rice stall, which pays $3,000 in rent and sells about $700 worth of dishes a day.<br><br>'Your stall must sell really nice food in order to survive. There are at least 50 other stalls in the area,' said the owner, who wanted to be known only as Mr Tan. But he called the rent 'reasonable'.<br><br>Indeed, just next door to VariNice is an S-11 coffee shop, where rents are $7,000 to $8,000 a month.<br><br>Property agents say rents at prime coffee shops have escalated in recent months, and it is not uncommon for them to rival those in air-conditioned food courts.<br><br>'In the prime areas such as Geylang, Toa Payoh, Bishan and Bukit Batok, fixed rents can go up to $6,000 or $7,000 a month,' said Mr Eric Cheng of HSR property group.<br><br>Some coffee-shop chains even collect rent on a profit-sharing basis, which means base rents could be $1,000 a month but stallholders may end up paying five figures if sales are good, he added.<br><br>On average, however, monthly coffee-shop rents range from $4,500 to $7,500. In low-end properties in the outskirts, they can go as low as $1,200, said Mr Cheng.<br><br>Clearly, there are limits to how much coffee-shop rents can be raised before stallholders are forced to pack it in. This may be why more expensive coffee shops on the market - three, in Yishun, Tampines and Bukit Batok, are said to be going for $15 million each - have yet to find takers.<br><br>So for VariNice in Jurong East to charge $6,000 in rent 'is not excessive', said Mr Ku of Savills. 'Foot traffic is very high, and it is near an interchange MRT station, a library and business parks.'<br><br>Copyright, 2007, Singapore Press Holdings Limited</div>

This April, a top official reported that the 2006 figure was 16.5 per cent lower than the previous year's.<br><br>But inflation has become the latest worry for Chinese leaders. It hit a 10-year high of 6.5 per cent in August and October, and officials have forecast a rate of 4.7 per cent for this year and 4.5 per cent for next year.<br><br>Last month, China raised fuel prices for the first time in 17 months to tackle widespread shortages and appease loss-incurring refiners.<br><br>To soften the blow, the populist government has dished out food subsidies to farmers, students and low-income groups. Some cities have given their taxi drivers fuel subsidies. On Wednesday, Beijing announced more rebates for oil refiners to further ease shortages.<br><br>Those measures will help keep things under control while more macro-economic adjustments are made, said Professor Yi.<br><br>He also pointed out that China is not seeing the massive shortage in the supply of goods during periods of inflation in 1989 and 1993.<br><br>The 1989 Tiananmen Square demonstrations - sparked initially by inflation - cannot be far from top leaders' minds.<br><br>And when state-affiliated labour unions do not act in the workers' interest, 'workers have only the option of staging a strike to bring attention to their plight', said Mr Crothall.<br><br>'Often, it's a gradual build-up of dissatisfaction, and then a seemingly small thing like a hike in canteen food is the final straw,' he pointed out.<br><br>Copyright, 2007, Singapore Press Holdings Limited</div>

Ninety are units of United States-based firms.<br><br>Inflation next year was expected to hit around 2.5 per cent when the survey was carried out. Recent data, however, suggests prices could shoot up by as much as 4 per cent to 5 per cent in the first half of next year.<br><br>If companies keep to their budgeted figures, real wage increases could come to only a measly 0.5 per cent to 1 per cent, at least during the early months of next year.<br><br>That may, in turn, spark a fresh round of musical chairs for junior and middle managers, especially in talent-strapped, high-growth sectors such as financial services, said Ms Tan Yee Deng, a Hewitt executive covering remuneration issues in Singapore and Malaysia.<br><br>These employees, who have typically worked two to five years and earn $3,000 to $5,000 a month, will be hit hardest by escalating costs of living.<br><br>'These people are the most likely to move to other jobs which offer much higher pay hikes than 5 per cent. So, we may see turnover rates much higher than the current 8 per cent to 12 per cent range for these positions in the first half of the year,' Ms Tan said.<br><br>In the last few years, real wage increases among Singapore companies averaged about 3 per cent and closely tracked gross domestic product (GDP) growth and inflation.<br><br>The spectre of a US economic slowdown that could hit Singapore's GDP growth next year, however, has placed Singapore companies in a quandary.<br><br>They must lift wages to retain talent in a tight labour market but they need to keep a lid on business costs, given the prospect of a slowing economy.<br><br>A senior executive of a US-based multinational electronics company said his firm 'may revise the wage budget to address concerns about rising inflation'.<br><br>But retaining talent, rather than factoring for inflation, was the key element pushing Singapore companies, like power outlet maker Eubiq, to raise wages for most employees by between 7 per cent and 20 per cent.<br><br>'We offer competitive wages to retain talent. It is also clear that living expenses are rising, so the minimum wage increase for our staff is 5 per cent,' said Mr Ng Joo Kok, the firm's director of global business.<br><br>Hewitt's Ms Tan said companies could make their junior and middle-management staff feel more reassured in their current jobs by enlarging the fixed portion of their annual pay, so that they get a higher salary every month.<br><br>graceng@sph.com.sg<br><br>Copyright, 2007, Singapore Press Holdings Limited</div>

Once the contract is over, weÂ’ll be paying a new price,Â” said Mr Timothy Chan, the general manager of Polar Holdings.<br><br>The firm will increase the price of two-thirds of its pastries and cakes by about 5 per cent in January.<br><br>Pressures on wholesalers and retailers have been building for several months in the wake of rocketing prices for a broad range of produce, including eggs, dairy products, rice, corn, soybean and wheat.<br><br>Add that to rising oil prices and SingaporeÂ’s higher rentals and ballooning wages, and a recipe for a serious cost squeeze emerges.<br><br>The managing director of Chye Choon Foods, Mr Jimmy Soh, said many wholesalers will pass the inflationary pressures down to foodcourts, hawker centres and restaurants.<br><br>Â“They have to maintain a certain margin to keep their business viable. TheyÂ’re doing business and have to survive,Â” said Mr Soh, whose firm produces the Golden Leaf brand of beehoon and rice.<br><br>Tee Yih Jia Manufacturing, a producer of Asian convenience food, will raise prices of items sold to local wholesalers by around 10 per cent in the new year.<br><br>The companyÂ’s market development manager, Ms Lorraine Goi, said wholesalers had asked the firm not to raise prices of ready-to-eat treats such as samosas, crepes, mini prawn rolls and roti prata until Jan 1.<br><br>This is because they had six-month contracts locked in with their own restaurant, hotel and hawker centre customers.<br><br>Â“The old price theyÂ’re selling at is valid till Dec 31, so itÂ’s very difficult for wholesalers to tell customers there is a price increment. If we increase the price before that, the wholesalers have to absorb it themselves,Â” said Ms Goi.<br><br>Many eateries have yet to pass on higher charges to consumers but experts believe they will not be able to hold out much longer.<br><br>Â“ItÂ’s likely the price increase will become more visible among the food services sector in the first and second quarters of next year,Â” said Mr Leon Perera, the group managing director of Spire Research and Consulting.<br><br>He added that the prices of food products in the retail sector, such as supermarkets, are already rising.<br><br>While familiar names like BreadTalk and Jumbo Seafood have no plans to hike prices Â– at least for now Â– industry players say that firms can try to keep customers loyal only for so long when faced with such cost pressures.<br><br>Â“If prices keep rising, do I have a choice?Â” said Mr Daniel Tay, the chief executive of Bakerzin, a dessert chain that raised prices of its cakes three to four months ago.<br><br>Â“My margin is 5 to 10 per cent at the most. If my cost rises 5 to 10 per cent, do I do charity or a losing business?Â” he added.<br><br>----------------------------------------------------<br><br><img src="http://img178.imageshack.us/img178/97/food2bb9.png"><br><br>Copyright, 2007, Singapore Press Holdings Limited</div>
