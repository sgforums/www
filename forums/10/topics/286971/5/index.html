It's that crazy,' she said.<br><br>The bakery cafe chain has operated at Republic Plaza for about eight years now and has a newer outlet at One Raffles Quay.<br><br>Singapore's office space crunch is spilling over to tenants like Cedele in office districts such as Raffles Place.<br><br>'When they told me about the increase, I nearly fell off my chair,' Ms Yeap said.<br><br>'If my rentals rise by 100 per cent, can my food price increase by the same?<br><br>'Then the tenant can sell only bird's nest and abalone,' she said, referring to expensive delicacies.<br><br>Occupancy levels for retail space such as cafes and fashion outlets in Raffles Place are close to 100 per cent.<br><br>A recent study by property consultant Cushman &amp; Wakefield found rent rises of up to 24 per cent over the past two years in the area.<br><br>Supply of shop space is tight with no major new retail space expected for the financial district in the short term.<br><br>That means retail rents there will keep rising by another 10 to 15 per cent in the year ahead, the firm's managing director here, Mr Donald Han, told The Straits Times. This is up from about 14 per cent in the last 12 months, he said.<br><br>The rise is relatively high, considering that rentals in the traditional shopping belt of Orchard Road have experienced single- digit rises in recent years.<br><br>Overall, rentals for prime retail space are expected to climb by 15 to 20 per cent year on year, with capital values up by 10 to 15 per cent, according to Knight Frank.<br><br>Ms Maye Kwok, 32, who sells bags and shoes from a ground-level shop at The Arcade, is convinced she will soon be paying higher rent.<br><br>'Across the board, rents have gone up. My neighbours here have paid higher rents. I am 100 per cent sure they will raise the rent when my lease is up for revision.'<br><br>Mr Han said the office space crunch was affecting nearby retail space.<br><br>'Most developers within the financial district prefer to maximise office use rather than retail,' he said.<br><br>'The irony is that when more offices are built, retail demand from the office population will grow in tandem.'<br><br>Most retail centres in Raffles Place such as OUB Centre, Raffles Xchange, One Fullerton and Republic Plaza are enjoying full occupancy.<br><br>Average gross rent for Raffles Place ground-level shops is between $18 and $35 per sq ft (psf) a month - well up from $13 to $25 psf two years ago.<br><br>Basement level space is between $12 and $25 psf a month, again well up from $9 to $18 psf two years back.<br><br>On the upper floors, which have less pedestrian traffic, rents hover between $8 and $14 psf a month, up from $6 to $9 psf a month two years ago.<br><br>As Raffles Place's retail rents rise, several landlords have already started to either reposition their retail developments or add new retail supply, said Cushman &amp; Wakefield.<br><br>Sino Land, the Hong Kong-based sister firm of property developer Far East Organization, recently announced plans to revamp a 26,000 sq ft retail and entertainment complex at Clifford Pier, a site that it had obtained late last year.<br><br>At OUB Centre, an additional 32,000 sq ft of retail space will be added, said Cushman &amp; Wakefield.<br><br>It noted that newly retrofitted projects like the Market Street carpark have done well, with space nearly fully leased out at $10 to $25 psf a month.<br><br>'The retail market situation in Raffles Place is coming to a level where nothing is available. This sub-market is being ignored when there is demand,' said Mr Han.<br><br>Copyright Â© 2007 Singapore Press Holdings. All rights reserved.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="color: darkblue;">The S'pore approach to battle rising cost of living</span></strong><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Straits Times, The (Singapore)<br>Prime News<br>November 12, 2007<br>Author: Peh Shing Huei</span><br><br>THE cost of living is rising and the Government is helping Singaporeans cope with it, said Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong yesterday.<br><br>While many people would look to their governments to keep prices low, Singapore's approach is different and he believed that it is one that works.<br><br>It aims to get the basics right - housing, jobs and affordable necessities.<br><br>'We help, we do a lot, but we don't help by keeping the prices individually controlled,' he said at a dialogue at the People's Action Party annual convention.<br><br>'We help by making sure that the low income are able to pay for their necessities, able to earn a living, able to have a house over their heads.'<br><br>While Singapore has gone through years with stable cost of living and very low inflation, he acknowledged that it might be tough to maintain such stability going forward.<br><br>Prices of flour, food, energy and even chicken are going up, and people are understandably worried, he said.<br><br>Following a jump in flour prices, bread prices here went up by up to 20 per cent and noodles increased by 20 to 30 cents per kg.<br><br>While there are calls on the Government to control prices, he added, Singapore will not head the way of countries like Malaysia, China and India by keeping prices of oil and electricity down.<br><br>Instead, the Government helps the people through the Housing Board flats, education, the Workfare Income Supplement scheme and periodic top-ups when there are Budget surpluses.<br><br>'So with the house, the HDB flat which we help you to buy...nearly everybody has a home which is a big relief. So when rentals go up, you are not affected because you have your house and you have something for your old age to retire by,' he said in response to a concern raised by a party activist on the rising cost of living.<br><br>There is also Workfare, he added, which sees the Government topping up the wages of low-income workers.<br><br>For example, those who earn $1,000 a month would get $1,000 plus of 'hongbao' from the Government a year in cash, CPF and Medisave, and this goes on continually.<br><br>But while these policies are important and helpful to the people, he believed the Government can do a better job in explaining them to Singaporeans.<br><br>He said that while the fine print of policies can be complicated, the principle behind them is not.<br><br>'The principle is to help yourself - you work, the Government will help you. But you must make the effort, and that is how Singapore will succeed. That is how you will succeed,' he said.<br><br>'And I think that is an approach that has worked for the economy, for the country, and we must keep that.'<br><br>Mr Lee was on a nine-member panel in the 90-minute dialogue at the meeting for cadres to speak on issues and challenges the party has to tackle.<br><br>Flanked by PAP chairman Lim Boon Heng, five MPs and a pair of activists, the PM tackled concerns that centred on the convention's catchy theme, 'Young and old, high and low', which refers to Singapore's ageing society and the growing income gap.<br><br>Mr Lee noted that Singapore's approach to battle the wealth divide has attracted the attention of other countries.<br><br>Referring to his recent interview with Chosun Ilbo, he said the South Korean top daily printed almost everything he said and displayed it over two pages.<br><br>Major newspapers and magazines in the West such as the Economist have also written about Singapore's changes, he said.<br><br>Urging the party to continue to serve Singaporeans so that it can win their support, he said: 'You are wearing white because it is a symbol that you care...and you are not just sitting there and letting somebody else take charge of the train.'<br><br>shpeh@sph.com.sg<br><br>Copyright, 2007, Singapore Press Holdings Limited<br><br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><strong>AFFORDING THE BASICS</strong><br><br>'We help, we do a lot, but we don't help by keeping the prices individually controlled.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Singapore says inflation may hit 5 pct in Q1 2008</strong><br><br>SINGAPORE, Nov 12 - Inflation in Singapore is seen rising to 2.7 percent year-on-year in the fourth quarter this year, with consumer prices potentially surging up to 5 percent in the first quarter of 2008, the government said on Monday.<br>ADVERTISEMENT<br><br>Inflation, which hit a 12-year high of 2.9 percent in August, would moderate in the second half of next year, Lim Hng Kiang, Singapore's Minister for Trade and Industry, told parliament.<br><br>"We expect the fourth quarter to be around 2.7 percent, or even slightly higher. We expect first quarter of next year to reach the peak of between 4, or maybe even 5 percent. This is because of the base effects of the first quarter of 2007," said Lim.<br><br>First quarter 2007 inflation was only 0.5 percent year-on-year. Inflation averaged just 1 percent in 2006, and a tight labour market, together with higher prices, may give the central bank reason to allow a further rise of the Singapore dollar to keep inflation in check.<br><br>"The pickup in inflation in Singapore should also be viewed from the perspective of the rapid economic growth over the last three years. GDP has grown by more than 6 percent on average since 2003," Lim said.<br><br>"Wages have also been growing, especially last year and this year. Against this backdrop, we should not be surprised to see inflation rise above the unusually low levels seen in recent years."<br><br>Lim noted that an actual increase in the cost of living depended on individual households' spending patterns. He also pointed to technical factors that have fueled a rise in the CPI figures.<br><br>Singapore's $129 billion economy is set for growth of at least 7-8 percent this year, reflecting buoyant construction across the island just half the size of Greater London, a rebound in manufacturing and strong business for bankers and fund managers. - Reuters</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>S'PORE WILL NOT STARVE: MM<br>Upcoming projects will ensure that economic upswing will continue<br><br>Lin Yanqin<br>yanqin@mediacorp.com.sg<br><br>AS HE toured Queenstown Â— Singapore's first satellite town which has rejuvenated itself to become one of the country's most popular housing estate Â— Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew had his eye firmly on the future.<br><br>Property prices may be on the rise, bringing up the worth of a Singaporean's assets, but all will not always be "plain sailing", he cautioned. "We're doing fine, we're likely to do well, but there are dangerous market signals," he said of the economy.<br><br>Referring to spiralling oil prices and rising food costs, he warned of an eventuality where the United States goes into a recession and reduces its imports. This could mean countries such as China and Singapore exporting less, leading to a "decline" in Singapore's economy.<br><br>"So remember, don't just believe that everything is just going to go up and never come down," he said.<br><br>MM Lee was speaking yesterday at the launch of the book Ten Stories: Queenstown Through the Years, commemorating the heritage of Queenstown and the opening of the Alexandra Canal Linear Park Â— built over the former Alexandra Canal.<br><br>Nonetheless, Singapore "will not starve", he said, thanks to the development of the Integrated Resorts, the upcoming Formula One race and investments such as the $6.3-billion solar manufacturing complex by Norwegian company REC and the US$4-billion ($5.76 billion) Exxon Mobil petrochemical plant.<br><br>And none of this, he added, happened "by accident".<br><br>"Ask yourself, if you had voted for the opposition during election time, you just decided to press the PAP (People's Action Party), one morning you will wake up, you'll find a set of rookies in the Government and it (the economy) goes down in maybe two weeks," he said.<br><br>Before an election, the PAP, he said, goes through "hundreds" of potential candidates to evaluate their ability and qualifications. "We know that they can make the job," he said.<br><br>Singapore, he added, was a "brand" that other countries look towards as an example. "We have a reputation, we get things done," he said.<br><br>Even if there was inflation or a recession headed Singapore's way, the country will grow, he assured. "Remember, stability depends on good living conditions, that depends on good business, which depends on good governance."<br><br>MM Lee also stopped for a visit at the home of longtime Queenstown resident Balbir Singh, whose home overlooks the new park, built at a cost of $1.6 million. He said Queenstown had gone into "decline" as newer towns were built, but with new developments, Singaporeans seeking a home near the city are now looking at the estate.<br><br>"This is not by accident," he said. "My colleagues and I, have from the very beginning, planned this Â— that every Singaporean should have an asset and that homes will increase in value as the country progresses and infrastructure goes in."<br><br></div>

Singapore doesn't need numbers, it needs talent, he said.<br>.<br>Pointing out that managing the population is the main challenge facing Singapore, the 70-year-old said: "If we do it wrongly, it will change our economic and social system."<br>.<br>Some 40 years ago, while serving on the Economic Development Board (EDB), he and others had studied the question of an "optimum size" for an industrial country.<br>.<br>Said Mr Ngiam: "We looked at successful small countries such as Sweden, Norway and Israel. They each had a population of six million. So we said Singapore needed to have six million people."<br>.<br>But given the technological advances and rising educational levels, Singapore "no longer needs numbers now but more quality", he added.<br>.<br>Mr Ngiam said he was told that the number "was based on Gross Domestic Product growth of six per cent a year".<br>.<br>"A back-of-the-envelope calculation would show this comprises a 2-per-cent increase in population and 4-per-cent growth in productivity. But if we can increase our productivity by more than 4 per cent, we can still have 6-per-cent growth, but with fewer people who are highly productive."<br>.<br>He stressed the need to appeal to people's hearts. "Otherwise ... Singapore will become just a six-star hotel where guests stay in good times and flee when times are bad. We will never become a nation," he said.<br>.<br>His vision: Set up a think tank to "think strategically" on top of tactics such as dual-citizenship and a more broadly-defined concept of National Service. "For instance, a foreign Singaporean living overseas should have no voting rights and less national service obligations."<br>.<br>The Government could even invite former citizens for "a month-long holiday" to advise policymakers on areas in which they have specialist knowledge. Said Mr Ngiam: "Do you know Chinese Nobel Prize winners are invited to China to teach for three months?"<br>.<br>"Our population policy should be more emotional ... You don't say to Singaporeans who are no longer citizens, 'You come back, we have a job for you'. You say, 'What about contributing your knowledge to Singapore? Better still, you want a job, we give you a job'."<br><br>-------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>my doubts increase about the ability of the people in charge...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Singapore: Consumer Price Index set to hit high of 5% in first half of 2008<br><br>Minister for Trade and Industry Lim Hng Kiang told Parliament on Monday that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) is set to reach a high of five percent in the first half of next year, though prices are likely to ease afterwards.<br><br>He explained that prices have gone up because oil prices have doubled since the start of the year, and the one-off hike in Goods and Services Tax (GST) in July also contributed to the rising inflation.<br><br>But the CPI, which measures inflation at the consumer level, is expected to go down to three per cent in the second half of 2008, Mr Lim said.<br><br>Another factor driving inflation has been the disruptions in the supply of food items such as vegetables and diary products from Australia, Malaysia and Indonesia.<br><br>Mr Lim said: "Diversifying our food supply sources is one way we can reduce our vulnerability to such supply disruptions and maintain more stable food prices.<br><br>"AVA (Agri-Food &amp; Veterinary Authority) will continue to step up efforts to this end. However, diversification cannot protect us against a worldwide increase in food prices, as is happening now."<br><br>When MP Halimah Yacob asked what the government has done to ease the inflationary impact on Singaporeans, Mr Lim pointed to measures such as the GST Offset Package, which is expected to cost the government S$4 billion over five years.<br><br>The government's exchange rate policies have also helped minimise the impact of inflation from other countries.<br><br>But Ang Mo Kio GRC Inderjit Singh asked: "Does the minister see any impact on our competitiveness here as far as businesses are concerned?"<br><br>Mr Lim replied: "We are tracking our competitiveness position very closely and so far we are in quite a good position for several reasons... even though (our inflation rate is) higher than what we've been experiencing, it's still lower than other countries...<br><br>"Second, even though wages have gone up last year and particularly the first three quarters of this year... (over) the last five, six or seven years (they did not go up) so rapidly."<br><br>Mr Lim added that the higher inflation should also be viewed against the backdrop of rapid economic growth rates since 2003, so it should not be surprising to see inflation rise above the "unusually low levels" seen over the last few years.<br><br>Source: channelnewsasia.com<br><br>Publication date: 11/13/2007</div>
