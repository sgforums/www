It also smashed Wednesday's record of 94.74 dollars.<br><br>The New York contract earlier surged to an all-time intraday summit of 96.24 dollars. Prices had risen 4.15 dollars, or about five percent, in New York Wednesday following the interest rate cut.<br><br>Brent North Sea crude for December delivery also erased the previous day's intraday high of 90.94 dollars to trade at 91.54 dollars.<br><br>"Now, it seems that triple digits is going to be the target," said Tony Nunan, manager for energy risk at Mitsubishi Corp in Tokyo, referring to oil at 100 dollars a barrel. "It's anybody's guess."<br><br>At current prices, oil is just four dollars off the 100-dollar mark.<br><br>"The increase in oil prices was driven by the release of the US Energy Information Administration's Weekly Petroleum Status report, which showed a large decline in US crude oil inventories," the Commonwealth Bank of Australia said.<br><br>Oil prices had earlier slumped below 90 dollars on Wednesday but staged a blistering rally after the Federal Reserve slashed key US interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point to 4.50 percent.<br><br>The cut is targeted to boost domestic consumption in the world's biggest economy and cushion the impact of a crisis in the US sub-prime mortgage housing market which has been rocked by defaults. A healthy US economy prompts higher demand for oil.<br><br>Oil prices also rose after the US Department of Energy's (DoE) weekly snapshot of energy reserves showed that crude inventories tumbled by 3.9 million barrels to stand at 312.7 million barrels in the week ended October 26.<br><br>That shocked the market because consensus forecasts had been for a gain of 400,000 barrels in the reserves of the world's biggest energy consumer and underscored a tight supply situation.<br><br>Compared with November last year and January 2007, current oil prices are more than 60 percent higher.<br><br>Peter Harbison, executive chairman of the Centre for Asia Pacific Aviation, said airlines are expected to ride through high oil prices because of strong travel demand.<br><br>"In this market you've got very strong economies which means strong demand and you haven't got enough seats flying," he told AFP on the sidelines of an aviation conference.<br><br>But Harbison also said the airline industry could still take a hit if the soaring oil prices lead to slower global economic growth.<br><br>Tony Fernandes, chief executive of Malaysian budget carrier AirAsia, said he was not worried about the rampaging oil prices.<br><br>"Oil is what it is, you got to live with it," he told AFP. "Basically, you've got to build a sustainable business model."<br><br>- AFP/so</div>

Singapore was up 0.2 percent in late deals.<br><br>"The Fed's monetary easing brought relief to investors, which helped the market continue with its record-breaking rally at the opening," said Lim Dong-Min, an analyst at Dongbu Securities in Seoul.<br><br>But with the rate cut already priced in, investors were left to ponder more bearish factors such as high oil prices and the strength of the local currency, the won, he said.<br><br>Europe's main stock markets were also mixed in opening trade, with London down 0.07 percent as Frankfurt rose 0.06 percent and Paris added 0.08 percent.<br><br>The Fed cut its benchmark rate by 25 basis points to 4.50 percent Wednesday as expected, its second cut in less than two months, and said risks to the financial markets from the credit crisis had eased.<br><br>The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) followed the Fed with a similar rate reduction, taking its base rate down to 6.0 percent.<br><br>The Fed's statement that the risks between higher inflation and weaker growth were balanced, hinting this would be the last rate cut this year, was taken positively by investors in Hong Kong, said Peter Lai, director at DBS Vickers.<br><br>"While (Fed chairman Ben) Bernanke did not say that the worst is over for the subprime crisis, at least he signalled that the government will not let the US economy go into a recession," Lai said.<br><br>In Tokyo, investors took their cue from Wall Street where the Dow Jones index gained 1.0 percent Wednesday after the Fed move.<br><br>News that US gross domestic product (GDP) grew at an annual rate of 3.9 percent in the third quarter, better than the 3.0 percent growth forecast by economists, provided an additional lift to sentiment.<br><br>The robust growth performance added to speculation that Wednesday's US rate cut could be the last for this year.<br><br>"The Fed has signalled that it has got a neutral bias for the short term at least, so the chances of a December rate cut seem to be less than they were," said Malcolm Wood, a Hong Kong-based strategist for Morgan Stanley.<br><br>"But expectations for additional rate cuts were not huge. The US market reaction would suggest that they are happy that the Fed is on their side and I think that should be the reaction here in Asia," he said.<br><br>But Shanghai gave up early gains to end down 0.68 percent, snapping four days of gains amid concerns the nation's social security fund may reportedly scale back its stock holdings, dealers said.<br><br>The dollar saw mixed fortunes in the region, falling to a fresh 23-year low against the Australian currency but edging higher against the yen as investors chased higher yields.<br><br>- AFP /ls</div>

It hit an all-time high of 97.10 dollars in intra-day trade.<br><br>In London, Brent North Sea crude for December delivery jumped 2.77 dollars a barrel to settle at a record 93.26, after earlier reaching a record 93.56 dollars.<br><br>It was the first time oil futures had breached 97 dollars in New York and 93 dollars in London.<br><br>Oil prices moved steadily toward the symbolic 100-dollar level ahead of the US Department of Energy's (DoE) report on energy supplies.<br><br>The record-breaking run came as traders bet on a further decline in US crude supplies ahead of the northern hemisphere winter, when demand for heating fuel is expected to shoot higher, analysts said.<br><br>The DoE is set to release Wednesday its energy reserves report for the week ended November 2. Crude supplies had fallen in the previous two weekly reports.<br><br>"If the inventory figures are bad again then (New York crude) could push up," said CMC Markets trader Nas Nijjar.<br><br>"It still feels as though there will be a test of the 100-dollar level ... We're not seeing any large sellers in this market."<br><br>Analysts' consensus forecast is for US crude reserves to have fallen by 1.7 million barrels following recent disruptions to Mexican output.<br><br>The US Energy Information Administration (EIA) said Tuesday the outlook for global supply would likely remain tight, supporting high prices.<br><br>"Global oil markets will likely remain stretched, as world oil demand has continued to grow much faster than oil supply outside of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), putting pressure on OPEC and inventories to bridge the gap," the EIA said.<br><br>"Additional fundamental factors contributing to price volatility include ongoing geopolitical risks, OECD inventory tightness, and worldwide refining bottlenecks. As a consequence, crude oil prices are expected to remain high and volatile."<br><br>The DoE unit forecast global demand to rise by 1.5 million barrels a day in 2008, a day after reporting that US crude oil reserves had declined four percent in 2006.<br><br>World oil prices fell on Monday in profit taking after a series of surges to record highs, but rebounded as supply concerns loomed.<br><br>"Despite concerns about a potential slowdown in energy consumption and slower global economic growth, there is still plenty of support to crude prices and especially with US fuel inventories running low ahead of winter," Sucden analyst Michael Davies said.<br><br>Victor Shum, an analyst with energy consultancy Purvin and Gertz, said on Tuesday, said: "What we can expect going forward is extreme volatility in the oil market, driven by profit-taking and traders buying back positions."<br><br>"But the overall market sentiment is still bullish and prices appear to be on an uptrend towards the 100-dollar mark. If we have a combination of a draw-down in inventories and a cold spell in the US, that could cause a surge in pricing," he added.<br><br>Shum said oil prices could reach 100 dollars before the end of 2007. "the market sentiment is that it's just a matter of time," he noted.<br><br>Prices also were supported by the sliding US dollar.<br><br>A weak US unit encourages demand for dollar-priced commodities because it makes them cheaper for buyers using stronger currencies.<br><br>Earlier on Tuesday, the euro hit a record 1.4570 dollars, the highest level since the European single currency's creation in 1999. - AFP/de<br><br></div>
