            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Consumers not cutting back on buying household items</strong><br><br>Channel NewsAsia - Thursday, December 27<br><br>SINGAPORE : Prices of household items have gone up, but that has not stopped consumers from buying. Some retailers are even reporting a growth in sales.<br><br>Every dollar counts these days, but many shoppers are not cutting back on spending, especially on household items.<br><br>One shopper said, "The spending would probably be almost the same. ItÂ’s just that I would be more conscious about buying brands like the supermarket brands or I would try and check out things that are on offer."<br><br>Another noted, "These are basic necessities that we have to buy. So we just have to make the purchase. But I do make my purchases wisely, I donÂ’t spend more than what I need."<br><br>A buoyant economy is also one of the reasons why NTUC FairPrice said it has seen sales increase this year, compared to the same period the previous year.<br><br>NTUC FairPrice declined to give actual figures, but it did say that the sale of their housebrand products Â— ranging from essential items like rice, detergent and brown rice Â— has seen doubleÂ—digit growth in 2007.<br><br>So consumers are willing to pay, despite the relatively higher prices.<br><br>Lau Chuen Wei, Executive Director, Singapore Retailers Association, said, "Consumer confidence has built up over the first three quarters of the year. And then news about this inflation has very subtly slipped in. By that time, people would have possibly made their plans.<br><br>"And when this news of this inflation has come in, at this last quarter, itÂ’s only like two or three months left of the year, and that is the main shopping period of all the festivities, feasting, dining and all the presents.<br><br>"As a consumer myself, I would probably think, ok let this be my last burst this year, I would still go and spend. I will still have a Merry Christmas and worry about this next year."<br><br>But the growth in yearÂ—end sales does not necessarily mean, bigger profits for all retailers.<br><br>Ms Lau said, "By and large, when talking to the retailers, they say yes the sales may have gone up, but their margins, which are already very tight, seem to be getting tighter and tighter.<br><br>"And what that means Â— the challenge for them is how to manage costs... Â— is how to make the best use of whatever staff is available, and that is another major challenge, especially now, where the job market is so buoyant."<br><br>The Singapore Retailers Association said competition will keep prices low for now. However, rising costs will eventually force retailers to increase prices, and the products likely to be affected include electronics and household items. Â— CNA/ms</div>

We have seen food prices go up significantly in the second half of last year and food prices, unfortunately, will stay high.<br><br>"CPI (consumer price index) may go up 2 percent or even beyond 5 percent year-on-year. Young Singaporeans may not have seen that kind of inflation in a long, long time."<br><br>"Even a small amount of inflation Â– such as what we are seeing today Â– can have a big impact on what you can do with your money.<br><br>"For example, S$100 today is reduced to just S$88 spending power by 2010 if we experience an inflation rate of 4 percent. And if that inflation rate is moved from 4 percent to 8 percent, that S$88 is reduced to just S$77 in 2010," said Gary Harvey, CEO of Ipac Wealth Management Asia.<br><br>The solution, however, is basic Â– see what you are spending on and budget carefully to stretch that dollar further.<br><br>While rising fuel and food prices will continue to have an upward impact on one's day-to-day costs, economists said there is a slight silver lining in that prices for consumer goods such as flat-screen TVs and mobile phones have remained unchanged or have even gone down.<br><br>This is because big manufacturers have managed to keep the prices down. But economists said that may not necessarily be the case in 12 months' time, if material or wage costs continue to climb.<br><br></div>

That was the seventh week in a row that stockpiles had dropped.<br><br>Analysts also pointed to violence in Nigeria, the biggest oil producer in Africa, as a catalyst for the spike to 100 dollars on Wednesday.<br><br>They added that crude was also being supported by concerns about stability in Pakistan, falling US energy inventories and cold weather, which was pushing up demand for heating fuel.<br><br>Phil Flynn at Alaron Trading said oil and other commodities were "on fire" as traders bid up prices helped by a soft dollar.<br><br>"If oil closes above 100 dollars the next target for oil would be close to 104 dollars," he said. "But I stress we must close above 100 or it could still be a sign that oil is at a 'blow-off' top."<br><br>Analysts said the symbolic 100-dollar price level would heap pressure on the OPEC oil-producing cartel to increase output when its 13 members meet on February 1.<br><br>"If oil prices are still around 100 dollars per barrel in the run-up to the next OPEC meeting we would expect quotas to be raised again," said Julian Jessop, chief international economist at Capital Economics.<br><br>The Organization of thee Petroleum Exporting Countries froze its oil output levels at its last meeting in December, resisting calls for an increase to help cool sky-high prices that threaten to dampen global economic growth.<br><br>The cartel, which produces about 40 percent of world oil, insisted that the market was well-supplied and blamed market speculators for fueling prices.<br><br>Analysts argue that rising oil demand has outstripped growth in supply, pointing to booming Asian economies like China and India and insufficient investment by oil exporters, which has led to a decline in spare production capacity.<br><br>Crude prices have quadrupled over the past five years.<br><br>- AFP /ls</div>

I just suffer," 30-year-old businesswoman Sirintra Vanno complained at a petrol station in Bangkok. "I have no choice but to drive every day to go to work because public transportation services are so limited."<br><br>Nena, an elderly woman who sells meals wrapped in banana leaves by the roadside in Jakarta, said higher fuel prices had dramatically cut her daily income over the past few months from 60,000 rupiah to 35,000 rupiah.<br><br>"I have to buy things at higher prices now but I cannot raise the price of food every time kerosene rises," she said.<br><br>Hery, 54, a motorcycle taxi driver in Jakarta, said he feared rising oil prices would lead to cuts in government subsidies for the cooking fuel, which costs 6,000 rupiah (64 cents) per litre.<br><br>"It will be out of reach" if the price goes higher, he said.<br><br>Australian truck driver Doug McMillan said the rising oil price was having a devastating impact on his business, which uses trailers to deliver farm equipment across the country's vast Outback.<br><br>McMillan said fuel costs used to account for about one-third of his expenditure but were now 55 percent -- and rising.<br><br>"By the time you pay your drivers' wages, there's no profit left," he told AFP by phone as he drove one of his rigs.<br><br>Song Haisheng, a 30-year-old taxi driver in Beijing, said he too was under pressure, adding he and many of his colleagues were barely surviving at current petrol prices.<br><br>"In order to save fuel, many taxi drivers now would rather park and queue along the street like this than cruise blindly as we used to do in search of customers," he said as he queued outside an office building in Beijing.<br><br>The Chinese government caps the prices at which refiners can sell their products, partly shielding consumers from the immediate impact of global oil spikes.<br><br>But it allowed refiners to raise domestic fuel prices by roughly 10 percent in November and ordinary Chinese now fear more hikes, with even the more well-off feeling the impact of record fuel prices.<br><br>"Nowadays I try not to travel by car when going on business trips and instead opt for the train as much as possible," said Huang, 42, who would only give his surname as he waited for his company driver to pick him up in Beijing.<br><br>On the streets of Manila, taxi driver Mario Agbayani was also worried.<br><br>"If pump prices continue to rise, I will be forced to look for another job because what I would be earning in a day would not be enough to even buy petrol," the 40-year-old father of three said.<br><br>He spends 12 hours a day on Manila's chaotic roads but takes home only 500 pesos (about 12 dollars) after expenses.<br><br>Japanese businessman Narihisa Murakami, 38, said in Tokyo that ordinary folks were powerless in the face of rising fuel prices, calling them "a real problem" and adding that fuel economy had become key when buying a car.<br><br>In Singapore, freelance motorcycle courier Irwan Shah, 45, said he tried to save by gassing up across the Causeway in neighbouring Malaysia, where petrol costs half the price it does in the city-state.<br><br>Another Singaporean courier, Surahman Ridwan, 52, resorted to a more drastic solution. "I had to cut down on cigarettes just to pay off my petrol costs more comfortably," he said. - AFP/ir</div>

But patients are not happy about it.<br><br>One of them said: "When you drink it, it gets stuck halfway (down your throat) so you have to sort of swallow a lot of water to 'push' the mixture down."<br><br>Chinese physicians said powdered medicine is equally effective and easier to prescribe.<br><br>It normally contains just one ingredient, while liquid medicine is usually a compound of two or more ingredients.<br><br>Ang Liang, director of Singapore Chung Hwa Medical Institution, said: "In compound mixtures, you cannot remove ingredients as they are mixed together. For powdered medicine, you can take away what you don't want or add what you want, so we can prescribe a more suitable mixture of medicine for the patient."<br><br>But such flexibility comes at a cost, as powdered medicine is 30 to 40 percent more expensive to produce.<br><br>At Chung Hwa Medical Institution, the price of a daily dosage of powdered medicine has increased from S$2 to S$3.</div>
