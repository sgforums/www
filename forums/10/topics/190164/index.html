            <div class='col-md body'>If our healthcare is lauded as world class and basically advanced and top of the world, why then do we lag behind Sweden???<br><br>And the last sentence - 'It suggests that the Malays may have less than optimal access to health care.' - gives me the impression that good HealthCare here, is only accessible to the well heelled. Or another term familiar to many of us now - ELITES.<br><br>================================================<br>SO you have asthma?<br><br>Well, there's good and bad news.<br>The good news is that asthma death rates are falling, not only in Singapore but all the over the world.<br>The bad news is that in terms of figures, Singapore still lags behind first-world countries such as Sweden.<br>Between 150 and 200 people die from asthma attacks here each year. This puts the risk of dying from asthma here much higher than in Sweden.<br>If you are a Singaporean and if you have asthma, your risk of dying from the disease is six times higher than that of someone in Sweden.<br>A team at the National University Hospital has just analysed eight years of data on the asthma death rate here.<br>An article based on part of their findings was published in the May issue of Thorax, an international medical journal.<br>Said Professor Lim Tow Keang, senior consultant and head of the division of respiratory and critical care medicine at NUH, who was involved in the study: 'The Singapore eight-year data shows that a Singaporean Chinese has a higher than three-times risk of dying from asthma than someone from Sweden.<br>'But for the Malays, it is even worse. The risk is over 15 times higher.'<br>That is unacceptably high, he said.<br>'Sweden is considered world-class in terms of its asthma control and we can do as well if patients follow through on prevention medicine,' he said. (See report on facing page.)<br>What is most disturbing to him is that the gap between the Chinese and the Malays has persisted over the years.<br>'It suggests that the Malays may have less than optimal access to health care.'<br><br>Source : http://newpaper.asia1.com.sg/news/story/0,4136,106385,00.html?<br></div>

Each stay averaged four days.<br>She knew she needed to take medication every day to keep her asthma at bay, and also more medication to keep the attacks mild when they happened.<br>'But that type of medication is very expensive,' she told The New Paper.<br>Cost was the major consideration and impediment in her taking the medication.<br>The preventive medication would have cost her more than $1,000 a year.<br>She chose to become sick and be hospitalised when the need arose, even when each hospitalisation cost her and her husband, a tyre technician, an average of $1,000.<br>'For hospitalisation, we can claim from Medisave,' explained the housewife and mother of five.<br>'For medication, where can we come up with the money?' In 2004, she became one of nearly 10,000 high-risk asthma patients put on the Singapore National Asthma Programme (Snap).<br>From having to pay over $1,000 a year, Madam Surayah needed to pay only $150 every three months for the preventive medication, which works out to be about 50 per cent less.<br>She has not suffered a single acute attack since.<br><br></div>
