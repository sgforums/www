And sadly enough, people always stereotype. For example, A claims to be a Prophet or Holy Man of XXX Religion. A contradicts wat XXX Religion has taught. But people still view as Religion XXX to be a bad one and not the particular heretic. Thus, it lies down to individual. Are they just ignorant or are they just happy to see another religion falls and being ridiculed at.......</div>
