              <p>oh my goodness....this is madness...to think the Tigers' followers were so naive to believe them and sacrifice themselves  as suicide bombers....</p>
              <p>They have been manuiplated...i pity them...may they help to expose the Tigers' real colors...they are a selfish, cowardly bunch of freedom fighters i have heard of....</p>
              <p>If they wanted independence, they could just fight it out using soldiers, not innocent civilians...even if they got wiped out in the end, sympathisers will remember them as heroes who fought for their dreams..</p>
              <p>Still, i wonder who helped the Sri Lankan army with the strategy and arms....They played Command &amp; Conquer (Red Alert 3) for training?</p>

              <p>Their commanders play Company of Heros, their soldiers learn from Call Of Duty. Red Alert 3 not realistic.</p>

              <p>its really about Political Virture at this point rather than emotional. But its hard for the Sri Langka govt.</p>
              <p>Firstly they finally see that this conflict would come to an end.</p>
              <p>And also to negociate against military wisdom that they could for once crush the Tamil once and for all.  </p>

              <p><span>The Tigers have been fighting the Sri Lanka's
              army for more than 20 years. They fight to establish a
              separate northern Tamil state within Sri Lanka.<br> <br> The Indian army for a brief period, under Rajiv Gandhi, fought
              along the Sri Lanka’s army against the Tigers. The Indian army
              fought a reluctant war and paid for heavily with high body counts.
              It was a devastation, both politically and morally, to the Indian
              government.<br> <br> The main tactic of the Tigers was the coercion and the
              indoctrination of the common people into committing suicide and
              mass murder as human bomber. The Tigers were the first terror
              organisation to come up with this idea of human suicide
              bombers.<br> <br> This method was, subsequently, copied by the rest of the global

              <p><br>I don't think that would sell. But rather an intergrated society with the mainly body of Sri Langka is what UN and the world community like to see.</p>
              <p>The reason i mention the merit of negociation is because In Iraq the Sadam political party was dismentled totally it literally took the US 4 years to built from scratch and try to intergrate the various ethnic group.   </p>
