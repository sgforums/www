              <p>People i can understand that why the disappointment that LKY is
              still around because you do not wish him to prolong his unholy
              existence. The hope of recovering from the dark age of
              Singapore has to do with the number of days he has left the power
              behind, which he has made it so. Power is the ultimate aphrodisiac,
              he's obsessed with power that he can't even let go at the age of 85
              and have to twist here and there to come out with a unique title
              calls ministor mentor that you can hardly even find it in
              history textbook. Lets us unite to help him cure his addiction by
              reducing his power in the next election. May god be with us.</p>

              <p><br>I beg to differ. I reckon 77.7% due to activism providing alternative voice.  Activism is given publicity due to some reasons. I do not see WP getting a lot of publicity. maybe its just me.</p>
              <p>Activist blogs help release some frustration of the citizens. After that, maybe the citizens less agitated and cool down. Best part is Activist blogs are not political parties posing no threat to gubbertment.</p>
              <p>I predict Opposition days may be numbered given that they have not advanced since the last election.  They appear to be in status quo. SAD.</p>
              <p>When people starting turning to Activists, there could be less support for Opposition since Activists can help voice up for the people also.</p>

              <p>   Lee kwan yew has, in net terms, given his best to singapore. Even in his old age, he continues to serve singapore, but people still insist that he is power crazy. These people are so ungrateful. If LKY does not continue working, I am so sure that opposition still has negative comments on it. This shows how ungrateful and hypocritical they are.</p>
              <p> Lastly, death is universal, LKY will die, our PM will die, Geroge bush will die, ben bernake, alan greenspan, everyone young and old will die someday, including you and me.. so there is nothing surprising that LKY is going to die someday, sooner and later.  </p>

You can mock at his old age and how soon he is going to die while you are all still young, but i guess some of you will probably die first, maybe one of you all, due to accident, going by pure chance. For the rest of you, it will be faster than you think when its time to contemplate your own mortality.</p>
              <p>   Lee kwan yew has, in net terms, given his best to singapore. Even in his old age, he continues to serve singapore, but people still insist that he is power crazy. These people are so ungrateful. If LKY does not continue working, I am so sure that opposition still has negative comments on it. This shows how ungrateful and hypocritical they are.</p>
              <p> Lastly, death is universal, LKY will die, our PM will die, Geroge bush will die, ben bernake, alan greenspan, everyone young and old will die someday, including you and me.. so there is nothing surprising that LKY is going to die someday, sooner and later.  </p>
