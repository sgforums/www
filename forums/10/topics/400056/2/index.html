              <p>ya, okinawa army was sent ot rule oer korea and taiwan for nearly 40 years, and the amount of torture the citizens of both countries gone thru is still behind history, till now the Japanses still did not apologise for their wrong doing, they only accept wrong doing. </p>
              <p>Okinawa soldier sex with local women, give birth to baby boys and gals, the boys was recruited to be like them , at 18 or 20 yo, they were sent to malaya  and other part of thepacific, so in term of japan, they used korean and taiwanese boys to fight for them, and these boys are all  brain washed to obey the emperor, nothing but the emperor, many were killed and when they are successfully, only real Japanese higher army arrive to take over. As for the women, as you known, most become comfort women,  and also used to produce babies for the japs..so cruel</p>

              <p><br>sometimes its the vision of one man, or a group of men their selfish intend that can corrupt and bring a nation to war and agression over another nation. sometimes its the weakness of a nation, corruption and poor education awaraness of the people that presents themselves as weak and feeble, an easy pushover for another national to bully and control.</p>

              <p>any civilised country should have their own military forces, a steadfast compassion gahmen rule based not on greed to having sky high salaries, but wisdom and care for the people. A rule of iron fist to deter agression, a touch of warm to care for the people.</p>

              <p>i see many people so bend on japanese cultures and believes, their ways. they have their rich and strong points, but understand the past and history and do not follow the footsteps or glorify their ways and past deeds.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>the reason why US troops are still based in certain areas of japan i believe was based on agreements. unless it can be broken there's nothing much which can be done. the people theer emay not like the US tropps present but they are lucky enough not to have US troops controlling their daily lifes and rapping their women like what they did to other countries in the past. Any rape cases by US troops there at least has a chance to be presented in the court of law. Its retribution.</p>

              <p>Nothing worng to visit war shrines. Its for their war heroes. But if anyone don;t know about the places is that the ashes and remains of the war heroes directly responsible for initiation and part take in the atrocities of WW2 on many nations of asia were there. If the ghmen had not go ther and pay respect to them in their status as a ruler of a country - Japan, no one will make a fuss about it. this action only provikes and prove that they cannot change their culture and behaviour ro admit that the war criminals resting there should not be honored by their gahmen, but can only be honored by their direct relatives paying respect to their father or grandfathers' dead ashes. This shows that they top leders are still not able to forgo their 'thick skin, want face attitude'.</p>
              <p>US troops present there is for a purpose. To deter any possible agression on japan's side to the neighbouring countries. In case the neighbouring countries (now all got their own army) 'liagong' and attack japan US is still there. US troops is for safe keeping the region and seas there, whtever.</p>
              <p>Incase japan tries to rewrite their books about history and what they did is right and above the celestial law, their children can at least question their parents the presence of foreign US troops there and they will get the righteous answer.</p>

              <p><br>The jap initial motive is to chase away the westerners from Asia, the objective is to help Asia deliberate themselves from western influences, but thing got into a change when their generals and armies start to torture the peoples.</p>
              <p>Taiwanese and Korean have lots of jap breed and blood in them, that is why you see us as industrial as the Jap, we also look the same as them, all due to earlier occupation which lasted a generation, and most of our oldies in taiwan and korean knows how to speak japanese too, because the jap wanted all to become like them, a superior race. And if you look at me, i also look like a Jap model because our ancestor may had been a handsome jap guy.</p>
