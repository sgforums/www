              <p class="art-PostHeader">May 21st, 2010</p>
              <p>At an advanced age when most leaders would have retired and spend their remaining days at home with their families, PAP strongman Lee Kuan Yew continues to tour the world dishing out his “advice” to other leaders and teaching them how to run their countries.</p>
              <p>During a symposium in Tokyo where he is currently on official visit sponsored by Singapore taxpayers, Lee urged Japan again to reconsider moving the U.S. air base out of the island of Okinawa.</p>
              <p><em>“‘We believe that (the US) presence brings about stability and peace and I believe they need a base in the north-east. If there is no base in Japan, then they cannot deploy their weaponry and project their power sufficiently,”</em> Lee was quoted as saying in the Straits Times.</p>
              <p>He stressed the need for the US to act as a counterbalance to China. The last time he said this last year, it triggered a massive outcry among Chinese netizens who pettered him with unflattering names like “traitor to the Chinese race” and “lackey of the Americans”, prompting Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao to intercede on his behalf.</p>
              <p>Lee also called on Japan to emulate Singapore’s example and accept more immigrants in order to grow:</p>
              <p><em>“You have the choice to keep Japan homogeneous and shrinking and stagnant economically, or you accept immigrants and grow.”</em></p>
              <p>With due respect to Lee, he has really no business to poke into Japan’s domestic affairs. It is up to the Japanese themselves to decide if they need more immigrants and not the government.</p>
              <p>Had Lee tried to replicate his immigration policies in Japan, he would have been voted out of office a long time ago.</p>
              <p>Even in Singapore, there is rising frustration, resentment and anger on the ground at the PAP’s liberal immigration and pro-foreigner policies which have caused tremendous suffering and hardship to ordinary Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>According to a recent Wall Street Journal editorial, the relentless influx of foreigners has depressed the wages of Singaporeans, increased the cost of living and led to a decline in the quality of life.</p>
              <p>Lee is indeed a rare “treasure” to the world. By his own admission last year, he is not doing much work lately except doing “forecasting”. Japan is fortunate to have Singapore’s “forecaster extraordinarie” to do some “forecasting” for its future absolutely free of charge courtesy of Singapore taxpayers who is paying Lee’s astronomical annual salary of more than $3 million dollars.</p>

              <p>hmmm.......I supposed we always selectively choose the portion of the documentary that we wanted to see.....and forget that Japan declared war on the US and the Brit.</p>
              <p>Just want o highlight that the documentary you forgot to mention Sg was also once invaded by Japan.....</p>
              <p>Also you forgot that US landed on Okinawa being part of a greater War....that Japan has created.</p>

              <p>There's no way for the old dog to shut up lah. He insists on playing the role of "wise man", "statesman".</p>
              <p>He is actually quite a mediocre thinker, I haven't seen any sort of creative or original idea or thought from Lee Kuan Yew.</p>
              <p>But rubbish ideas, rubbish theories, rubbish policies - a lot.</p>
              <p>I really feel disgraced to have such a poor thinker such as Lee Kuan Yew as leader for so long.</p>
              <p>Poor thinker nevermind, but also a liar, racist, an anglo dog, a vindictive attitude and a political coward.</p>

              <p>actually many jap quite respect him. personally i knw some but i guess he lost a lot of respect from this speeches. what he implies is basically if u dont let USA has military bases in Japan, you are dead.  if u dont let immigrants influx into japan, you are finish.</p>
              <p>maybe the japs respect him for being a clerk working for them during japanese occupation.</p>

              <p>medicated oil. i agree with your comments but the bomb part i beg to differ.</p>
              <p>US and allied forces when starting to fight imperial japanese troops near end of WW2 realised that the imperial rulling gahmen then had order all the japs soldiers to fight to the last man, based on integrity and honor which is still stressed on and very much importatnt in the japanese culture way of a warrior. other people call them 'scare of losing face, death before dishonor'.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>US know that many more of their soldiers and soldiers  and civilians on the japanese side will die in a prolonged struggle if a land invasion of japan were to happened. by then US and allied had been fighting a guerilla suicide warface from the japs in their countries outlaying islands. casualty were far more than expected at both sides considering tthat japan had lost control even of their occupied countries in asia.</p>
              <p>US had the atomic bombs and already warn japan that they will use it if their unconditional surrender requests were not met. the emporer and gahmen thick skin mah. the sacrifice at hiroshima reinforced that. but the thick skin gahmen still thick skin and thick brain man. think US play play they drop the second one at nagasaki and show that they will continue droppign until japan unconditionally surrender. the gahmen then know cannot play play already.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now if only us soldiers had stop harrassing their pretty jap babes <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
