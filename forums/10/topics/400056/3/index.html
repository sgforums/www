              <p><br>Kor kor,</p>
              <p>Those taiwanese are no more taiwanese in mind, they are japanses trained, jap colonised taiwan and korea for nearly 1/2 a century, unlike singapore or china, which only last from 3 to 5years. When the jap first took over korea and taiwan, they did the same, kill as many young able men as possible including those poor and useless one, they will keep the womenfolk for sex and breeding of babies, after about 3 years of killing, both taiwanese and koreans also have to kowtow to them. The jap then train the young boys from as young as 3 years old to follow japanese Kaizai and Zen way of life. When time was riped, they use them to attack S.E.A, and these young men, being lost in identity, only knows how to fight, rape and torture peoples. By the country of japan alone, there cannot be so much soldiers to conqueror the whole of asia including China. That is why we are used as a tool for them. The real japanese army actually fight in China and with the American in the pacific war.</p>
              <p>The japanese believes that there are elites and clever group of people in this world, and in asia, they found out that the Chinese are the most clever and cunning peoples, these are the peoples who can uprise against them, so they got to get rid of them, they dun care the malays, the thais, the viet or the mynamars etc etc, because they know the chinese are their main threat to their future. Just like the German Nazi, they kill the jews because they know that the jews are the next clever people who can overtake them.</p>
              <p>You start to call uncle liao...good lor...if you do it, you see people treat you nicer.</p>

              <p><br>you read paper history too much, you do not fully understand the impact of local taiwanese and korean suffering, those are politics, what i am saying is not from book, but from old taiwanese and koreans tellers, just like Singapore, a foreigners will alway said LKY is good, he do this and that, this are all written in history books for them to read, but the real cause of suffering of people of singapore and the way the singaporeans looks at it is different. That is why some foreigners like to interview and talks to us about our singapore history, which to them, is all by the books, which you are reading now.</p>
