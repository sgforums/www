              <p>What can anyone expect from your ability at understanding anything but 'Point_blank' logic ?</p>
              <p>It is only in your own perverse way of understanding your own 'points' made in your own unique 'blank' form of the English Language that you will imagine carry any substance.</p>
              <p>Yes, ''comming from you - all crap and no substance'' is typical 'Point_blank' juvenile ways of using the English Language.</p>
              <p>The only fool that is hung up on my writing seems to be you, as you seem to be the only one who is returning for more swipes - after getting your ass butt kicked across each thread in this Speakers' Corner.</p>
              <p>You are the only vain one that is intent on seeking recognition from the gallery, seeking others to judge our on-going debate, when you have nothing truly that of value - even nothing to point as to where my supposed lies exist, only general accusation and loud obscene expletives seems to be your only forte.</p>
              <p>It is amazing that you dare take up the cudgel for your God Father, when you cannot even protect your own ass butt from getting constantly swiped.</p>

              <p>How do I feel at the receiving end of your nonsense? Just like talking to a pathetic mad man who escaped from Woodbridge lor, those that no matter who they see, will just open their mouth to showcase the filthy worms crawling around inside. How could one ever expect reason and logic coming from a pathetic lunatic like you?</p>
              <p>PS: How does it feel to be the joke of the forum, to be look down upon as a pathetic lifeform with totally no credibility by the majority in this forum?</p>

              <blockquote><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: xx-small;"> In the 2001 general elections his (and
              his team mates’) nomination papers to contest the Aljunied Group
              Representation Constituency (GRC) were declared void as the statutory
              declaration forms were deemed to be improperly filed. (In 2005, the
              government amended the Parliamentary Elections Act to do away with the
              need for a statutory declaration.)</span></blockquote><blockquote>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: xx-small;">In 2006, he stood as a candidate for the </span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: xx-small;"><a href="http://www.wp.org.sg/">Workers' Party </a>as </span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: xx-small;">part of a five member team in the Aljunied GRC. James Gomez became the face of the 2006 general elections</span><a name="Academic_life"></a><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: xx-small;"> when the ruling party tried to make political capital out of his application for a minority certificate. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: xx-small;">As a result, during Singapore’s General Elections held in May 2006, “James Gomez” became the most searched name in <a href="http://www.technorati.com/">Technorati</a> an "<em>authority on what's going on in the world of weblogs</em>".
              The volume of reportage in the local and international media on James
              Gomez during the nine-days of campaigning raised James’s profile to an
              iconic level. </span></p>

              <p><em>a lion puppet</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For those who wondered what happened.</p>
              <p>Lionnoisy created a clone called "makepeace" which he used in speakers corner to further his own agenda, trying to give people the impression that there are others out there that would agree with him.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately he did a very poor job of hiding it.</p>
              <p>This kind of behaviour is called sockpuppeting, ie. creating a false online identity to praise, defend or create the illusion of support for one’s self, allies or company.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A <strong>sockpuppet</strong> is an <a title="Online identity" rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Online_identity"><span style="color: #0066cc;">online identity</span></a> used for purposes of deception within an <a title="Internet" rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Internet"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Internet</span></a> community. In its earliest usage, a sockpuppet was a false identity through which a member of an Internet community speaks while pretending not to, like a puppeteer manipulating a <a title="Hand puppet" rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Hand_puppet"><span style="color: #0066cc;">hand puppet</span></a>.<sup><a rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/forums/1164/topics/#cite_note-0"><span style="color: #0066cc;">[1]</span></a></sup></p>
              <p>In current usage, the perception of the term has been extended beyond second identities of people who already post in a forum to include other uses of misleading online identities. For example, a <em><a title="NY Times" rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/NY_Times"><span style="color: #0066cc;">NY Times</span></a></em> article claims that "sock-puppeting" is defined as "the act of creating a fake online identity to praise, defend or create the illusion of support for one’s self, allies or company."<sup><a rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/forums/1164/topics/#cite_note-1"><span style="color: #0066cc;">[2]</span></a></sup></p>
              <p>The key difference between a sockpuppet and a regular <a title="Pseudonym" rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Pseudonym"><span style="color: #0066cc;">pseudonym</span></a> (sometimes termed an "alt") is the pretense that the puppet is a third party who is not affiliated with the puppeteer.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To "flame wars" and "phishing" we can now add "<strong>sock puppet</strong>." A <strong>sock puppet</strong>, for those still boning up, is a false identity through which a member of an Internet community speaks while pretending not to, like a puppeteer manipulating a hand puppet. Recently, a senior editor at The New Republic got in trouble for some particularly colorful <strong>sock puppet</strong>ry.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When Lee Siegel began blogging for The New Republic, he found, as many others have, that Internet posters tend to be fairly outspoken — and a good number of the posters on the blog were harshly critical. An exception was ''sprezzatura,'' who regularly offered extravagant praise. After Mr. Siegel was criticized for his writing about Jon Stewart, host of ''The Daily Show,'' sprezzatura wrote: ''Siegel is brave, brilliant and wittier than Stewart will ever be. Take that, you bunch of immature, abusive sheep.'' A reader charged that sprezzatura was in fact Mr. Siegel, but sprezzatura denied it.</p>
              <p>The reader turned out to be right. ...</p>
              <p>After making some lame and hasty excuse about his account being hacked, lionnoisy suddenly abandoned all this threads in which him being sockpuppeting was being mentioned. Unfortunately his excuse cannot stand up to logic as he was seen responding to and talking back TO HIS OWN ACCOUNT.</p>
              <p>This is what happened:</p>
              <p>29th April 0932hrs a "user" called "makepeace" that had never posted before created a lionnoisy-sounding titled thread called "<strong>Oz Judge ban TV drama &amp; interview glorify gangland wars</strong> "</p>
              <p>Already suspisions were raised because the structure and phrasing of the title was signature of lionnoisy. The first post by this "makepeace" was as such:</p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">Originally posted by makepeace:</span></p>

              <p>jurors to be affected while the trial of a murder case is in progress.</p>

              <p>U wont know TV programmes on Oz gangsters</p>

              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>6.Questions</strong></span></p>
              <p>A.Why the media want to air the interview while the trial</p>
              <p>is still on?</p>
              <p>B.How are the gang activities in Down Under?</p>
              <p>C.Am i look like anti--Oz?</p>
              <p>D.How true are the postings in 3 and 4 listed above.</p>
              <p>i dunt expect the there are so many details about</p>
              <p>Oz gangsters.Can any one tell me more?</p>
              <p>Note that other then for the user name, this post is virtually indistinguishable from the countless of other lionnoisy posts we can compare it with. The excessive reliance on the media, posting of hyperlinks, using warped logic that takes issues out of their context, and most tellingly the horrible english which make typos and grammatical errors right down to what lionnoisy would EXACTLY make is exactly what you'd expect from lionnoisy.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; line-height: normal;"><span>Hence lionnoisy must have been someone disappointed because after 20 minutes still nobody bothered to reply to his post under makepeace. Hence he decided to bump his own thread.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; line-height: normal;"><span>But after a few lackluster replies, he finally decided to "talk" to makepeace</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>I cant believe there are so many killings</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>in the above links !!!</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>More excited than Holloywood movies!!</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Note the bad acting, where he pretended to be "excited" and "surprised" about what he wrote himself.</span></p>
              <p>Now this is the funny part, if his account was really hacked as he claimed it to be, he would certainly not be replying back to his "hacked" account so happily in such a way.</p>
              <p>But in any case when he was exposed he made this very funny, frantic and desperate post trying to suddenly divorce himself from the actions of his sockpuppetry by claiming he was hacked. Unfortunately all a basic look at the thread will reveal what really happened, and that is nothing other then lionnoisy was caught red-handed sockpuppeting.</p>
