              <p><br>Asswipe Atobe, I was at the WP rally on 29th April 2006 at Nee Soon East.  MP Low TK stood beside Slimey James who read a prepared legal drafted statement of apology, address to the crowd and media.</p>
              <p>MP Low TK then, flanked by the election hustings and paraphanelia of his party, addressed the crowd, in mandarin:-<br>"After the unpleasant incident between Gomez and the Election Dept, I asked Mr Gomez about the details leading to and following the incident. I think this was the PAP’s making a mountain out of a molehill. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Of course, I am responsible</span>, no problem..."</p>
              <p>Is this an apology to us, Singaporeans, enough? Are you claiming MP Low is not assuring the citizens of an error that had occured by a member of his party? He being 'responsible' was a political dirty trick to the crowd to calm them? <strong>BUT WAIT!</strong> You will claim it is not an apology, simply because you will be willing to sacrifice  WP for your own ego and ends.</p>
              <p>Why go to the ELD office if not to file and submit the certificate? If Slimey james claims he is busy, why go there in the first place? Honest mistake? lol! what does he take us all for, fools like you, Asswipe Atobe? And why apologise to <span style="color: #ff0000;">t</span>he country if he did not admit he had done wrong?</p>
              <p>So did i change the facts, or had I once again proven your despical attempts to change facts to suit your pathetic ego? I had consistantly provided evidences to back my claims, yet you continue to talk crap and evade backing up your allegations, are you mentally challenged and need psychology help?</p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Do we need to argue your other naively thought-out reasons for James Gomez attendance at the ELD, etc, etc, etc, etc - that will surely expose your true slimey nature that has been confirmed by your sheer 'Point_blank' dishonesty ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">You are no better then an ''ASS'' - whose ''arse'' has been consistently swiped by yours truly - could this have affected your brains so badly that you cannot see things straight, but only in blanks ?</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Amazing how desparation can produce thwarted impressions to save your thin skin ass or arse from getting swiped - again, and again, and again, and again.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Amazing that you were at the WP rally during Election 2006, and yet you mention every word so clearly - and you can quote him in full after the passing of 2 years {?}</span></p>
              <p>""After the unpleasant incident between Gomez and the Election Dept, I asked Mr Gomez about the details leading to and following the incident. I think this was the PAP’s making a mountain out of a molehill. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Of course, I am responsible</span>, no problem..."</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Given your abilities that have been proven repeatedly to be ''Point_blank" - as well as ''Point_blank dishonest'' - can we trust you any further with the accuracy and interpretation of the events that transpired two years ago</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">From the piece of statement that you quoted - and which you attribute to be from WP Low Thia Kiang - where is the essential words that clearly state that</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">"<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">I, Low Thia Kiang, sincerely apologise for the errors of Mr James Gomez</span></strong>" ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">You were diligent in underscoring his line, but was that a clear apology ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Are you not being very slimey in the way you snake through the words that are said to be made by others ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Another argumentative ''point'' from you that has been shown to come to another ''blank" ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Do we need to argue your other naively thought-out reasons for James Gomez attendance at the ELD, etc, etc, etc, etc - that will surely expose your true slimey nature that has been confirmed by your sheer 'Point_blank' dishonesty ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">You are no better then an ''ASS'' - whose ''arse'' has been consistently swiped by yours truly - could this have affected your brains so badly that you cannot see things straight, but only in blanks ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Grow up, and stop being a juvenile twirp if you think you can fit your God Father's shoes that probably fit your pompous head more then your feet.</span></p>

              <p>ASSWIPE ATOBE, don't you even have the decency to admit your malicious mistake, misconceptions and blind irrationality even when presented the truth. Do you need psychology help or you insist on being wilfully idiotic here?</p>
              <p>For your benefit, i repost again in reply to your question posed to me, which i at least never evade, but you, using arrogance to cover ignorance, big words, seductive lies, non-commital questions,  to fool people over to your egoistical stupid side.</p>
              <p>And when confronted with you truth, you twist your words again. You are nothing but a word whore, asswipe Atobe. Trust? only fools will trust you. Whip me? lol! You must be deluded!</p>
              <p>Asswipe Atobe, I was at the WP rally on 29th April 2006 at Nee Soon East.  MP Low TK stood beside Slimey James who read a prepared legal drafted statement of apology, address to the crowd and media.</p>
              <p>MP Low TK then, flanked by the election hustings and paraphanelia of his party, addressed the crowd, in mandarin:-<br>"After the unpleasant incident between Gomez and the Election Dept, I asked Mr Gomez about the details leading to and following the incident.

              <p>Is this an apology to us, Singaporeans, enough? Are you claiming MP Low is not assuring the citizens of an error that had occured by a member of his party? He being 'responsible' was a political dirty trick to the crowd to calm them? <strong>BUT WAIT!</strong> You will claim it is not an apology, simply because you will be willing to sacrifice  WP for your own ego and ends.</p>
              <p>Why go to the ELD office if not to file and submit the certificate? If Slimey james claims he is busy, why go there in the first place? Honest mistake? lol! what does he take us all for, fools like you, Asswipe Atobe? And why apologise to <span style="color: #ff0000;">t</span>he country if he did not admit he had done wrong?</p>
              <p>So did i change the facts, or had I once again proven your despical attempts to change facts to suit your pathetic ego? I had consistantly provided evidences to back my claims, yet you continue to talk crap and evade backing up your allegations, are you mentally challenged and need psychology help?</p>
              <p>You are as willfully blind as you are mentally challenged, Asswipe Atobe!</p>

In other words, it underscores those democratic principles enshrined in the rule of law as propounded by Dicey that consequently promotes free and fair elections including unhindered space for citizenry participation.

This is inevitably transformed into imbalanced electoral designs to perpetuate vested interests. Some countries successfully fight electoral injustice effectively whilst others are less successful. The primary reason behind this is the type of governance of which is shaped by a country’s <span class="highlightedsearchterm">political</span>, economic and cultural history and the populace’s maturity and understanding of their political autonomy. It is less a problem for countries that adhere to the rule of law where there are ministerial responsibility and accountability and that procedures are transparent; but it would be otherwise for those that do not have possess such democratic norms, especially countries in transition from authoritarianism.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/unused/sorry.png" alt="sorry.png"></span></span></h1>

The ultimate sovereignty lies in the hands of the people and not the servants they elect to serve them; and it is only upon the realization and exercise of their respective sovereignty that democracy is finally attained.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/unused/satisfied.png" alt="satisfied.png"></span></span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"></span></h1>
