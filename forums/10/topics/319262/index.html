              <h2><span style="color: #800000;">If there was no internet, would James gomez be another Chee Soon Juan i.e. bankrupted?</span><br></h2>
              <h2><br>http://asia.news.yahoo.com/060513/5/singapore208054.html</h2>

              <h2>James Gomez is still liar, dishonest despite stern warning: MM Lee</h2>
              <p>CHINA : Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew says the attorney-general's
                  decision not to prosecute Workers' Party member James Gomez does not
                  make him less of a liar or less dishonest.</p>
              <p>In a statement released from China, where he is currently on a visit, Mr Lee reiterated what he had called Mr Gomez earlier.</p>
              <p>The
                  Minister Mentor had said that Mr Gomez was a liar and dishonest and
                  that Workers' Party chairman Sylvia Lim and the party secretary-general
                  Low Thia Khiang did not act honourably by shielding him.</p>
              <p>Mr Lee added that if Mr Gomez claims he is not a liar nor dishonest, he can go to court to clear his name.</p>
              <p>Earlier
                  on Friday, Mr Gomez had been let off with a stern warning for
                  threatening an Elections Department officer, ending a three week long
                  saga.</p>
              <p>Investigations by police started after a complaint by the Elections Department against Mr Gomez on May 6.

              </p>
              <p>Police said that after reviewing the evidence, the Public
                  Prosecutor was satisfied that Mr Gomez had used threatening words
                  towards a public servant.</p>
              <p>He could have been fined up to $5,000 or jailed up to one year.</p>
              <p>But
                  police decided it would let Mr Gomez go with a warning instead, as he
                  had been cooperative and had not committed any previous criminal
                  offences.</p>
              <p>The saga revolved around Mr Gomez's claim that he had
                  applied for a minority candidate certificate at the Elections
                  Department before the May 6 General Election.</p>
              <p>Security camera
                  footage from the Elections Department later showed that he did not
                  submit the application form but instead put it into his bag.</p>
              <p>Mr Gomez subsequently admitted he did not hand in the form and apologised, saying he was distracted.</p>
              <p>But
                  People's Action Party leaders found his apology inadequate and accused
                  him of lying and trying to discredit the Elections Department.</p>
              <p>"It
                  is in the AG's authority to exercise his discretion, but his decision
                  not to prosecute does not, in any way, make James Gomez less of a liar
                  or less dishonest. I reiterate what I have called him, a liar and
                  dishonest, and that Ms Sylvia Lim and Mr Low Thia Khiang did not act
                  honourably by shielding him. If Gomez claims he is not a liar nor
                  dishonest, he can go to court to clear his name," said Mr Lee in his
                  statement.</p>

              <p>In this climate of fear, its no wonder good candidates for elections would prefer to watch from the sidelines.Afterall who wants to be "fixed" by LHL?</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">More detailed account:-</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">April 24, Mr Gomez, accompanied by Worker's Party Chairman Slyvia Lim and filmed by media cameras, filled up the minority certificate to run in the Constituency. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">After being left alone by the cameras and his Chairman, however, he was shown (through CCTV footage) to have kept the forms in an envelope in his bag and left the building without submitting it.April 26, 2006, James Gomez called the elections department to enquire about the status of the form, but was indignant that the board had not received the form. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">He subsequently reminded the ELD officer of the "consequences" of misplacing his form, pointing to the CCTV nearby.April 27,2006, the elections department confirmed through CCTV that Mr James Gomez did not submit a "minority-race candidate application form", despite claiming on the eve of Nomination Day that he had done so."</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1. Why go to the Elections Department if not to apply and then hand in the form? Distracted by what? The female staff?</p>
              <p>2. Why threaten ELD officer of 'consequences' and then make a big hoohah to others when he quietly did a con job?</p>
              <p>3. It was, as the CCTV had shown, no 'fumble' but pure attempt to cheat. If next time you catch a pick pocket stealing your wallet, you better let him go, cause he was just 'fumbling' your back pocket.</p>
              <p>I am not sure whether the date of the news on the first post was 'unintentionally or intentionally' left out. After years, even MM Lee had let the issue died down, MP Low TH still in office, so what's this 'accountability' some people are asking for the removal of DPM Wong? </p>

              <p>Poh, this thread is about Slimey james. Rather than to tell you off about the relevance of your case to that of slimey's, i will instead let you differentiate yourself between the 2. </p>
              <p><br>What Slimey james had done was nothing more than an attempt to smear the ruling party through underhand means. It was to show that he did go the election office to register his application for candidacy.</p>
              <p><br>And then to claim that he was denied the chance to run should the election department claims there was no entry of his application - implying that the election department are at fraud, which was why he cunningly stuff that application form into his bag instead of submitting it. </p>
              <p><br>Fortunately, CCTV cameras caught his act red-handed. This is no honest or simple mistake, but a deliberate act to undermine our elections and trust in the election department.</p>
              <p><br>Personally, i may forgive him over time for the cheating, for i am a rational and forgiving person, BUT I CANNOT FORGIVE HIM FOR ATTEMPTING TO SACRIFICE THE ELD OFFICER FOR HIS OWN PERSONAL MOTIVE TO GET SYMPATHY AND ELECTED! </p>
              <p><br>Can you imagine what would have had happened if there were no CCTV evidence? The ELD officer, our fellow Singaporean, would be accountable and charged, and would be made out of job, not of his fault, but by the con artiste Slimey james. </p>
              <p><br>Already, even before he begins his public career, he had proven his craveness and readiness to sacrifice others for his own personal gains, what more will happen when fools elect him or like some now, still protecting his memory? </p>
              <p><br>Some here claim the ruling party of wrong-doings, fraud and all kinds of allegations without evidences, some even years back, yet here is one outright fraud caught on camera, with real life at stake, they would rather turn a blind eye. Have we all lost sight of truth and reality?</p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">"Security camera footage from the Elections Department later showed that he did not submit the application form but instead put it into his bag.</span></p>

              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">More detailed account:-</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">April 24, Mr Gomez, accompanied by Worker's Party Chairman Slyvia Lim and filmed by media cameras, filled up the minority certificate to run in the Constituency.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">After being left alone by the cameras and his Chairman, however, he was shown (through CCTV footage) to have kept the forms in an envelope in his bag and left the building without submitting it.April 26, 2006, James Gomez called the elections department to enquire about the status of the form, but was indignant that the board had not received the form.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">He subsequently reminded the ELD officer of the "consequences" of misplacing his form, pointing to the CCTV nearby.April 27,2006, the elections department confirmed through CCTV that Mr James Gomez did not submit a "minority-race candidate application form", despite claiming on the eve of Nomination Day that he had done so."</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1. Why go to the Elections Department if not to apply and then hand in the form? Distracted by what? The female staff?</p>
              <p>2. Why threaten ELD officer of 'consequences' and then make a big hoohah to others when he quietly did a con job?</p>
              <p>3. It was, as the CCTV had shown, no 'fumble' but pure attempt to cheat. If next time you catch a pick pocket stealing your wallet, you better let him go, cause he was just 'fumbling' your back pocket.</p>
              <p>I am not sure whether the date of the news on the first post was 'unintentionally or intentionally' left out. After years, even MM Lee had let the issue died down, MP Low TH still in office, so what's this 'accountability' some people are asking for the removal of DPM Wong? </p>

              <p>Did you review the CCTV footage, or were you depending on what was reported ?</p>
              <p>How do you know what transpired from the time everyone were present facing each other at the counter - the ELD official or officials with James Gomez and Sylvia Lim - until the point that no one was there that got James Gomez to place the forms in the envelope, then the envelope into his attached case ?</p>
              <p>What were the events during that moment that caused the distraction, and which got everyone away - leaving James alone ?</p>
              <p>Was the footage replayed with the recorded sound, or was the recorded sound turned off and viewers attention was led through the footage by a "voice over guide" ?</p>
              <p>What gain can James Gomez acheive by messing up his nomination papers - surely not to create a situation that he cannot stand for election ?</p>
              <p>Why should the word ''consequences" be viewed as a threat ?</p>
              <p>How do you infer from a CCTV footage the intention of a person to cheat ?</p>
              <p>The act of robbery with a gun captured on CCTV is obvious - how does your ingenius mind infer from a CCTV footage the intent of a person ?</p>
              <p>LKY did criticis Sylvia Lim and Low Thia Kiang for suggesting that ''we should move on after James Gomez had offered an apology'' - yet LKY demanded that the WP leadership should do more than just to allow James Gomez to apologise and propose for Singapore to "move on".</p>
              <p>Is Wong Kan Seng's responsibility not greater in the complacent manner of sheer over confidence that his Home Affairs Ministry is managed - which resulted in the escape of Mas Selamat Kastari ?</p>
              <p>Surely, MSK escape is more damaging to Singapore's security and reputation than James Gomez accusation of inefficiency at the ELD ?</p>
              <p>It was LKY's public statement that Singaporeans should learn from the Japanese ways in which the Leadership accepts accountability for the mishaps of their subordinates.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, his comments were intended for Singaporeans to follow, and not to be applied to himself or his own.</p>
              <p>Has LKY never make a mistake in his life time that he wished he had never made ?</p>
              <p>Surely his error of judgment in laughing at Chiam See Tong's O-Level Grade at a noon time Election Rally at Fullerton Square was one of a few such gaffs that he has made in his 50 odd years as a politician ?</p>
              <p>Did he ever make a public apology to his insulting comments towards all the O-Level Singaporeans - insinuating that they cannot be compared to the talents similar to his breed of University educated genes ?</p>

              distraction, and which got everyone away - leaving James
              alone ?</p>
              <p>Was the footage replayed with the recorded sound, or was the
              recorded sound turned off and viewers attention was led
              through the footage by a "voice over guide" ?</p>
              <p>What gain can James Gomez acheive by messing up his nomination
              papers - surely not to create a situation that he cannot stand for
              election ?</p>
              <p>Why should the word ''consequences" be viewed as a threat ?</p>
              <p>How do you infer from a CCTV footage the intention of a person
              to cheat ?</p>
              <p>The act of robbery with a gun captured on CCTV is obvious -
              how does your ingenius mind infer from a CCTV footage the
              intent of a person ?</p>
              <p>LKY did criticis Sylvia Lim and Low Thia Kiang for suggesting
              that ''we should move on after James Gomez had offered an apology''
              - yet LKY demanded that the WP leadership should do more than just
              to allow James Gomez to apologise and propose for Singapore to
              "move on".</p>
              <p>Is Wong Kan Seng's responsibility not greater in the complacent
              manner of sheer over confidence that his Home Affairs Ministry
              is managed - which resulted in the escape of Mas Selamat Kastari
              ?</p>
              <p>Surely, MSK escape is more damaging to Singapore's security and
              reputation than James Gomez accusation of inefficiency at the ELD
              ?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">It was LKY's public statement that Singaporeans should learn
              from the Japanese ways in which the Leadership accepts
              accountability for the mishaps of their subordinates.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Unfortunately, his comments were intended for Singaporeans to
              follow, and not to be applied to himself or his own.</span></p>
              <p>Has LKY never make a mistake in his life time that he wished he
              had never made ?</p>
              <p>Surely his error of judgment in laughing at Chiam See Tong's
              O-Level Grade at a noon time Election Rally at Fullerton Square was
              one of a few such gaffs that he has made in his 50 odd years
              as a politician ?</p>
              <p>Did he ever make a public apology to his insulting comments
              towards all the O-Level Singaporeans - insinuating that they cannot
              be compared to the talents similar to his breed of University
              educated genes ?</p>
              <p> </p>
