              <p>Okay, so what was it i said 'illogical' and that was 'bull shit'? I repost to make it easier for you.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Poh, this thread is about Slimey james. Rather than to tell you off about the relevance of your case to that of slimey's, i will instead let you differentiate yourself between the 2.</p>
              <p> <br>What Slimey james had done was nothing more than an attempt to smear the ruling party through underhand means. It was to show that he did go the election office to register his application for candidacy.</p>
              <p><br>And then to claim that he was denied the chance to run should the election department claims there was no entry of his application - implying that the election department are at fraud, which was why he cunningly stuff that application form into his bag instead of submitting it.</p>
              <p> <br>Fortunately, CCTV cameras caught his act red-handed. This is no honest or simple mistake, but a deliberate act to undermine our elections and trust in the election department.</p>
              <p><br>Personally, i may forgive him over time for the cheating, for i am a rational and forgiving person, <strong>BUT I CANNOT FORGIVE HIM FOR ATTEMPTING TO SACRIFICE THE ELD OFFICER FOR HIS OWN PERSONAL MOTIVE TO GET SYMPATHY AND ELECTED!</strong></p>
              <p> <br>Can you imagine what would have had happened if there were no CCTV evidence? The ELD officer, <strong>our fellow Singaporean</strong>, would be accountable and charged, and would be made out of job, not of his fault, but by the con artiste Slimey james.</p>
              <p> <br>Already, even before he begins his public career, he had proven his craveness and readiness to sacrifice others for his own personal gains, what more will happen when fools elect him or like some now, still protecting his memory? </p>
              <p><br>Some here claim the ruling party of wrong-doings, fraud and all kinds of allegations without evidences, some even years back, yet here is one outright fraud caught on camera, with real life at stake, they would rather turn a blind eye. <strong>Have we all lost sight of truth and reality?</strong></p>

The constituency encompasses the majority of Ang Mo Kio, Teck Ghee, Kebun Baru, Yio Chu Kang, Jalan Kayu, Seletar Hills, part of Serangoon North, the western portion of Sengkang - Fernvale, Anchorvale and the southern portion of Yishun - Nee Soon South. In the 2001 general election, <strong>the constituency was enlarged to include most parts of the Cheng San Group Representation Constituency...</strong></p>

              <p>I am sure there will be many things that would make good fodder to gripe amongst our young, who now sitting comfortably with a nice roof at home with aircon, internet access to the world, jobs avaliable, opportunities galore for the hardworking and smart, education and continual education subsidized and so much more, compared to the Myanmar folks who have to eat frogs and longkang fish for meals.</p>

              <p>Okay, so what was it i said 'illogical' and that was 'bull
              shit'? I repost to make it easier for you.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Poh, this thread is about Slimey james. Rather than to tell you
              off about the relevance of your case to that of slimey's, i will
              instead let you differentiate yourself between the 2.</p>
              <p> <br> What Slimey james had done was nothing more than an attempt to
              smear the ruling party through underhand means. It was to show that
              he did go the election office to register his application for
              candidacy.</p>
              <p><br> And then to claim that he was denied the chance to run should the
              election department claims there was no entry of his application -
              implying that the election department are at fraud, which was why
              he cunningly stuff that application form into his bag instead of
              submitting it.</p>
              <p> <br> Fortunately, CCTV cameras caught his act red-handed. This is no
              honest or simple mistake, but a deliberate act to undermine our
              elections and trust in the election department.</p>
              <p><br> Personally, i may forgive him over time for the cheating, for i am
              a rational and forgiving person, <strong>BUT I CANNOT FORGIVE HIM
              FOR ATTEMPTING TO SACRIFICE THE ELD OFFICER FOR HIS OWN PERSONAL
              MOTIVE TO GET SYMPATHY AND ELECTED!</strong></p>
              <p> <br> Can you imagine what would have had happened if there were no CCTV
              evidence? The ELD officer, <strong>our fellow Singaporean</strong>,
              would be accountable and charged, and would be made out of job, not
              of his fault, but by the con artiste Slimey james.</p>
              <p> <br> Already, even before he begins his public career, he had proven his
              craveness and readiness to sacrifice others for his own personal
              gains, what more will happen when fools elect him or like some now,
              still protecting his memory? </p>
              <p><br> Some here claim the ruling party of wrong-doings, fraud and all
              kinds of allegations without evidences, some even years
              back, yet here is one outright fraud caught on camera, with
              real life at stake, they would rather turn a blind eye.
              <strong>Have we all lost sight of truth and reality?</strong></p>

              <p><br>Asswipe Atobe, I was at the WP rally on 29th April 2006 at Nee Soon East.  MP Low TK stood beside Slimey James who read a prepared legal drafted statement of apology, address to the crowd and media.</p>
              <p>MP Low TK then, flanked by the election hustings and paraphanelia of his party, addressed the crowd, in mandarin:-<br>"After the unpleasant incident between Gomez and the Election Dept, I asked Mr Gomez about the details leading to and following the incident. I think this was the PAP’s making a mountain out of a molehill. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Of course, I am responsible</span>, no problem..."</p>
              <p>Is this an apology to us, Singaporeans, enough? Are you claiming MP Low is not assuring the citizens of an error that had occured by a member of his party? He being 'responsible' was a political dirty trick to the crowd to calm them? <strong>BUT WAIT!</strong> You will claim it is not an apology, simply because you will be willing to sacrifice  WP for your own ego and ends.</p>
              <p>Why go to the ELD office if not to file and submit the certificate? If Slimey james claims he is busy, why go there in the first place? Honest mistake? lol! what does he take us all for, fools like you, Asswipe Atobe? And why apologise to <span style="color: #ff0000;">t</span>he country if he did not admit he had done wrong?</p>
              <p>So did i change the facts, or had I once again proven your despical attempts to change facts to suit your pathetic ego? I had consistantly provided evidences to back my claims, yet you continue to talk crap and evade backing up your allegations, are you mentally challenged and need psychology help?</p>
              <p>You are as willfully blind as you are mentally challenged, Asswipe Atobe!</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>And please don't tell me this is state controlled media, for you will only be alleging that the police, public prosecutor and the ELD reported statements are lies, and that is a serious allegation. </p>

              <p>Allegation definition:-</p>
              <ol>
              <li>To assert to be true; affirm: <em><span>alleging his innocence of the charge.</span> </em></li>
              <li>To assert without or before proof: <em><span>The indictment alleges that the commissioner took bribes.</span> </em></li>
              <li>To state (a plea or excuse, for example) in support or denial of a claim or accusation: <em><span>The defendant alleges temporary insanity.</span> </em></li>
              </ol>
              <p><em></em></p>
              <p>In equal measure, you are alleging he is innocent. Is he? Where is the evidence? Is he prepared to defend himself? You posted his blog, and did you see any evidence he is prepared to fight for his innocence?</p>
              <p>Whereelse the allegations of his misconduct has irrefutable evidences that should the authorities choose to press charges, they could.</p>
              <p>Charge him, waste the court's time, and you claim the authorities are heavy handed. Don't charge, and you claim he is innocent even when the facts and evidences are placed before your eyes.</p>
