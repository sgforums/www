              <p>There had never been any doubt about the independence of the ELD. Only the integrity of a political wannabe who threatened an ELD officer for 'misplacing' his application form when he had NEVER intended to submit it in the first place. Should there be no CCTV evidence, who's word would be believed in the often emotionally charged fields of elections prior to voting? An <strong>innocent man</strong> from that apolitical department would have been held accountable and charged for negligence, there would be serious doubts in the ELD apolitical objectiveness, thru the wilful selfish harm done by one rotten rat - and that is real life and non-political.</p>

              <p>There is also a somewhat similar saying - its better for a fool to remain silent than to open his/her mouth and remove all doubts. ( more so if he/she has no facts to back it up, which is usual amongst political fools )</p>

              <p>Poh, what is your purpose in that question? State it clearer then all can see your intent and i can give you a brutally honest reply. It would be interesting to up the stakes if you are honest with your reply. You know full well where i stand on this issue, along with many other citizens and none lesser than MM Lee who calls him a liar outright in the media. This is not an evasion. I await your reply.</p>

              doing the right thing.</p>

              Yawning Bread called that Gomez saga "bicycle theft tactic". It really show the PAP MPs to be very small-minded and deficient of independent thinking when they all jumped in to condemned Gomez.
