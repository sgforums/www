              <p>Just what I have been trying to impress in this forum long time ago.</p>
              <p>In choosing a government we choose the best of the worst. An analogy I gave some time ago was about packaged suntan (coconut milk squeezed from gratings)</p>
              <p>An acomplished cook told me that all the packaged suntan are lousy, but she pick the Kara brand because it is the best of the lot.</p>

              <p>All the more reason to vote in more opposition to have a balance of power, where no single party has an overwhelming majority to single handedly pass laws and amend constitution.</p>

              <p>ya. i agreed too that this is the
              way of politics.</p>
              <p>make oppositions look as bad as possible and make themselves look as good as possible even if they did something wrong. just lie low for a few weeks and most people would have forgotten about it.</p>
              <p>how many people are able to notice that this is what pap is doing?</p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Are there differences in moral standards?!!! Have you lost yours??? While there is no perfection, there is still a minimum standard and if you think slimey james is of good moral character, then i certainly dare not imagine you at your worst!</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Is this good enough, or do you want to extrapolate more for your understanding?</span></p>

              <p>First of all, defamation is to slander against someone without evidence. Whether in politics or in working life, would you accept it if someone accuses you of being, example;- a child molester, without evidence? You would probably punch the daylights outta him, or if you are civilised, sue him and make him pay.</p>
              <p>How more, ministers who administers over us, MUST clear their reputation and name, more so when there is US$300 billion in the kitty?</p>
              <p>Do you think the  ministers enjoys such suits? They have a country to run, people to take care of, solutions to find, where got time to challenge everyone of them? <strong>So the best - Summary judgement to asses if there is evidence,  and if not, fine them to the HILT, to stop such nutcases from wasting the PEOPLE's time.</strong></p>
              <p>It sickens one to see such defamation suits, but the opposition STILL DO NOT learn, and continue to act, talk without evidences. So who is more slimey - the one who defames, or the one who trys to clear his name?</p>

              <p>Somehow, you are comparing a pre-election issue (and Gomez having left Singapore and WP) involving merely an application</p>
              <p>vs</p>
              <p>an post-election issue that concerns national security</p>
              <p>Surely you can tell the difference in the seriousness for both events. It's like comparing an issue of forgetting to submit an exam paper vs an issue of failing to detect that a  bomb has been placed at some major shopping centre.</p>
              <p>Don't try to compare a lizard vs a crocodile, then tell us that the accountability in both instances are similar. You make no sense.</p>

              <p>Did you review the CCTV footage, or were you depending on what was reported ?</p>
              <p>How do you know what transpired from the time everyone were present facing each other at the counter - the ELD official or officials with James Gomez and Sylvia Lim - until the point that no one was there that got James Gomez to place the forms in the envelope, then the envelope into his attached case ?</p>
              <p>What were the events during that moment that caused the distraction, and which got everyone away - leaving James alone ?</p>
              <p>Was the footage replayed with the recorded sound, or was the recorded sound turned off and viewers attention was led through the footage by a "voice over guide" ?</p>
              <p>What gain can James Gomez acheive by messing up his nomination papers - surely not to create a situation that he cannot stand for election ?</p>
              <p>Why should the word ''consequences" be viewed as a threat ?</p>
              <p>How do you infer from a CCTV footage the intention of a person to cheat ?</p>
              <p>The act of robbery with a gun captured on CCTV is obvious - how does your ingenius mind infer from a CCTV footage the intent of a person ?</p>
              <p>LKY did criticis Sylvia Lim and Low Thia Kiang for suggesting that ''we should move on after James Gomez had offered an apology'' - yet LKY demanded that the WP leadership should do more than just to allow James Gomez to apologise and propose for Singapore to "move on".</p>
              <p>Is Wong Kan Seng's responsibility not greater in the complacent manner of sheer over confidence that his Home Affairs Ministry is managed - which resulted in the escape of Mas Selamat Kastari ?</p>
              <p>Surely, MSK escape is more damaging to Singapore's security and reputation than James Gomez accusation of inefficiency at the ELD ?</p>
              <p>It was LKY's public statement that Singaporeans should learn from the Japanese ways in which the Leadership accepts accountability for the mishaps of their subordinates.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, his comments were intended for Singaporeans to follow, and not to be applied to himself or his own.</p>
              <p>Has LKY never make a mistake in his life time that he wished he had never made ?</p>
              <p>Surely his error of judgment in laughing at Chiam See Tong's O-Level Grade at a noon time Election Rally at Fullerton Square was one of a few such gaffs that he has made in his 50 odd years as a politician ?</p>
              <p>Did he ever make a public apology to his insulting comments towards all the O-Level Singaporeans - insinuating that they cannot be compared to the talents similar to his breed of University educated genes ?</p>

              <p>While there was CCTV footage of him taking the forms back, can one be <strong>100%</strong> sure he did it to <strong>intentionally</strong>  defraud the elections department? <strong>How can one be 100% sure it is not an honest mistake?</strong></p>
              <p>Besides, the judge of a character cannot be based on 1 doubtful incident. To accuse James gomez, "<strong>diposed to lie, cheat or steal"</strong> is a <strong>character assassination, dirty politics.</strong></p>
              <p>James Gomez is <strong>innocent until proven guilty.</strong> I doubt MM has a case even if the AG brings the case to prosecution, <strong>The inability to prove James Gomez to be</strong> <strong>guilty without doubts proves his innocence.The benefit of the doubt should be given.<br></strong></p>
              <p>With due respect to the contributions of MM to Singapore, if he persist in playing dirty politics, he is harming the country's future by preventing good candidates from coming forward as alternatives.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans should act as referees in future elections. If the opposition plays dirty politics, they should be punished with withdrawal of support. Similary, if MM blatantly plays dirty politics, Singaporeans should safeguard the future of Singapore by doing the right thing.</p>

              <p><br>Of course there is. For example, Hillary Clinton lost big time with her supporters when she tried to play the race card against Barack Obama.</p>
