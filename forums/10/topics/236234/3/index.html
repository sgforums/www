Few or large, I don't really know. But they settling here for good.<br><br>I went to meet-my-MP sessions and were pre-interveiwed by two of these FT (at diff occassions) before seeing my MP.<br><br>Thse FT as they were interviewing me, I can see from the puzzled looks on their faces. Clearly, they are real foreigners with no deep understanding of this country. I had to explain my case carefully and repetitively, again and again, to them.<br><br>Aside, what I don't really like about these FT are:-<br>1) They don't really know about Sg's history, culture, politic and even economic well. They assume too much about us and the worst thing is that some of them pretend they do really know Sg well.<br><br>2) In their minds, they always use Sg as a yardstick with that of their countres. They can't understand why we are complaining so much. They fail to understanding that the problem lies with their thinkings. They don't understand that they are comparing third world economy with a first world economy. The problems and challenges pertaining to third world country and those pertaining to the advanced country are stackly different.</div>

So the first stall is giving you 0.50 subsidy? Crap, pure crap, HDB is talking.<br><br>Now that the election is over, they can take out all the craps and dish them one by one to us.<br><br>Talking about slaughtering the sacred cows. HDB is one cow which the govt  needs to slaughter long time ago. But then, they must have calculated carefully the usefulness of its continuous social engineering role.<br><br>Talking about percentage minority in a HDB flat. So if the majority stays upper storey and if the minority stays lower storey? This is what happening. So where the racial social mixing? What HDB going to do? Make sure that every storey has Chinese, Malay and Indian? So the private estates have even fewer minority, what then? Racial quota private estate as well? There are areas which the govt should not push too hard without backlash. There are areas which the govt should not overdo and this one area.<br><br>It is not merely sg having social mixing or enough social mixing to prevent terrorism, as they have use believing. What if our govt goes round openly support the US invasion of Iraq? Open and not discrete support? Surely this is the one major factor for us to be on the terrorists' radar screen.<br><br>It is long overdued for HDB to be scrapped. The important roles for it to play are historical. It takes a brave govt to admit it.<br></div>
