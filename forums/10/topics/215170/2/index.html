There are just so many ISP in Singapore, if they really want to watch everyone, they would have done it a long time ago. Do you think they would allow you to post this on here if they wanted a total police state?<br><br>Exactly how are we the normal people being locked? No chewing gums? well it wouldn't have to be this way if some of us had not stuck them in between train doors in the first place. Can't be naked at home? Well, actually we can, so long we draw the curtains and make sure nobody else who don't want to see our naked body doesn't see it.<br><br>Singapore may not be as liberal as a number of western states, but it certainly doesn't mean that we don't have any freedom at all. I read a number of posts in these forum spaces that protray Sg as a police state or a matrix like place with only a few "clear minded" people. I'm not sure if this is due to the psychological need of some to feel superior or outstanding from others, but I feel that there is a lack of balance in the criticism to PAP with regards to the restrictions perceived by some.<br><br>Basically if you are a ordinary person, you don't get too much restriction, I mean sure you can't scold against LKY and company in public like the Dixie Chicks to Bush, but its not like you will get arrested if you post a thread here that wish him to die early. Does anyone here actually believe that the PAP does not know of this forum or has not had pple come in here occassionally and read the threads? If the freedom in Sg is really as bad as some protray, pple like Atobe, Shutterbug and furomwee88 would "disappear" a long time ago.<br><br>This post is not against anyone, not the people who argued against PAP(some like Atobe had put brilliant arguments while others just plain anyhow anyhow complain) and certainly not against you Opspec. But I do hope that people don't see PAP as a satanic like figure and credit them with every single possible evil. And if people doesn't argue against the PAP, it's not always because they haven't "wake up" but maybe because some of them saw something that anti-PAP people have not seen.</div>

Currently, Singaporeans use different ISPs, which will have different blocks of IP addresses assigned to them. This means that a user can easily be traced if he/she does something wrong.<br><br>Now, if everybody uses the free Internet, everybody would be using the same block of IP addresses. This would make reading logs near impossible, due to the huge number of people accessing it.<br><br>The spying problem might thus become redundant.<br><br>Edit: However, this doesn't guarantee your privacy. Since it is an opened network, anybody and everybody can just steal your sensitive information.</div>
