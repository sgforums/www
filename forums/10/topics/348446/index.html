              <p>Monday, 16 February 2009</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><em>Singapore Democrats</em><br><br><img src="http://www.yoursdp.org/images/stories/postersI/conflict_of_interest.jpg" border="0" alt="" width="150" align="left">Mr
              Lee Kuan Yew's appointments as an international advisor to corporations
              such as JP Morgan, Total, DaimlerChrysler (now defunct) and Citigroup
              have gone largely unnoticed by most in Singapore, until now that is.
              Especially noteworthy for obvious reasons is Mr Lee's role in
              Citigroup. On <a href="http://www.prdomain.com/companies/C/Citibank/newsreleases/20069635397.htm">5 Sep 06</a>, the American banking giant purred:</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <blockquote>Minister Mentor Lee is
              a modern-day visionary and a unique statesman who is respected
              world-wide, and it is a privilege for Citigroup to benefit from his
              understanding, insights and experience. I am honored that Minister
              Mentor Lee has chosen to be a special advisor to Citigroup and look
              forward to having the opportunity to work closely with him as we pursue
              our international growth strategy.” (emphasis added)<br></blockquote>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><br>Few
              Singaporeans really cared when the announcement was made. How can
              anyone take issue with such an accolade especially one coming from the
              world's biggest bank? In fact, then DPM Lee Hsien Loong lauded his
              father's appointment in Parliament in 2000 when he pointed out that Lee
              Sr's roles in these corporations would help to promote Singapore
              globally. <br><br>Mr Lee holds the position of Minister Mentor now as
              he did in 2006 when he was appointed Citi's advisor. This much is
              clear. What is ambiguous is whether Mr Lee holds the Citi portfolio in
              his official capacity as Minister Mentor representing Singapore or
              whether he does so in his personal capacity as a citizen, albeit a
              prominent one.<br><br>There is no mention of Mr Lee's role in Citi in his profile shown in the Singapore Government's <a href="http://www.cabinet.gov.sg/CabinetAppointments/Mr+LEE+Kuan+Yew.htm">website</a> which leads one to think that these extra-ministerial appointments are a private matter. <br><br>But Citi's 2006 <a href="http://www.prdomain.com/companies/C/Citibank/newsreleases/20069635397.htm">press release</a> (and JP Morgan's <a href="http://www.jpmorganchase.com/ar2004/cd_jcic.html">website</a>)
              trumpets the fact that Mr Lee is the Minister Mentor of the Republic of
              Singapore and makes no qualifications that he is serving in a private
              capacity.<br><br>The ambiguity raises the following questions as naturally and necessarily as the day follows night:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Does
              Mr Lee receive remuneration or compensation monetarily or otherwise
              from these positions that he holds? If so, how much? Does Mr Lee get to
              keep the income?</li>
              <li>In return, what is expected of Mr 	Lee in terms of the time he spends attending to the business of 	these corporations?</li>
              <li>What
              kinds of information is expected from Mr Lee as an advisor and what
              sort is provided? Is the cabinet fully informed of the discussions that
              Mr Lee is involved in with these companies?</li>
              <li>Do our ministers
              also hold such appointments in companies, foreign or domestic? If yes,
              which ones and in what capacities? If no, why not, since MM Lee does? </li>
              </ul>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><br>What
              is more disturbing, if that's actually possible, is that these
              questions have never been asked of the PAP Government in any meaningful
              manner. Ministers, MPs, state journalists, etc have this uncanny
              ability to not notice the hyperactive, rainbow-coloured gorilla jumping
              up and down, screaming and poking them in the eyes right in the middle
              of the living room.<br><br>Maybe the reticence is because it didn't
              cross anyone's mind that there is actually something called conflict of
              interest. Be that as it may, that was then and this is now. The now is
              when we learn that in January 2008 the GIC, chaired by Mr Lee, had
              poured into Citigroup S$10 billion of our funds.<br><br>It transpired
              that GIC made the investment after it received an “invitation” from
              Citi to invest in its equity. GIC dove in because, according to its
              deputy chairman Dr Tony Tan (who, by the way also controls all the
              Singaporean newspapers as chairman of the SPH), it was “well within the
              risk limits which we had prescribed for the finance sector.”<br><br>Not only were the risks reasonable, <a href="http://www.asiaone.com/Business/News/My%2BMoney/Story/A1Story20080131-47536.html">Dr Tan assessed</a>, Citi was a "sound bank..temporarily facing significant problems.  But their franchises are strong".<br><br> Nine months after Dr Tan made the endorsement Citigroup announced that
              it was on the verge of bankruptcy and needed bail-out money from the US
              Government. It received <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/marketsNews/idUSN2636427520081126">US$25 billion</a> – the biggest bailout in history. In November, it came back for more
              and got another US$20 billion. The bank was staring into the abyss with
              a potential loss of US$306 billion in toxic assets.<br><br>If the US
              Government had not stepped in, and there is every possibility that the
              bailout could still fail, Citi would have collapsed and our $10 billion
              would be no more. (If it's any comfort, our money spread much good
              cheer among the many millionaire executives of the bank.)<br><br>How
              can a sound bank with strong franchises collapse in just nine months?
              Did everyone at GIC skip class the day the teacher went through the
              chapter on Citi's troubles? <br><br>More important, did Citi seek its
              special advisor's advice before it approached the GIC for funds? If it
              did, what was the advise given? When the GIC received the invitation
              from Citi, what went into the decision to go ahead with the investment?
              Did Mr Lee's position in one organisation affect the decision made in
              the other?<br><br>The conflict of interest is too jarring to even contemplate. <br><br>Now
              consider this: When former Senator Hillary Clinton's name was put up
              for the post of US Secretary of State, there were concerns that she
              could be influenced by big donors who gave to her husband's
              presidential foundation. As a result former president Bill Clinton
              suspended day-to-day responsibilities at the foundation, revealed the
              identities of all his donors and the amounts they gave, and promised to
              clear future donations with the White House. And he's not even the one
              holding office. <br><br>But, of course, this is Singapore. Conflict of interest is defined a little different here. <br><br>Incredible
              as it may seem the GIC still refuses to explain its decisions or open
              up its books for scrutiny or even tell Singaporeans how much it has
              lost in its investments. Obviously, the Government is a little shy
              about revealing such information. The question is: Should the people be
              shy about demanding it?</p>
