              <p>Very profound thought. A true leader is therefore someone who will stand up to evil supreme and hold him at bay despite all the threats to his own safety.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Having that quality, of defying evil wraps up leadership as quality which embrace ability to lead against all adversities.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Deng Xiao Peng perhaps came close to enshrining such qualities. He was persecuted by anti-liberal dogmatic communist comrades more than once. His own brother also suffered from similar persecution and became crippled.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When Deng came into power he did not take the easy way of grabbing power to himself but he quicky realized the vision of creating a new generation of leadership which will bring about stable succession to establish modernizing and openning up to a market economy.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He sacrificed his own self gains for the good of the nation. Today the ascendency of China was made possible through Deng's paving the way for smooth unselfish succession of leadership. Two or three more generations of leadership changes have continued to throw up new and visionary effective leaders who do not pretend to have great talents nor try to promote themselves all prepared to let go to abler younger new potential leaders to take the nation further.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Just compare LKY with DXP, do we see such greatness in LKY who of course does not have to contend with so much intrigues in a much bigger country within his own dogmatic power-based party as Deng did.</p>

              <p>Besides I asked the people to say who is their favorite <strong>fictional</strong> character.</p>
              <p>There is nothing wrong in what I wrote or asked. I asked because it seems that many real life politician fell short of expectation. I really can't say who is my favorite politican today.</p>
              <p>But you were correct in saying that God helps us all. If there are no more good admirable politicians we are doomed. Anyone still believe in principles and values? That's the core that separates us and the animals though I swear that an NTU lecturer believed that we were indeed mere animals. Would you let an animal and a deceiver to lead and deceive you and have the power over a country resources? And make a wolfpack out of a nation.</p>
              <p> The people in any nation need a man who is able to lead and not seeking power for himself.</p>

              <p><br>True if he forced inept and corrupted leaders top resign, that is leadership. <br><br>But he did not.</p>
              <p>Look at Hu Yao Bang and his efforts to reform china especially on area of freedom. Quoting from wiki, Hu is believe to had been forced to resign back then due to his tolerence and emphathetic attitude toward's china liberal intelligentsia. I think Deng could have blamed number of student demostration then to Hu's liberal attitude.</p>
              <p>Let us look at Zhao Zi Yang one of the forefront runners on reform and a figther for more freedom in china back then. Extremely popular among the people with his economic and political policies. Politically he supported the need to be more transparent, open and free. The death of Hu Yao Bang and the party's inappropriate response to his dealth as seen by the public sparked among other reasons large scale protests which lead to the tiananmen incident. Zhao Zi Yang was sent to mediate with the student but was seen and heard with evidence of his subtle and soft approach towards them. The demostration didnt end and as a premier, he was later forced to resign and place under house arrest. He has to seek party's permission to leave his courtyard or to recieve guest. Many see his sudden downfall as a result of his soft approach to the demostrators, allowance given to expose the incident to foreign and local press and other things which conflicts with the other party member.</p>
              <p>Deng Xiao Ping then was the chairman of the central military commission of the CCP at that point of time not the general secretary of the CCP and neither was he the premier but Zhao Zi yang made a stunting revelation during Gorbachev's visit that Deng, though officially no longer a member of the party central committee, was still having final say in major decision-making.</p>
              <p>So i like you to know that Deng was perhaps responsible for the the downfall of 2 general secretary whom have strong liberal view which in his eyes dangerous because they walk their talk. On top of the dismissal of the 2 leaders, we see the subsequent house arrest of Zhao and the death of thousands in the protest crack down.</p>
              <p>Deng play a extremely important role in the making of modern china as a economic superpower as it is today. His efforts to reform the party and to make china relevant to the world is something which the chinese people must show gratitude to. Like all other great political leader amist all his good work, he also had to resort to dirt and flirt to make progress stick.</p>
