Their per capita GDP on a ppp index is less than one sixth of ours.<br>you have never been to poor country before right?</strong> </blockquote>With your continued 'sweeping contributions' to this forum, can we take your word that you have even visited the Philippines? And as for poor countries, does Nepal and Indonesia count?<br><br>It does not take a genius to note that Philippines economy is merely a fraction of ours, but then again, it's an apple to orange comparison. Governing Philippines' archiepalago of islands is a near impossible task, coupled with the corruption rifle in their cabinet, to say nothing of their attempts to boost their national income.<br><br>Even Gloria Arroyo will scoff at your misguided attempts in comparing a tiny red dot against her goliath of a country.<br><br><blockquote><strong>thats reality sir. go there and see for yourself. you have no idea how tough life is there. </strong></blockquote>Having to endure security checks everytime one transits from village to town, stay indoors during the day, restricted walks around the neighbourhood under guard to prevent kidnapping, i have a pretty good idea to the extent of the word 'tough'. Vigrants line the streets of Manila, and petty theft is rampant. The average youth does not have a proper education, and every corner, drugs and gang-style shootings are a common occurence.<br><br><blockquote><strong>dunno abt suicide rate but they are definitely happier people because they are humble. </strong></blockquote>This statement says it all. You are totally clueless about the suicide rate, yet willing to base your claims on assumptions of 'happiness' you plucked from....where? The sky?<br><br>The people of Philippines are probably far more content if they had an iota of peace, food on the table and a decent job to hold down. And all these come from a competent government.<br><br>How far back was SG when our people hoped and prayed for the same things? In the days before independence, these were precisely the same goals. With the old guard in place, we expanded our reach beyond the need for basic necessities and evolved to the island state we are now.<br><br>We are not very different from them, just 40-50 years ahead. And most of us do not forget our humble beginnings.<br><br><blockquote><strong>yes, abu sayyaf and milf too where people have to fight and die for their freedom while we take it for granted and still complen. </strong></blockquote>The only one who has the impression that Singaporeans take their safety and security for granted is you. ItÂ’s amazing how you continue to dodge bullets and regurgitate the same rhetoric about others Â‘taking things for grantedÂ’ and Â‘complainingÂ’.</div>
