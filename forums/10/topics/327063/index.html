              <p>I watched the Beijing Olympics and had a stirring nationalistic pride when i saw my flag entered the field of athletic prowess ambitions.</p>
              <p>Perhaps it was just me, but my heart sank when i saw a PR holding the highest of all national symbols of our land - our flag.</p>
              <p>But it was only for a fleeting second, for i realized that the fault was not hers, but our ( you and me and fellow singaporeans) fault.</p>
              <p>In our mindless pursuit of academic excellence and the desire of material comfort at the expense of child bearing, we had neglected the sports arena as unimportant.</p>
              <p>And thus lay the foundation of ruin and despire in our sporting hopes, of siring stronger, better, faster athletic prowess for our next generations of citizens.</p>
              <p>Fortunately, the more sane and intelligent members in our community had seen a way out to keep such athletic dreams alive - by buying 'left out' potential sportsperson neglected by their own country, bringing them here and giving them the opportunities they would never have in their own homeland, while we deliberate and try the solve our own predicament of producing athletes of our own from our own loins.</p>
              <p>Upon reflections such as these, the moment of shame passed, and i cheered these PRs whom had benefitted from our generosity, and had vowed allegience to our flag, to fight on our behalf against their own countrymen - to bring sporting glory to our nation and every citizen of this land that they may walk tall with pride, sharing in their achievements made possible by our collective support.</p>
              <p>Let us not deny these PRs their glory like their own countrymen had, but cheer them on for doing each and everyone of us all proud, breaking records and history while at it.</p>
              <p>Stand tall and revile in the olympic glory that we, in our self-centred lives, would never have without these great sportspersons, including those from our own loins. </p>

              <p>Then i guess you and me must work harder with our partners at night to produce the next Spore olympian, sacrificing academic excellence but groom him/her into greater sporting heights, if he/she wants and is so inclined, taking our national pride to higher athletic glory.</p>
              <p>But in the meantime, never to deny the honour due to our current sportspersons who brought us fame and glory, be him/her a citizen, or a PR, whom fights in the olympic stage on our behalf.</p>
