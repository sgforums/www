            <div class='col-md body'>Hmmm....the govt initially try to make use of the Gomez issue to break the WP. Just take a look at today's first page of news paper......, LKY beats the war gong against Gomez, soon, many PAP ppls comment on the following paper are also out to qns the WP candidates. From here, we could see who are the real ppls that are neutral and fair and who are those "PLP KINGS' out to gain favour from the PAP inner Sanctum. I think this will cause a rift instead for the PAP camp, as it is GCT VS the PAP camp. I also believe that WP on the contrary may have a huge chance of winning........<br><br>Take a look at Slyvia Lim, she has the "Da Chang Jin" type of personality and background, she worked her way thru the ranks in the police force and also she have a good education background. The type of heartlander that is close to the ppls and understand their needs. Yes, many PAP ppls are coming out to question her capability and her background. But remember the battle of Britain during WW2? The Luftwafte bombed London in side out, but instead of causing the Brits to surrender in fear, it caused them instead to be veri resilient and determined. Some ppls might come to see the true colours of our minister, desparately trying to Bombard the two. They may get fed up and instead vote for WP.<br><br>Just look at how intensive the "bombing" campaign conducted by PAP on WP just comes to show how paranoid and perhaps reflects the truth that the PAP is facing a fast dropping in support. THink of it....</div>
