              <p>“Should Singaporean Youths be Allowed to Vote at 18?”</p>
              <p>The Workers’ Party Youth Wing is pleased to invite you to participate in the first of our YouthQuake Forums and partake in a discussion on how youths in Singapore can be encouraged to adopt and carry forward a refreshing new agenda on voting age. This forum session seeks to educate, empower, and unite young people to bring youth-centric issues into the forefront of public discourse. It aims to provide an opportunity for youths to share their insights and opinions on promoting a vote@18 agenda in Singapore.</p>
              <p>The first YouthQuake Forum will be held on</p>

              <h3>Choo Zheng Xi</h3>
              <p>Choo Zheng Xi is a second year student at the NUS Law Faculty. He was the youngest speaker to make his case at the Speaker’s Corner, taking to the soapbox in 2000 at the age of 14. His activism has since refined but he is no less passionate about youth involvement in the public sphere. Zheng Xi organized Myanmar Peace Awareness Day on all local campuses on August 2007. This involved public forums, red ribbon and armband distribution, and public petition signing. He is also the owner and Editor of TOC (www.theonlinecitizen.com), a local online news and social commentary website with an established readership. He is currently involved in a blogger’s project to craft a position paper on deregulation to be submitted to the government. He looks forward to a day when youth involvement in public discourse will be the norm rather than the exception.</p>

              <p>Khairulanwar Zaini is willingly defending the nation although he would be glad to be deprived of the honour for the next remaining ten months. He remains a silent sideline observer of the socio-political landscape in Singapore, sporadically becoming outraged at certain political developments and even more sporadically writes about opposition development at (http://burningrepublicstate.wordpress.com). A liberal at heart, he awaits the day a Singaporean politician will campaign on themes of hope and love.</p>

              <div>It does occur in the army but more so in the police.</div>
              <div>True, voting will politicise the population but more importantly, it also empowers the people an opportunity to vote for the country's future.</div>
              <div>How democratic or undemocratic about this country is IMO an another issue. I think the issue here is the percieved maturity of the population that made the voting age in Singapore above 21 and i find this ridiculous.</div>
              <div>Poh said something about some youth knowing nothing about politics and are easily hookwinked, but i like to ask, how many adults in singapore knows politics and are fully informed to be hookwinked-proof?</div>
              <div>Takan by PAP? Hmm, i dont really know but im pretty sure a few of my former colleagues whom were critical of the govt hold good positions...</div>

              <p>" im pretty sure a few of my former colleagues whom were critical of the govt hold good positions..."</p>
              <p>Imperative word is "were". And were they critical enough to join protests etc? If their livelihood is dependent on the PAP regime, they will be marginalized by the PAP government as well.</p>
              <p>The reason why Singaporeans should not be able to vote at 18 is because firstly unlike Western countries, they are not taught at school in detail about politics for eg parliamentary system etc as part of the compulsory curriculum. Secondly LIKE Western countries, at 18 regardless of the draft or not, the majority of the teenagers are too immature or too young to remember what life was like for working adults say 5 years old. </p>
              <p>Unless you are really smart and have too much free time, I doubt that at 18 most people would also lack the basic knowledge of political science and philosophy...</p>
