            <div class='col-md body'>Singapore and malaysia should consider forming an Economic Union. Not a political merger, as that was found unworkable in 1965.<br><br>An Economic Union along the lines of the EEC: preferential treatment for each other's citizens....... free borders.........etc<br><br>Get our economies and people so inter-twined with each other so that we need each other.....eg. Johor rely on Spore totally for power supply......and other way round for water.........our people married to each other........etc<br><br>with blood and economic ties.......we become like one....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>you got quite a good point actually idwar, with the rise of china i think it's time that singapore and m'sia start looking at economic co-operation instead of competing with each other, while will end up hurting no one but both sides, infact, perhaps that could be expanded into a wider economic alliance that includes greater asean perhaps, or at the very least a tripartite pact that includes indonesia, with indonesia as a natural resources storehouse, malaysia as a manufacturing hub, and singapore concentrating on being a finance, trans-shipping, services and high-end manufacturing, we can much better withstand the chinese onslaught.<br><br>but of course, that will probably remain idle talk forever, the political differences are simply too great, the political cultures between singapore and malaysia are very different from each other. Remember the hornets' nest a few years ago when LKY talked about the re-integration of singapore into malaysia ?... Bumiputra issues and racial politics is still very much alive in malaysia. even close co-operation in the economic sphere alone will raise thorny issues. We're still fighting too much for the same slices of pie to ever do otherwise for the forseeable future ....<br><br>sadly, meanwhile ... the china juggernaut looms ever larger ....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Economic union with Malaysia? Common passport &amp; currency? I think it should apply to the whole Asean grouping, like the EU. Singapore-Malaysia seems a bit unlikely, but Malaysia and Thailand could start close cooperation for appetisers.</div>
