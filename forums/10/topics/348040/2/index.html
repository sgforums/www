              <p>Consider some Foreign workers, bangadeshi or indians or even PRC with no education, they spit and talk loudly, sit on grass patches,  littered here and there, talk rudely and most of us will said that they are lack of education. I agreed, but that doesn't meant they are stupid or lazy, it is just they do not hv the chance to be educated.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Therefore, the primary focus of education is to bring about a well behaved, good moral and disciplined person who can align one right thinking and share with others. As for knowledge, whether you applied in your daily working life or not, is another issue of education.</p>

              <p><br>There is a weakness in education system..The current education does not really gives people "space" to find out ,"to think" and to pursue one's interest. Singaporean are expected to follow a standard guideline and somehow misleading into believing to achieve "this particular theology set up the government". We all born free, with different personality inclination. The environment that i find in singapore is rather restrictive, it does not encourage people to discover who they are and either do most of us find people being encouraging when we try to be different; to help nuture the talent within all of us and make it all possible.</p>
              <p>In a way, education brainwashs people. The government use this media intending to imput certain views into unsuspected people. I don't think it is all bad. If you teach good things, there could be great but our government isn't really doing so.</p>
              <p>And yes, i do agreed that world-class education should teach educated people about having social responsibility and basic values. I could advocate people to think for themselves about what is good and what is bad.. and to do it. </p>
