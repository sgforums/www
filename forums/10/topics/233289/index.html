            <div class='col-md body'>Actually if you look at the concept of ministerial responsibility, although it is a non-codified political custom and practice, a minister who is responsible for losses or having caused harm to the people directly or by the deeds of his subordinates must resign.<br><br>So in speaking out in support of TT DURAI, even in their "personal capacities", to which if you are a political or public figure this status is non-existent. Those who have supported TT DURAI must resign.<br><br>Simply because without investigating they are putting their credibility on the line and if they vouch for such a person that means they support the person and believe that he is right.<br><br>Hence with their support, they are trying to tell the people that there is no wrong being done and to this end they are asking us to trust these people because the are lending their weight to this person's reputation as well.<br><br>But the truth is now known, but you hardly hear a peep out of these people. Now they are clamouring over each other to distance themselves from DURAI.<br><br>You will see this happen throughout Asian democracies, especially in S. Korea and Japan also seen in the UK several times as well, where a man's word means everything, there can be no U-turns, "...on hindsight...", etc in the political arena.<br><br>The PAPAYAS have gotten away with all these for far too long, time for a change, time to take back our rights.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>One of TT Durai's clone has popped up.  ST reported that 'in 2005 the founder of Youth Challenge, Vincent Lam, paid himself  $248,867 which amounted to 56 per cent of the charity's income of $442,287 for the period.' That means he was drawing a salary of $20,739 a month.  In addition, 'his allowances and benefits included personal travel, birthday gift, housing loan, club membership, insurance, among other things.'  Vincent Lam, by the way, is an ex-policeman and has being running Youth Challenge since 1985.<br><br>Let's hope and pray that all of TT Durai's clones will be exposed and made to pay for their greed before they run for cover or disappear!!!  The same goes for their kakis.<br><br>On the first month that he left the Police Force as a Corporal to join Youth Challenge full time, he bought himself a brand new BMW.<br><br>I am surprised he never ever came into scrutiny. Seems similar to Durai's case when senior SIA management staff travelling first class had seen Durai in their cabin and cabin crew who served had seen him as he travelled frequently. Yet they never said anything despite the defamation suits brought out by NKF and Durai on 1st class travel. Bad enough for their boss Ho Ching who runs Temasek who owns majority stake of SIA not to know and write a beautiful letter of support for Durai in the ST Forum.<br><br>I know that nearly 12 years ago, School principals barred Vincent Lam and Youth Challenge from speaking to their students on school premises after some of them realised that things were not adding up.<br><br>We never learn do we.<br><br>&lt;&gt;<br><br>There is another conman ex jap interpreter still in office.<br><br>Options  Reply<br><br>From:  kingfook   21:37<br>To:  honour6   4 of 4<br><br>130480.4 in reply to 130480.3<br><br>There is another conman ex jap interpreter still in office.<br><br>People who help invaders or occupiers of one's country are at best collaborators..........   at worst, traitors.      A fact.<br><br>[However, in sinkapore.........**sigh**]<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You are right this is worse than corruption and there are no clear set of rules.<br><br>Despite his high profile, Vincent Lam was refused promotion while in the Police Force. At that time, getting a sergeant after a few years was pretty much standards. His superiors knew him well.<br><br>In fact he was smarter than Durai, he milked 56% while Durai was much lesser percentage wise.<br><br>I am have been given to understand that except for tax evasion, there is nothing that can be done to him. He is obviously going to claim ignorance based on complexity of taxes.<br><br>What many are not aware is that besides cash donations that went thru the books, there were many instances of donations that came from the vounteers directly. It was very much standard practice that volunteers pay for all things including nice t-shirts, transport and food. He also understood that the high churning of impressionable teenagers and young adults who were his vounteers would leave disillusioned and leave and others coming of age will be in the pipeline.<br><br>At the end of the day, he was the only one who has been with the organisation from start to finish.<br><br>It must be dark in hell when the Chairman or a morbid sense of humor, was happy to note that no finding of misappropriation or criminal breach of trust had occurred.<br><br>Mind you this is a legally individually and a member of the Supreme Court who should have expressed remorse that 56% disappeared that was meant for charity.<br><br>As to the government, this jumped when NCSS lodged a formal complaint. Tells you that they are still sitting on their butt. Don't they monitor or do they need vounteers to do their work.<br><br></div>
