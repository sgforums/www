            <div class='col-md body'>our materialistic lifestyle could be the main reason for the rise in our temper.<br><br>Tempers up in law-and-order city<br>Stable Singapore witnesses a spate of public violence that could belie a sense of restlessness.<br>By Seah Chiang Nee, littlespeck.com<br>Jun 9, 2007<br><br>KNOWN for its strict law and order, Singapore has surprising witnessed a spate of unprovoked Â“rageÂ” violence that could belie a sense of restlessness among its youth.<br><br>It is generally low-level, nothing compared to the violence of Western Â“gunÂ” cities, but highly unusual for a stable city where the cane is liberally used.<br><br>It is too early to describe it as a trend or that it will make Singapore violent-prone.<br><br>But this underlying streak of violence and ill behaviour among better-educated Singaporeans who had grown up in an affluent environment is surprising.<br><br>People seem to flare up over such things as road overtaking, car parking, over a Â“lazyÂ” maid or for merely brushing against another person.<br><br>Some of these assaults were unprovoked and directed at senior citizens, a blow to Minister Mentor Lee Kuan YewÂ’s Asian values of respect for the elderly.<br><br>It prompted this youthful comment recently. Â“IÂ’m a teenager and I can say that tempers and attitudes among youngsters are getting worse. This is due to the increasing stress and ever-rising expectations from the public and our elders.Â”<br><br>Older adults are, of course, just as quick-tempered.<br><br>Over two days last week, the newspapers carried the following items:<br><br>* DURING a recent quarrel captured on video and watched by many, a young man attacked an older man, stomping on him as he lay on the ground;<br><br>* SINGAPOREÂ’S largest bus operator says thereÂ’s been an increase in violent incidents on its buses Â– 37 cases over five months, 15 involving passengers assaulting its staff;<br><br>* TWO men came to blows over a business-and-money row, resulting in one of them needing treatment in hospital;<br><br>* A DOCTOR was assaulted in his clinic when he asked a patient who had asked for Erimin 5 tablets (a controlled substance) about his drug history;<br><br>* A HUMAN Resource assistant was charged with burning her maidÂ’s arm with a hot iron and hitting her with a wooden pole;<br><br>* A YOUNG man wrote in a chat-site that he Â“felt good after a fightÂ” during one Â“hot evening without the slightest breezeÂ”. His victim had reacted angrily when told to stub out his cigarette in a no-smoking zone; and<br><br>* A STUDENT from a top junior college had assaulted an elderly bus driver when he detained his girlfriend for using an invalid bus card. His father later knelt in front of the victim, begging him to forgive his son.<br><br>Why are tempers getting shorter?<br><br>The answers are mixed. Some attribute it to the Â“arroganceÂ” of Singaporeans who are over-protective of their crowded turf. Others blame it on poor parenting or pressures of life.<br><br>Singaporeans live in a Â“pressure cookerÂ” from competitive school to office or business in a society that rates economic growth and accumulation of wealth over social etiquette.<br><br>Lee has succeeded in creating a minor economic miracle, but fared less well when it comes to developing social graces.<br><br>He admits that the First World ultramodern city-state he built still lacks the Â“graces of a civilised societyÂ”.<br><br>Some believe that the rudeness and violence could reflect a widening class division between rich and poor, where some elites look upon the latter as failures.<br><br>While the offenders hail from a wide sphere, the majority are middle- or lower-income people.<br><br>The wealth gap has spawned a small breed of people who feel left out of the prosperity. They have developed a sense of envy and resentment against what they consider as the Â“greedy elitist classÂ”.<br><br>It has been a problem over the years, and has worsened recently as the economic gap widened.<br><br>I have heard of new expensive cars parked in Housing Board spaces near lower-income blocks being scratched, a possible manifestation of class resentment.<br><br>A different view is that the violence has nothing to do with politics but bad genes.<br><br>In a recent case, four young teens who took a cab bolted in different directions without paying. Two were caught. In another, a passenger not only refused to pay his fare, but also bashed up the driver.<br><br>Contrary to the image, the police are not always the tough nut they are portrayed to be, at least in cases of public assault in which no weapon is used or where no one is grievously hurt.<br><br>This surfaced recently when irate Singaporeans who were beaten up were told by the police to file a civil complaint.<br><br>In one incident, motorcycle thugs set upon and beat up a young doctor while he was eating at a coffee shop.<br><br>At the hospital he was given a medical-report form and a referral letter to lodge a complaint with a magistrate. This is considered by some as a shortfall that could encourage public violence.<br><br>Overall, the level of violence is still comparatively low. The government has tried to instill good behaviour by courtesy campaigns and a ban on violent films that could affect youths.<br><br>But what it cannot change is the basic fabric, described this way: Â“People are always in a rush, with deadlines to meet, bosses to please and long hours to slog though.Â”<br><br>Obviously for some, it just boils over to the detriment of others.</div>

The burgeoning rodent populations of psychologist John B. Calhoun at the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), however, disappear on their own. As crowding intensifies in their experimental colonies, the animals reach a point of no return and self-destruct; behaviors necessary for survival, such as mating and parental care of infants, disappear.<br><br>What is more, Calhoun calculates that the human population is entering a 200-year period of rapid growth that, based on his animal model, may reach a similar point of no recovery in around 80 years. Since crowding effects strike at the most complex behaviors of a species, he says, escalating human population density is likely to progressively impair each person's ability to create and use ideas necessary for adaptive changes, rather than reproductive ability.<br><br>But in Calhoun's scenario, humanity is not expanding toward an inevitable oblivion. He sees a way for people, in contrast to experimental rodents, to reverse rapid population growth and bypass the point of no return. The "pied piper' in this instance is an increasingly sophisticated use of computer systems that will extend the human capacity to solve problems and adapt to the environment.<br><br>If such an "evolutionary' extension occurs, Calhoun predicts it will lead to intentional efforts to put a brake on fertility and set the stage for a rapid population drop beginning in the 21st century. He contends that unless this conceptual adaptation occurs, attempts to institute widespread contraceptive use will fail and the population will continue to increase.<br><br>"I try not to be a "doomsdayer,'' says Calhoun, "but if there's high probability of our entering a point of no return, then [my animal model] is worth considering.'<br><br>Calhoun attracted considerable attention with his early crowding and cooperation experiments on rats and even inspired an animated movie about humanlike rats (SN: 8/7/82, p. 92). His willingness to assign human significance to animal data has been scoffed at by some scientists, but he remains undaunted. Calhoun described his latest and most elaborate crowding study --this one with mice--at a recent lecture in Washington, D.C., and used it to buttress his human population predictions.<br><br>The project took place in "universe 133,' an 18-foot-wide, four-level mouse house at NIMH in Bethesda, Md. The structure contains eight cells of equal size, food and water dispensers, nest boxes and platforms on which mice can climb. Each cell has 120 numbered locations to aid in recording behavior. The entire unit was designed to house an optimum of up to 16 groups of about 12 adults, or around 192 mice.<br><br>Beginning with eight pairs of mice, the researchers allowed the population of universe 133 to expand. As it progressed through stages 1, 2, 4 and 8 times the optimum density, successive generations of mice became less and less able to reproduce or interact with others in normal ways. In late stages of crowding, around 200 weeks after the study began, mating ceased altogether. At that point, the population fell precipitously from what had been a peak of nearly 1,600 mice.<br><br>Childhood and juvenile behavior, says Calhoun, extended increasingly into adulthood (which begins at about 172 days of age for mice) as new generations crowded into the living space. Adult females often persisted in the juvenile behaviors of wandering from cell to cell and following strange objects, such as the feet of an investigator when he entered the structure. Males often continued in an even earlier type of behavior, huddling together in small groups on cell barriers. Some became extremely aggressive, clamping onto other mice with their teeth and swinging them from platforms; an attacked mouse rarely fled, and if it did, the attacker rarely pursued.<br><br>In a previous experiment with rats, Calhoun had found that a group trained in two cooperative behaviors--gaining access to water only when two rats were present at a fountain and gaining access to food only when two members of an experimentally designated "clan' were present--was better able to adapt to increasing population density than a control group. The training, he says, allowed the rats to develop new social roles and maintain an optimum number of social contacts for each individual, even as crowding became worse.<br><br>But left to their own devices, the mice in universe 133 reached a point where all animals failed to develop relationships and reproduce. Crowding was reduced, of course, but the colony rapidly became extinct as older mice died. Calhoun estimates this point of no return to have fallen somewhere between 2.5 and 4.0 generations after the mice reached two times optimum density.<br><br>How does this apply to humans? The modern human population, which started out about 43,000 years ago, has grown rapidly only in the last two centuries, says Calhoun. According to a computer simulation he and a colleague developed, a 200-year-long world population transition period began around 1975, when density reached approximately two times optimum. Assuming a 27-year generational span for humans, the point of no return (2.5 to 4.0 generations after 1975) would fall between 2042 and 2083.<br><br></blockquote></span><br><br></div>
