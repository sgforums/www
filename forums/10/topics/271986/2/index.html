But now we have access to various sources of info.<br><br>The plurality will help us realise that there are actually many sides to a story and many angles of looking at things. The info-seekers will eventually learn how to seive through all these viewpoints and/or to probe further to draw his/her conclusions. Such interaction would definitely pique one's interest in current issues and hopefully help one becomes more informed, open and tolerant.<br><br>Btw, while i think we all should sing the anthem i don't believe in forcing anyone to sing it by caning.</div>

It is not a joke.</span><br><br>Do you love your country? never mind the government. What did you learn from NE? What is Singapore to you?<br><br>Your friend must have misbehaved and kenna canned, or is it you who kenna canned but feel ashamed to tell the truth so give a half truth, hoping for some support here?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"> </div></blockquote>All the teacher inspect the students la.<br>Ya the school warn first time before.<br><br>So are you trying to say, as a singaporean.<br>You <strong>MUST</strong> love your country?<br><br>No i not the one that kana cane.<br><br>The portion in red = real BS.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Singing national anthem should be enforced. In some countries like North Korea or even Korea Republic (South Korea), you will be punished like a soldier for not singing. (run one round, do push ups, do extras)</div>

You break the rule, you face the music. That is what you deserved.<br><br>You don't like Singapore, but you break the law, you get canned also, whether under PAP government or WP government. When in america, you may not like bush but if you break the law, you get punishment. When "God saves America" is played, everybody stand attention, whether you are republican, democrat, or tourists from any country, try doing something else and you will know.<br><br>If you think the portion in red is BS, go to american club or tanglin club, try talking on your hp in the restaurants, you will be booted out. Respecting country or establishment is a virtue, a manner, you don't ask why you need to respect.
