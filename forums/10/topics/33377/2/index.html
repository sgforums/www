            <div class='col-md body'>Dun have to sink a ship, juz pay some container ship captain to ram their several boats a few times, and then suggest that we run "joint patrols", this time in Malaysian waters... And dun care what they say, we send one armada to parade around the JB side of the straits of Singapore. That ought to do the trick. Understandably, their reaction would be unconstructive, as it has almost always been.<br><br>Whenever Malaysia uses the word "compromise" it ofetn means nothing less then total and unconditional surrender and complaince to their demands, no wonder nobody takes them seriously...</div>

UN peacekeepers were stationed there after anti-independence militia launched a bloody rampage through the former Indonesian province in 1999.<br><br>Timor gained independence last May, and is now rebuilding itself.<br><br>Singapore has deployed about 250 troopers there, including 160 ground troops and a detachment of four UH-1H helicopters with 72 crew including pilots, aircrew and technicians.<br><br>The minister said he was 'heartened' to find out that morale among the Singaporeans there was high, and that they have been warmly received by the peacekeepers from other countries as well as the Timorese.<br><br>In Dili, Dr Tan also met Timor Leste Prime Minister Mari Alkatiri, Secretary of State for Defence Roque Rodrigues and the UN Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr Kamalesh Sharma.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>KL says navy patrols off Pedra Branca will go on<br>MALACCA -- Malaysia on Thursday said it would keep its naval ships on patrol missions in waters around the rocky islet of Pedra Branca.<br><br>Defence Minister Najib Razak said of the island, which Malaysia calls Pulau Batu Putih: 'We have a right to continue the patrols and these patrols conducted by Malaysia are not something new but have been going on since 1964.'<br><br>He was reacting to accusations by Singaporean Defence Minister Tony Tan that Malaysian vessels had recently intruded repeatedly into the waters around the island, which Singapore claims as its territory.<br><br>The island, which sits on the eastern entrance to the Straits of Singapore, is largely uninhabited. Singapore has exercised sovereign rights on the islet since the 1840s, when the British colonial government occupied it and constructed the Horsburgh Lighthouse there.<br><br>Malaysia, buoyed by its 2002 win in the International Court of Justice (ICJ) that awarded it two other islands also claimed by Indonesia, asserted its claim to Pedra Branca in the late 70s and again following its ICJ victory.<br><br>Mr Najib, speaking to the official Bernama news agency, said Malaysia had no intention of causing tension through the patrols.<br><br>'The patrols that we have conducted and will conduct are non-aggressive in that, for example, we don't show our cannons, missiles or radar,' he said.<br><br>Dr Tan told the Singapore Parliament on Monday: 'There were three violations by Malaysian state vessels over the last week of December. There were five more violations last week.<br><br>'In these incidents, the Malaysian vessels came close to Pedra Branca and conducted various activities,' he said, pledging that Singapore's navy would defend the country's sovereignty.<br><br>During a visit to Singapore troops stationed Timor Leste for a United Nations peacekeeping mission on Wednesday, he repeated his warning to Kuala Lumpur about staying away from the island.<br><br>The two countries have agreed to sign a pact to refer the dispute over the rocky outcrop on their maritime border to the ICJ on Feb 6. -- AFP<br><br>looks like its time to grant the RMN a free tour to the bottom of the sea...</div>
