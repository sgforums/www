            <div class='col-md body'>DPM Tony Tan expressed his displeasure in parliment to indicate discontent with Malaysia's blatant intrusions into our waters.<br><br>In case u haven't realised, a radar lock on a foreign vessel in disputed waters is considered an act of war.<br><br>Neither side truly wants war. Malaysia knows this. They are simply goading us by making these harassments at sensitive times.<br><br>It's like slapping an injured bull on the face to see if it gores you.<br><br>Restraint is the best answer as Malaysian authorities have not actually set foot on preda branca itself.<br><br>Sending a number of vessels to the island will be viewed as a "threat" by the bullish Malaysian govt. That in turn will have them sending their own navy to confront us. That will simply lead to a boorish standoff, wasting time and resources that WE cannot spare. (unless u're refering to war)<br><br>These Malaysian actions are typical of their political games to gain popularity and "gardner votes" from their ppl. It's a routine.<br><br>We're already used to it.<br><br>At the end of the day, the ICJ will still name the island as Preda Branca, sealing an end to their tiresome charade.<br><br></div>

Though the current issues of how Malaysia has been 'taking advantage' and threatens has almost become deaf-threatening, I personally feel that we really don't know where my finger should point to and which topic to start....?<br><br>Sometime ago when the ISSUE of terrorist was still FRESH on our mind, many things happened... ACTIONs demanded as precaution against the terrorist... Singapore being a non-Muslim country amist Malaysia and Indonesia has been thought of as a possible target.... THEN AGAIN, UN and US have been pretty concerned in regard to possible hidings of terrorist leaders in South-East Asia.... Malaysia (thankfully to Singapore?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> ) was under bombardment too... I could have imagined the kind of frustrations faced by the Malaysia government back then.... Doing so much only to be facing criticism and more 'red alerts' by the words of our government.... I don't really know what was the intention of our government back then... (whether it's solely for security or more...?) But one thing certainly leads to another...? Now that the storm has somehow simmer down a little, its not hard for me to imagine that angers all bottled up under Malaysia government.... Talk about bilateral relationship...? Certainly it all seems not like wise moves...?<br><br>And SURELY there are things we can dig out from the PAST HISTORY between Malaysian &amp; Singapore.... Which reminds me of my OWN HISTORY....? When I was around 11 my aunt told me not to dig out things of the past... Especially the revengeful ones.... They'll just put you in an endless spinning cycle.... If I had not took her advice seriously I most probably couldn't have been who I am TODAY.... (not to mention if there would even be a 'me' today...?)<br><br>What are we doing SO MUCH for...? Ourselves...? Our future generation...? If you cut one of your hands &amp; one of your legs today what kind of future do you think you would have in store for you.....? TODAY.... Or TOMORROW......?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yeah i agree... give them an inch, they'll take a mile. We can't let them think we're weak... but blowing holes in their crappy mat ships would constitute a declaration of war, which in the end, is expensive and is a waste of lives. We should just hire some Osama wannabe and get him to knock down their petronas twin lan jiao towers. That'll show them.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by eurofighter:</div><div class="quote_body">I read in a newspaper before that a few singaporeans got ISA for  conducting espionage for a regional country. Also read from somwhere(probably Defending The Lion City:The Armed Forces Of Singapore) that Malaysia caught some of our spies.<br>BTW, anyone knows about the incident where a female soviet spy seduce a Singaporean worker working in the Singapore embassy in Russia to get some secret codes? The Straits Times says that this incident is mentioned in the booklet about ISA given to students.</div></blockquote>Yeah i read that incident before. May i know which newspaper did you read the incident from? When was it? Thanks. Four Singaporean were caught by the Malaysia ISA for espionage. Too bad those four Singaporean were later <strong>HANG</strong> by the Malaysian government. Then Singapore and Malaysia relationship become sour.<br><br>It is much safer to conduct espionage in USA rather than in Malaysia. Becuase in America you don't get hang for conducting espionage.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>think the malaysians wanna make sure everyone knows the price for undermining its security...<br><br>Another reason is probably to limit or impede or raise the cost of intelligience operations by singapore in malaysia though harsh punishments.<br><br>as to hanging of the 4 singapore operatives... its unfortunate.. but that is the risk of their jobs....hopefully they managed to garther sufficient information from the mission to provide singapore...</div>
