              <p><strong><span class="article_heading1">Mr. Limonov on Mr. Medvedev</span></strong></p>
              <p><em>We have now two presidents in Russia: old one is Mister
              Putin and a new one, appointed on March 2, Mister Medvedev. That idiocy
              will be formally ended on May 7, when Mr. Medvedev will be inaugurated
              in Kremlin’s seat. But nevertheless, for more than two months, Russia
              was headed by two presidents.</em></p>
              <p><em>As to Putin’s in his first years of presidency to Mr. Medvedev also
              could be addressed banal questions: "Who is Mister Medvedev?" </em></p>
              <p><em>Because
              Mr. Medvedev is not a political figure, he is a practically unknown
              bureaucrat, one of a huge crowd of bureaucrats surrounding Putin.</em></p>
              <p><em> As
              Putin himself is a small bureaucrat, one from a huge crowd of
              "chinovniks" surrounding Yeltsin. If the elected president had been
              named Zyuganov or Yavlinski or Kasparov or even Limonov, nobody in
              Russia would have asked a question: "Who is that man?" Because these
              are political leaders, actors in Russian political play. </em></p>
              <p><em>They are known
              to general population. Mr. Medvedev, on the contrary, is not known, or
              wasn’t known, at all. Mr. Medvedev is not a leader of political party,
              he is not a member of political party, so he is not a political man. We
              can guess that he is a member of Putin’s circle of close friends, a
              member of some inner circle. If he is to be appointed to the post of
              guarding of their interests, we are guessing that Mr. Medvedev is
              trusted by Mr. Putin’s group and Mr. Putin himself.</em></p>
              <p><em>So the answer to the question of "Who is Mister Medvedev?" is shamelessly simple. He is a...</em></p>

              <p>Without a doubt, Medvedev will be under Putin's influence when it comes to policy making.  Russia still has Putin in charge... so to speak.</p>

              <p>I agree that Russia remains a big power but its power has deteriorated a lot compared to the  USSR days. Since the breakup of USSR, Russia has seen many breakaway republics and Slavic countries defecting to the US camp. Georgia, Ukraine, Poland, Bulgaria, Romania, and Czech. And they are back to check and weaken Russia, their own Slavic cousin. It hit the bottom during Yeltsin.</p>
              <p>After the USSR collapse, I thought the world would enter a permanent peace and democracy. I thought that the US represented democracy and freedom. I disregarded some futurists' warning that the US hegomony would be even worse than Cold War.</p>
              <p>Now I come to a realization that we need regional powers to keep the US in check.</p>

              <p>The problem with Russia is that many Russians are not interested in politics.</p>

              <p>If you guys have time....try to look at YouTube for a few Russian news video clips.</p>
              <p>For instance, RussiaToday (RT). It is an English language Russian channel covering the news from Russian perspective.</p>
              <p>If u have time, also watch several interviews of Vladimir Putin.</p>
              <p>Also take a look at the comments from ordinary Russian people, the YouTube comments posted there by Russians.</p>
              <p>In my opinion, he is a smart and well-balanced man. He is also genuinely popular among many ordinary Russians. Not all of them 'brainwashed' like what western media says, because quite alot of them are expatriate Russians who live abroad and access all sources of news.</p>
              <p>About this transition......this maybe a Russian style smooth and peaceful transitioning of power. Remember not all countries and societies in the world is the same. As noted, in Singapore, a rather similar method is used. And in other countries, they have kings and all sorts of different systems in the world today.</p>
              <p>So who are we to critisize this Russian method?</p>
              <p>The Russians themselves didn't object to it. Why must outsiders impose their views?</p>
              <p>Of course, for western media, they like to paint a negative picture. They assume they are the most 'civilized' and they believe that whatever they are familiar with, automatically all other nations must also practice it, otherwise it is wrong.</p>
              <p>If you read afew Russian media or watch those YouTube Russian clips, there are different perspectives about this transition. One is, Putin maybe is genuinely stepping down, and helping to phase out and gear a smooth transition to a new president. They did make a few points, that if Putin really wanted, he could have drawn a new consitution, or even override the constitution, but he didn't. He chose to obey it and step down in time.</p>
              <p>Then another thing, western media says Medvedev is a 'puppet', or inner-circle, unknown guy etc. No offence but first time I saw Medvedev I got a good impression just from his looks.</p>
              <p>This is a young, handsome, dynamic, and energetic person. He is also someone who will most likely bring continuity with recent years of Russian stability, and Putin policies, instead of abrupt changes from a radical president.</p>
              <p>If u look also at what Medvedev has been saying in interviews, he talks about rule-of-law, democracy, human rights. This is not just recently when his name is a candidate, but even from old interviews from past periods. This gives u a glimpse into his mind and what his instincts are. His background also, is not KGB or security agencies, but a civilian.</p>
              <p>So when Putin stepped down in time, obey constitution, didnt get tempted despite his obvious ability, and when he chose someone not from a security minded person, young, dynamic, has some reform mindset, and is doing it in a smooth transfer, ensuring stability and continuity for Russia's future, then...how can u blame him...? </p>
              <p>For the west, this event is being spun as something 'negative' , but negative for whom? Is it negative for Russia?</p>
