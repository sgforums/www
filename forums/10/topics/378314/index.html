              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Singapore's sand shortage - The hourglass effect<br> </strong></span></span> <br> <strong>“LOOKING for sea-sand for reclamation project in Singapore. Prompt reply is greatly appreciated.</strong>” <br> <br> Many such pleas can be found on Alibaba.com, a popular Chinese trading-website. <span style="color: red;"><strong>Malaysia
              banned sand exports as long ago as 1997. Indonesia followed suit in
              2007 on environmental and, some say, political grounds.</strong></span> Ever since, it has become harder for Singapore to secure supplies for its booming construction industry and sea-fill plans.<br> <br> The ban by Indonesia, its biggest supplier, led to a surge in the price
              of sand, used in both concrete and land-reclamation. The government
              averted a short-term crisis by releasing sand from its stockpile and
              helping contractors find new sources. <span style="color: red;"><strong>However, Indonesia’s embargo, followed swiftly by a Chinese ban on sales of sand to Taiwan, set in train a domino effect.</strong></span><br> <br> Environmentalists argue that large-scale sand-dredging can deplete fish
              stocks and cause erosion, risking landslides and flooding. So
              Singaporean contractors turned to Cambodia, where prices are low and
              environmental standards almost non-existent. <span style="color: red;"><strong>But this May Hun Sen, Cambodia’s prime minister, outlawed exports of sand. </strong></span>Again, environmental pressures were cited, but there may also have been a political motive. <br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>After the Cambodian ban Vietnam’s sand exports
              surged, achieving volumes seven times as big as last year, with
              Singapore the main customer. Then last month Vietnam’s construction
              ministry called for a temporary halt to the trade, to assess its impact
              on the environment and the local building industry. NGOs in Thailand
              and Bangladesh have also pressed their governments to reject recent
              requests to allow sales of sand to Singapore.</strong></span><br> <br> Sand prices, which peaked at over S$60 ($43) a tonne in 2007, have
              fallen during the slowdown. Simon Lee, of the Singapore Contractors’
              Association, believes a new regulation requiring sand importers to have
              alternative back-up supplies will help insulate his members from
              further turbulence. A spokesman for Singapore’s national-development
              ministry adds that construction companies have been importing sand from
              “various” regional countries and claims that “recent restrictions on
              sand exports have not affected the supply of construction sand to
              Singapore.” But global demand for dwindling supplies of sand and other
              materials is mounting. <span style="color: red;"><strong>Critics
              say that Singapore needs to shift faster from building cheap but
              resource-intensive concrete structures towards more expensive
              construction techniques that use, say, more steel and glass.</strong></span><br> <br> <strong><span style="color: red;">Relying as it does on low-wage, low-skilled
              migrant workers from South Asia, Singapore’s construction industry is
              not yet ready for such a high-tech transformation.</span> </strong>And in
              the short term there are still plenty of willing suppliers. Tim Sintop,
              an American whose trading company wants to export sand from Myanmar and
              has already secured several contracts in Singapore, is upbeat: “The
              more bans there are elsewhere, the better for us.”<br> <br> ====================<br> <br> <span style="font-size: small;"><strong><a href="http://singaporenewsalternative.blogspot.com/">Click here</a> to check out the latest news update at Singapore News Alternative</strong></span><br> <br> .</p>
