Anyhow, there is no clear relevance of the Khoa case to the Ngyuen Case. My best bet is that the Judge wanted the Aussies and the media to be able to treat Ngyuen's case impartially, as well as sympathise for his grieving family, whatever wrongs they might have committed in the past.<br><br>5) Note, she suspended the sentence FOR THREE YEARS; Khoa is still going to jail in the end, and I suspect he might go earlier than 3 years later to sap his remorsefulness over his brother's death.<br><br>6) *Ahem* The Judiciary is DIFFERENT from the government. The government you're talking abt - Howard, Downer, Robinson, AQC and all - is the Executive. Unlike down here, where PAP has influence over everything, the Aussies keep the division of power as distinct as possible. So you don't blame the Judge's sentence on Howard or Downer or Robinson; you could blame the Australian Legal system, or better still blame the official herself.<br><br>7) That seems to apply to Singapore too, except that we have no scales and too long a sword. The Judge's decision actually showed her use of the scales, and she did give Khoa 3 years in jail, her sword if you might. On the other hand, S'pore govt used the sword - or rather the noose - against Ngyuen without considering properly all the pleas of clemency, thus showing that it does not possess scales at all, but only the sharp sword which cuts both ways; the Hangman has trouble recruiting a successor.<br><br>the (sad) pikamaster</div>
