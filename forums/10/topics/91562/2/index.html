Singapore is ultimately a paper chase society where everyone's worth is measured by a piece of paper. Not having a degree means lesser chances of a promotion and companies are more disposed towards employing people with higher educational qualifications. People tend to look at degree holders in a different light. Whether you like it or not... that's how superficial society is... having a degree does open many doors... let's face it!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I can't help but smile at the sensible reply that Qitai made.<br><br>While I sympathize with the frustrations many diploma holders have for failing to secure an interview because of the lack of sufficent paper qualifications, it is just as stereotypical to portray degree-holders as<br><br>"idiots at work. They can conceptualize, come up with good presentations...but cannot carry out anything bcoz they cannot get anyone to work for them...their socialising skills and PR farktup lah. Double standard...cannot carry out what they preach... " (Troy437, 30 Aug 2004)<br><br>It's simply a sweeping, ill-considered cliche to portray those who work hard in school to get to universities as incompetent, clueless and socially-inept.<br><br>I couldn't help but carry this illogical misconception a step further: does that mean that primary school dropouts also have a case against diploma holders? ("all these diploma holders all idiot lor! industrial attachment many, but hokkien damn lao ya, think they go poly waste time only!")<br><br>Academically, the same discipline (e.g engineering or accounting) is taught differently in the universities and polytechnics, in terms of depth, scope and focus. It doesnt take a lot of common sense to recognise this.<br><br>While a degree may open more doors, and secure the all important first interview, ultimately, it is like what many cool-headed people here have pointed out: it's the ability and performance that counts.<br><br>More and more people *around the world* are opting for a university education. This has stretched the operating budgets, manpower resources and facilities of many tertiary institutions including prestigious ones. These are regularly reported in international media (for example UK's Guardian Online under its Education column).<br><br>Singaporeans are no exception in recognising that a degree gives the holder a chance for a better life (improving lifestyle, self-fulfillment, more job security, opportunities to do more things they want). This is a reality that people who complain about their lack of formal qalifications should recognise quickly. It's pure naivety if people think degree-holders have an easier life at work and do not have their share of discontentment. Perhaps the fact that Singapore is a country with 4.2 million people crowded on a small land mass amplifies these frustrations, and makes the issue appear larger and louder compared to other much bigger countries. But really, which country's populace doesnt aspire to a better life for themselves and their families, or where materialism hasn't taken a foothold?<br><br>If diploma holders think they are being short-changed, there is no other alternative but to prove themselves (not only work performance, but in terms of training, certification and paper qualifications). Do something constructive, and stop whining.<br><br></div>

It just that not all people come from rich family with lots of money to support their studies. Besides many Singaporeans have many ugly mindsets! Take my case for eg. I am holding a temp and always like to work OT to save some more money for my education in the future. You know what the first thing they say to you. Take money from your parents or lend from bank! When you tell them you don't want to end up in debt and want to earn enough to pay it off. HA HA. You should see those people face man. The fact is that Singaporeans do not want to understand other people's way of thinking. Most of us like to follow the majority mindset. And they are always frighten if you want to learn more. I have only one thing to say a slave is still a slave. Chief slave or not. They think their position so desirable mei. Dream on. If they all so smart how come still working for people!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well, lets face it, people slog through 3-4 yrs in a uni, 2 yrs in A levels. a total of 5-6 yrs of tertiary education, due credit should be given, not to forget its much much much more expensive to go through a 3 yr in a uni than 3 yr in poly.<br><br>it is true there are many degree holders out there but do realise that it isn't really dat easy to get a degree and its not an overnight thing, people slog through uni to get dat piece of paper. maybe its easy to get into uni, but getting out of it with decent grades aren't, at least for ntu. go ask ard, see how many people flunk subjects even in year 1 sem 1. many poly students who came in, direct-entry yr 2 will find it much harder to cope...now u see the difference between poly and uni although both are tertiary education. poly is more into lab work, not much emphasis on maths etc, dats why when those poly people come to ntu, they are really lost cos they did not learn what those A level people learn while in JC.<br><br>having a degree will more or less give u an job that will make u just 'rich' enough to take care of ur needs and stuff like dat. it doesn't really make u earn big bucks. not having a degree doesn't mean u will starve to death either. in singapore, as long as u are willing to work, u won't starve.<br><br>having a good education enables u to have a safety net, as u can use the cert to go find jobs even if ur entrepeneur path fails. but if u have no cert and ur entrepeneur path fails, u are in big trouble if u have nothing to promote urself to others.<br><br>i know many friends who wanna make it big via MLM etc, came to approach me but realised dat i actually knew more than them...then they asked me 'why didn't u continue with MLM' and such stuff....as far as i know, they are still 'marching on the spot' in the MLM thingy, they could have progressed but they didn't as all they want is $$$$, there is no personal commitment, no interest, no nothing, they want and hope others do the work and they reap the profits like wat those MLM people tell them. if dat works, nobody will be slogging like hell. MLM is fine and will work if u are hardworking and have gd contact network but don't really pin too high hopes on it cos there are only a few M people staying here and there are thousands of similar agents in 1 MLM.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br>the problem is alot of people see the newspaper, see dis person made it big, see dat person made it big and they will think they can do it too. wat they fail to realise is dat opportunity and 'contact network' is very important. if u have the right contact, u will be able to have a headstart in your path. most importantly is dat u must be enthu abt it, no point following others into some MLM just because so and so made it big etc....if u are only into making $, u won't last long, dats wat i observed in 10/10 cases...sad to say.<br><br>i know a friend who opened 2 toy stores, one is in Suntec. he told me he went to Japan to source for novelty stuff a few yrs, and he met luckily someone who taught him the ropes in 3 weeks and introduced him to some suppliers, if he didn't meet him, he told me it would take a few yrs and thousands and thousands of $ wasted just to learn the ropes.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Xenthar:</div><div class="quote_body">Well I certainly didn't sterotype degree holders. I just say they have a better chance. It just that not all people come from rich family with lots of money to support their studies. Besides many Singaporeans have many ugly mindsets! Take my case for eg. I am holding a temp and always like to work OT to save some more money for my education in the future. You know what the first thing they say to you. Take money from your parents or lend from bank! When you tell them you don't want to end up in debt and want to earn enough to pay it off. HA HA. You should see those people face man. The fact is that Singaporeans do not want to understand other people's way of thinking. Most of us like to follow the majority mindset. And they are always frighten if you want to learn more. I have only one thing to say a slave is still a slave. Chief slave or not. They think their position so desirable mei. Dream on. If they all so smart how come still working for people!</div></blockquote>Just ignore those people. Why let those people affect you. Like you said, it is not as if they are doing well themselves. If you need advise, get it from those who have done it, not those who failed to achieve. Those who did not achieve gives good advise on what to avoid, but not necessarily what to do best.<br><br>You can get a degree even if you are poor. I have done it. I pretty much paid for my degree myself by giving tuition everyday after school while I was in University. I loan the maximum allowed from bank and my father paid for whatever is left that cannot be covered by the bank and myself. It is not a shame to borrow $$ for a degree. Most of us should be able to use CPF $$ (if not already spend into housing) and bank loans to cover a significant percentage of the cost, if not all of it. And don't worry about the borrowing, it is well worth it, both in terms of employability as well as learning. I used to be very upset each time I looked at the $$ I owe the bank. But looking back, it is really not a big deal.<br><br>Additionally, note that degree is not the only path to success. There are so many ways to success, degree is just the most common and proven. Key is to pick up skills and knowledge that you can eventually sell yourself. This can even be as simple as being know how to cook or just having a good personality that people likes. Even degree holders needs the other skills to get far. I have seen degree holders who are still stuck with &lt;$2,000 salary after a few years of work.</div>
