              <p>I gave my reasons for suspecting you to be an indian.</p>
              <p>You whine like an indian.</p>
              <p>An indian play around with you. (You own a plastics business, mind you, why would an indian play around with the boss.)</p>
              <p>Therefore it is not out of the blues, like your remark.</p>
              <p>If you say you're not indian, ok so be it. You sleep with it.</p>
              <p>You really lack maturity, I have said that, and so has others too. This we gather from your rantings. You puff yourself up too much.</p>

              <p>hmmm.... i find it really funny. I aspire to be a Economist in the private banking sector and hopefully being able to work for a consulate as a capacity of a Economic advisor to third world countries like ghana for example. Being in Singapore made me realised my dreams and being so i hope that it can help me in a way fulfil in a dream. No matter where you are , having a vision and the drive to move towards it are important in achieving it's aim. Singapore is not supposed be a vibrant metropolitan city , as what it is now if not for the visions and the determination to make this a reality by our forefathers. David Marshall, S rajaratnam and Dr Goh keng swee are the people behind the scenes , toiling to make this a reality. I personally salute them.</p>

              <p> Taken from temasekreview.com<br> <br> <strong><span style="font-size: small;">Researcher from LKY School debunked MM Lee’s claims that widening income gap is “inevitable”</span></strong><br> <br> During the Kent Ridge Ministerial dialogue held at NUS two days ago,
                  Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew stressed that that problem of a widening
                  income gap is one that most countries – not just Singapore – have to
                  contend with and it is “inevitable” in a globalized world.<br> <br> MM Lee’s claims about the “inevitability” of Singapore’s widening
                  income gap were debunked last year in a paper co-authored by a
                  researcher, Mr Mukul Asher, from the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public
                  Policy entitled “Singapore’s Policy Responses to Aging, Inequality and
                  Poverty: An Assessment”. (read abstract here)<br> <br> Besides income inequality, the paper also addressed the twin problems
                  of aging and poverty in Singapore which may be contributed partly by
                  the government’s policies.<br> <br> The paper criticizes Singapore’s over-reliance on a single-tier
                  mandatory savings in the form of CPF to finance retirement, housing and
                  to a lesser extent, healthcare as well as the government’s migration
                  policies to allow non-citizen population to triple between 1990 and
                  2005 to 30 per cent (it is now 36 per cent) in order to sustain growth
                  and competitiveness at the expense of citizens.<br> <br> It argues that Singapore has the fiscal, institutional, and
                  organizational capacities for a modern multi-tier social security
                  system instead of the current inadequate and inequitable arrangements
                  which require individuals and their families to bear disproportionate
                  risks in financing retirement, healthcare and short-term income support.<br> <br> Short of being a helpless victim of globalization, the paper concluded
                  that “this reflects conscious policy choices arising from a Darwinist
                  vision of society, and the need of socio-political control…and
                  therefore cannot be attributed to globalization phenomenon.”<br> <br> In other words, Singapore’s widening income gap is largely a result of
                  the government’s long-held policy of depriving citizens of an adequate
                  social safety net in order to spur them to continue working harder to
                  support themselves and families.<br> <br> While globalization does contribute to income disparities, the
                  government can ameliorate the situation by limiting the influx of
                  foreigners and providing more social assistance to citizens like in
                  other developed Asian countries.<br> <br> Singapore has one of the highest saving rates in the world at 47 per
                  cent. Instead of investing its vast fiscal surpluses in children which
                  will generate a much better returns, they end up mostly in the
                  country’s two giant sovereign wealth funds – GIC and Temasek, which
                  suffered heavy losses lately as a result of the global financial crisis.<br> <br> The limited and inadequate social security system is necessary to keep
                  citizens on their toes at all times and to diminish their interest in
                  politics. With Singaporeans having to work extra hard in order to pay
                  off their ever rising loans, few will be adventurous enough to join the
                  opposition to challenge the ruling party.<br> <br> As a result, Singaporeans are continuously being held hostage by the
                  ruling party over estate upgrading which affects the value of their
                  flats and their CPFs which they are unable to withdraw in one lump sum
                  now under the annuity scheme.<br> <br> A subservient and apolitical citizenry makes for easy control and
                  governance thereby enabling the ruling elite to implement unpopular
                  policies with little fuss since the majority of the populace are too
                  caught up with earning money than to bother themselves with politics
                  and current affairs.<br> <br> In summary, the government can do much more to reduce the growing
                  income gap between the poor and the rich, it is not simply an
                  “inevitable” consequence of globalization.<br> <br> Though Singapore is an open economy and cannot expect to buffer itself
                  from external shocks, the government has the resources and capacity to
                  develop a multi-tier social protection system for its citizens.<br> <br> The problem of such a system is that it will empower the citizens and
                  reduce their heavy reliance on the ruling party thereby threatening its
                  political hegemony.<br> <br> Singaporeans must realize that as citizens of their country, they have
                  the right to demand the government provides them with certain basic
                  benefits such as free education up to the college level at least and
                  easily affordable medical care which commensurate with developed
                  countries elsewhere though not necessarily an exact replica of the
                  welfare system in the West.<br> <br> Embracing globalization fully without putting in adequate safeguards to
                  protect the interests of citizens is not only foolhardy, but
                  detrimental to the development of the nation in the long run.</p>

              <p>We have noticed that of late, government ministers &amp; officials, and People’s Action Party members have been criticizing Singaporeans and their attitudes towards a myriad of issues – from employment to public housing.</p>
              <p>We thus would like to collate all of these into a single thread here.</p>
              <p>Our hope is that the government will see for itself the callous, unfair and condescending attitude it and its members have adopted towards Singaporeans and do some soul-searching. Singaporeans work hard, very hard, and gives the PAP government its vote of confidence at every election since independence.</p>
              <p>Are such remarks towards Singaporeans justified?</p>
