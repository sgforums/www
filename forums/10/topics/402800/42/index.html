              <p>Then the only way to rejuvenate Singapore public life and society is to terminate the 50 years dictatorial rule of the People's Action Party.</p>
              <p>Imagine the great reforms, great possibilities that can come with the end of PAP rule!</p>
              <p>Just a simple 5 years without PAP rule can bring so much improvements and progressive reforms to Singapore public life and help uplift society.</p>

              <p>I somehow feel that PAP is bringing about the ultimate destruction of Singapore and in order to save the situation, the PAP rule must be destroyed.</p>
              <p>If PAP rule continues to exist, the state of Singapore will be destroyed along with the PAP.</p>
              <p>That is why all Singaporeans who want to save Singapore must support the end of PAP power.</p>

              <p>pap will not be destroyed,,,if i were to head PAP,i would take out $$$$ to next country eg)east timor or cambodia or laos.with their past knowledge they will duplicate another spore model there along with merlion,MAS building,PUB ,pulau bukom.changi airport etc etc.</p>
              <p>this would be possible if that foreign gov would be lenient n allow sporeans to go into their gov facilities n infrastructure of said country something like what suzhou china gave to spore but dumped them soon after.</p>
              <p>since there is no country on the planet yet to allow spore to take control of its infrastructure,,,,spore resources has to stay put in spore and only personal riches are allowd to buy castles and mansions overseas .</p>

              <p>It’s no wonder Singapore’s productivity went all the way down eversince the country was sold by PAP in it’s FT policy.</p>
              <p>Dishonesty at work and at job interviews are a norm in thrid world countries like China and India.</p>
              <p>While the Singapore businesses thought they’ve got a good deal by hiring FTs (whether it’s due to cost or for the sake of diversity), they’re actually denying qualified Singaporeans of their opportunities while importing unproductive and liars into their company.</p>
              <p>It’s simply penny wise pound foolish – like every other PAP’s policies in the last few years.</p>
              <p>“<em>A recent study by KPMG found that about 60% of employers complain about resume fraud and fake credentials among significant numbers of applicants. Five percent of companies have reported losses exceeding $2 million as a result. The situation is such that many universities are now starting to embed RFID chips in their diplomas to prevent fraud.”</em></p>

This ultra-pragmatism is pervasive in Chinese society today; people are less concerned with abstract notions of right and wrong than with getting things done. In economic terms, this fosters a business climate in which companies copy each others’ products, steal employees and business plans, and compete ruthlessly over tiny profit margins. But with little trust or sense of long-term planning and investment, they find it hard to grow and develop their businesses.”</em></p>

              <p>Most of these Foreign Trashes from PRC and India are not even semi-skilled as claimed to be, like a hired electrician who don’t even know how to fix an electrical plug.<br>They rob Singaporeans of their jobs, take the salaries and just start learning on the job training.</p>

              <p>((While the Singapore businesses thought they’ve got a good deal by hiring FTs (whether it’s due to cost or for the sake of diversity))</p>
              <p>Foreign Talent is euphemism for Lee Kuan Yew’s racist policy For every 10 foreigners allowed in, eight of them have to be of Chinese origin, according to Singapore’s immigration policy supervised by minister Wong Kan Seng.</p>
              <p>The population is said to be five million and is expected to go up to 6.5 million. In this, racial composition plays a major part. Eight out of ten in Singapore have to be Chinese to maintain, in the words of Lee Kuan Yew, “racial balance”. Why do we need this bigotry?</p>

              <p>@fcx: Actually, there is some truth to this. When I was working at NTU, we had a real concern with the credentials of foreign students, and would spend more time checking up on them than on local students or foreign students with local degrees.</p>
              <p>Things we did included checking with supposed supervisors, or degree granting institutions to verify degrees, and cold calling prospects (no announced interview time) to verify their abilities. The unannounced interviews were done, because some prospects actually hired others to do their interviews for them.</p>
              <p>We also had a couple of cases of out and out plagiarism (i.e., copying someone else’s article word for word), where the foreign student just didn’t see what was wrong with doing that. In contrast, when I dealt with a Singaporean group involved in a copying case, they KNEW it was wrong… but did it anyway.</p>
              <p>Its not so much that people in other countries are bad, but that what is considered bad in Singapore isn’t considered bad elsewhere. I could list examples of friends of mine who have studied in other countries, where cheating on exams is accepted. Unfortunately, to do that, I’d have to name the countries.</p>
              <p>I can give these as examples though: In Japan, pornography is sold openly in newsstands. In China and Korea, dogs are raised and slaughtered for meat. What would be offensive and morally wrong in Singapore aren’t morally wrong to those people.</p>
              <p>In fact, the notion of copyright and that copying others is bad is a relatively modern idea that evolved around the notion of intellectual property rights. In many countries of the world, the notion of intellectual property rights is relatively new.</p>

              <p>In the 70s, many Asians wanted to work in Europe because of what we saw in TV. Many girls became sex slaves.<br>Asian is forever searching for a better place to earn a living.<br>Chinese and Indians had always been slaves to everyone…!<br>Can only talk about culture this and culture that! Like to boast about, we have longest tradition and all, but never admitted that they love this slavery mentality!<br>Can never stand on its own two feet!<br>Always must serve others! Cursed nations!<br>The leaders realized that if they are act like westerners, many of these slave workers will surly come to do their cursed obligations!</p>

              <p>The most audacious incident that I experienced was in 1999. As a matter of policy, my employer required all job applicants to be tested prior to any job offer. I offered a role to an Indian national who had passsed the technical test. While the person who reported for work bore a close resemblance to the person that passed the test, intuition told me that something was amissed. So I decided to ask new employee to take the same test again. Guessed what, he failed, and he confessed that it was his twin brother that came for the interview and test.</p>

              <p>walau,these foreigners are really talented indeed.<br>it’s not easy to fake degrees leh.<br>I don’t think singaporeans know how to fake degrees leh.<br>Think maybe these foreign talents will soon be very rich if they use also use their talents to ‘fake’ money.</p>
              <p>who;s at fault here really?<br>Is it the MOM ?<br>I think I better learn how to fake degrees too,maybe fake two or three plus a PHD as recently some miws said we are short of PHDs here.</p>

              <p>@Cecil Chua</p>
              <p>i am not saying there is no truth in this article…there are few instances… but the way you are branding Indians/Chinese as cheats is hurtful…the whole intention of sites like these is find obscure data and do foreigner bashing…probably, it offers singaporeans some consolation in tough times…anyways, if branding indians and chinese as cheats make you feel superior, then enjoy ur superiority complex…</p>

              <p>In the course of my work, I met an Indian ‘electrical’ engineer who doesn’t even know ohm’s laws…that’s good it got. After he was exposed, it was discovered, he got the job thru a telephone interview, where he got panels of people helping answer questions..and that’s how he got hired..</p>
              <p>Sorry, I personally think he is better off selling snake oil somewhere…</p>

              <p>So what else is new? Guys from these countries don’t just have a bad reputation for lying and forging degrees and resumes in Singapore, they have a bad reputation for such antics ALL OVER THE WORLD. I am a member of an international engineering forum (<a rel="nofollow" href="http://cr4.globalspec.com/"><span style="color: #ab6f07;">http://cr4.globalspec.com/</span></a>) and a frequent complaint from the highly-qualified professionals there is that so-called professionals from these countries are no better than a poorly trained apprentice in terms of job skill.</p>

              <p>I have seen so much of FTs that today I can tell you that only 20% of these can deliver. 80% are not even close.</p>
              <p>Case 1. An accounts assitant in my company who had a Diploma and had worked for 17 years with the company. She was laid off and replaced by a PRC ACCA graduate who was given a similar pay which was around 4,000. Her proposed probation of 3 months ended 9 instead and finally she was fired. Reason: she had serious problems balancing the accounts and filling financial statements for the company causing investors to irked and SGX to fine the company twice.</p>
              <p>Case 2. An Indian FT who was suppose to be a genius in IT widzardry turned out to be a flop. Armed with all kinds of Microsoft certifications, ERP Specialist Diplomas, he couldn’t even solve a exception report problem for more than 6 months even when the Global IT extended all resources to him. Although we expected him to be paid less, he’s got enough salary to buy a Toyota Altis only after 3 months of work. The grapevine was, all his certifications were real, but apparently he didn’t earn them himself. He was relieved and replace by a Singaporean who was paid 10% less than the FT because he didn’t have so many certificates. However, eversince the Singaporean manager took over, IT was never a real problem to its users.</p>
              <p>If you wondered how come there’re so many PRC and Indian graduates everywhere, don’t be. Ot of curiousity, my ex-colleague ‘attended’ a course that would cost SGD 18,000 in Singapore for SGD 2,000 in India without even stepping foot in India or taking any exams. He got his certificate mailed to him 9 months later. A check with the accredited UK university proved that the certificate was real.</p>
              <p>So how did it happen? Apparently, the school will do whatever it can to make its student pass, even if it means that the lecturer will ’sit’ for the exams for his students on their behalf.</p>
              <p>So the point is, we got a bunch of fake FTs who are actually trash. Look around in your workplace right now. What makes them more deserving than Singaporean employees?</p>
              <p>When you flood the market with con-man employees from PRC &amp; India, not just it screws up the productivity of the company. With new expectations, it depresses and deprive Singaporeans of their fair wages.</p>
              <p>PAP knows that in order to be richer, someone has to be poorer. And that someone is you, the Citizens of Singapore.</p>
              <p>We don’t need an academic to explain how capitalism brings out the greatest atrocities, especially from a body who is suppose to look after you.</p>
              <p>40 years of persecution, punishment and perversion and Singaporeans think that it’s alright- I mean the 66%.</p>

              <p>Please don’t chase all this FT away, we need them to do our dirty work. We also need their blood, soon there will be a law that they must donate blood 4 times a year!<br>Also we can buy their kidneys and other spare parts!<br>Hope they are not reading this!</p>

              <p>Yes, you can buy fake university diploma or certificate in china, very cheap, 5-10 yuan or S$1-2 each. this is of course dishonest. but if you damned interviewer fails to identify such kind of fake applicants,and still gives them jobs; or if you damned interviewee fails to grab a job offer from what you so called foreign trash, doesn’t this give a strong footprint to your strong man who said some S’preans were daft?!</p>
              <p>can you,a punch of kiasi,kiasu,loser do anything really useful instead of complaining,muckraking and masturbating(bashing foreign inferiors to get some little consolation and cover your own incompetence and disability).</p>
              <p>when you say someone a trash, you are a trash too!</p>

              <p>Trust me,</p>
              <p>Try interviewing a Pinoy for any executive level jobs …</p>
              <p>worse. although, hmmm the girls do put up a good “show”. Half ball that they let lah, make up they put on lah, knows how to compliment their interviewer lah …</p>
              <p>sighhhh … sometimes we wonder we are hiring their skills or their body.</p>
              <p>I can tell u most of these Pinoys have no ACTUAL JOB experience. And one of the common trick they pull is “family issues back home” OR “landlord give problems” si beh sian one after hiring them.</p>
              <p>I think hor, good ole Malaysians still the best.</p>

              <p>Ask around your local friends, colleagues and family, if you had the choice, which group of the 3 main influx of foreign labour would you deport first out of Singapore. Consistently, here’s the results;</p>
              <p>1) Indians, especially white collar (always get Instant response to this group)<br>2) Mainland Chinese<br>3) Cheap Ang Mos / Pinoys<br>4) Miscellaneous</p>

              <p>@fcx: I think I see what you are trying to get at.</p>
              <p>For example, the author wrote “Dishonesty at work and at job interviews are a norm in thrid world countries like China and India.” I would reject that statement based on insufficient evidence.</p>
              <p>I would accept a proposition that “a significant and observable subpopulation of individuals from those two countries attempt to secure positions based on false credentials.” I would also note that Singaporeans, Americans, etc. have done these things in the past. In my original response to you, I tried to emphasize that I have caught SINGAPOREANS engaged in plagiarism.</p>
              <p>The key difference is that the Singaporeans viewed this as wrong and recognized that what they did was a punishable offense. In contrast, there exist places in India and China where the local population do not see securing positions based on false credentials as morally wrong.</p>
              <p>See for example:</p>

              <p>This is a real case from my friend. A lecher cucasian boss in a mnc hired a female filipino to be a department manager for $4K/mth. She does nothing in the office accept assigning her jobs to her subordinates. This filipino goes to work late and knock off early. She often went MIA when everyone were looking for her. She does not has similar prior working experience. When people emailed her questions, she took very long time to reply or doesn’t reply at all. This woman brought in more of her own kind by hiring them as office executives.</p>
              <p>Ridiculous!!!!!</p>

              <p>I am having difficulty understanding your definition, yet undisclosed, of “sufficient evidence” in your quote below.</p>
              <p>“I would reject that statement based on insufficient evidence”</p>
              <p>But I also implore that I do find it hard to understand if honesty is a cultural trait of one nationality – after reading the EVIDENCE in the official document of their own government which reads as follows</p>
              <p>” The answer is very simple, Chinese (generally) are very conceited, with just cause, and most would find our antics abd behavior, banal, inane, profane and sometime grossly offensive”</p>
              <p>You find these words in the page “Green Tea or Coca Cola” from the link below – of an OFFICIAL DOCUMENT OF A GUIDE FOR FOREIGNERS WORKING IN CHINA.</p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.china4u2.com/Guide_to_Jobs___Working_in_China__preview_.pdf"><span style="color: #ab6f07;">http://www.china4u2.com/Guide_to_Jobs___Working_in_China__preview_.pdf</span></a></p>
              <p>So if their Government knows their culture, can I deny that it is sufficient (???) for us to be concerned of their alien cultural traits less agreeable to other societies. I have seen incrediblly disportionate legal cases involving Chinese national on immigration lawsuits in Australian courts.</p>

              <div class="postcontent">NOVEMBER 10, 2000 VOL. 26 NO. 44<br>For Richer or Poorer<br>Who will care for the city-state's deprived?<br>By ROGER MITTON Singapore <br><br>Lee Chong Peng is the symbol of Singapore's broken dream. She lives alone in a one-room flat on about $3 a day. "I watch television and take short walks," she says. "My legs ache now, so I cannot go so far." But without fail, every Wednesday afternoon, Lee takes the lift down eight floors to the ground level of her public housing block. There she joins dozens of other poor folk from her district in Chinatown to sit, waiting, on concrete benches. Lee, 84, chats with friends, while others remain sullen, lacking even the warmth of comradeship. At 5 p.m. they all form into a line and shuffle forward to receive a plastic bag containing six eggs, 1.5 kg of rice, a can of baked beans, a can of sweet corn, one packet of hot chocolate, one packet of coffee, some cereal and a single toilet roll. Without this weekly donation from a charitable group, Lee and her neighbors find it tough to survive. <br><br>What happened to Singapore, the land of plenty? In its rush to forge a manufacturing, then a high-tech economy, the city-state rarely bothered to look back at those who were lagging. Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew developed a system based on hard work and government support for industry. Singaporeans were expected to earn their rewards. The results were astounding: a middle class emerged to build Asia's second-richest country. But with the advent of globalization and an influx of cheap foreign workers, Singapore's economy is becoming increasingly ruthless. According to its own statistics, the nation's rich are getting richer and the poor are falling further behind. To most Singaporeans, the mere existence of poor folk in need of care packages comes as a shock. And this realization has prompted an uncharacteristic bout of soul-searching. The rich-poor disparity strikes right at the heart of Singapore's development model — and challenges the city's smug self- image. Many younger Singaporeans raised in middle-class comfort are beginning to think that Lee's ideal is outdated; they argue that the government has a responsibility to care more for the downtrodden. <br><br>The issue burst into Singapore's consciousness in May, when the media reported a Department of Statistics disclosure that the lowest 10% of society had an average monthly income of only $75.81. Officials said the figure (which included unemployed and retired people) had been misused to present a distorted view. Trade and Industry Minister George Yeo presented a raft of numbers in parliament to show that Singapore's poor really were not so poor after all. "The standard of living among the lower income has gone up," said Yeo. Nearly all had televisions and telephones, on average they had about $11,500 in the state retirement fund (CPF), and all but a quarter lived in 3-room or larger flats. "In other words, many in the bottom 10% have significant wealth in the form of CPF savings and their homes," added Yeo. "They are not an underclass."</div>

If foreginer influx and cheap labor and hard work was the only reason for FT import, then they would do it in all areas and not just engineering. Why would banks not hire cheap labor and make them work more ??? The fact is that Singaporeans do not produce enough number of good-enough engineers. <br><br>Look at ur research labs like A-star. I had applied there as a foreigner and the very next day they called me for an interview and offered a job. I was a fresh grad student from NUS. Ofcoz, A-star does not pay that well so I did not go for it. But, where are ur singaporean engineers. Stop blaming FTs. The truth is that singaporean engineers are not capable to earning high salaries. And those who are , go to banking n finance. <br><br>The turth is a mediocre engineer can still earn better in finance. Just bcus the salaries are slightly higher in finance sector, does not mean that people are brainier. But to succeed n earn well in engineering, u need to be smart which most local people are not.</div>

              <div style="font-style: italic;">Stop blaming foreigners. If foreginer influx and cheap labor and hard work was the only reason for FT import, then they would do it in all areas and not just engineering. Why would banks not hire cheap labor and make them work more ??? The fact is that Singaporeans do not produce enough number of good-enough engineers. <br><br>Look at ur research labs like A-star. I had applied there as a foreigner and the very next day they called me for an interview and offered a job. I was a fresh grad student from NUS. Ofcoz, A-star does not pay that well so I did not go for it. But, where are ur singaporean engineers. Stop blaming FTs. The truth is that singaporean engineers are not capable to earning high salaries. And those who are , go to banking n finance. <br><br>The turth is a mediocre engineer can still earn better in finance. Just bcus the salaries are slightly higher in finance sector, does not mean that people are brainier. But to succeed n earn well in engineering, u need to be smart which most local people are not.</div>

              What an angry reply...<br><br>I'll just like to state a few points here... <br><br>I was an engineering graduate and I did my internship in A-star. Life as a researcher is rather stagnant. Unlike what you mentioned, I find that A-star does pay well. Maybe one man's food is another man's poison, but the A-star starting pay is definitely above the industry average for a fresh engineering graduate. <br><br>Yes, indeed, many engineering graduates turn over to the financial sector. Why? Because if you can achieve the highest returns while utilizing the lowest resources, then your resources have been used efficiently. Although the finance sector might require long working hours, the pay increase in the starting years is rather substantial depending on performance and your contacts. In this sector, your most important resource in terms of career advancement (time) would be made use of efficiently.<br><br>Needless to say, this is also possible as an engineer, but the chances are lower. Engineering is a stable career and you will find that your bosses will be rather unwilling to leave because they are sitting in their office with a comfortable paycheck and steady job. That is why it might take many more years to jump into a technical management role as compared to the finance sector. However, I do not agree that a mediocre engineer can do just as well in the finance sector. The financial sector is a cut-throat industry, where performance is key. <br><br>I am an engineer myself, and I wouldn't consider myself very smart or very capable. I too have considered moving on to the finance sector, but it is indeed hard to change your path when you are drawing a $4300 salary (excluding bonuses) after 1.5 years of working experience. I think the catch is all about choosing the right industry to be an engineer. <br>No prizes for guessing which industry. =)</div>

              Chen Shu Bian, an electrical engineering graduate from China's Chengchi University, is a senior equipment engineer in the Silicon-On-System Manufacturing Co. (SSMC) wafer fab in Singapore. He's one of many savvy mainland Chinese engineers working in the Lion City to fulfill their dream of working in a foreign country and getting advanced training with a multinational manufacturer. Once new skills are obtained, Chen and many other Chinese engineers plan to return home to help run the growing number of fabs being built in China.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Indeed, droves of Chinese engineers now coming to Singapore for advanced training expect to leave and return to either China or Taiwan. Only a few end up staying here. "Many of them are prepared to work in Singapore but if better opportunities present themselves, they are just as likely to leave," said Jason Lee, senior partner with Trapeze HR, an executive search firm based in Hong Kong.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Chen has been one of those itinerant engineers. "Although I am from China, I was originally working for a foundry in Taiwan as a junior engineer and later opted for a posting in Singapore," he said. "Singapore, I felt, provided the right environment for upgrading your skills and their rigorous on-the-job training helped me to be a senior engineer after only two years."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Lee estimated that close to 4,600 mainland Chinese have moved to Singapore since 2000, to look for better job opportunities and advanced training. Close to 20 percent, based on their qualifications, are working in the semiconductor and wafer fab industry.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Chen's job is to improve equipment performance on the 0.18?m line at SSMC so his division meets its production goals. The wafer fab is a joint venture among Philips Semiconductor, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp., and Singapore's Economic Development Board.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Despite Singapore's best efforts to integrate Chinese engineers into its work force by offering them permanent residence status, there are few guarantees they will stay. Retaining skilled labor is still considered an uphill task in Singapore, especially since a skilled work force is seen as mobile, less dependent on geographic locations, and influenced more by the desire for economic independence.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Brain drain at home?</strong></p>
              <p>Singapore is attracting more senior IC engineers and designers, Lee said. But it is also losing one-fifth of its own engineering work force to other regional and global markets. "We see a pattern emerging where young and enterprising Singaporeans are moving abroad instead of staying home."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>China's emergence as a semiconductor power also worries industry executives here. By 2010, Gartner Dataquest predicts China will be the second-largest semiconductor market. Indeed, China's domestic market alone will consume about $24 billion worth of semiconductors by 2004. Foundry capacity also increased by 2 percent last year and is expected to jump over 12 percent next year, challenging Singapore for the second spot in total foundry capacity after Taiwan.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Leow Hock Bee, a research manager for Frost &amp; Sullivan Asia Pacific, said China has already announced construction of 40 wafer fabs since last year. "The rapid developments in China in all sectors including semiconductors are resulting in some sort of a 'reverse brain drain' where mainland Chinese are returning to China," he said. "The availability of a similar quality of life and opportunities [in China] is strengthening this trend."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>William Mercer Consulting said China offers employment opportunities unlike others in Asia. A report put the forecast for China's economic growth this year as high as 7.6 percent. China's membership in the World Trade Organization has also spurred accelerating foreign direct investment, including investment diverted from other Asian countries. In Beijing alone, the overall salary range for this year is expected to increase by 10 percent, the report said.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Singapore will be hard-pressed to hang on to the Chinese engineers it helps train. Recovering from an overall slump in its electronic exports since last year, which badly mauled its performance in non-oil exports, Singapore also is making inroads in the chip foundry business.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The nation-state retains grand ambitions of transforming itself into an Asian wafer center second only to Taiwan. "It's an uphill job fulfilling the quota of having 25 wafer fabs in Singapore by 2005," said an official with Singapore's economic board. So far, there are 15 fabs, with only two more in the pipeline. Singapore "has been overly ambitious in laying claim as the wafer hub of Asia," said Jay Marican, an investment specialist with Novertal Investment in Malaysia.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Singapore continues to attract more Chinese engineers through a recruitment program, but fewer are staying and more are heading back to China or moving to Taiwan to run new fabs. Manish Sharma, who specializes in semiconductor front- and back-end software applications, said it's becoming more common for China to attract Singaporeans than the reverse. "China fabs are attracting Singaporeans since there is a heavy demand and executive packages are all too attractive compared to working in Singapore," Sharma said.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Immigrant mix</strong></p>
              <p>Sharma found that Malaysia and the Philippines make up the bulk of the engineering labor pool for back-end fab manufacturers, especially for IC manufacturing in Singapore. "When I visit NEC Semiconductor and National Semiconductor, I find more Malaysians and Filipinos there compared to Chinese from mainland China," he added.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Whether Taiwanese engineers running fabs in Singapore like SSMC will eventually end up in China remains unclear. Either way, more Taiwanese engineers are flocking to China rather than Singapore. It is estimated that about 500,000 Taiwanese are living and working in Shanghai, while several employment agencies said about 5,000 mid-level managers are working in high-tech areas for Chinese companies in Shanghai, Beijing and Tianjin. The second half of 2001 saw Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp., and Grace Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. hire some 3,000 engineers between them.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The benefits package China uses to attract Taiwanese engineers includes housing and a car as well as a salary beginning at $28,000, according to a recruiting agency. More than 80 percent of Taiwanese in a survey said they would like to work in China, according to 104 Job Bank, Taiwan's largest online job recruiting service.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Singapore is not the only country with a shortage of engineers. Japanese-run factories are also under pressure to double employment within China by 2004. Companies like NEC, Hitachi, Fujitsu and Toshiba are all seeking to hire more Chinese engineers. With demand growing, Chinese engineers increasingly understand they must work in a mature market like Singapore to obtain the necessary technical and managerial skills to run</p>
              <p>China's growing web of fabs.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Despite stiff labor competition from China, Japan and Taiwan, Singapore officials said this could be offset by productivity increases created when three 300mm fabs come online in late 2003 and early 2004. "These companies running the 300-mm fabs have adopted an aggressive policy with regards to hiring foreign engineers," said an official from the Institute of Micro Electronics, which also helps train local engineers and students.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Avenue for exchange</strong></p>
              <p>The National University of Singapore has linked with 10 top Chinese universities to forge closer academic ties. Chong Chi Tat, university deputy president, said the alliance creates an avenue for scientific and technological exchanges between researchers and students. "Competency centers" would be set up at select Chinese universities, he said, to identify emerging information technologies of strategic interest to both countries. Prototype development projects will be encouraged.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Singapore also sends top students to study in top universities in Japan, Germany and the United States. State-supported semiconductor research is also booming here. "Singapore has realized that attracting the top designers and engineering talent is necessary if it intends to be a wafer hub, especially for the front-end semiconductor industry. And paying top dollar for talent helps to stem the brain drain, much like capital flight, especially now since the semiconductor industry plays such a vital role in its national economy," said R. Ramakrishnam, a quality control director for a manufacturing company based in Thailand.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For Chen Shu Bian, the Chinese engineer honing his skills at the SSMC fab here, a key reason for relocating to Singapore was the attraction of a higher salary and the chance to gain more experience. But with China's fab infrastructure expanding at a breakneck pace, it's unlikely he'll choose to stay.</p>

              <p>Pham had an erection during the examination and tried to pull the doctor towards him. After dressing up, he placed his hands on the doctor’s shoulder and said he liked her very much.</p>

              <p>In June 2009, a 20 year old Cambodian student Chhuon Ratana was jailed three months for molesting two women at a club. When confronted by the club bouncers, he retorted:</p>
              <p><strong>“So what? I am a foreigner.”</strong></p>
              <p>PAP leaders have been reassuring Singaporeans that foreign workers are brought in only to take up jobs shunned by Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>Is there a shortage of Singapore engineers that we have to recruit them from Vietnam and elsewhere?</p>
              <p>PAP leader strongman Lee Kuan Yew said recently that the PAP will continue to give “priority” to Singaporeans:</p>
              <p><strong>“We have moderated the inflow of foreign workers and new immigrants, and also widened the differentiation between citizens and non-citizens. However, Singapore – with its low birth rates – needs to attract immigrants to augment our population,”</strong> he said.</p>
              <p>He added that the PAP will only recruit foreigners who are educated, professional and skilled to complement the existing workforce.</p>
              <p>Perhaps Pham was brought into Singapore for his other “skills” to boost Singapore’s flagging birth rates rather than his professional skills as an engineer.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>A reader forwarded me this <a href="http://www.contactsingapore.sg/cn/newsroom/?newsid=333"><span style="color: #ff0000;">press release</span></a> from Contact Singapore, announcing that Economic Development Board and the Ministry of Manpower are hiring 250 China engineers this Saturday in Shanghai. Here’s the catch: If don’t read Chinese, too bad for you–the press release is written only in Chinese with no English translation. It is quite obvious that the ad is targeted only at China engineers, and not at Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>My reader wondered why priority was not given to Singaporeans. I think it is a valid question to ask. Can EDB and MOM confirm that no effort was spared in recruiting locally before going to China to recruit?</p>
              <p>Having said that, it is likely that in this case, the companies have had difficulty finding local electrical engineers with those specialised skills (RF IC Design Engineers, Digital Design Engineers). I understand that many more Singaporean students nowadays are choosing not to study engineering in favour of business and finance. (I’m partially guilty–I studied electrical and computer engineering but went straight into IT consulting after graduating, never putting into practice all that digital and circuit design I studied.)</p>
              <p>I feel this situation warrants deeper study. Have we gotten to a point where our employers and the government don’t even bother recruiting local engineers and immediately recruit from overseas? Will this not create a vicious cycle whereby bright Singaporean students avoid studying engineering in university because they know that once they graduate they will have to compete with an onslaught of cheaper foreign engineers? Can we really build up and sustain a knowledge based economy without a core of local scientists and engineers driving it?</p>
              <p>I do not think importing engineers is the long term solution. It is an easy way out for our government and companies. But when these engineers get better positions in the US or back in China, they will up an leave in a jiffy.</p>
              <p>We need to make engineering an attractive career option again, just like it was in my time in school. It is an uphill battle, because careers in the financial industry are almost always going to pay better than what engineers get. Our students must be persuaded to take up engineering if they have a passion for science and technology. It’s not just about money. On the part of the Government, this aggressive recruitment of foreigners has to be tempered, to force companies to look locally before venturing abroad for talent.</p>

Criticism of the country’s foreign worker policy heightened during a recession that began in the third quarter of 2008. Pic: AFP</div>
              <p>WORKING and living conditions for foreign residents in Singapore, long a favoured destination for Myanmar working overseas, seem to be tightening up.</p>
              <p>Earlier this year, the government made changes to the employment and immigration system that make it more difficult to get the documents foreign workers need, including work permits and skills passes.</p>
              <p>The measures include raising the levy firms employing foreigners must pay, demanding better English-language skills for staff in the service sector and charging foreigners and permanent residents higher university tuition fees.</p>
              <p>The Singaporean government has also launched a five-year, S$5.5 billion (US$3.9 billion) project to improve the qualifications of its citizens so they can compete better with foreigners.</p>
              <p>The changes have been introduced in response to public criticism of the ruling People’s Action Party’s (PAP) foreign worker policy. Overcrowding on public transport, tougher competition for jobs and declining incomes are leading some Singaporeans to call for restrictions on the number of foreigners working in the country. A petition called “Employ Singaporeans First” has attracted about 500 signatories, while popular online forums have been flooded with comments largely condemning the influx of foreign workers.</p>
              <p>However, the restrictions affect certain sectors more than others and some Myanmar living in Singapore said they have had no problem finding or changing jobs and getting the necessary permits.</p>
              <p>“A friend of my wife got an accountancy job recently, and got an S-Pass too. Two of my friends, civil engineers, changed their jobs last month. They say it’s hard for foreigners to get a job, but some seem to manage. Maybe it’s a matter of luck,” said Ko Aung Aung Tun, an electrical power engineer.</p>
              <p>“But the rules for granting PR (Permanent Resident) status are much stricter than before. Now you need to pass an exam on Singapore history and culture.”</p>
              <p>Official statistics show more than 35 percent of Singapore’s population of almost five million are foreigners. This group includes 533,220 foreigners with Permanent Resident status and a further 1.25 million holding a work permit, skills pass (also known as an S-Pass), employment pass or similar.</p>
              <p>It is believed as many as 100,000 of these could be from Myanmar, while many more come from Bangladesh, India, China and the Philippines.</p>
              <p>Online forums have become a popular place for disenchanted Singaporeans – who say their concerns are not reflected in mainstream media, which is effectively muzzled by the PAP – to vent their frustrations. They point the finger at foreigners and the government for reduced job opportunities, declining wages and a perceived loss of national identity.</p>
              <p>“The average wage is enough for foreign workers who come alone from developing countries, but not for citizens who have a family to support,” posted one Singaporean on The Temasek Review, an independent news and comment site.<br>Singaporeans are also disappointed and frustrated with rising house prices, difficulties dealing with foreign workers in the service sector, having to share services, such as public transport, government schools and public housing, and bad behaviour attributed to foreigners, such as spitting and littering.</p>
              <p>Myanmar workers said the local anger at foreigners is largely confined to the online sphere.<br>“I see some furious posts by Singaporeans online, but my own everyday experience has not changed,” said Ko Phyo Tun Oo, an engineer who has lived in Singapore for three years.</p>
              <p>“Personally, I never encounter or hear of bad situations or reactions from locals,” said Ma Chit Myo Aye, an IT analyst at a logistics company.</p>
              <p>In the past, the government has justified its foreign worker policy by pointing to the country’s declining birth rate, arguing that Singaporeans will ultimately pay the price if the population does not continue to grow.</p>
              <p>According to the Wall Street Journal, between 2005 and 2009, Singapore’s population surged by roughly 150,000 people a year, with at least 75pc of the growth due to foreigners.</p>
              <p>And while citizens complain about reduced job opportunities, some employers argue that locals are choosy and often lack the social and communication skills required in the service sector. Lower-paid workers also help to improve profits for Singapore’s small and medium enterprises.</p>
              <p>“[Singapore] citizens don’t want to work in tiring and time-consuming jobs like construction,” said Ko Aung Aung Tun. “They know that their country needs qualified foreign workers. Meanwhile, citizens have to compete with foreigners for Skills Pass jobs in administration, account-ancy and IT, while employers are happy to hire foreigners for a salary of S$1400 ($1020) where locals would demand S$2500 ($1820) for the same job.</p>
              <p>“Foreigners seldom complain about having to do overtime, but locals don’t want to,” he said.</p>
              <p>Economists say the negative views about foreign workers gained momentum during a severe economic slump that began in the third quarter of 2008, when trade-reliant Singapore became the first Asian economy to slip into recession.</p>
              <p>“Singaporeans import large numbers of foreigners to take jobs they don’t want to do themselves. When the economy takes a downturn, employers prefer foreigners in many respects. That’s why locals are unemployed and have a negative view about foreigners,” said engineer Ko Phyo Tun Oo.</p>
              <p>While the government is standing by its position that foreigners are needed to maintain population growth, officials last year began publicly acknowledg-ing that the interests and concerns of citizens also need to be addressed.</p>
              <p>In January, Singapore’s founding leader, Lee Kuan Yew told The Straits Times that Singapore had “grown in the last five years by just importing labour” and the government planned to scale back the country’s dependency on foreign workers over the next five years.</p>
              <p>“Now, the people feel uncomfortable, there are too many foreigners,” said Mr Lee, who advises the cabinet of his son, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong. “Trains are overcrowded with foreigners, buses too, property prices have gone up because foreigners with permanent residence are buying into the market.”</p>
              <p>“The answer is simple: We check the flow of foreigners, raise your productivity, do the job better, so that instead of two workers, eventually you’ll do it with one worker, like the Japanese do.”</p>
              <p>With an election due by 2012, analysts say the recent moves by the PAP government are designed to create the perception that it is listening to and acting on the concerns of Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>Political commentator Seah Chiang Nee told news agency AFP: “I think it is shaping up to be one of the hottest issues in Singapore today.”</p>
              <p>AFP quoted economist Song Seng Wun of CIMB-GK Research as saying that apart from helping local companies rise up the value chain, the new measures would also address potential election issues.</p>
              <p>“The government has to be seen to be doing something in areas that are potential flashpoints,” Song said.<br>Ko Aung Aung Tun said he expected the PAP, which won every seat at the 2006 election and has ruled the country since independence, would continue to make life difficult for foreign workers until after the election.</p>
              <p>“Many people think the government will stay tough on the foreign labour issue until the election is over,” he said.<br>Until then, Myanmar workers say they plan to keep their head down and try not to create any trouble that will attract the attention of policymakers.</p>
              <p>A Myanmar technician who has been living in Singapore for more than 20 years said: “This is about the election. Besides, when you live in a foreign country you should avoid doing things that may cause the extra or unnecessary problems with the locals.”</p>
              <p>“As long as you are living and working here, you should fit in with the country’s policies and try your best to survive here,” agreed Ma Chit Myo Aye.</p>

              <p>Dear TR,</p>
              <p>Thanks for publishing the article by Ms Judy Eng. (read article <a href="http://www.temasekreview.com/2010/03/22/a-young-singaporean-expressed-her-worries-at-a-gloomy-and-uncertain-future/"><span style="color: #004080;">here</span></a>) It really strikes a chord in my heart as I am in the same situation as her too. I am 28 this year now working as a teacher in a secondary school.</p>
              <p>My fiancee just found a job in a GLC as an engineer after six months of looking for one. The pay isn’t fantastic as there is an abundance of foreign engineers in Singapore. He considered himself lucky to finally secure a full-time job after months of being on contract.</p>
              <p>We are planning to get married in July and just bought a 4-room resale flat at Sin Ming. Guess how much it costs? You won’t believe it, we bought it at almost $500,000. No kidding, it’s true! All the flats in the vicinity cost above $500K. After paying about $30,000 in COV partially paid for by our parents, we do not have a single cent left for our wedding which we will have a simple afternoon tea buffet at our church instead of the traditional 8-course Chinese dinner.</p>
              <p>I am really worried about our future. We earn barely $5,000 together and the mortgage loan already took up 30 percent of our income. We still have to cough out some cash after using up the entire CPFs. The moment I think of this, I lost all the mood already.</p>
              <p>People used to say that marriage is the happiest moment in a girl’s life, but I am not looking forward to it. I feel very heavy, like a burden placeed on my chest, sometimes choking me, it is so suffocating. Can we buy a new flat? I do not  wish to wait for another 3 to 4 years, anything can happen to our relationship during this period of time. It is a risk I cannot afford to take.</p>
              <p>My hubby-to-be is burnt out everyday from work – OT, OT and OT and he is not paid for it. For me, my weekends are either burnt in school CCAs or marking the homeworks of my students. We hardly meet each other at all, sometimes just enough time to have a meal or catch a movie. Somehow I feel apprehensive startinig life together with  another person, am I ready for it? I don’t think we can start a family, at least for the next three years or so. How to have children when we are not financially stable?</p>
              <p>I will pay the loan mostly on my own as my hubby still have to pay for his student loan and car loan. I have only a few thousand dollars in my savings now and I  wonder how long they can last me. What happens when there is an emergency? Or if we are retrenched? I dread to think of the worst…but women being women, they always think alot.</p>
              <p>Every month, my pay gets used up almost immediately after it’s deposited into my POSB account – living expenses, allowances for parents, and now with housing loan, I  really don’t know how far we can continue like this. Did we do our Maths before we make the purchase? Yes, but what can we do, the flats are expensive everywhere and we want to stay near our parents. Even 4-room flats in Jurong are calling above $400,000 nowadays! The prices are really going crazy, the agents told us that they will only go up in the future as the govt will never allow them to come down.</p>
              <p>Sorry for the ramblings. There are so many things on my mind now, I can’t think or type clearly…..Thanks for providing me an outlet to vent my frustrations, who can understand what we are going through? Sigh, maybe I am one of those few unlucky souls.</p>
