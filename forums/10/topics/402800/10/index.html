              <p>problem from eagle:</p>
              <p>I'm the one who direct commands to operators to push the products in for production, and I'm directly involved in the production and reliability of the products globally. <img src="http://www.sgforums.com/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"><br>A gal wearing miniskirt can do what I do? Of course, because my job is one that needs much much more brains than brawn.</p>
              <p>answer:not a big deal...people dun wanna werk so u need to push them as in a slave driver...no skills needed.even a durian seller can do yer job.u are involve in production and reliability???u mean u stand around watching the engineers do all the werk n u say its ok or not ok.....they have computers to tell boss that u know!yer job is so "valued"its listed as unknown in most countries!whi are u trying to bluff here???u must think im stupider than u or something.if u dun program the robotics..then ya nuthin in any company.......u just need to drink more coffee with the boss or the directors like me more often.......but then i would find people like u tiresome cuz u dun come with a pair of great legs....pretty soon i will hand u an email telling u yer service with the company has been terminated cuz theres a chiobu waiting to take yer place.and she has a degree.</p>
              <p>ans:its not brains. ...its more like plannin that any sane person can do...that kinda job most people can do with no education.</p>
              <p>only the best and able are able to immigrate and stay there in usa and oz forever...folks like u are bums and an option to any organisation......im the one who scolds the production supervisor and the operators.damn eagle knows next to nuths about production... .u are really lucky im not in spore...i would have thrown u down from factory if u failed in yer duties.over in my spore place supervisors are expected to solve machine problems as well as production figures and production operators.if u only handle one job then u must be sucking lotsa people in yer company.i dun think that skill is recognised anywhere except in angel7030s company.....do u werk fer her??sounds like u werk in her place.:)heng ah..i got out in time...otherwise i need to depend on lazy n stupid people like eagle or soul rag.</p>
              <p>if im stupid then yer stupid spore economy depended on it ....not a million but half a billion bucks!</p>
              <p>who the fuck cares about soul rags boss.im not him and who cares unlless u intend to be his cocksucker.</p>
              <p>really ......folks like u cant even immigrate to indonesia or usa let alone talk about my life in oz.how oz treats me is up to their government and politicians.if u are not even half an australian and not even part of the political system then shut your mouth...put it into  soul rags boss dick instead where it shuld belong!</p>

              <p>anyway spore didnt have anything for me after being there for decades.its so empty salarywise even those indian and china workers from spore shipyards ,high tech industries also left spore n went to australia.and their countrymen and political parties hail them and help them.never once uttering traitor or sissy or sending them to half a national service.</p>
              <p>in that respect the people of spore are also to be partly to be blamed for being................unconscious all the while...they might as well be brain dead and be in a coma and only wake up on retirement day discovering only nickles n dimes in retirement accounts.</p>
              <p>as immigration has tightened up in most cuntries n only ones opening up slightly is nz....outcome for most sporeans is dim if they continue their present course.they cant fight in spore...chances are they cant fight overseas either against wilder n much violent people.</p>
              <p>u need people who can reason logically...those who are serious and objective to see where it will all end up in spore.how much is the fixed deposit interests in spore banks&gt;&gt;is it 7%/year??can u take it out every month?is the salary even enough to buy a car n house??how about a coffin n some poison?can u go against a sea of stupid people who insist people shpuld werk  onlyfor food,water,poison n shelter ???</p>
              <p>and why they calling people names such as traitor??so funny...lky werked fir the japanese back in ww2...maybe this eagle kid should call him a traitor too.but folks like him are too scared shitless and the majority of sporeans havent balls to really go fight it all the way like a true warrior.sooner or later i will be thru fighting yer battles in spore from overseas for salary to jobs and will end up getting folks n kids like soul rag n eagle look after yer future to their selfish benefit.</p>
              <p>if u all wont fightb for yer future................and you dont want to survive............then let the politicians like eagle and soul rag run yer retirement in hell for u.i would sooner or later force myself to forget i was ever sporean and it was all a bad dream.....but remeber...im no longer in spore and my future n path dont lie there anymore.</p>

              <p><a href="http://i829.photobucket.com/albums/zz217/phishy_/NS.jpg?t=1265470427"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://i829.photobucket.com/albums/zz217/phishy_/NS.jpg?t=1265470427" alt="" width="425" height="236"></a>Being Singaporean means experiencing a lot of things. Good food. High prices. SPGs. It also means constantly receiving some excellent reasons for why things are; reasons that may or may not (mostly not) justify fallacies in the current political system. I’m sure we’ve all heard some amazingly creative comments and justifications for shortcomings in our society, most of which have been provided by the beloved leaders of our country. Just recently, I was subjected to a talk during my reservist training in which the speaker, whom I shall address as Mr X, provided some interesting viewpoints.</p>
              <p>Mr X is eloquent, intelligent and charming. In fact, he manages, within the first five minutes, to capture the undivided attention of the room, and it remains that way for a good hour. How he does this is simple. First, he makes it clear that he understands the predicament of everyone in the room. Complete with hand gestures, a passionate tone and a slightly higher volume than normal, he questions the intelligence of those who put us in the room. Next, he likens himself to the group –working men pulled out of their busy schedules by a higher power to attend unnecessary activities. That one garners him even more support from the group. Finally, he tells the group that instead of having a normal presentation, he is going to make it a discussion, just so that it’s more interesting for us. That completes the group’s transformation. They are now relatively contented, wide awake and ready to debate, when before it was mostly a propensity to swear.</p>
              <p>Now, Mr X is ready to serve up the main course. He asks the group if there is anything they are unhappy with as Singaporeans.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ERP Gantries</span></p>
              <p>The issue is raised by one of the guys, who says he disagrees with the government’s decision to increase the number of Electronic Road Pricing (ERP) gantries. The opinion is echoed around the room. Some say it isn’t fair that they have to pass through the gantries several times.</p>
              <p>Mr X’s response: The ERP gantries help regulate the flow of traffic. They are there to discourage Singaporeans from driving so that the roads will stay clear. Public transport in Singapore is efficient enough to provide alternative means of travelling. He then compares the prices to the London Congestion Charge (£8 a day) and tells us how much better we have it here.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">National Service</span></p>
              <p>The inevitable question surfaces relatively early. Why are Singaporean men subjected to National Service? Is conscription really necessary?</p>
              <p>Mr X uses a brilliant lock analogy to justify the necessity of National Service. He asks us if we lock our front doors when we go to sleep at night.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>“If you don’t lock your doors, you might wake up at 3am to find someone pushing your plasma TV out the door. If you ask him why he’s doing that, he’ll tell you it’s because your door was open.”</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>He then explains the analogy: Everyone serving national service, including those who are Operationally Ready NS men, are considered the country’s lock. We are the guys who lockdown the nation so that the rest of the population feel safe enough go to sleep.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Foreigners</span></p>
              <p>Mr X brings up this next point himself, which implies that he had prepared himself thoroughly for such a question. Why are there so many foreigners in the country? Why do we need to import so many of them?</p>
              <p>Singapore is targeting a population of six million, so as to ensure that the country maintains a progressive long-term economic order. Everything sounds right. Then, Mr X begins his tirade.</p>
              <p>First, he questions if it is wise that Singaporeans are refusing to have more than one child, if any at all. He is backed up by statistics which show that Singapore has one of the lowest fertility rates in the world; about 1.25 per resident female compared to about three in the 1970s. He wants to know if we will remain economically stable if our population dips to three million. That is the reason, he claims, why the government is importing foreigners: Because Singaporeans refuse to help solve the problem.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>“At the rate we’re going, in about a hundred years’ time, Singaporeans may not even exist anymore. By then, the only place you can see one is in a museum!”</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>He continues by saying that Singaporeans are feeling threatened, and uses the reactions of Singaporeans towards news of our top PSLE student being a Chinese import as an example. He talks about how foreigners working as sales personnel in local malls have better attitudes that their local counterparts. He emphasizes that Singaporeans were all children of immigrants anyway, and so why shouldn’t we welcome foreigners?</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Corruption</span></p>
              <p>By now Mr X has stopped taking questions. He begins talking about how the Singapore government has done such a good job resisting the lures of corruption. Despite my best efforts, he didn’t hear me snigger. He then asks if it is possible that the government will one day succumb to temptation. Raising, as an example, the rise of the Philippines as one of the world’s top trading centres and their fall from grace, leading to women coming to Singapore to work as maids, he asks if our women might suffer that very same fate one day.</p>
              <p>He ends his talk with two stories. The first is about an Australian family he encountered while on holiday. After a barbeque, the Australian family replaced the charcoal before driving off. Mr X emphasizes that although there was a sign telling users to do so, there was no one around to enforce the rule. But they did it anyway. Subsequently, he drives into a small town where he sees a table full of fresh fruit with no one manning it. He notices a tin labeled ‘50 cents’, and says that there is no way something like this could ever happen in Singapore.</p>
              <p>The second is about an incident he observed while in a local supermarket. After finishing a food sample given to her by promoters, a young girl was instructed by her grandmother to throw the toothpick on the floor. According to him, Singaporeans have been spoon-fed by the government so much that we now expect them to clean up after us.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>“Throw it away and the government will send someone to clean it up.”</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>He adds that there isn’t a strong sense of community and trust in Singapore, and finishes off by saying that it is up to us, and not the government, to be civic-minded.</p>
              <p>Later, I discover that Mr X served as an Army regular for 30 years, before setting up his own company to provide leadership programmes and “National Education” talks to various organizations. His clients include the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports, Ministry of Defence and the Singapore Civil Defence Force. Explains a lot doesn’t it?</p>
              <p>The condescending manner in which Mr X delivers his points suggests that he considers the men in the room to be intellectually inferior to him, thus rendering them incapable of making their own decisions and opinions about their own country. Visualize a kindergarten teacher talking to her students about evolution and you’ll get an accurate picture. Besides being a complete waste of time, it is an immense insult to our intelligence.</p>
              <p>The question remains though: Why us? Is the whole thing an elaborate set-up manufactured to exploit whatever feelings of patriotism an In-Camp Training session may incite? Are we easy targets because we are old enough to vote and young enough to be considered easily influenced? Or is reservist training more about feeding us false information and justifications, than making sure we maintain our physical fitness?</p>
              <p>Mr X epitomizes everything the government is: intelligent, cunning, articulate, and committed to the cause. The question is whether we have what it takes to identify their methods. Judging from the reactions of the other men in the room as they trek off to lunch, it seems like we have some way to go.</p>

              <div class="art-PostContent">
              <p><strong>Written by Our Correspondent</strong></p>
              <p>In yet another sign that young Singaporeans are getting increasingly impatient and frustrated with some policies of the ruling party, a PAP MP Alvin Yeo was lobbied relentlessly with tough and sensitive questions during a policy forum held at NUS on 26 January 2010. (read the field report <a href="http://www.temasekreview.com/2010/01/29/policy-face-off-immigration-policies-how-many-is-enough/"><span style="color: #6d7e7e;">here</span></a>)</p>
              <p>Mr Yeo was one of the panel speakers. The other two were Sylvia Lim from Workers’ Party and Dr Leong Chan Hoong from the Institute of Policy Studies. The title of the Forum is – “Immigration policies – how many is enough?”</p>
              <p>Due to the ruling party’s liberal immigration policies, foreigners now make up 36 per cent of the Singapore’s population, up from 14 per cent in 1990. Of the remaining 64 per cent who are citizens, an increasing proportion are new citizens born overseas.</p>
              <p>Until recently, PAP leaders had been defending the policy vigorously on the grounds that foreigners are “essential” for Singapore, a point highlighted repeated by Mr Yeo in his presentation in which he justified the PAP’s pro-foreigner” policies as for the “collective good of society.”</p>
              <p>When asked by a NUS student during the Question-and-Answer session on why foreigners who take up Singapore citizenship are exempted from the mandatory two years National Service which all Singapore-born males have to go through, he shot back:</p>
              <p><em>“They are here to work and contribute economically, and if we make foreigners serve 2.5 years of National Service, who would want to come here? They will leave!”</em></p>
              <p>On foreigners competing with Singaporeans for limited jobs, Mr Yeo repeated his party’s stance that it will not shield Singaporeans from competition as it is “good” for them:</p>
              <p><em>“I don’t think we should protect Singaporeans from global competition because this is what happens in the outside world. Global competition is good for Singaporeans because it makes them work harder and think harder to succeed.”</em></p>
              <p>Unfortunately, quite a number of foreigners working in Singapore are here not because they are more skilled than locals, but because they cost much less than them.</p>
              <p>While foreign workers were only employed in sectors shunned by Singaporeans in the past, they are found now increasingly across all industries thereby competing directly with Singaporeans for jobs.</p>
              <p>To exacerbate the situation, they are given PRs liberally by the ruling party, thereby increasing their “attractiveness” to employers.</p>
              <p>According to the Home Affairs Ministry, two out of every three PR applicants are successful, some of whom are cleaners, construction workers, masseurs and even prostitutes.</p>
              <p>Based on unconfirmed tip-off from readers, some foreigners are given Singapore PRs via immigration agencies even though they may not have stepped foot on Singapore itself.</p>
              <p>The high growth rate of Singapore’s economy in recent years is fueled largely by the influx of cheap foreign labor which helps to cut business costs and increase GDP as a result.</p>
              <p>A significant proportion of the PAP ministers’ multi-million annual salary is based on GDP growth – the higher the growth, the more money they take home.</p>
              <p>A recent Wall Street Journal editorial reported that the influx of foreigners into Singapore has depressed the wages of ordinary Singaporeans, increased the cost of living, especially that of public housing, decreased labor productivity and led to an overall decline in standards of living. (read article <a href="http://www.temasekreview.com/2010/01/14/wsj-singapores-expat-surge-fuels-economic-fears/comment-page-1/"><span style="color: #ab6f07;">here</span></a>)</p>
              <p>Mr Yeo made the headlines last month by paying an eye-popping $6.5 million dollars for a 2,680 sq ft four-bedroom unit at luxurious condominium Marina Bay Suites with his wife. (read article <a href="http://www.temasekreview.com/2009/12/09/pap-mp-and-mcys-perm-sec-bought-units-at-luxury-condo-marina-bay-suites/"><span style="color: #ab6f07;">here</span></a>)</p>
              <p>Singapore’s ministers are the highest paid in the world. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong earns about $3 million dollars yearly, or more than 5 times the annual salary of U.S. President Barack Obama.</p>
