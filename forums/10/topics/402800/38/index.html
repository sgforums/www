              <span class="left"><a title="Posts by Andrew Loh" href="http://theonlinecitizen.com/author/admin/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Andrew Loh</span></span></a> on November 9, 2009</span></div>
              <p></p>
              <div class="entry">
              <div>
              <p><strong>The following is an excerpt from the <a href="http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2009/11/whats_really_ro.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #810081;">Econlog</span></span></a></strong></p>
              <p><em>Professor Bryan Caplan clarifies he is not a PAP apologist</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <img src="http://i907.photobucket.com/albums/ac277/dytan/singapore-night-scene.jpg" alt="">
              <p> </p>
              <p>Still, lest I be mistaken for a PAP apologist, this is a great time to air Singapore’s<em>real</em> dirty laundry. The Singaporean government has many disgraceful policies. My top picks:</p>
              <p>1. <a href="http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2008/01/singapore_the_d.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Conscription</span></span></a>. Though they laughed at me in Singapore, this is clearly state slavery – and there are plenty of less draconian means to defend the city-state from conquest. (Like… paying soldiers market wages). Only a <a href="http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2007/06/leaving_the_chu.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">democratic fundamentalist</span></span></a> would imagine that the right to vote is more important than the right to say “No” to a job offer.</p>
              <p>2. The <a href="http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2009/01/the_origin_of_s.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">death penalty for drug trafficking</span></span></a>. Jailing people for capitalist acts between consenting adults is bad enough. Murdering people for selling intoxicants to willing buyers is sheer barbarism.</p>
              <p>3. State ownership. While Singapore’s state-owned companies act surprisingly like capitalist firms, why settle for second-best? And if you needed further empirical evidence that state ownership undermines personal freedom even if it is “run like a business,” take a look at the <em><a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Straits Times</span></span></a> </em>or Singaporean television.</p>
              <p>4. Defamation law. Letting people sue people who badmouth them is <a href="http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2009/02/econlog_book_cl_7.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">bad enough</span></span></a>. But Singapore takes defamation law to its logical, absurd conclusion: You can’t even badmouth government officials unless you can <em>prove </em>that your charges are true. The problem with these laws isn’t that they’re undemocratic – after all, Singapore still allows criticism of <em>policies</em>. The problem is that they violate human freedom. People should be allowed to say what they like about whoever they like, whether or not they can prove it, and whether or not they’re right.</p>
              <p>5. Censorship. The Internet has made Singaporean censorship largely obsolete, but it’s still an outrage that you need the government’s approval to stage a public performance.</p>
              <p>Bottom line: Singapore’s critics have plenty of genuine grievances to denounce. (And under Singaporean law, it’s legal to do so – just don’t get personal!) So why do the critics keep complaining about “lack of democracy” when the real story is that most Singaporeans persistently prefer the PAP to the opposition?</p>

              <br> <br> Jul 14, 2010 
              <br> <br> HOUSTON (Texas)- SINGAPORE can expect the number of foreign workers to 
              increase by at least 100,000 this year in response to the demands of the
               booming economy, said Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.
              <br> <br> Speaking to the Singapore media here on Tuesday as he wrapped up a 
              six-day visit to the United States, Mr Lee said the government had taken
               steps to moderate the number of foreign workers, but a rise was 
              inevitable given the strong growth.
              <br> <br> He added: 'It cannot be helped because with the market so tight, if we 
              don't allow the foreign workers in, you are going to have overheating.
              <br> <br> 'But we are managing the number of foreign workers. Their levies are 
              being calibrated to moderate the inflow.
              <br> <br> 'But even with that, I would imagine there would be more than 100,000 
              extra foreign workers this year. I cannot see it otherwise. We have to 
              accept that.'
              <br> <br> The Ministry of Trade and Industry released fresh economic data and 
              estimates on Wednesday morning showing that Singapore's economy could 
              grow by 13 to 15 per cent this year, up sharply from the earlier 
              forecast of 7 to 9 per cent.</span></p>

              <p><br>I see you ask a question, like a kid. You are supposed to have engineering experience for decades, and you still haven't grown up.</p>
              <p>Sorry I still say you are not an engineer, just as a medical orderly who does surgery, or a nurse who prescribe medicine is still not a doctor.</p>
              <p>You presented a lot of info here about yourself that are slanted and massaged.</p>
              <p>You definitely failed in the yearly assessment for promotion in Singapore because of your lack of qualifications and maturity. This is revealed to all by your rantings here.</p>

              <p>mancha,</p>
              <p>wheres yer picture of u dancing nekkid???thats more important than the engineering stuff ya need from me!!</p>
              <p>a nurse prescribing medication???isnt that some kinda mouth job???as a nurse who wants to be a doctor they should be doing surgery...unless if the doctors skills has been reduced to medication prescription.engineeeering is very much the same as medicine apart on the subject in question.in engineering prescibing drugs or meds would be a storeman job if that storeman is used to 101 problems in a production line,,,actually most engineers,techs,specialist and assistant engineers need to know what parts to describe for faulty parts to surgery equivalent and software calibrations and diagnostics as well.yer term of a nurse able to prescribe drugs is myopic not to mention an easy job as an occupation.all techpeople need to diagnost and fix problems and at the same time design new maschinen and software if needed.</p>
              <p>hmm....are u a nurse.....well if i dont sound like a real deal then thats sad...well..if u want me to show u my engineering skills....u could send me the software and robot components and i will assemble it and program it to whatever u desire.</p>
              <p>i passed my promotion every year and in the past was very harsh to my yearly evaluation.u should hve seen my supervisors cancelling n deleteing here n there.yup....thats how i get promoted,,,just one step to pointing a machinegun at boss head.:)</p>
              <p>im a fake???save yer worthless opinions back for the sporeans in spore or are u just trying to target me overseas  n get kicks out of destroyin me??....i no longer see the need to represent spore for what they gave me in return.</p>
              <p>are u a nurse?????i bet ya would change tables if ya found out i was a white dude earning $100k/year.yes..i know spore nurse...one time i saw a malay nurse or chinese nurse at changi hospital.....she was tending to some white guy living in some c-class ward and seemed to pay more attention than the pther guys....u shoulda seen her...lowering his pillow and taking care of his every needs.meanwhile the rest were not tended to..........so this nurse was taking care of some ang mo dude in a c-class ward like she was his lover....the medical side of things in spore is a farce somewhat and nurses arent allowed to prescribe medication......unlesss its something like panadol...ice water etc....</p>
              <p>not interesting in ass kissin nurse who look down on their own race and kiss ass for other race which they deem as .....superior.very unprofessional</p>
              <p>hey....yer profession is some kinda stripper from yer desciption of engineering and medical tales.</p>

              <p>manchas version of nurse callin herself a doctor------------prescribed medication only but is unable to do any surgery.</p>
              <p>manchas version of an engineer----------------kiss ass and glow in the dark.</p>
              <p>but in reality engineers,assistant engineers n techs ...not only are supposed to prescribe meds in engineering equivalent as small fraction of the job but also perform dignostics n surgery on machines.there are no nurse equivalent in engineering.</p>

              <p>eagle,</p>
              <p>flips the straits times....id un see any pay here being $100,000/year cept a minister job or selling n buying shares.n stocks.</p>
              <p>hmmm....$100k/year before 30 in spore?.......well.... people driver who cant spell  properly are already earnin $100k/year in oz before age 30 and have their own place.in spore ya need a degree or so and probably go thru good schools.....it isnt tough but yer werking way too hard to compete salary with other developed country.</p>
              <p>in the end yer status after goin thru all that not very tough effort yields same result as a truck driver in oz who is often seen scratching the crack on his ass from sitting too  uch on the seat.</p>
              <p>truck driver in oz status= yer degree holder status</p>
              <p>same house,maybe less cars,less kids,less food for u.but what u would get would be more coffee</p>

              <p>$100k p.a. per person???</p>
              <p>I got my source from wiki that the <strong>median</strong> household income in Australia in AUD$66820. I don't see $100k leh.</p>
              <p><br>From Oz stat board, average income is about A$1.3k per month, which is about $5.2k per month, or $104k p.a. if we have <strong>12 months with<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> 8 months</span> worth of bonus</strong>. At $104k p.a., tax amount is about $25.45k. Effective salary about $80k.</p>
              <p>In Singapore, if you earn $80k p.a., your tax is $4.3k, which means effective is about $75k.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyway, termie, how are you able to flip the straits times over in Oz???? Or do you mean the times when you were still here?</p>

              <p>Terminator your rantings are absurd.</p>
              <p>You are not an engineer. This is a fact. By your own admission you are a production line technician, at most a production supervisor, working with asst engineers and engineers.</p>
              <p>You cannot even grasp the analogy of the medical orderly and the nurse. They are not doctors. They can con the uninitiated with their knowledge that they are doctors, just like you con us here. So no need to prove you are an engineer, you are not.</p>
              <p>With your mentality not even being able to comprehend simple English, how can you be an engineer. Further more you claim that you have been an engineer for decades. Decades is in plural, that means minimum 20 years. After vocational school plus 20 years that would put you in the late thirties, or about 40. Are you a 40 yo man, or a punk? Something is not right, you are not telling the truth.</p>
              <p>You write like a troll, think like a punk, can't comprehend English, but claim to be an engineer with decades of experience. How to believe you?</p>
              <p>You write like an indian, express yourself like an indian. Must be that indian national from Singapore that influenced you alot, maybe he passed you his DNA while horsing around with you. Since you deny you are an indian, let it be.</p>
              <p>Back to why you cannot be not an engineer. You can even be sure of my gender. A grown up engineer would have no problem reading posts and decide if the writer is male or female. Seem you have a problem, that because you have yet to grow up.</p>
              <p>Anyway in cyber space whether you are indian or not, I am a nurse or not does not matter. But the fact remains that you cannot be an engineer because you do not add up to an engineer. Your rantings and complains against Singapore has no merit. You failed yourself and is putting the blame on the government.</p>
              <p>So here I go again, You are a fake.</p>

              <p>dear mancha,</p>
              <p>im not n indian....u wished i had indian dna???what??an indian dna dick is bigger than  a chinese dna dick????did you take a look when you were hard at werk ?</p>
              <p>im an engineer,,,are you an engineer?folks like u accusing and not digesting  the one page of job info i gave shouldnt be in spore....U SHOULD BE IN LAOS TENDING TO YER PADI FIELDS!</p>
              <p>i suppose u think engineers n inventors are dull people who cant think actively with a kid like passion.the best are always very active n think like kids.U VERY WELL JUST WANTED ENGINEERS TO THINK LIKE RICE FARMERS!!HAHAHA</p>
              <p>eh????u counting my age......well.....i started studyin enginnering at age 17 but i went into it since i started walking n kindergarthen without knowing it.......so its a lifelong thing.</p>
              <p>an engineer cant tell yer sex over the internet .........thats not n engineer job....too lazy to ascroll n check...all i see is a dog.well....u do sound very much like a girl..</p>
              <p>eh??i cant add up???well as i have told u the americans,europeans  accepted me as n engineer.....u must be better than the americans!i bet ya able to build aircrafts ,complex machines n space shuttles by yerself if u can judge who can n will be an engineer.</p>
              <p>actuakly.....u sound like a person about to lose job in spore...or dun seem to have much of any use in  industries in spore.</p>
              <p>i still have no idea what u forcing on me.....if im a fake,,,,,,then u must be a bad story teller.so far i havent seen anyone here giving u unbiased support.besides yer reasons are sooo LAME.</p>
              <p>FACE IT.....MOST ENGINEERS ARE WAY OFF WERSE THAN ME.....EITHER U ACCEPT IT OR GO FLY A KITE.</p>
              <p>YER MAIN GOAL HERE IS TO:</p>
              <p>1)ENSURE I WAS NOT SOMEONE HARWERKIN N HONEST IN SPORE</p>
              <p>2)I AM AN INDIAN FOR GOD KNOWS WAT PURPOSE</p>
              <p>3)DESTROY ME FROM 1 N 2</p>
              <p>u have so far tried forcing yer thoughts on me which is illogical....i could have said i was a doctor in that case instead of n engineer.but then why be an engineer when ya could be like bill gates,einstein ,tesla,edison or steven spielberg</p>
