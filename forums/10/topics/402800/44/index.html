              <p><strong>Ex-ISD Director Yoong Siew Wah: </strong><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Verdana, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: normal; font-size: 16.6667px; color: #333333;"><a style="color: #333333; text-decoration: none;" href="http://singaporerecalcitrant.blogspot.com/2010/07/redeeming-feature-of-pap-government.html"><strong>A Redeeming Feature of the PAP Government</strong></a></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Verdana, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 27px; font-size: 12.5px; color: #333333;">
              </span></p><div><span style="line-height: 27px; font-size: 12.5px;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">As outraged netizens it is quite natural to vent our wraths on the arrogant PAP government from time to time for the innumerable injustices by it.</span></strong> It is equally natural for the government to promote an international benevolent feature in order to divert some of the local broadsides. </span></div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div><span style="line-height: 27px; font-size: 12.5px;">It is for its political capital that it is doing this but this should not detract from the immense succours that disaster victims received, especially in the case of colossal natural disasters such as a tsunami.<br><br>The Meulaboh tsunami disaster in December 2004 presented the PAP government with a golden opportunity to show to the world its readiness and benevolent prowess in rising to the humanitarian occasion promptly. Meulaboh was a sleepy Acehnese town in Indonesia and the tsunami destructions were so widespread and devastating that they were beyond belief. The number of lives lost was inestimable.<br><br>Team Singapore was the first to descend on the devastated town, before other foreign governments and non-governmental organisations (NGO), and began the agonising task of rescuing the survivors and resettling them. After that came the laborious and lengthy task of rebuilding and rehabilitation. </span></div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div><span style="line-height: 27px; font-size: 12.5px;">That Team Singapore has persevered relentlessly since the start of the disaster in Decembver 2004 till now in its noble task of rebuilding and rehabilitation showed its sterling quality and determination which in turn reflected on the international acclaims to the PAP government. The tsuname disaster in Aceh with its subsequent rebuilding and rehabitation can indeed be said to be a showcase of the PAP government's humanitarianism. The colossal devastation of the tsunami disaster had shocked a normally placid world and the PAP government's heroic role in rescue, rebuilding and rehabilitation could not but elicited a show of respectful gratitude from an amazed world.<br><br>Here is the irony of it. It is all very well for the PAP government to promote an international humane image. When it comes to the local scene, it shows it is not so benign in its ruthlessness in dealing with the opposition parties and those who are not so sparing in their vitriolic criticisms of the government. Maybe it is in its mental make-up that it finds it antipathic to show the same kind of justice and fairness universally as in its international image projection.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Prime Minister's and ministers' silence on major public occurrences and happenings is not going to endear the government to the public, not to mention losing public confidence.</span></strong></span></div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div><span style="line-height: 27px; font-size: 12.5px;"> The recent SMRT Changi depot security lapse and the Orchard Road deluge are only two cases in point. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Then there is the question of a fair general election but the general expectation is that there will be gerrymandering when electoral boundaries are drawn up, obviously not to the advantage of opposition parties contesting the election. </span></strong></span></div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div><span style="line-height: 27px; font-size: 12.5px;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Of course, it will be a godsend if the PAP government can show a little more fairness and justice but is this not analogous to wishing for the pie in the sky?</span></strong></span></div>

We are always the first on the retrenchment list. Is this good in the long run?<br><br>I will like to suggest that we impose a significant increase in PR, FW, FT levies. i.e. Instead of allowing companies in employing anyone they like, Singapore must impose additional levies on the above mentioned groups.<br><br>As there are approximately 1 million to 1.43 millions PRs in Singapore, if we increase the levies of each PR, FT by minimum 1K for each PR employed, companies will have to think twice before employing FT as the cost to employ them would be significantly higher.<br><br>However, such increase in levies which increase the government's coffer cannot be used to justify for Ministers' pay raise. Instead, this levies must be used to create jobs for the locally born Singaporeans.<br><br>At present, I see lots of unemployed and underemployed Singaporeans. We need to bring food for the family.<br><br>If we do not help the local community, all the locally born Singaporeans will be in trouble. I strongly believe we need alternatives in the Parliament before those who shake legs collect all their pays and preparing to flee the country anytime from now.<br><br>Please kindly help as the situation is really bad now among the locally born Singaporeans.<br><br>Please help. Please. This is a distress call.<br><br>SINGAPOREAN</span></p>

              <div><span style="line-height: 24px; font-size: 11.8056px;">SDP,<br><br>As a new citizen, I am deeply hurt and ashamed that other countries and their diplomats are not taking our government and laws seriously. Consider these facts (I will start alphabetically):<br><br>1. <strong>China:</strong> Singapore has spent billions in assisting China in the Suzhou industrial park and training Chinese public officials in Singapore. But China repays us by pointedly leaving Singapore out of the 2008 Beijing Olympics Torch Relay. A stingling slap that resulted in the PM, Ministers and officials (Vivian, Teo Ser Luck, Ng Ser Miang) rushing to save face by hosting the YOG 2010 which cost tax-payers minillions of dollars. Now efforts are needed to generate buzz to galvanise excitment among the people for YOG. By the way, Singapore with its extremely humid and hot weather, will need to brace itself for brickbats from athletes from temperate countries who can't take the heat in August. Did our PM, Ministers and officials consider this before rushing to host the YOG?<br><br>2. <strong>Indonesia:</strong> When the Tsunami struck Aceh, Singapore took the opportunity to curry favour with Indonesia by rendering assistance, etc. Indonesia repays us by banning export of ssand to Singapore thus hampering Singapore construction activities. Another slap in the face! What has MFA got to say about this?<br><br>3. <strong>Romania:</strong> It appears that even Eastern European nations like Romanis holds Singapore government in low regards. To date, the Romanian government has yet to repatriate the diplomat who killed a Singapore PR and injured two Singapore citizens in a car crash. Is the governemtn hoping that this whole matter be blown away and forgotten? MFA has still not informed the nation what steps have taken to prevent repeat of such tragic incident.<br><br>4. <strong>Saudi Arabia</strong>: Recently, a Saudidiplomat beat up a Singapore citizen after he told the diplomat that he has parked his car at a lot meant for the handicapped. this shows how little respect foreign diplomats have for Singaporrre  laws. I am sure this case will be quietly squashed as Saudi Arabia is an oil rich nation which Singapore can ill-afford to offend. Everything will  be swept under the carpet.<br><br>Finally, my wife and I are wondering whether we have made the right decision in taking up Singapore citizenship, as we are embarrassed by the callous attitude towards this nation by other countries.<br><br>LIM</span></div>
