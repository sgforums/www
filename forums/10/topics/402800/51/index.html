              <p>Tibetan Monks are using Remote Viewing to predict the future. Between now and 2012 the world super powers will continue to engage in regional wars. Terrorism and covert war will be the main problem. In world politics something will happen in and around 2010. At that time the world powers will threaten to destroy each other. Between 2010 and 2012, the whole world will get polarized and prepare for the ultimate dooms day. Heavy political maneuvers and negotiations will take place with little progress. In 2012, the world will start plunging into a total destructive nuclear war. And at that time something remarkable will happen, says, Buddhist monk of Tibet. Supernatural divine powers will intervene. The destiny of the world is not to self-destruct at this time.</p>
              <p>Scientific interpretation of the monks’ statements makes it evident that the Extra Terrestrial powers are watching us every step of the way. They will intervene in 2012 and save the world from self-destruction.</p>

              <p>The year in question begins in a fantastic way, and let the force be with you. This might be one of the most outstanding coming years. The "final truth" is coming from far away.</p>
              <p>2007 is the year of prophecy at its very best</p>
              <p>The veil of lies will be lifted and the truth - nothing but the truth and the full truth - will be seen.</p>
              <p>As 2007 draws to its close on 12/12, a once in a millennium (understatement) alignment occurs: Excessive net worker Jupiter triggers Pluto, overlord of trans-formation and super avatar of change in the point known as the 'galactic center'. This can only mean space time travel, and things transcendental. I expect a new cosmology to manifest at that time, more inter-stellar type mathematics of time, and I look forward to a creed of justice and a belief in the zero point field called GOD. Labels of 'religions' will most definitely have no more space in considerations of true high level studies of the love of perennial wisdom - 'wisdom's love' being in Greek called 'philo-sophy'.</p>
              <p><a name="2008"></a></p>
              <h3><span class="editsection">[<a title="Edit section: 2008" href="http://www.sgforums.com/index.php?title=Remote_Viewing&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">edit</span></span></a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">2008</span></h3>
              <p>2008 is a new beginning - a ONE and an earthy energy type of year at that - with Jupiter &amp; Pluto in Capricorn (ruled by Saturn), and Saturn in Virgo (ruled by Mercury). Things become more grounded, more 'real'. It is also a year of 'no-nonsense'.</p>
              <p>The USA will see by Summer of 2008 the equivalent of a workers' revolt, or a class war, as the status quo of the plutocracy 'democracy' will be challenged to the very end.</p>
              <p>The structures will begin to crumble and a new society will start to emerge, but only really see the light of day in 2012-2013 when Neptune is in Pisces, assisting Pluto in Capricorn.</p>
              <p>The North Node of Earth's Destiny meets with Neptune at 24 degrees Aquarius in early May and with Chiron a month later, a couple degrees further back, saying the same. That is a spectacular alignment, again one in a millennium.</p>

              <p>The year of the floods... I remind you of the words by the little boy from Mars, Russian born Boriska to a 'Pravda' chronicler in 2004: There will be a catastrophe in 2009 on a continent he could not specify.</p>
              <p>We will start to figure out the invisible world then, as unusual things will start to transpire by the time Mercury, Mars, Jupiter, Chiron, and Neptune meet in Aquarius...</p>
              <p>Mars treks in militant if not military or warlike manner through Capricorn, conjunct the sun and Pluto early 2009, between life and death, giving 2009 a distinct ambitious mode.</p>
              <p>I see 2009 as the year of the aliens</p>
              <p>The year 2009 is also profoundly hopeful, or upbeat with Chiron, Jupiter, and Neptune in humanitarian Aquarius, giving faith for a global or Cosmic one world solution, which will need alien or extra-terrestrial help or intervention, seen or unseen. My impression is that the space ships will make their presence known to us, and urge the world to move toward peaceful solutions.</p>
              <p>However, realistically speaking, the world will be at war, Islam will rise and make its view points known to a world that has for too long treated the Muslims like slaves of the earth.</p>
              <p>There will be the beginning of revolutions seen in 2009.</p>
              <p>It is to be expected that China makes its grand entrance on the chess board of the world players as its natal chart is aspected in ways to propel it into a lead function.</p>
              <p>2009 is also a time of great technological discoveries. Some of them will have a practical meaning for the future, as they could imply free energy and a more democratically accessible distribution of resources.</p>
              <p>The year 2009 is one of practicality, frugality and functionality. All things must make sense on an earthy level. You are well advised to put savings away that can be of use, i.e. tools, gold, and buy fertile lands so you can live of the land.</p>

              <p>2010 begins the transpersonal (Pluto in Capricorn) decade of the cardinal signs, Aries, Cancer, Libra, and Capricorn, because planets Uranus, Jupiter, Saturn and Pluto, and the North &amp; South Nodes position themselves in these signs for years ahead. Cardinal signs have the energy to get things started and going, yet they are not known for moving around the energy too peacefully. Furthermore the planets involved in the longstanding and in some instances many years lasting challenging alignments are very ponderous and shock absorbing, such as Pluto, Saturn, and Uranus - the latter one in fact is known for dishing it out.</p>
              <p>One could say that thusly 2010 is the Alpha-Omega year of transition, where the old will end and the new will begin.</p>
              <p>The visitors will be more and more frequent and they will teach us very advanced things that we had forgotten, because we all tend to discard the fact that we all came from the stars, yet this knowledge will start to become commonplace as we near the moment of the crossing into the 5th world at the end of 2012...</p>
              <p>We are headed for an extra-terrestrial one world management of Peace. But to get there, we will have to clean up the abode earth, and if it means wars, so be it.

              <p>2011 begins with the moon moving from Scorpio to Sagittarius, as it did on the 1999-2000 'Y2K'switch... but on a dose of great optimism, while Jupiter, wise ruler of far seeing Sagittarius moves through the mutable and last degrees of Pisces, conjunct and in tandem with Uranus. There is synchronisation at work as 2011 opens to a new Cosmic reality and people will have to wake up or go to sleep forever as the Matrix veils fall away.</p>
              <p>Neptune-Uranus in mutual reception mean that potentially people will see the invisible world and understand the message from afar.</p>
              <p>We will see in 2011 that an oversoul type first cause, or original source, aka 'God', is linked by an energy or motion, call it time and spirit, to all the little souls on earth where past present and future meet in one great gateway to Cosmos. There will be an upgrading of awareness going on, and whatever happens in the real world, it will be meaningful and suggest a new understanding of very ancient and fragmented wisdom. Major discoveries will be made while Uranus and Jupiter are in Aries, and these breakthroughs will change the future of earthlings for the better.</p>
              <p>2011 is technologically speaking not for fainthearted - and these little aliens will have a say in it too. You can rest assured of it and you want to well prepared mentally and spiritually to see through the "techno-spiritual paradigm" as 2011 become the famous 2012...</p>

              <p>Despite the dubious origins of much data, the CIA and military intelligence decided they should investigate and know as much about it as possible. Various programs were approved yearly and re-funded accordingly.

Work results were reviewed, and remote viewing was demonstrated with the results being kept secret from the "viewer". It was thought that if the viewer was shown they were incorrect it would damage the viewer's confidence and skill. This was standard operating procedure throughout the years of military and domestic remote viewing programs. Feedback of any kind, back to the viewer was very rare. It was kept classified and secret.<sup id="cite_ref-autogenerated3_5-0" class="reference"><a href="http://www.sgforums.com/forums/10/topics/#cite_note-autogenerated3-5"><span style="color: #0645ad;"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></span></a></sup></p>

Upon the closure of the Army's Center Lane remote viewing program, Smith was re-assigned to the Defense Intelligence Agency’s follow-on remote viewing unit, Sun Streak, which later became Star Gate. He was the main author of what is known today as the “CRV Manual”. Its purpose was simply to serve as a guide and a reference for the terminology and it served to show inquisitive lawmakers what the millions of dollars were being spent on.<sup id="cite_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="http://www.sgforums.com/forums/10/topics/#cite_note-30"><span style="color: #0645ad;"><span>[</span>31<span>]</span></span></a></sup> Swann wrote to Smith giving Smith's manual his approval.

              </blockquote>
              <p style="margin: 0px 6px 0px 10px;"><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial;">One day in 1973, Price walked into Hal Puthoff's office, tossed a file on his desk and said,</span></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p style="margin: 0px 6px 0px 10px;"><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial;">'You might be interested in these UFO bases.' </span></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p style="margin: 0px 6px 0px 10px;"><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial;">Price believed that ET's had established four underground bases, had remote viewed them and provided Puthoff with descriptions of their locations and functions. Hal Puthoff, Ph.D., founded and directed the CIA funded Remote Viewing program at SRI from 1972 to 1985. Price, who died under mysterious circumstances in 1975, was believable had a proven RV track record and had neither agenda nor any axe to grind. <br><br>Puthoff passed the same folder on to Atwater in the early '80's, saying,</span></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p style="margin: 0px 6px 0px 10px;"><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial;">'You might be interested in this.' </span></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p style="margin: 0px 6px 0px 10px;"><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial;">At this point, it's important to note that Price's information was viewed without protocols, the results were not officially reported and Price did not use sealed envelopes. <br><br>Price's report stated that the bases primary purpose was to '<em>reinforce B.T.L. implants, transport of new recruits and overall monitoring function</em>.' Today, Atwater has no idea what B.T.L. implants are and to his knowledge, no one has remote viewed this term. <br><br>Price also reported that the base inhabitants looked like us, <em>homosapiens</em>, except for the heart, lungs, blood and eyes. He reported that the sites were highly protected from discovery, mutually supportive, and had very high technology. </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 6px 0px 10px;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 6px 0px 10px;"><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial;">He also noted that they used 'thought transfer for motor control of us.' <br><br><br></span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;"><a name="Mount_Perdido">Mount Perdido</a></span></span><strong><span style="font-size: medium; color: #b50400; font-family: Arial;"> <br></span></strong><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial;">So where are these bases? <br><br>The first is at <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Mt. Perdido</span> is in the Pyrenees Mountains, between France and Spain. </span></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p style="margin: 0px 6px 0px 10px;"><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial;">'A famous set of caves in the Pyrenees have ancient drawings of ancient astronauts and flying spacecraft,' Atwater explained. 'And there have been a number of sightings here.' </span></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p style="margin: 0px 6px 0px 10px;"><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial;">Mt. Perdido, aka Mt. Perdu, is 3,352 m, 11,007 ft. high and is the third highest mountain in the Pyrenees. It's about a quarter inch west of Andorra. Price reported that the main base was protected around a 2-mile perimeter with detectors. Several craft were in the launch recovery area and had what looked like an electromagnetic field propulsion system. <br><br>Price's next underground base location is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Mt. Inyangani</span>, the highest mountain (2,592 m, 8,503 ft) in Zimbabwe, formerly Rhodesia, Africa. </span></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p style="margin: 0px 6px 0px 10px;"><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial;">'Actually, it's more of a maintenance and tech center,' Price viewed. 'This base looks like overhaul and maintenance unit. I see lots of spare equipment. Parts are being welded in a vacuum area with window area then parts are fused. A grayish white powder is pasted on both parts then fused.' </span></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p style="margin: 0px 6px 0px 10px;"><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial;">His attention was drawn to unit that several were working on. It is a tubular grid system 'for ionizing a layer of air.' </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 6px 0px 10px;"><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial;"><br><br></span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Mount Hayes</span></span><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial;"> <br>The next site is at <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Mt. Hayes</span>, Alaska. It appears to be a weather and geological center and has similar security measures to prevent discovery. He described 'computer equipment' and followed leads on an 'oscilloscope' which led to a small box like structure which contained rotational antenna that sat on top of a mountain peak. </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 6px 0px 10px;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 6px 0px 10px;"><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial;">The receiver seemed to be part of a detection system. </span></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p style="margin: 0px 6px 0px 10px;"><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial;">'If they were discovered,' Price wrote, 'personnel are deployed physically in activity to make sure of failure of that certain project. This site has also been responsible for strange activity and malfunction of US and Soviet space projects.' </span></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p style="margin: 0px 6px 0px 10px;"><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial;">Atwater suggested that if a probe was launched over this part of Alaska, that it might be interfered in some way, to prevent detection of the Mt. Hayes base. </span></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p style="margin: 0px 6px 0px 10px;"><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial;">'It comes to mind that these 'people' have infiltrated all government in sensitive positions, not to control government, the processes or people, but rather to be in positions of power to stop politically any activity that may produce a result that could cause discovery.' </span></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p style="margin: 0px 6px 0px 10px;"><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial;"><br></span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Mount Ziel</span></span><strong><span style="font-size: medium; color: #b50400; font-family: Arial;"> <br></span></strong><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial;">The fourth site is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Mt. Ziel</span>, a personnel center, in Australia's Northern Territory. </span></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p style="margin: 0px 6px 0px 10px;"><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial;">'It is interesting that this unit appears to have the most personnel. There are personnel from the other three sites here, like a rest and recreation area.' </span></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p style="margin: 0px 6px 0px 10px;"><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial;">For a few moments, <strong>Price</strong> felt slightly disoriented and decided they had detected him so he led them to Melbourne. <br><br>Price returned to the site and saw vehicles from the other bases, with each having different ID marks that correspond to each site's different functions. </span></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p style="margin: 0px 6px 0px 10px;"><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial;">'Mt. Ziel had personnel for all bases and is the homosapiens introduction point.' he observed. </span></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p style="margin: 0px 6px 0px 10px;"><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial;">Price also noted that the site should be approached with caution and that the area was under alert at that moment. <br> </span></p>

              <p>Of the 12 men who have walked on the moon, the last to set foot there, Harrison (Jack) Schmitt, is the only one with scientific training (he has a Ph.D. in geology). He has seen and done things most scientists only dream of. Schmitt's work on the Moon in 1972 ranks as one of the most exciting and productive episodes in the history of exploration. His memories of the three days he spent in the Valley of Taurus-Littrow are a priceless treasure trove of scientific and aesthetic insights. Unfortunately, those experiences are not the subject of his new book, <em>Return to the Moon</em>.</p>
              <p><span class="imageArticleRight" style="width: 158px;"><img style="cursor: pointer;" src="http://www.americanscientist.org/Libraries/images/thumbnail/200633091025_307.jpg" alt="Harrison Schmitt..."><a><img style="clear: both;" src="http://www.sgforums.com/images/enlarge-image.gif" alt="Click to Enlarge Image"></a></span></p>
              <p>Instead, the volume is structured as a legal brief, in which Schmitt makes the case for returning to the Moon to mine the isotope helium-3. He claims that because fossil fuels are limited in supply and because their extraction and use harm the environment, our rapidly industrializing world requires new sources of energy. The ultimate solution, he suggests, is the generation of power by nuclear fusion—not of deuterium and tritium, as is usually proposed, but of deuterium and helium-3.</p>
              <p>This reaction, which does not produce any fast neutrons, is clean and nonpolluting. There are, however, two drawbacks to its industrial use. First, the fusion of deuterium and helium-3 is very difficult to start and sustain, requiring roughly an order of magnitude more energy than the fusion of deuterium and tritium. Second, there are no plentiful stocks of helium-3 on Earth. Although the isotope is found naturally as a trace component in reservoirs of natural gas and also as a decay product of tritium (making our stockpile of nuclear weapons the best current terrestrial source), there is not enough helium-3 on our planet to support commercial power generation through fusion.</p>
              <p>Enter the Moon. Because the Moon has been bombarded for billions of years by solar wind, which consists largely of ionized hydrogen and ionized helium, helium-3 is available in the dust of the lunar surface. Even there, however, helium-3 is present only in concentrations between 10 and 20 parts per billion. Hundreds of millions of tons of lunar soil (more properly called regolith) must be mined and handled to extract a ton of helium-3. Schmitt has looked at this problem in some detail, and he outlines a plan for mining helium-3 on the Moon to feed a commercial industry for generating power here on Earth.</p>
              <p>After a brief introduction and a short discussion of the legacy of Apollo, Schmitt considers the future of energy production on Earth, concluding that all of the various proposed alternatives to fossil fuels have drawbacks. However, he maintains that mining the Moon for helium-3 is a viable solution to our energy problems.</p>
              <p>Next Schmitt surveys the economics of rocket launches, the economics of fusion power and the geology of lunar helium, covering the composition and state of the rocks and soils of the Moon in some detail. He then describes possible strategies for the mining and production of helium-3 and suggests how to organize the effort. Because helium-3 is such a minor constituent of the regolith, mining it produces valuable by-products in abundance, particularly solar-wind hydrogen, which could be used to fuel an Earth-Moon transportation infrastructure and to support human life at the lunar outpost.</p>
              <p>Schmitt then devotes two chapters to his idiosyncratic take on how NASA should be reorganized to regain the management prowess lost since the end of the Apollo program. The material on restructuring NASA consists largely of the text of e-mails that Schmitt sent to various members of the Bush administration in 2001—before the loss of the space shuttle <em>Columbia</em> precipitated a detailed examination of the goals of America's space program, resulting in the new Presidential Vision for Space Exploration in 2004.</p>
              <p>Next Schmitt outlines his recommendations for lining up investors in a commercial operation for mining helium-3 on the Moon. Schmitt believes that for his plan to be successful, it must attract considerable private-sector investment. Would such an endeavor be legal? Space law regarding lunar resources is unclear. Nonetheless, Schmitt is convinced that existing treaties permit lunar economic development, particularly if it is carried out not by national governments, but by a user-based international consortium like those developed to manage communication satellites.</p>
              <p>The next-to-last chapter touches on the value of humans in space. The book then concludes with the thought that a private effort to mine the Moon for helium-3 could not only solve our energy problems but also open the door to human settlement of the solar system.</p>
              <p>Exactly how one takes all of this depends very much on one's personal predilections and how one views the track record and credibility of people promising commercial fusion power. The traditional comment on this field is that commercial fusion power is 10 years away—and has been since the middle of the past century. And as noted above, the simplest fusion reaction, deuterium-tritium fusion, has yet to come close to breakeven (to producing as much energy as is needed to start the reaction), despite being an order of magnitude easier to achieve than the fusion of deuterium and helium-3.</p>
              <p>Some other criticisms are that Schmitt is not clear as to what role NASA should play in his scenario. Any involvement on NASA's part would appear to be only tangentially related to the new Vision for Space Exploration, which has been adopted as national policy by both the executive and legislative branches. Also, Schmitt discusses and interprets the geology of the Moon, the organization of the U.S. government's space program, space law and private-sector involvement in space through his own lens. Many of these issues are subjects of active debate, and those who wish to understand the wide scope of arguments being made should consult other books for different perspectives.</p>
              <p>The concept of a book as a legal brief has a long and distinguished pedigree in science. In Schmitt's own field, Charles Lyell's <em>Principles of Geology</em> (1830) comes closest to such status, being primarily an extended brief supporting the gradualist, Huttonian model of the evolution of the Earth. Darwin took a copy of Lyell's <em>Principles</em> with him on the voyage of the H.M.S. <em>Beagle</em>. Will astronauts returning to the Moon carry a copy of Schmitt's book</p>
