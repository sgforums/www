The noise disturbs the neighbours living in close proximity.</span><span> </span><span>"This has gone on for 6 months already.<br><br>"At last, a few neighbours and I could not take it and reported this to the town council.<br><br>"The town council actually referred this case to the HDB. I reported the case on May 21 but today the aircon is still turning on every night.</span><span> </span><span>"On hot nights, it actually turns even more vigorously, because the owner increases the speed of the blower.<br><br>"When I called the HDB to voice my query, I was told that the owner of the unit had refused to respond to the door. Therefore, they are unable to communicate with her.<br><br>"I heard from one of my neighbours who went to a "meet the MP" session and reported this, but in the end this case was also referred to the HDB.<br><br>"Is this the efficiency of the HDB? If they really cannot get hold of the owner, should the neighbours all just tolerate it? What else can the neighbours do to resolve this problem?<br><br>"We are not only concerned about the noise created but that the aircon is mounted on the loose bracket and might give way any time.

              <p>STOMPer <strong>applecake</strong> was shocked by this couple's behaviour. He had boarded the MRT train the same time as this couple, and got a seat next to the guy, however, the guy tried to push him away by opening his legs wider and wider, to get the seat for his girlfriend. <br><br>Tired of this, applecake stood up, only to be further taken aback by the lady's angry, glaring expression on her face, as if he did something wrong.</p>
              <p>Says this STOMPer:</p>
              <p>"The incident took place yesterday morning at Pasir Ris MRT station. The man (shown in the pic) actually tried to 'reserve' the seat which I occupied. We (me and the man) sat down at the same time.</p>
              <p><br>"However, he tried to save the seat for his girlfriend who walked in behind him when I already sat on it.</p>
              <p><br>"He opened his leg wider and wider to chase me away, and tried to stop me from leaning on the seat in attempt to save it for his girlfriend.</p>
              <p><br>"Shocked, I stood up and saw an angry lady (shown in the pic) staring at me. She was not injured, pregnant or whatsoever.</p>
              <p><br>"She continued glaring at me and took the seat which I initially sat on, without a simple thank you or smile.</p>
              <p><br>"I could have gladly given up my seat if she was more polite. Annoyed, I questioned my friend who was beside me: 'How can she do that?' And the lady rudely answered: 'OF COURSE CAN LAH!'.</p>
              <p><br>"I just hope they can be more polite and considerate instead of being so demanding. Very shocked to realise how they can behave like this."</p>

              <p>"A girl and 2 guys sat on a crowded bus 36, in the yellow seats specially marked for those in need.</p>

              <p>"The boy in grey looked directly at the them and didn't say a thing. Neither did the girl nor the blue-shirted guy despite seeing them.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Incensed, I yelled at the guy in grey, 'Can you give up your seat to the auntie or not? She's standing in front of you!'</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"At that he and the girl got up and let the 2 aunties sit. Only the guy in blue continued sitting.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"He did not give up his seat to my wife or another man who was carrying his toddler in the crowded bus who were standing in front of him.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"The selfish guy even let his legs jut out even more, obstructing those who were standing.</p>

              <p>TWO Chinese national, a man and a woman were convicted of theft of gaming chips from casinos on Wednesday, according to the Straits Times.</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.temasekreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/mbs1.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-28078" title="mbs1" src="http://www.temasekreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/mbs1-300x208.jpg" alt="mbs1" width="300" height="208"></a>Carpenter Chen ShuChun, 39, was jailed for two weeks after he pleaded guilty to stealing two pieces of $100 chips from Mr Tan Wee Soon, 63, at Marina Bay Sands casino on June 25. A magistrate’s court heard that the victim was playing roulette when he went to sit on a chair in between another roulette table where he had also placed his bet.</p>
              <p>Chen, a Chinese national, took the opportunity to shift Mr Tan’s $200 bet from the red colour box to the third column bet without consent. The victim found his winning bet and the $400 chips he was supposed to get missing and informed the croupier.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, Chen had claimed his winning of $600 from the third column bet and left. He subsequently gambled away the money. He was arrested on July 5 at the casino.</p>
              <p>In the same court, another Chinese national Qu Lihua, 43, a study mama, was fined a total of $6,000 for theft of gaming chips worth $1,000 and $750 from two men at Resorts World Sentosa casino on May 18 and June 10 respectively.</p>
