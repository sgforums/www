              <p><strong>What is a trademark?</strong></p>
              <p>Simply put, it's a brand name. More formally, it's "a word, phrase, symbol or design, or a combination of words, phrases, symbols or designs, that identifies and distinguishes the source of the goods of one party from those of others." (<a href="http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/tac/doc/basic/trade_defin.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #3366cc;">USPTO</span></span></a>) A service mark identifies a service rather than a product.</p>
              <p>Trademark protection only applies to a particular category of goods or services, although a single trademark owner may use it in multiple categories. For example, Nike Inc. owns the mark on a variety of shoes, clothing, sporting goods, etc., but Sweden's Nike Corporation could not prevent their use of the name because Nike Corporation's trademark was for heavy machinery, including hydraulic lifting jacks, pistons and presses.</p>
              <p><strong>What can be trademarked?</strong></p>
              <p>Trademark registration can be granted on distinctive names, logos and slogans. Marks may be inherently distinctive because they are original and unique, or may become a strong mark over time or as a result of a marketing campaign. Inherently distinctive marks may be:</p>
              <ul>
              <li><strong>suggestive or evocative marks</strong> - made-up words that suggest or evoke qualities of the product or service (Slim-Fast, Expedia) </li>
              <li><strong>coined or fanciful marks</strong> - arbitrary made-up words (Exxon, Kleenex, Viagra) </li>
              <li><strong>arbitrary marks</strong> - words that are surprising or unexpected in the context of their use (Sprite soft drink, Amazon online bookstore) </li>
              <li><strong>unique logos or symbols</strong> - distinctive typography or artwork (McDonald's golden arches, the Playboy bunny, IBM's logo)</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Marks that describe a feature of the product, or that are based upon a person's name or geographical location, are generally unprotectable. However, once the owner can demonstrate public awareness of the mark through advertising, product sales or other means, then it develops a "secondary meaning" and may be registered. Examples include:</p>
              <ul>
              <li><strong>people's names</strong> (Ben &amp; Jerry's, Calvin Klein, Procter &amp; Gamble) </li>
              <li><strong>geographic terms</strong> (Bank of America, New York Life) </li>
              <li><strong>words that describe the product or service</strong> - (Burger King, Jiffy Lube) </li>
              <li><strong>slogans</strong> - "Just do it" (Nike), "We do chicken right" (KFC), "Quality is job 1" (Ford)[</li>
              </ul>
              <p><strong>What is non-trademarkable?</strong></p>
              <p>Several types of terms are not protected under copyright law and can not be registered:</p>
              <ul>
              <li><strong>marks confusingly similar to existing marks</strong> - A mark is not subject to protection if it is too similar in spelling, sound or appearance and is used for similar goods or services (a new sportswear company could not call itself Nikee). </li>
              <li><strong>generic terms</strong> - A mark can not be protected if it is simply the name of the goods themselves (a soft drink called Pop). </li>
              <li><strong>weak marks that have not achieved secondary meaning</strong> - The owner must demonstrate that the public recognizes the mark as unique to their product (Joe's Bar would not qualify). </li>
              <li><strong>abandoned trademarks</strong> - If the mark is no longer in use and the owner has indicated intent not to resume use, it is not protected. </li>
              <li><strong>functional features</strong> - A functional element of a product or its packaging, as opposed to a decorative element. Note that this may be protectable under a design patent. </li>
              <li><strong>titles of literary or artistic works</strong> - Titles of books, movies and music can not generally be trademarked (or copyrighted). It can be if it is used to brand a series of books (<em>Chicken Soup for the Soul</em>), or related products (<em>Star Wars</em> toys).</li>
              </ul>
              <p><strong>Do I have to register my trademark?</strong></p>
              <p>Your right to use the name is protected the moment you first use it publicly. Your right to prevent others in your line of business from using it starts the moment you first claim it as a trademark (TM) or service mark (SM), and you do not have to register in order to use those designations. However, registering has several advantages, including:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>public notice of your claim of ownership </li>
              <li>ability to bring action in federal court </li>
              <li>legal presumption of ownership and exclusive right of use </li>
              <li>basis for registration in other countries </li>
              <li>preventing the import of infringing foreign goods</li>
              </ul>
              <p><strong>Do I need a lawyer?</strong></p>
              <p>You do not have to have a lawyer to file in the U.S., although it certainly increases your chances of a successful filing. A trademark attorney will check that you have all the necessary records in the proper format, that your mark qualifies for protection, and perform a thorough trademark search. You can do these yourself, but an experienced attorney will likely be able to do it much faster and more reliably.</p>
              <p><strong>How do I obtain a trademark?</strong></p>
              <p>Procedures vary from country to country, but in the U.S., you can file via mail or online at the <a href="http://www.uspto.gov/teas/index.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #3366cc;">USPTO Web site</span></span></a>. Registration costs between $275 and $375. The initial application primarily includes a representation of the mark and a description of the goods or services. You should have already performed a search to be sure your mark is unique for the category for which you are registering.</p>
              <p>As part of the approval process, you may be required to demonstrate your first use of the mark, so you will want to prepare records of things like a DBA filing, bank statements in the company name, or advertisements in printed publications</p>

              </ul>
              A trademark is either a word, phrase, symbol or design, or combination of words, phrases, symbols or designs, which identifies and distinguishes the source of the goods or services of one party from those of others.
              <p>Normally, a mark for goods appears on the product or on its packaging, while a service mark appears in advertising for the services.</p>
              <h3>Establishing Trademark Rights</h3>
              Trademark rights are established from either the actual use of the mark, or by applying for trademark registration and formally claiming your intention to use your mark for business. Federal trademark registration is not required to establish rights on your mark, nor is it required to begin using your mark.
              <h3>The Right To Register, The Right To Use</h3>
              There are two related but distinct types of rights in a mark: the right to register and the right to use. The first person to either use a mark in commerce or files an application generally gains the right to trademark registration.
              <p>Trademark registration can provide significant advantages to a party involved in a court proceeding. The <a href="http://inventors.about.com/od/definations/g/USPTO.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #3366cc;">USPTO</span></span></a> determines who can register. However, the right to use a mark can be more complicated to figure out. Two parties could begin using the same or similar marks without knowledge of one another and neither applied for trademark registration. Only a court could decide the right to use, with an injunction stopping one party from using the mark, and a settlement for damages caused by trademark infringement.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h3>Trademarks Do Not Have to Expire</h3>
              Trademark rights can last indefinitely if the owner continues to use the mark to identify goods or services. An affidavit and additional fees must be paid at certain intervals. If no affidavit is filed, the registration is canceled.
              <h3>See - <a href="http://inventors.about.com/od/inventing101trademarks/f/expiration.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #3366cc;">Keeping Your Trademark Registration Alive</span></span></a></h3>
              <h3>What Is Your Filing Basis?</h3>
              An important part of your application will be selecting your basis for filing. This will determine what materials you will need to submit with your application. Your choices will include: 
              <ul>
              <li><a href="http://inventors.about.com/od/definations/g/Commerce.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #3366cc;">Use in Commerce</span></span></a> - An applicant who has already used a mark in commerce may file based on that use called a "use in commerce" application. </li>
              <li>"Intent-To-Use" - An applicant who has not yet used the mark may apply based on a bona fide or good faith intention to use the mark in commerce after filing. </li>
              <li>Right of Priority - Filing based on an application or registration in another country.</li>
              </ul>
              <h3>What Does Federal Registration Mean</h3>
              United States trademark registration provides protection only in the United States and its territories. If the owner of a mark wishes to protect a mark in other countries, the owner must seek protection in each country separately under the relevant laws.
              <p>Certain countries, however, do recognize a United States registration as a basis for registering the mark in those countries. Many countries maintain a register of trademarks. The laws of each country regarding registration must be consulted. See - <a href="http://inventors.about.com/od/inventing101trademarks/f/tm_applicant.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #3366cc;">Who Can Apply To Register A Trademark?</span></span></a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <h3>Conflicting Marks</h3>
              In evaluating your application, the USPTO examining attorney will conduct a trademark search for conflicting marks. If a conflict is found and the mark cannot be registered. You should do your own <a href="http://inventors.about.com/od/trademarks/a/tm_search.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #3366cc;">trademark search</span></span></a> before filing.
              <p>Conflict means a likelihood of confusion caused by the similarity of trademarks. For example, if relevant consumers would be likely to associate one product with another because of the trademark. To find a conflict, the marks do not have to be identical, and the goods and services do not have to be the exactly the same.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>The <a href="http://inventors.about.com/od/definations/g/USPTO.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #3366cc;">USPTO</span></span></a> is responsible for the federal registration of trademarks. When an application is first received, the USPTO reviews it to determine if it meets the minimum requirements for receiving a filing date. The full examination will come later.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h3>Minimum Requirements</h3>
              <p>Submitting the minimum requirements just get you a filing date and not a registered trademark. Have everything finished ASAP before your full examination. To receive a filing date, the applicant must provide at least the following items:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>A completed application form with your correct name, a name and address for correspondence, and a listing of the goods and/or services. </li>
              <li>The appropriate <a href="http://inventors.about.com/od/inventing101trademarks/f/Fees.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #3366cc;">fee</span></span></a> </li>
              <li>A <a href="http://inventors.about.com/library/bl/toc/bldrawing.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #3366cc;">drawing</span></span></a> of the mark to be registered </li>
              <li>If the application is based on actual <a href="http://inventors.about.com/od/definations/g/Commerce.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #3366cc;">use in commerce</span></span></a>, three <a href="http://inventors.about.com/od/inventing101trademarks/f/specimen.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #3366cc;">specimens</span></span></a> for each class of goods or services claimed in the application.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>If the minimum requirements are not met, the entire mailing, including the filing fee, is returned to the applicant. If the application does meet the minimum requirements, the USPTO assigns it a serial number and sends the applicant a receipt. Keep the serial number and use it on any future correspondence.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h3>Full Examination</h3>
              <p>After receiving a filing date, the application undergoes a complete review that includes a search for conflicting marks, and an examination of the written application, the drawing, and any specimens.</p>
              <p>If the examining attorney determines that the mark cannot be registered, the examining attorney will send you a letter (office action) listing <a href="http://inventors.about.com/od/inventing101trademarks/f/refusal.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #3366cc;">any grounds</span></span></a> for refusal and any corrections required in the application.</p>
              <p>The applicant must respond to any objections within six months of the mailing date of the letter, or the application will be abandoned.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h3>Final Refusal</h3>
              <p>If the applicant's response does not overcome all objections, the examining attorney will issue a final refusal. To attempt to overcome a final refusal, the applicant may, for an additional fee, appeal to the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board (TTAB), an administrative tribunal within the USPTO.</p>
              <p>A common ground for refusal is likelihood of confusion between the applicant's mark and a registered mark. Marks which are merely descriptive in relation to the applicant's goods or services, or a feature of the goods or services, may also be refused. Marks consisting of geographic terms or surnames may also be refused. Marks may be refused for other reasons as well.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h3>Notice of Publication</h3>
              <p>If there are no objections, or if the applicant overcomes all objections, the examining attorney will approve the mark for publication in the Official Gazette, a weekly publication of the USPTO. Think of publication as the announcement of your trademark registration to the public.</p>
              <p>The USPTO will send a NOTICE OF PUBLICATION to the applicant indicating the date of publication. In the case of two or more applications for similar marks, the USPTO will publish the application with the earliest effective filing date first.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h3>Does Anyone Contest Your Right To Register?</h3>
              <p>Anybody who believes they may be damaged by the registration of a trademark has 30 days from the date of publication in the Gazette to file an opposition to that registration. An opposition is similar to a formal proceeding in the federal courts, but is held before the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board.</p>
              <p>If no opposition is filed, the application enters the next stage of the registration process.</p>
              <h3>Issuance of Certificate of Registration<br>Notice of Allowance</h3>
              <p>If the application was based upon <a href="http://inventors.about.com/od/definations/g/Commerce.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #3366cc;">use in commerce</span></span></a>, the USPTO will register the mark and issue a registration certificate about 12 weeks after publication.</p>
              <p>If, instead, the application was based upon an intention to use the mark in commerce, the USPTO will issue a NOTICE OF ALLOWANCE about 12 weeks after publication. The applicant then has six months from the date of the NOTICE OF ALLOWANCE to either use the mark in commerce and submit a STATEMENT OF USE, or request a six-month EXTENSION OF TIME TO FILE A STATEMENT OF USE.</p>
              <p>If the STATEMENT OF USE is filed and approved, the USPTO will then issue the trademark registration certificate.</p>

              <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 11pt;"><span style="font-size: 8.3pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt;"><strong>Is there a maximum size for a deposit? NO. <br></strong></span><br>Depending on your needs, we register and store any file, even if it's more convenient to limit the size of your deposit for the web transfers. <br><br><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Does the deposit prevent from counterfeiting your creative work? NO. <br></span></strong><br>None deposit prevent from counterfeiting. But, the bailiff deposit is a real legal proof that can prove the anteriority of your creative work (thanks to a certain date). It's essential to register any creative work if you wish to sue a counterfeiter. However, the deposit proves the copyright deposit efficiency can be limited by the fact a deposit registration helps to prove a design/creative work paternity, but the right exists by the work existence itself. The deposit receipt helps proving, but does not provides the right that already exists for an original work. Timestamp witnesses your copyright and makes the link irrefutable between author, work and certain date. <br><br><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Is my OfficeCopyright.com deposit valid abroad? Yes<br></span></strong></span><br></span>According to the <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/forums/10/topics/list_countries_bern_convention_copyright.aspx"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Bern Convention in 163 countries</span></span></a>, the value of a deposit in one of these countries is automatically extended to the other 162 countries. <br><br><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Do I have to pay yearly to guarantee the validity of my deposit? NO. <br></span></strong><br>You pay just once the deposit of your creative work and you get a lifetime protection (+70 years after the author death). The data storage at our bailiff is limited to 30 years because of the 30 years regulation that is said the maximum legal duration of storage by a bailiff is 30 years. At a notary, the dutation is naturally longer. <br><br><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Can I modify a deposit content after registration? No. <br></span></strong><br>A deposit provides a proof of anteriority sealed on your creative work by a certain date and a bailiff deposit on your file to register. That is what makes OfficeCopyright.com efficient and credible. <br><br><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Why are our rates so low (9.90€) whereas bailiff or a notary deposit costs 20 times as expensive ?</span></strong></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">the digital deposit to our bailiff is mutualized between all our clients. The cost is shared. The digital deposit is reliable and checked by our bailiff who receives simultaneously the deposits registered on our websites and validates legally your creative works. The electronic timestamp provides you an anteriority proof with a certain date and a bailiff stamp that allows you to use your deposits as a property proof (no industrial) before the court. <br><br><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">How to make a declaration of originality? <br></span></strong><br>Such declaration of originality allows you to build a complete file on your creative work, containing your original work and an explanatory which justifies the common knowledge at the registering time and what the competitors are doing in the similar fields. That finally makes your deposit strong and allows to prove, during registration, the originality of your creative work.</p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;"><span><span style="font-size: 8.3pt;"><strong>Especially for your website.</strong><br></span><br></span><strong>What do I have to do if my website is counterfeited?</strong> </span></p>
              <p>1. First of all, check if it's real copy (and not a simple resumption of some elements that can look like to your creative work) before appealing to justice for counterfeiting.<br><br>2. Then, the copy has to be a published document and that everyone can access: these are the main requirements to claim to be subjected to real harms. <br><br>3. If the copy is actually a published document that everyone can access, you can start a legal action. <br><br>4.Send a registered mail to the counterfeiter, the mail must state that the counterfeiter is using private/protected/copyrighted data and must stop immediately the spreading of this information/content; if he refuses, you will have to appeal to justice. <br><br>5. If these requirements are gathered, you can contact us, we will inform you on the way to follow.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Is it necessary to register for each upgrade of your creative work? YES.</span></strong></p>
              <p>For an optimal protection, it's better to register each upgrade. In fact, the deposit provides a certain date and then an anteriority proof, but it doesn't protect data added later. <br><br><strong>Hint : </strong>If your website needs to be update steadily, choose the <strong>PREMIUM Plan</strong> allowing large number of updates. <br><br><span style="font-size: 11pt;">• <strong>How to know if my plan fits my needs ?</strong><br><strong> </strong></span><br>If your website needs few or no updates, choose the<strong> BASIC</strong> plan. <br><br>If your website needs yearly changes (catalog changes, new products...), choose the<strong> EVOLUTION </strong>plan. <br><br>If your website needs many updates (for instance dynamic content), choose the <strong>PREMIUM </strong>plan. <br><br>Go to your account in order to register your updates <br></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">• Can we sue someone who uses my copyrighted data (text, picture, creative content) data reachable on my website, in order to use them for the benefit of himself ? </span>YES </strong></p>
              <p>Anyone who uses your creative work, your database or your image without any authorization, without your knowledge, your agreement or in case of information theft, can be sued, in these cases, please contact us for more information.  <br><br><span style="font-size: 11pt;"><strong>• Do I have to register my whole website to be protected ?</strong> </span><strong>NO </strong></p>
              <p>We advise to register and protect only which is necessary: the more important the file is, the longer the transfer will be on our servers. <br><br><strong>Hint :</strong> if the whole content of your website is large, send us your website on CD-ROM by registered mail.</p>

              Detailed records of the concepts, test results, and other information related to making an invention should be kept in a logbook. You can start a logbook from the very first moment you think of an idea. Proper record keeping can be used as proof of the conception date of an invention. The best way to prove that an idea is yours is by maintaining an inventor's journal or logbook. Your logbook should be a bound binder with pages numbered consecutively.

If you need help at any stage of the invention process experts suggest that you hire professionals on a piecemeal basis. There can be conflicts of interest involved in hiring one company.

              There are arguements from both sides on this point. However, some experts suggest not spending the time or money on a patent, instead they suggest taking your invention straight to the marketplace. Only a tiny percentage of patents make money. If your invention is a very simple item you might want to consider that approach. Did you know that one very successful invention that was never patented was Rubik's Cube?

              A patent application is a legal document and you cannot expect to "spend one evening filling it out," the better written the patent, the better the protection your patent will produce. Think of it as a contract for your invention, where every single word has impact. Hire an intellectual property lawyer that has a background in the technology that is part of your invention.

              <p>The ways you might make money from your invention fall under three basic paths. You can sell the patent or rights to your invention outright. You can license your invention. You can produce and market and sell your invention yourself.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h3>Selling Outright</h3>
              Selling your intellectual property patent means that you have permanently transferred ownership of your property to another person or company for an agreed upon fee. All future commercial opportunities including royalties will no longer be yours.
              <p> </p>
              <h3>License Your Invention</h3>
              Licensing means that you will continue to own your own invention, however, you rent out the rights to make, use, or sell your invention. You can give an exclusive license to one party, or a non-exclusive license to more than one party. You can set a time limit on the license or not. In exchange for the rights to your intellectual property, you can charge a flat fee, or collect a royalty for each unit sold, or a combination of the two.
              <p>It should be noted that royalties are a much smaller percentage than most inventors would guess they should be, often under three percent for first-time inventors. That fact should not be surprising, the licensing party is taking a financial risk and it is quite an undertaking to manufacture, market, advertise, and distribute any product. More about licensing in our next lesson.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h3>Do it Yourself</h3>
              To manufacture, market, advertise, and distribute your own intellectual property is a large enterprise. Ask yourself, "do you have the spirit necessary to become an entrepreneur?" In a later lesson we will discuss business and business plans and provide resources for conducting your own. For those of you who do wish to become your own entrepreneur and start and raise capitol for a serious business, this may be your next stop: <a href="http://inventors.about.com/od/entrepreneur/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #3366cc;">Entrepreneur Tutorials</span></span></a>.
              <p>Independent inventors may decide hire help for marketing or other aspects of promoting their invention. Before making any commitments to <a href="http://inventors.about.com/library/bl/toc/blinventionscams.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #3366cc;">promoters and promotion firms</span></span></a>, you should check on their reputation before making any commitments. Remember, not all firms are legitimate. It is best to be wary of any firm that promises too much and/or costs too much.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h3>I Want to Make Money Before I Have a Patent</h3>
              This is a controversial issue, however, many successful inventors do follow this path. Here are two articles on this topic.

              <span style="font-family: Verdana;">We are proud to introduce you to Bob DeMatteis, a successful inventor with sales of his inventions exceeding $25 million a year to companies like Sears, Walmart and Kroeger. What Bob writes will help inspire other inventors to do as well.</span>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><strong> </strong>In one of my seminars in Sacramento last fall, I was asked by a participant, "If there is any one thing you would want to do first… what would it be?" One thing immediately came to mind, but I thought for a while and purposely waited to respond. I realized the question was directly related to my personal success and was taping into all my past experience. After some thought, I responded "There is only one thing… and it is… To have a real smart marketing expert on my team as soon as possible".</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Let me explain why the marketing expert early on is so important. Then you can see how you can use this concept to help spur on success in your inventing and patenting activities as well. First, your measure of success is based upon income you will receive from sales of your invention. It is not based upon having it patented or manufactured. Many patents earn no money at all and simply having something manufactured is worthless unless someone can sell it!</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">The invention development process invariably begins with a single idea by an inventor. But to be successful, an inventor needs to form a team of highly skilled associates who can help him/her develop, evaluate and subsequently file for patents and launch the new invention. Besides, developing an invention requires a tremendous amount of effort. A single person simply will not have enough time to do it all alone.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">A smart inventor will build a team as soon as possible. The four principal team members will be you, a patent attorney, a manufacturing expert and a marketing expert. Again, keep in mind that sales generate income, which will generate profits or royalties. And, since inventors are usually not very good at sales, your marketing expert is the most important key member you will want on your team as early in development as possible.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">An inventor can brainstorm the basic concept and even make a crude prototype. But prototyping should not be advanced without substantial input from the marketing expert. After all, this marketing expert (or group) is the one that is going to generate the sales. It makes no sense to spend your valuable time and money on developing an idea that no one wants to buy. Having the right marketing person on your team, at the earliest possible moment, will ensure that you will be developing your invention with all the right attributes. This marketing expert will provide valuable input into evaluating the invention and can even provide sales projections.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;"> My new book is "From Patent to Profit!", in it you can read in layperson terms all about the invention development process. In the book is the Road Map To Success chart, which allows you, the inventor, to track your progress. In the book is the following diagram, which is a simple flow chart showing how the initial invention evaluation process dovetails with your patent protection process. You basically have three alternatives to start the patent protection process of an idea while it is being evaluated.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">The first and best alternative is to evaluate your invention's merits and its sales potential with an expert you know and trust. Second, if you do not know any trusted experts, you can use <a href="http://inventors.about.com/cs/nondisclosure/index.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">confidentiality agreements</span></a>. Third, if you want to spend the extra money and speculate on having your invention ready for mass production and producing income in a year, you can file a simple, <a href="http://inventors.about.com/library/weekly/aa061701a.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">provisional patent application</span></a> for as little as $75.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">As you can imagine, many larger companies will not sign confidentiality agreements as a matter of policy. Filing a provisional patent application can replace the need to use confidentiality agreements and serves to protect your invention's priority date (the date you file for patent protection). If you file a provisional application you can more openly talk to and interview those marketing experts working with larger companies. The downside of filing a provisional application at an early stage is that you will be incurring the higher costs of filing the regular patent a year later. One year is not necessarily a lot of time to build your team and fully develop your invention. But it should be adequate if you plan your development well.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">All three methods are viable approaches for inventors and have their merits. You only need to determine which works best for you in your particular situation. To give you a little insight into my invention activities, I prefer to work either with those marketing experts I know and trust, or using confidentiality agreements with those I do not know well. Any company that will not sign one of my confidentiality agreements I will not consider as a viable team member. And, I will never sign one of their agreements, which invariably protects them a lot more than you.</span></p>
              <p><img id="_x0000_i1027" src="http://0.tqn.com/d/inventors/1/0/f/7/chart.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="253"></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Figure 6-1 Invention Evaluation - Patent Protection Flow Chart</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">In your pursuit of finding that key team member, a marketing expert, you will want to interview them based upon several factors. Just remember that some marketing experts will not have any interest in selling your invention and others will simply not have the ability. You would be wise to keep searching until you find just the right match.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">If you receive a lukewarm response from one or more, don't give up right away. Try to field, as many objections as possible from the interviewees to better understand why the objections exist. These problems can invariably become opportunities once they are resolved. Discuss the various alternatives with the expert.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Finding the right marketing expert for your team can quickly propel your efforts forward and can even encourage manufacturers to invest their resources to gear up to manufacture your new invention.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Smart marketing experts who understand the benefits to your invention and have the right contacts can pre-sell your product based upon some simple prototypes. Think about it… can your marketing expert get a commitment for an initial sample order of $20,000 [for instance]? Then it would be easy to assume that subsequent orders from others would probably total 10 times (or more) that amount. With pre-sold orders, it is a lot easier for your manufacturing team member to make a commitment to spend its resources and get the product launched and producing income.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">So when I am asked what is the single-most important key to success… it is almost invariably, "Get a smart marketing expert on your team at the earliest possible moment!</span></p>

              <div id="articlebody"><strong>Note:</strong> Bob DeMatteis, author of "<a href="http://frompatenttoprofit.com/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #3366cc;">From Patent to Profit</span></span></a>", is a nationally known inventor, author and educator. He is one of the original inventors of the plastic grocery sack and plastic merchandise bag systems used throughout the United States. Bob is also an advisor to several small company development organizations funded by federal and state governments. Bob has generously written us an article sharing some of his "more than successful" knowledge on inventing.
              <p>Inventors often believe that getting a patent is automatically going to make them money. However, the U.S. Patent Office reports that less than 3% of patents ever make any money for the inventor. Yes, a 97% failure rate! The Federal Trade Commission cites an even lower rate of success: less than 1%. Yet, in sharp contrast to these statistics many successful inventors have a virtual 100% success rate. Why is this? What are the experts doing to ensure their success?</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, most individuals with good ideas follow a traditional approach to inventing and patenting which is certain to put them into the 97% failure category. Unknowing (or money hungry) patent attorneys and agents usually teach these methodologies. Many inventor organizations and their inexperienced inventor/leaders do, too. It is propagated by the fact that many attorneys will scare unsuspecting inventors with the comment, "you don't have any protection until you have a patent." This is clearly misleading. As you will see, being scared into rushing to file for patents will almost always assure an inventor of having a worthless patent and becoming part of the 97% failure statistic.</p>
              <p>Many invention promotion firms run slick ads on radio and TV and add to the problem. Although their ads appear to make inventors believe that their success and financial gain is eminent, by reading their literature you will find that their success rate is absolutely dismal being less than 1/100 of 1%. However, this is not surprising since I don't know of any invention promotion company that has a single successful inventor on their staff.</p>
              <p>Last, many unknowing inventors begin their pursuit of patenting by trying to save the high cost of hiring patent attorneys and file the application themselves. It is referred to as filing "pro per". This typically results in a huge waste of time for the inventor. These patents generally have a very limited scope (protection) and are easy for skilled inventors or engineers to design around.</p>
              <p>The traditional approach teaches an inventor to:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>protect his/her invention </li>
              <li>do a patent search </li>
              <li>file a patent application </li>
              <li>make prototypes and </li>
              <li>see if they can make some sales</li>
              </ul>
              If you are a first time or inexperienced inventor, this is the exact methodology that guarantees a 97% failure rate. It will cost you a lot of money and a lot of time and will almost assuredly result in worthless, ineffective patents. In my From Patent to Profit workshops, about 1/3 or more of the inventors I met -- who have followed this traditional approach to patenting -- ended with patents that they later designed around. Why? Keep reading.
              <p>In contrast to the traditional approach, the expert inventor knows that patents cost money, they don't earn money. They also know that they are not going to waste their valuable money, time and efforts on a whim. But the best news of all is that expert inventors know how to do this with very little out of pocket expense!</p>
              <p>For example, of my 14 patents, I own 10 of them. I also have 7 patents pending. All 10 patents I own -- and the 7 pending -- are licensed and producing sales and income. Yet, I have paid the filing and prosecuting costs on only 3 of my patents and patents pending. This is not uncommon. Inventor Andy Gibbs also has a 100% success rate with his 7 patents. Yujiro Yamamoto has a virtual 100% success rate with his 46+ patents! (Yujiro is the original inventor of the telephone answering machine and cordless telephone.) Andy did not personally pay for his, nor did Yujiro pay for most of his. There are many other inventors with similar success stories. What is the patent strategy we all use? </p>

              <p>First of all, we do not rush out and file like many patent attorneys would like you to do. Besides, the first-to-invent laws of the United States protect us. In summary these laws state that the inventor who is first to conceive of an idea, then reduce it to practice (that is, prove that it works the way you say it does) will be acknowledged as the legal inventor. The only other issue that an inventor should keep in mind is that if work on the invention has been abandoned, then he/she will lose those rights. In other words, you have to proceed with due diligence in your development and cannot let large amounts of time elapse. The best way to track your day-to-day activities is by using a legal, bound journal.</p>
              <p>Second, smart inventors know that being successful means making money, not getting patents. Thus, expert inventors make sure their products are sellable before filing for patents. In a complete reversal of the traditional method (the 97% failure rate), which puts marketing last, smart inventors qualify the market potential right up front! After protecting their invention, they will work confidentially with marketing experts in the field of their invention that can secure some substantial sales commitments. Then, they will work with manufacturing experts to get their invention made cost effectively.</p>
              <p>Think about it, it's only common sense. It is smart business, not wishful thinking. Sales earn money and patents cost money. You want to get sales, and you want to protect them with patents. Besides, your marketing experts will confirm the desirability of your invention/product concept. They will inform you what the best attributes are and will help you mold your invention into a high-volume, sellable product. Your manufacturing expert will work along side you and the marketing expert to make the prototypes and working models for testing. So, get these experts on your team early on, before you file for patents, and develop your inventions/products with all the right attributes and excellent patent coverage! Know you are going to make money before you spend it on patenting!</p>
              <p>Perhaps the best outcome of all is that by partnering (or licensing) with marketing and manufacturing experts, most of the cost of development and patenting is absorbed by them, not you! In return for their investment in the initial manufacturing costs and the marketing expense, they will have exclusivity. The exclusivity is, of course, conditioned upon their on-going ability to perform.</p>
              <p>When you are thinking of patenting, think of marketing first. Then, just like the experts, you will be guaranteed that your invention/innovation will make you money.

              <p><strong><em>3 ½ years. </em></strong> Number of years it took for Facebook to receive its social media “news feed” patent.  “Back in August 2006, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg">Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg</a> and a handful of employees submitted paperwork to patent the social network's "news feed," the system of displaying the stream of links, photos and status updates that have become an addictive daily staple for millions of people.  Last week, they <a href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;co1=AND&amp;d=PTXT&amp;s1=facebook&amp;s2=zuckerberg&amp;OS=facebook+AND+zuckerberg&amp;RS=facebook+AND+zuckerberg">got their patent</a>. . . . I'm going to focus on the 31/2 years it took for this puppy [the Facebook patent] to grind its way through the [patent office] approval process.  That extended review time is a disaster for Facebook, for its competitors, for innovation and for the economy. Unfortunately, it reflects the general dysfunction of our patent system, which takes an average of three years to bless a patent.  But don't take my word for how bad things are. Listen to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Kappos">David Kappos</a>, <a href="http://www.uspto.gov/about/bios/">director of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office</a>.  ‘It is indeed a broken agency,’ Kappos said. ‘We are trying to work our way through a broken system.’”  <a href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;co1=AND&amp;d=PTXT&amp;s1=facebook&amp;s2=zuckerberg&amp;OS=facebook+AND+zuckerberg&amp;RS=facebook+AND+zuckerberg">Take a look at the original Facebook patent</a>.   (<a href="http://twitter.com/sjcobrien">Chris O'Brien</a>, Mercury News Columnist, 415-298-0207,  “How Obama's team hopes to fix patent office,” <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000N9KNQO?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=al21209-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000N9KNQO"><em>Silicon Valley Mercury News</em></a><em>,</em> updated March 3, 2010)<br><br><strong><em>40 months (3.3 years).</em></strong>  Average time it takes for the patent office to review a patent.  “[The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office] says it plans to fast-track 3,000 already-filed [greentech] patent applications...  The program aims to reduce the review time for a patent—currently 40 months, on average—by about one year.” (Sara Stroud, “Greentech patents put on the fast track,” <em>Sustainable Industries, </em>Washington, DC, December 29, 2009)</p>

It takes more than three years in many cases to get a final answer.  ‘Imagine in the commercial world any service provider where if you sent the service provider money and a request for service and they said, 'Thanks, we'll get back to you in three years.' You'd say that's insane, unacceptable,’ Kappos said in a recent interview.  Beyond the lag time, observers agree that the agency is in dire need of modernization and a morale boost.
