              I was reading this article on Top Ten Lost Technologies and came across an interesting tidbit about Damascus Steel, one of only two materials to make the list (the other being Roman Cement). Damascus Steel was a super-strong Middle Eastern forged metal used from roughly 1100 A.D. to 1700 A.D. It was said to be able to cut through rocks and other people's swords, making it the bad-ass material of its day.
              Sadly, the "recipe" for making Damascus Steel no longer exists, and they've not been able to reverse-engineer how to make it. In any case, below is the passage that struck me, boldface mine:
              The particular process for forging Damascus steel appears to have disappeared sometime around 1750 AD. The exact cause for the loss of the technique is unknown, but there are several theories. The most popular is that the supply of ores needed for the special recipe for Damascus steel started running low, and sword makers were forced to develop other techniques. Another is that the whole recipe for Damascus steel--specifically the presence of carbon nanotubes--was only discovered by accident, and that sword smiths didn't actually know the technique by heart. Instead, they would simply forge the swords en masse, and test them to determine which met the standards of Damascus steel. Whatever the technique, Damascus steel is one technology that modern experimenters have been unable to fully reproduce.

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Electrolux Design Lab 2010 Entries + a Dancing Pork ChopPosted by elle* | 16 Jun 2010 | Comments (0) The top 25 entries of the Electrolux Design Lab 2010 competition are out. Participants were asked to focus on "The 2nd Space Age" by designing a home environment for the year 2050 when 74% of the world's population is expected to live in urban areas. Entries addressed the areas of food prep and storage, as well as laundry and dish washing. The expected compact dishwashers and washing machines are thrown in the mix, some requisite anthropomorphism elicits smiles, and a few provoking materials keep things interesting. You can see all the entires here. Check out Berty Bhuruth's "Instinct Vacuum Cleaner" (aka "the Sheep-like Cleaner") that dutifully cleans while you surf the web; Yuriy Dmitriev's Bio Robot Refrigerator from Russia that literally tackles "Cool, Green, Food Preservation" by proposing to chill your edibles with bright chartreuse luminescent biopolymer gel (Pictured above. Also cryptically defined as looking "like boot process products"-?); and several entries even do away with the need for physical food altogether by bringing the Jetson-ian regime to life with food replacement systems. It's always a treat to imagine what might come next in our domestic spaces, but we got to wondering what would happen if Electrolux considered more than just small spaces for the future. With growing urbanization, that human touch in design would help us all feel better about living in our single-bed-studio-apartments. Imagine teaming some of these entries up with the poetic likes of designer Michael Harboun, whose Living Kitchen incorporates Claytronics technology to create a truly responsive environment. Or throwing Joan Healy's Sound-Activated Dancing Pork Chop in there to get form, function and, well...a new way to think about "grinding meat." It might make you chuckle, but let's not forget that the future can't be all work and no play.<img style="vertical-align: top;" src="http://s3files.core77.com/blog/images/electrolux_touch.jpg" alt="" width="468" height="639"></p></div>

              <p>I try to go other places, and there are enough MRT + Bus

              <p>I try prank calling the emergency services, and they showed up

              <p>I confronted one of them, and it is clear that the public

              <p>I took a taxi, and realized that the fares are all standard

              <p>And I applied for the job and found one based on my merits just

              <p>I think it is not a matter of wanting to retire here or in aussie, as the saying goes, at the end of the day, the bird fly back to it own nest, like me, being born in taiwan and having my childhood there, it gives me a deep impression as my homeland, a place where i shall return in some period of my life, be it retirement or mid life, I am not sure. So, it is basically that people are cultured in a way that there is never a better place then your own homeland. I bet those singaporeans who had retired oversea still ponder and hope to return to singapore, they will miss here alot.</p>
              <p>Not bearing the cost of living or the hectic life, retirement is a completely different issue to a able person who is still very much economy viable, there is no different if you do not sell your house and live on till retirement, whether oz is higher or not is no more an issue.</p>
              <p>It all depend on what you want for retirement, in oz, it can be very serene and tranquility with kangeroos or deers just outside your house, but also go wolves and wobat to hunt you down, and not to mention those flood. Buy groceries or going shopping can be long travel, but if you like a vibrant city like singapore, why, kopitiam and pub and gals like mine is just around the corner, where one shout, MOLEST!!! can get full attention, you will be more happier in singapore</p>

              <p>I think it is not a matter of wanting to retire here or in
              aussie, as the saying goes, at the end of the day, the bird fly
              back to it own nest, like me, being born in taiwan and having my
              childhood there, it gives me a deep impression as my homeland, a
              place where i shall return in some period of my life, be it
              retirement or mid life, I am not sure. So, it is basically that
              people are cultured in a way that there is never a better place
              then your own homeland. I bet those singaporeans who had retired
              oversea still ponder and hope to return to singapore, they will
              miss here alot.</p>
              <p>Not bearing the cost of living or the hectic life, retirement is
              a completely different issue to a able person who is still very
              much economy viable, there is no different if you do not sell your
              house and live on till retirement, whether oz is higher or not is
              no more an issue.</p>
              <p>It all depend on what you want for retirement, in oz, it can be
              very serene and tranquility with kangeroos or deers just outside
              your house, but also go wolves and wobat to hunt you down, and not
              to mention those flood. Buy groceries or going shopping can be long
              travel, but if you like a vibrant city like singapore, why,
              kopitiam and pub and gals like mine is just around the corner,
              where one shout, MOLEST!!! can get full attention, you will be more
              happier in singapore</p>

              <p>I'm still happy with Singapore...its just that its so difficult to retire here....most people work until they die to support their expensive homes....this is certainly not something to be happy about...unless they got their homes cheap and sold at high prices, then go aussie to retire...many of my frens are like this....</p>

              maybe he didnt buy it in the right place.as an intelligent person always look at the correct maps.never buy it cuz everyones buying it.its not only shallow minded but costly.
              
              even if its many years ago..he should e at least read the architects blue prints and construction drawings.they have the stuff and data thats needed to have a safe place thats free of flood,fire and cyclones.

              Comments (4) Add to My Stories A shopkeeper in the flood-hit Australian state of Queensland has revealed he spotted a six-foot bull sharks swimming around a McDonaldÃ¢â¬â¢s takeaway Ã¢â¬â 12 miles inland from the sea.
              
              Steve Bateman, 42, was forced to hide waist deep in floodwater inside his shop for two hours while the shark swam outside looking for prey.
              
              His nightmare began after he ventured back to see what he could salvage from his butcherÃ¢â¬â¢s shop in Goodna, outside Brisbane.
              
               Floods: Goodna in Queensland is underwater and when Steve Bateman went to see what he could scavenge from his butchers, he encountered two bull sharks
              
               Hidden predators: A number of sharks were spotted in the town near Ipswich
              Mr Bateman said he managed to gain entry to his shop after pulling open its glass front doors with the floodwaters up to his chest.
              
              He said: Ã¢â¬â¢Goodna was turned into an aquarium that day.
              
              Ã¢â¬ËI was swimming towards my store and a guy in a boat picked me up and told me there was a bull shark in the shopping centre.
              
               Fish and chips: A butcher spotted two bull sharks swimming near a McDonald's in Goodna, Australia
              Ã¢â¬ËHe dropped me off at my store. I waded in, opened the door and then saw a long dark shadow and a fin swim past. It was probably 10 metres away from me and it looked about six feet long.
              
              Ã¢â¬ËBut that was not the scariest part. I was hiding in the shop for a while hoping the shark had moved on.
              
              Ã¢â¬ËMy head was the only thing above water and I was crapping myself.
              
              Ã¢â¬ËI thought it would bite my face... but it swam straight past me.
              
              Ã¢â¬ËI saw it in the McDonaldÃ¢â¬â¢s takeaway in the shopping centre.Ã¢â¬â¢ 
              
              His shop, Bateman's Bargain Butcher, is a mile-and-a-half from the Brisbane River, which broke its banks and destroyed the eastern suburbs of the township after torrential rain.
              
              Local councillor Mr Paul Tully confirmed the sightings of the killer shark Ã¢â¬â which can grow up to 12 feet long.
              
              He said: Ã¢â¬ËItÃ¢â¬â¢s definitely a first to have a shark in the main street.
              
              Ã¢â¬ËI know Steve Bateman and he wouldnÃ¢â¬â¢t say he saw a shark unless he really saw one.
              
              Ã¢â¬ËItÃ¢â¬â¢s not like there have been polar bears.
              
              Ã¢â¬ËBull sharks have been in the Brisbane River.Ã¢â¬â¢ 
              
               Deadly predator: Bull sharks are well known for being unpredictable, often aggressive behaviour. Since bull sharks often dwell in shallow waters, they may be more dangerous to humans than any other species of shark
              The deadly predators are solitary hunters which can survive in salt and freshwater and are common all over Australia.
              
              The 50-stone predator gets its name from the stocky build, broad snout and its aggressive nature.
              
              According to Animal Planet, their main source of food is dolphins, other sharks and large animals.
              
              But there have also been reports of bull sharks attacking horses which have ventured too close to the waterÃ¢â¬â¢s edge in Queensland.
              
              They are also responsible for a high number

              Breaking news Attractive people have higher IQs, UK scientists claim 
              From: NewsCore January 16, 2011 10:28PM Increase Text Size Decrease Text Size Print Email Share Add to Digg Add to del.icio.us Add to Facebook Add to Kwoff Add to Myspace Add to Newsvine What are these? ATTRACTIVE people have been given even more reason to celebrate after scientists claimed handsome men and pretty women were more likely to have a high IQ. 
              
              Researchers from the London School of Economics (LSE) said that physically-attractive people have above-average IQs, with good-looking men around 13.6 points above the norm and attractive women 11.4 points above average.
              
              The findings, based on UK and US studies, suggested that the link between beauty and intelligence means the children of attractive couples will inherit both attributes, forming a genetic link between the qualities.
              
              Ã¢â¬ÅBoth in the British and American samples, physical attractiveness is significantly positively associated with general intelligence, both with and without controls for social class, body size and health.
              
              The association between physical attractiveness and general intelligence is also stronger among men than among women,Ã¢â¬ï¿½ said LSE lead researcher Satoshi Kanazawa, writing in the latest edition of the journal Intelligence.

              More than 52,000 people across the UK and US were measured on their academic progress and intelligence, as well as scored on their appearance.
              
              Ã¢â¬ÅIf more intelligent men are more likely to attain higher status, and if men of higher status are more likely to marry beautiful women, then, given that both intelligence and physical attractiveness are highly heritable, there should be a positive correlation between intelligence and physical attractiveness in the childrenÃ¢â¬â¢s generation," Mr Kanazawa said.
              
              He added, however, that his findings were statistical and should not be applied to individuals, saying that Ã¢â¬Åit goes without saying that our contention that beautiful people are more intelligent is purely scientific. It is not a prescription for how to treat or judge others.Ã¢â¬ï¿½

              The Queensland city of Toowoomba has been devastated by a deadly wall of water in scenes reminiscent of a tsunami.
              
              An ugly new chapter is unfolding in the state's unprecedented flood crisis, with parts of Toowoomba devastated and homes swept away in the Lockyer Valley at the foot of the Toowoomba range.
              
              Four people - including a woman pedestrian caught up in the flash flooding -- have been killed on Monday, police said.
              
              An unknown number of others are missing after the flood hit about midday (AEST), washing away cars, some with drivers still trapped inside.
              
              The seething, dirty torrent arrived without warning trapping pedestrians, motorists, tearing up roads and leaving the city virtually cut off.
              
              There are unconfirmed reports a bridge in the city's south has been washed away, and of a building collapse in the city heart, the Department of Community Safety said.
              
              An unknown number of people remain trapped in cars and in buildings in Toowoomba, as rescuers struggle to reach them.
              
              Communities in the Lockyer Valley were also hit by the destructive torrent.
              
              Lockyer Valley Mayor Steve Jones, whose ute was almost swept away in the drama, told AAP the town of Withcott bore the full force of the flood.
              
              "There's petrol pumps taken out and taken half a kilometre down the road. It's like Cyclone Tracy hit it," he said.
              
              "There's houses come off the stumps at (nearby) Postmans Ridge and taken down the creek, possibly two or three."
              
              Toowoomba Mayor Peter Taylor said there was still no clear picture of the damage in his community but it was enormous.
              
              "There has been loss of life. I don't know how many at this point ..." he told the ABC.
              
              "There is massive damage ... this is unbelievable damage."
              
              Rescue crews are also trying to reach three pedestrians and two vehicles swept from a roadway at Withcott.
              
              Deputy Police Commissioner Ian Stewart said lives were under threat.
              
              "We've had multiple 000 calls requesting urgent assistance from people caught in vehicles, caught on the street, caught in floodways," he told reporters.
              
              "This has just evolved. There has been no warning of this event."
              
              A man who has relatives in Grantham, in the Lockyer Valley, told the ABC there were many people trapped on the roofs of houses there, and were in desperate need of help.
              
              The man, identified only as Andrew, said at least one house had floated away and he was very worried about those in the town.
              
              "All the houses in Grantham, there are people on the roofs there," he said.
              
              "One of the houses ... actually lifted and floated away.
              
              "We're worried about the SES being able to get to people ... the roads are all cut.
              
              "It's a dire situation and I just pray for those people ..."
              
              Premier Anna Bligh was in a meeting with flood recovery experts when she was told about the drama unfolding in Toowoomba.
              
              Ã¢â¬ÅJust as we might be moving to a stabilised situation this afternoon ... there has been a massive deluge in the city of Toowoomba,Ã¢â¬ï¿½ she told reporters.

              Elsewhere across Queensland the multi-billion dollar flood crisis, now almost a month old, is rolling on.
              
              Floodwaters are continuing to rise in the southeast Queensland city of Gympie, where the Mary River is expected to peak at about 20 metres overnight.
              
              More than 110 homes and businesses are expected to flood at that level, Ms Bligh said.
              
              At Dalby, west of Brisbane, residents are preparing for a fifth flood event in three weeks, with between 200 and 300 homes expected to go under there, Ms Bligh said.
              
              At 5pm, the Myall Creek at Dalby was at 3.74 metres - 200mm higher than the December 27 peak when 100 properties were flooded. A peak is expected at Dalby by about 8pm.
              
              Earlier, Western Downs Mayor Ray Brown said the creek was expected to get to 3.8 metres. He said the town was cut in two by floodwaters, with evacuation centres open on each side.
              
              He said there was Ã¢â¬Åhuge emotionÃ¢â¬ï¿½ in the town.
              
              Ã¢â¬ÅYouÃ¢â¬â¢ve got to remember weÃ¢â¬â¢ve had five significant water events through Dalby in the last 20 days or so,Ã¢â¬ï¿½ he told the ABC.
              
              Brisbane residents too have been warned theyÃ¢â¬â¢re not immune from the unrelenting tide, with people told homes and businesses could flood in coming days despite critical protection afforded by the Wivenhoe dam west of the city.
              
              Lord Mayor Campbell Newman said the dam was doing its job, protecting the city from a 1974-scale disaster.
              
              But with rain still falling, essential releases continuing from Wivenhoe, and a king tide due on January 21, Mr Newman said residents along the Brisbane River must be ready for flooding.
              
              The council had ordered 30,000 sandbags, which will be filled and available for distribution from council depots.
              
              Ms Bligh said the dam, built after the 1974 floods devastated thousands of Brisbane and Ipswich homes, was seeing Ã¢â¬Åmassive inflowsÃ¢â¬ï¿½ to rival that disaster.
              
              Ã¢â¬ÅWe are seeing one million megalitres or two Sydney harbours flow into the Wivenhoe catchment every day,Ã¢â¬ï¿½ she told reporters.
              
              Ã¢â¬ÅWithout a doubt the Wivenhoe Dam has already saved Brisbane from a catastrophic flood in the next 48 hours but we have to keep releasing water from it so it can keep doing the job itÃ¢â¬â¢s doing.
              
              Ã¢â¬ÅThe dam will see releases over the next two to three days larger than it has ever seen in its history ...Ã¢â¬ï¿½

              CNN) -- The death toll increased Monday after flash floods swept cars off roads in the city of Toowoomba in northeast Australia, a region that was already reeling from one of the worst floods in its history.
              
              Eight people have now been confirmed dead and 11 injured, Queensland police say.
              
              Toowoomba is the biggest inland city in the state of Queensland, about 125 kilometers (80 miles) directly west of the state capital, Brisbane -- and considerably south of some of the more publicized flood areas such as B

                                                  Bowen has endured Cyclone Anthony, but the weather bureau is warning a bigger cyclone is on the way.

                                                  NORTH Queensland has endured the destructive winds of Cyclone Anthony, but the weather bureau is warning a bigger cyclone that's likely to affect a much larger area of the state is on the way.
                                                  
                                                  Cyclone Yasi is just north of Vanuatu, about 2000 kilometres east-northeast of Bowen, which suffered only minor damage when Anthony crossed the coast on Sunday night.
                                                  
                                                  Unlike Anthony, which weakened into a low pressure system after crossing land, Yasi is expected to menace Queensland as a strong cyclone even after crossing the coast. Cyclone Yasi is 5 times the size of Anthony
                                                  
                                                  Queensland's Bureau of Meteorology says it's likely to cross the north coast either on Wednesday night or Thursday morning.
                                                  
                                                  The bureau's senior forecaster Gordon Banks said Yasi would be big and intense, bringing destructive winds and heavy rain across the state.
                                                  
                                                  He said like January's devastating floods, Yasi will most likely be a state event.
                                                  
                                                  "It's going to affect a much larger area (than ex-cyclone Anthony) both with rainfall and wind and because of its size and strength, it's likely to persist as a cyclone even after it crosses land," Mr Banks told ABC Radio.
                                                  
                                                  "I think eventually Yasi will be a whole state event."
