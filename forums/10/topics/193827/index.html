            <div class='col-md body'>The system does develop and gives opportunities to talented people. The problem is that there is a mismatch between skills and the jobs that have been created. The government is creating lots of jobs in biotechnology and going into areas like nanotechnology, but we lack the talent to fill these jobs.<br><br>It is self defeating to bemoan the lack of job opportunities in say, the textile production industry, when that is dead and gone. Why are people doing computer programming when an Indian programmer can do that job for less? IT professionals should be going into things like software design or project management instead.<br><br>It is too simplistic to talk in terms of a lack of opportunities. The issue is applying your talents to the opportunities available.</div>
