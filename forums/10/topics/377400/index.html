              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Gangasudhan</strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Temasek Holdings released its annual report on 17<sup>th</sup> September 2009 which was duly highlighted in the best possible light with a bold header of ‘<a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/Breaking%2BNews/Singapore/Story/STIStory_431374.html">Temasek Rebounds</a>’ (<em>Straits Times, September 18</em>). Unfortunately, <a href="http://review.temasek.com.sg/wp-content/uploads/pdf/temasek-review-2009-colour.pdf">Temasek Review 2009</a> seems to have more questions than answers (not necessarily a surprise),
                      some which would serve the interests of the fundamental shareholders to
                      be answered – and we are not talking about the Ministry of Finance
                      which is its sole shareholder.</p>
              <p>The focus in the report has again predominately been the Portfolio
                      Value which refers to the market value of the various assets under its
                      charge. These include local heavyweights such as Singtel, Standard
                      Chartered, DBS Group and CapitaLand, as well as other overseas entities
                      based in China, India, US and even Brazil. This Portfolio Value has
                      risen steadily over the years from $90 billion in 2004 to $185 billion
                      in 2008 (and in between consecutive years too) before spectacularly
                      dropping by $55 billion in 2009 to $130 billion.</p>
              <p>The information from the press and Temasek Holdings contrasts this
                      single drop in portfolio value against previous years’ stellar values
                      and puts the blame of poor performance squarely on the global financial
                      crisis which has taken the world by (thunder)storm.</p>
              <p><strong><em>Value vs Wealth</em></strong></p>
              <p>However, the Temasek Review 2009 (pages 21 and 22) also reveals
                      another figure which is termed ‘Wealth Added’ and reports this value as
                      a ‘negative $68 billion’ (a positive way of saying the ‘Wealth
                      Deducted’ was $68.1 billion) which certainly does not tally with the
                      reported drop of $55 billion in Portfolio Value. The description of the
                      Wealth Added component according to the Temasek Review 2009 includes
                      various components such as operating cost and capital charges, among
                      others.</p>
              <p>However, this component conveniently includes any capital injections
                      (whose exact amount would be hidden here) and thus the Portfolio Value
                      of $130 billion which is overemphasised by the parties concerned could
                      very well be lower had the capital injection (if any) not been included
                      in estimating this value.</p>
              <p><strong>Illustration</strong></p>
              <ul>
              <li><em>$68.1 billion includes the market value change (-$55 billion)</em></li>
              <li><em>The remaining $13.1 billion ($68 – $55 billion) includes
                      operating costs, capital charges, any opportunity cost involved, and
                      capital injections</em></li>
              <li><em>Thus the <strong>capital injection could have theoretical been as much as $13.1 billion</strong> (if there had been no other charges or expenses) with a probable estimate being $10 billion (based on <a href="http://www.temasekholdings.com.sg/temasekreview/2008/pdf/TR2008%2018-08-08%20Bookmarked.pdf">Temasek Review 2008</a> – page 19)</em></li>
              </ul>
              <p>Although this may be creative accounting at its best, the
                      implications of not knowing these figures are rather significant.
                      Without knowing whether there was a capital injection and if so, how
                      much, we are left to speculate on the actual loss of the Portfolio
                      Value. Using the figures available in Temasek Review 2009, we can
                      estimate that <strong><em>the ‘true’ Portfolio Value could have been as low as $116.9 billion</em></strong> ($185 – $68.1 billion) as contrasted against the reported $130 billion.</p>
              <p>Interestingly, the Wealth Added for 2008 was also a negative value
                      ($6.3 billion) which seems to suggest that any growth in Portfolio
                      Value (for any year’s performance) may not necessarily translate into
                      ‘wealth’. Thus, there is a need to relook the wisdom of using Portfolio
                      Value as a measure of success or performance instead of Wealth Added.</p>
              <p><strong>Illustration</strong></p>
              <p><em>Imagine buying your home for $200,000 and boasting about the
                      current market value of $300,000 (implying a profit of $100,000 should
                      you sell). However, if you were to actually sell your home and the
                      various levies, loan interest charges, fees and CPF account
                      reimbursements are then deducted, the net returns may very well be just
                      a few thousand dollars. In this example, the <strong>Portfolio Value would be the buying and selling prices of the home</strong> and the <strong>Wealth Added would be the actual money that you get in your pocket</strong>.
                      As can be seen through this example, the price of your home (i.e.
                      Portfolio Value) is hardly anything more than a bragging right and the
                      net returns that you (can) get (i.e. Wealth Added) is what really
                      matters.</em></p>
              <p><strong><em>Rephrasing 101</em></strong></p>
              <p>This year’s annual report also included the new term ‘retraced its
                      value’ (Temasek Review 2009, page 8 &amp; 18). A rose by any other name
                      may still be a rose but it is apparent that the Temasek Review still
                      holds positive spin above all else. Not content with just one creative
                      adjective, it goes on to add ‘retracted its value’ (Temasek Review
                      2009, page 6) to further reinforce the implied notion that the drop in
                      value is not a drop in value.</p>
              <p>A retracing or retraction of value seems to imply that it was a mere
                      reversal or a rewind to 3 years earlier (2006), but notably, operating
                      costs are NOT at these levels – in fact they are 3 times more in 2009
                      (Temasek Review 2009, page 28). Also, if the drop in Portfolio Value
                      symbolises a return to 2006, then logic would dictate that salaries
                      paid in 2006 and 2007 should be recovered in tandem. Thus, a play on
                      semantics is not always a good idea, especially on the back of such a
                      catastrophic financial performance.</p>
              <p><strong><em>Illustration</em></strong></p>
              <p><em>What if you had to take a pay cut that amounts to 3 years’
                      increment? Could you go around to your creditors and tell them, “Sorry
                      my salary retraced by 3 years.” Would that change anything in the eyes
                      of these creditors?</em></p>
              <p><strong><em>Signs of desperation</em></strong></p>
              <p>Finally, the Straits Times’ Alvin Foo was more than happy to pen down,</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><em>“The portfolio sank from a peak of $185 billion on March 31 last year to $130 billion on March 31 this year, <strong>according
                      to its annual report, which was out on Thursday. It also showed that
                      the portfolio had rebounded to $172 billion as at July 31</strong>.” <a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/Breaking%2BNews/Singapore/Story/STIStory_431374.html">Temasek Rebounds</a> (18 September 2009)</em></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>However, the reporter failed to realise that the annual report
                      (Temasek Review 2009) made no reference to the ‘magic’ $172 billion
                      and, in fact, this figure appears only in the <a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/STI/STIMEDIA/pdf/20090917/TemasekReview.pdf">CEO’s Opening Remarks</a> (page 2). It is therefore very erroneous to suggest that the annual
                      report reports such a figure as the auditors (whose sign off dates 16<sup>th</sup> July 2009) could not and have not verified this figure to be true,
                      accurate or reliable. It is also quite amusing that Temasek Holdings
                      which prides itself in ensuring that it is always quoted properly has
                      allowed the misrepresentation to exist without corrections – and it is
                      hard not to speculate that the reason is due to the positive
                      inclination of said misrepresentation.</p>
              <p>Nevertheless, the discussion on Temasek Holdings’ (non-)performance
                      should revolve around the substantiated facts ($130 billion) instead of
                      an unverified number ($172 billion) which was mentioned in a single
                      sentence involving a mere 16 words out of 1,786 that the speech
                      comprised.</p>
              <p><strong><em>Illustration</em></strong></p>
              <p><em>If a child takes an exam and is unable to answer a question but
                      later on gets the answer, is he or she able to go back and include this
                      information and improve his final score? Here, the ‘exam’ for Temasek
                      Holdings ended on 31<sup>st</sup> March 2009 and it is thus meaningless to talk about any issue after the fact.</em></p>
              <p>At the end of reviewing Temasek Review 2009, we would urge Temasek Holdings to;</p>
              <p>a)     issue a correction to the misrepresentation by Straits Times
                      attributing the reported July 2009 Portfolio Value to its annual report</p>
              <p>b)    reveal its monthly Portfolio Value for at least the last 3
                      years for an adequate comparison of the July figure of $172 billion
                      (which incidentally is featured prominently on the <a href="http://www.temasekholdings.com.sg/index.htm">homepage of its website</a>)</p>
              <p>c)     disclose the exact components (especially any capital
                      injection) and their accompanying figures involved that resulted in the
                      Wealth Added figure of negative $68.1 billion</p>
              <p>These are the critical factors that enable the ultimate shareholders
                      (citizens of Singapore) to assess and understand the actual performance
                      of Temasek Holdings in the financial year ended 31<sup>st</sup> March 2009, and the speculative performance in the four months thereafter.</p>
              <p>************************************************************************</p>
              <p><strong><em>Temasek Trivia</em></strong></p>
              <p><em>Temasek Holdings has been reporting an annual report since 2004
                      and TOC made an attempt to secure these reports online. While the
                      reports for 2004 and 2005 were nowhere to be found, the 2006 to 2009
                      issues were (eventually) located on the Temasek Holdings website.
                      Quizzically, each Temasek Review is placed on a different URL as

                      that the IT department employed by Temasek Holdings to manage its

              <p>When they announce that their portfolio increased to $172 billion from a year end balance of $130 billion. I was also thinking of capital injection, meaning they could have sought extra funds from MAS or GICs to buy up more companies.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When your current portfolio is $130 billion, you get extra funds to buy more shares, your portfolio could increase by the amount of funds used to purchase these new shares, hence $172 billion. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"> The mouth-piece of the ruling party, the Straits Times has declared unilaterally today that the state Sovereign Wealth Fund, Temasek Holdings has “recouped a big part of its portfolio losses since a low point in March”. (read full article here)<br><br>In an lengthy editorial splashed on the front page, the Straits Times tried desperately to exonerate Temasek’s beleaguered CEO Ho Ching from any blame in the investment losses by hailing her decisions to purchase financial heavyweights such as India’s ICICI Bank, China Construction Bank and Standard Chartered Bank.<br><br>The Straits Times “findings” show that much of Temasek’s gains since the end of March have been driven by its exposure to financial firms:<br><br>“Take DBS Group Holdings, which has rallied 64.3 per cent during the four-month period. Temasek, which owns 27.8 per cent of the local lender, made a paper gain of more than $2 billion as a result.<br><br>Then there is Bank of China, which has surged 50.2 per cent and contributed around US$1.7 billion (S$2.4 billion) in gains to Temasek’s portfolio. The Singapore firm has a 13.8 per cent stake in the Chinese bank.”<br><br>However, the Straits Times is surprisingly muted on the share prices of Bank of America and Barclays which have since rebounded.<br><br>Temasek under Ho Ching bought shares in Merrill Lynch (later sold to Bank of America) and Barclays at a high last year before selling them at a low somewhere in mid-March this year leading to a catastrophic loss of a few billion dollars.<br><br>Temasek’s loss on BoA alone is estimated around US$4.6 billion, or roughly US$1,000 for every single Singaporean citizen. (Source: Asian Sentinel)<br><br><strong>A simple calcuation shows that the stock value of Bank of America has increased by more than 200%</strong>.</span></p>
