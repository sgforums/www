            <div class='col-md body'>Dec 8, 2005<br>Changing nature of NS would hurt security<br><br>IN THE article, 'Rethink scope of national service' (ST, Dec 6), Ms Ong Soh Chin called for a broader definition of national service, in particular, the inclusion of 'civilian service', so that Singapore would not lose 'another Singaporean like Melvyn Tan'.<br><br>While I agree that it is sad that we should lose a talent like Mr Tan or other 'would-be prodigal Singaporeans' like him, I do not think we can afford to compromise national security by changing the nature of our national service to accommodate the aspirations of individuals.<br><br>And, yes, it does make a mockery of the 'many young Singaporean males who have properly served their country'.<br><br>If national service were designed to cater to the 'special aptitude' of a person by allowing him to be channelled to an 'appropriate industry', wouldn't this relegate national service to a mere ritual of convenience and encourage people to become self-serving in the name of serving the country?<br><br>Besides, though it is not for every man, our national servicemen do have the opportunity to experience the non-combat aspects of national service. There are already clerical duties, medical duties and, as the writer acknowledges, overseas missions to 'Aceh or other tsunami-hit countries to help out in the rehabilitation process'.<br><br>Ms Ong says not every man is a warrior, so not all should carry arms. But national service does not just turn national servicemen into fighting machines with the ability to 'shoot to kill'.<br><br>In the army, soldiers are equipped with combat know-how, understanding of sophisticated weaponry, principles of total defence, survival and various life skills, among others, so that they know how to and are able to defend their country and guide their fellow countrymen in doing so when the call comes.<br><br>More importantly, the army instils discipline and prepares recruits for life's realities in a way 'soft' attachments like 'coaching young musicians' cannot.<br><br>If we rethink the scope of national service and give people a choice to choose either 'military' or 'civilian' service, guess which one most people would choose.<br><br>The strength of an army lies in its numbers, besides modern technology. Considering Singapore's population of about 3.5 million people of whom about 1.79 million are females, 937,000 are 19 years old and below and 620,500 are 55 years old and above, and the unique vulnerabilities that every country faces, to remain sufficiently combat-ready we cannot afford to reduce our army size at all.<br><br>Hence, not serving national service is not simply an issue of having one's loyalty (and manhood) questioned; it is a question of life and death.<br><br>Lena Soh Kwee Kim (Ms)<br><br>What does a woman like her know abt NS? pui. Oh i can safely tell you i am one person who would choose civilian service. And since you are so pro- NS, why not go serve before you think you even deserve to talk abt NS? what a bitch. Obviously she think females do not need to serve NS yet demand equality. 'Soft attachments'? what do you know abt the ARTS? oh forget being a bitch. You are just one lame fucking bitch that only knows how to shoot her mouth first<br></div>

Disruptions can only be very sparingly given and for a very short period. In considering disruption applications, Mindef tries to be fair to all. We work on the principle that males from the same school cohort enter university in the same calendar year. Those proceeding for overseas studies in universities where the academic year starts in September or October, such as Mrs Lim-Sin's son, therefore have no need for any disruption as they will enter university in the same year as the rest of their cohort.<br><br>Colonel Benedict Lim<br>Director, Public Affairs<br>Ministry of Defence<br></div>
