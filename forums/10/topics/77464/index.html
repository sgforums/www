            <div class='col-md body'>Americans and their treatment of Canadians<br><br>They Put a Bag Over My Head &amp; Flew Me To Syria for Torture and<br>Interrogation<br><br>I am here today to tell the people of Canada what has happened to me.<br><br>There have been many allegations made about me in the media, all of them<br>by people who refuse to be named or come forward. So before I tell you<br>who I am and what happened to me, I will tell you who I am not.<br><br>I am not a terrorist. I am not a member of al-Qaida and I do not know<br>any one who belongs to this group. All I know about al-Qaida is what I<br>have seen in the media.<br><br>I have never been to Afghanistan. I have never been anywhere near<br>Afghanistan and I do not have any desire to ever go to Afghanistan. Now,<br>let me tell you who I am.<br><br>I am a Syrian-born Canadian. I moved here with my parents when I was 17<br>years old. I went to university and studied hard, and eventually<br>obtained a Masters degree in telecommunications.<br><br>I met my wife, Monia at McGill University. We fell in love and<br>eventually married in 1994. I knew then that she was special, but I had<br>no idea how special she would turn out to be.<br><br>If it were not for her, I believe I would still be in prison.<br><br>We had our first child, a daughter named Bar'a, in February 1997. She is<br>six years old now. In December 1997, we moved to Ottawa from Montreal.<br><br>I took a job with a high-tech firm, called The MathWorks, in Boston in<br>1999, and my job involved a lot of travel within the U.S.<br><br>Then in 2001 I decided to come back to Ottawa to start my own consulting<br>company. We had our second child, Houd, in February 2002. He is 20<br>months old now.<br><br>So this is who I am. I am a father and a husband. I am a<br>telecommunications engineer and entrepreneur. I have never had trouble<br>with the police and have always been a good citizen.<br><br>So I still cannot believe what has happened to me, and how my life and<br>career have been destroyed.<br><br>In September 2002, I was with my wife and children, and her family,<br>vacationing in Tunis.<br><br>I got an e-mail from the MathWorks saying that they might need me soon<br>to assess a potential consulting work for one of their customers.<br><br>I said goodbye to my wife and family, and headed back home to prepare<br>for work.<br><br>I was using my air-miles to travel, and the best flight I could get went<br>from Tunis, to Zurich, to New York, to Montreal.<br><br>My flight arrived in New York at 2 p.m. on Sept. 26, 2002. I had a few<br>hours to wait until my connecting flight to Montreal.<br><br>This is when my nightmare began. I was pulled aside at immigration and<br>taken to another area.<br><br>Two hours later some officials came and told me this was regular<br>procedure -- they took my fingerprints and photographs.<br><br>Then some police came and searched my bags and copied my Canadian<br>passport. I was getting worried, and I asked what was going on, and they<br>would not answer.<br><br>I asked to make a phone call, and they would not let me.<br><br>Then a team of people came and told me they wanted to ask me some<br>questions. One man was from the FBI, and another was from the New York<br>Police Department.<br><br>I was scared and did not know what was going on.<br><br>I told them I wanted a lawyer. They told me I had no right to a lawyer,<br>because I was not an American citizen.<br><br>They asked me where I worked and how much money I made. They swore at<br>me, and insulted me. It was very humiliating.<br><br>They wanted me to answer every question quickly.<br><br>They were consulting a report while they were questioning me, and the<br>information they had was so private -- I thought this must be from<br>Canada. I told them everything I knew.<br><br>They asked me about my travel in the United States. I told them about my<br>work permits, and my business there.<br><br>They asked about information on my computer and whether I was willing to<br>share it. I welcomed the idea, but I don't know if they did. They asked<br>me about different people, some I know, and most I do not.<br><br>They asked me about Abdullah Almalki, and I told them I worked with his<br>brother at high-tech firms in Ottawa, and that the Almalki family had<br>come from Syria about the same time as mine. I told them I did not know<br>Abdullah well, but had seen him a few times and I described the times I<br>could remember.<br><br>I told them I had a casual relationship with him.<br><br>They were so rude with me, yelling at me that I had a selective memory.<br>Then they pulled out a copy of my rental lease from 1997. I could not<br>believe they had this.<br><br>I was completely shocked. They pointed out that Abdullah had signed the<br>lease as a witness. I had completely forgotten that he had signed it for<br>me -- when we moved to Ottawa in 1997, we needed someone to witness our<br>lease, and I phoned Abdullah's brother, and he could not come, so he<br>sent Abdullah.<br><br>But they thought I was hiding this. I told them the truth. I had nothing<br>to hide. I had never had problems in the United States before, and I<br>could not believe what was happening to me.<br><br>This interrogation continued until midnight. I was very, very worried,<br>and asked for a lawyer again and again.<br><br>They just ignored me. Then they put me in chains, on my wrists and<br>ankles, and took me in a van to a place where many people were being<br>held -- another building by the airport. They would not tell me what was<br>happening.<br><br>At one in the morning they put me in a room with metal benches in it. I<br>could not sleep. I was very, very scared and disoriented. The next<br>morning they started questioning me again.<br><br>They asked me about what I think about bin Laden, Palestine, Iraq. They<br>also asked me about the mosques I pray in, my bank accounts, my e-mail<br>addresses, my relatives, about everything.<br><br>This continued on and off for eight hours.<br><br>Then a man from the INS came in and told me they wanted me to volunteer<br>to go to Syria. I said no way.<br><br>I said I wanted to go home to Canada or sent back to Switzerland. He<br>said to me 'you are a special interest.' They asked me to sign a form.<br>They would not let me read it, but I just signed it. I was exhausted and<br>confused and disoriented.<br><br>I had not slept or eaten since I was in the plane. At about six in the<br>evening they brought me some cold McDonalds meal to eat.<br><br>This was the first food I had eaten since the last meal I had on the<br>plane. At about eight o'clock they put all the shackles and chains back<br>on, and put me in a van, and drove me to a prison.<br><br>I later learned this was the Metropolitan Detention Centre. They would<br>not tell me what was happening, or where I was going.<br><br>They strip searched me. It was humiliating. They put me in an orange<br>suit, and took me to a doctor, where they made me sign forms, and gave<br>me a vaccination.<br><br>I asked what it was, and they would not tell me. My arm was red for<br>almost two weeks from that.<br><br>They took me to a cell. I had never seen a prison before in my life, and<br>I was terrified. I asked again for a phone call and a lawyer. They just<br>ignored me.<br><br>They treated me differently than the other prisoners. They would not<br>give me a toothbrush or toothpaste, or reading material. I did get a<br>copy of the Koran about two days later.<br><br>After five days, they let me make a phone call. I called Monia's mother,<br>who was here in Ottawa, and told her I was scared they might send me to<br>Syria, and asked her to help find me a lawyer. They would only let me<br>talk for two minutes.<br><br>On the seventh or eighth day they brought me a document, saying they had<br>decided to deport me, and I had a choice of where to be deported. I<br>wrote that I wanted to go to Canada. It asked if I had concerns about<br>going to Canada. I wrote no, and signed it.<br><br>The Canadian consul came on Oct. 4, and I told her I was scared of being<br>deported to Syria. She told me that would not happen. She told me that a<br>lawyer was being arranged. I was very upset, and scared. I could barely<br>talk.<br><br>The next day, a lawyer came. She told me not to sign any document unless<br>she was present. We could only talk for 30 minutes. She said she would<br>try to help me. That was a Saturday.<br><br>On Sunday night at about 9 p.m., the guards came to my cell and told me<br>my lawyer was there to see me. I thought it was a strange time, and they<br>took me into a room with seven or eight people in it.<br><br>I asked where my lawyer was. They told me he had refused to come and<br>started questioning me again.<br><br>They said they wanted to know why I did not want to go back to Syria. I<br>told them I would be tortured there. I told them I had not done my<br>military service; I am a Sunni Muslim; my mother's cousin had been<br>accused of being a member of the Muslim Brotherhood and was put in<br>prison for nine years.<br><br>They asked me to sign a document and I refused. I told them they could<br>not send me to Syria - I would be tortured.<br><br>I asked again for a lawyer. At three in the morning they took me back to<br>my cell. At three in the morning on Tuesday, Oct. 8, a prison guard woke<br>me up and told me I was leaving.<br><br>They took me to another room and stripped and searched me again. Then<br>they again chained and shackled me.<br><br>Then two officials took me inside a room and read me what they said was<br>a decision by the INS director. They told me that based on classified<br>information that they could not reveal to me, I would be deported to<br>Syria.<br><br>I said again that I would be tortured there. Then they read part of the<br>document where it explained that INS was not the body that deals with<br>Geneva Convention regarding torture.<br><br>Then they took me outside into a car and drove me to an airport in New<br>Jersey. Then they put me on a small private jet. I was the only person<br>on the plane with them. I was still chained and shackled. We flew first<br>to Washington.<br><br>A new team of people got on the plane and the others left. I overheard<br>them talking on the phone, saying that Syria was refusing to take me<br>directly, but Jordan would take me.<br><br>Then we flew to Portland, to Rome, and then to Amman, Jordan. All the<br>time I was on the plane I was thinking how to avoid being tortured. I<br>was very scared.<br><br>We landed in Amman at three in the morning local time on Oct. 9. They<br>took me out of plane and there were six or seven Jordanian men waiting<br>for us.<br><br>They blindfolded and chained me, and put me in a van. They made me bend<br>my head down in the back seat. Then, these men started beating me. Every<br>time I tried to talk they beat me.<br><br>For the first few minutes it was very intense.<br><br>Thirty minutes later, we arrived at a building where they took off my<br>blindfold and asked routine questions, before taking me to a cell. It<br>was around 4:30 in the morning on Oct. 9.<br><br>Later that day, they took my fingerprints, and blindfolded me and put me<br>in a van. I asked where I was going, and they told me I was going back<br>to Montreal.<br><br>About 45 minutes later, I was put into a different car. These men<br>started beating me again. They made me keep my head down, and it was<br>very uncomfortable, but every time I moved, they beat me again. Over an<br>hour later, we arrived at what I think was the border with Syria.<br><br>I was put in another car and we drove for another three hours.<br><br>I was taken into a building, where some guards went through my bags and<br>took some chocolates I bought in Zurich. I asked one of the people where<br>I was and he told me I was in the Palestine branch of the Syrian<br>military intelligence. It was now about six in the evening on Oct. 9.<br><br>Three men came and took me into a room. I was very, very scared. They<br>put me on a chair, and one of the men started asking me questions. I<br>later learned this man was a colonel.<br><br>He asked me about my brothers, and why we had left Syria. I answered all<br>the questions. If I did not answer quickly enough, he would point to a<br>metal chair in the corner and ask 'Do you want me to use this?' I did<br>not know then what that chair was for. I learned later it was used to<br>torture people.<br><br>I asked him what he wanted to hear. I was terrified, and I did not want<br>to be tortured. I would say anything to avoid torture. This lasted for<br>four hours. There was no violence, only threats this day.<br><br>At about one in the morning, the guards came to take me to my cell<br>downstairs.<br><br>We went into the basement, and they opened a door, and I looked in. I<br>could not believe what I saw. I asked how long I would be kept in this<br>place. He did not answer, but put me in and closed the door. It was like<br>a grave. It had no light.<br><br>It was three feet wide. It was six feet deep. It was seven feet high. It<br>had a metal door, with a small opening in the door, which did not let in<br>light because there was a piece of metal on the outside for sliding<br>things into the cell.<br><br>There was a small opening in the ceiling, about one foot by two feet<br>with iron bars. Over that was another ceiling, so only a little light<br>came through this.<br><br>There were cats and rats up there, and from time to time the cats peed<br>through the opening into the cell. There were two blankets, two dishes<br>and two bottles. One bottle was for water and the other one was used for<br>urinating during the night. Nothing else. No light.<br><br>I spent 10 months, and 10 days inside that grave.<br><br>The next day I was taken upstairs again. The beating started that day<br>and was very intense for a week, and then less intense for another week.<br>That second and the third days were the worst.<br><br>I could hear other prisoners being tortured, and screaming and<br>screaming. Interrogations are carried out in different rooms.<br><br>One tactic they use is to question prisoners for two hours, and then put<br>them in a waiting room, so they can hear the others screaming, and then<br>bring them back to continue the interrogation.<br><br>The cable is a black electrical cable, about two inches thick. They hit<br>me with it everywhere on my body.<br><br>They mostly aimed for my palms, but sometimes missed and hit my wrists<br>-- they were sore and red for three weeks. They also struck me on my<br>hips, and lower back. Interrogators constantly threatened me with the<br>metal chair, tire and electric shocks.<br><br>The tire is used to restrain prisoners while they torture them with<br>beating on the sole of their feet. I guess I was lucky, because they put<br>me in the tire, but only as a threat.<br><br>I was not beaten while in tire. They used the cable on the second and<br>third day, and after that mostly beat me with their hands, hitting me in<br>the stomach and on the back of my neck, and slapping me on the face.<br><br>Where they hit me with the cables, my skin turned blue for two or three<br>weeks, but there was no bleeding. At the end of the day, they told me<br>tomorrow would be worse. So I could not sleep.<br><br>Then on the third day, the interrogation lasted about 18 hours. They<br>beat me from time to time and make me wait in the waiting room for one<br>to two hours before resuming the interrogation.<br><br>While in the waiting room I heard a lot of people screaming. They wanted<br>me to say I went to Afghanistan. This was a surprise to me.<br><br>They had not asked about this in the United States. They kept beating me<br>so I had to falsely confess and told them I did go to Afghanistan. I was<br>ready to confess to anything if it would stop the torture. They wanted<br>me to say I went to a training camp.<br><br>I was so scared I urinated on myself twice. The beating was less severe<br>each of the following days.<br><br>At the end of each day, they would always say, 'Tomorrow will be harder<br>for you. ' So each night, I could not sleep. I did not sleep for the<br>first four days, and slept no more than two hours a day for about two<br>months. Most of time, I was not taken back to my cell, but to the<br>waiting room where I could hear all the prisoners being tortured and<br>screaming.<br><br>One time, I heard them banging a man's head repeatedly on a desk really<br>hard. Around Oct. 17, the beatings subsided. Their next tactic was to<br>take me in a room, blindfolded, and people would talk about me.<br><br>I could hear them saying, 'He knows lots of people who are terrorists;'<br>'We will get their numbers;' 'He is a liar;' 'He has been out of the<br>country for long.' Then they would say, 'Let's be frank, let's be<br>friends, tell us the truth,' and come around the desk, and slap me on<br>the face. They played lots of mind games.<br><br>The interrogation and beating ended three days before I had my first<br>consular visit, on Oct. 23.<br><br>I was taken from my cell and my beard was shaved. I was taken to another<br>building, and there was the colonel in the hallway with some other men<br>and they all seemed very nervous and agitated.<br><br>I did not know what was happening and they would not tell me. They never<br>say what is happening. You never know what will happen next.<br><br>I was told not to tell anything about the beating, then I was taken into<br>a room for a 10-minute meeting with the consul. The colonel was there,<br>and three other Syrian officials including an interpreter.<br><br>I cried a lot at that meeting. I could not say anything about the<br>torture. I thought if I did, I would not get any more visits, or I might<br>be beaten again.<br><br>After that visit, about a month after I arrived, they called me up to<br>sign and place my thumb print on a document about seven pages long.<br><br>They would not let me read it, but I had to put my thumb print and<br>signature on the bottom of each page. It was handwritten.<br><br>Another document was about three pages long, with questions: Who are<br>your friends? How long have you been out of the country?<br><br>Last question was empty lines. They answered the questions with their<br>own handwriting except for the last one where I was forced to write that<br>I had been to Afghanistan.<br><br>The consular visits were my lifeline, but I also found them very<br>frustrating.<br><br>There were seven consular visits, and one visit from members of<br>Parliament. After the visits, I would bang my head and my fist on the<br>wall in frustration. I needed the visits, but I could not say anything<br>there.<br><br>I got new clothes after the Dec. 10 consular visit. Until then, I had<br>been wearing the same clothes since being on the jet from the United<br>States.<br><br>On three different occasions in December, I had a very hard time.<br>Memories crowded my mind and I thought I was going to lose control, and<br>I just screamed and screamed. I could not breathe well after, and felt<br>very dizzy.<br><br>I was not exposed to sunlight for six months. The only times I left the<br>grave was for interrogation, and for the visits.<br><br>Daily life in that place was hell. When I was detained in New York I<br>weighed about 180 pounds. I think I lost about 40 pounds while I was at<br>the Palestine Branch.<br><br>On Aug. 19, I was taken upstairs to see the investigator and I was given<br>a paper and asked to write what he dictated.<br><br>If I protested, he kicked me. I was forced to write that I went to a<br>training camp in Afghanistan. They made me sign and put my thumbprint on<br>the last page.<br><br>The same day I was transferred to a different place, which I learnt<br>later was the Investigation Branch.<br><br>I was placed there in a 12 feet by 20 feet collective cell. We were<br>about 50 people in that place. The next day, I was taken to the Sednaya<br>prison. I was very lucky that I was not tortured when I arrived there.<br>All the other prisoners were tortured when they arrived.<br><br>Sednaya prison was like heaven for me. I could move around, and talk<br>with other prisoners. I could buy food to eat and I gained a lot of<br>weight there. I was only beaten once there.<br><br>On around Sept. 19 or 20, I heard the other prisoners saying that<br>another Canadian had arrived there.<br><br>I looked up, and saw a man, but I did not recognize him. His head was<br>shaved, and he was very, very thin and pale. He was very weak. When I<br>looked closer, I recognized him.<br><br>It was Abdullah Almalki. He told me he had also been at the Palestine<br>Branch, and that he had also been in a grave like I had been -- except<br>he had been in it longer.<br><br>He told me he had been severely tortured -- with the tire, and the<br>cable. He was also hanged upside down. He was tortured much worse than<br>me. He had also been tortured when he was brought to Sednaya, so that<br>was only two weeks before.<br><br>I do not know why they have Abdullah there. What I can say for sure is<br>that no human deserves to be treated the way he was, and I hope that<br>Canada does all they can to help him.<br><br>On Sept. 28, I was taken out and blindfolded and put in what felt like a<br>bus and taken back to the Palestine Branch.<br><br>They would not tell me what was happening, and I was scared I was going<br>back to the grave. Instead, I was put in one of the waiting rooms where<br>they torture people. I could hear the prisoners being tortured, and<br>screaming, again.<br><br>The same day I was called in to an office to answer more questions,<br>about what I would say if I came back to Canada. They did not tell me I<br>would be released.<br><br>I was put back in the waiting room, and I was kept there for one week,<br>listening to all the prisoners screaming.<br><br>It was awful. On Sunday, Oct. 5, I was taken out and into a car and<br>driven to a court. I was put in a room with a prosecutor. I asked for a<br>lawyer and he said I did not need one.<br><br>I asked what was going on and he read from my confession. I tried to<br>argue I was beaten and did not go to Afghanistan, but he did not listen.<br><br>He did not tell me what I was charged with, but told me to stamp my<br>fingerprint and sign on a document he would not let me see. Then he said<br>I would be released.<br><br>Then I was taken back to the Palestine Branch where I met the head of<br>the Syrian Military Intelligence and officials from the Canadian<br>Embassy. And then I was released.<br><br>I want to conclude by thanking all of the people who worked for my<br>release, especially my wife Monia, and human rights groups, and all the<br>people who wrote letters, and all the members of parliament who stood up<br>for justice.<br><br>Of course, I thank all of the journalists for covering my story.<br><br>The past year has been a nightmare, and I have spent the past few weeks<br>at home trying to learn how to live with what happened to me.<br><br>I know that the only way I will ever be able to move on in my life and<br>have a future is if I can find out why this happened to me.<br><br>I want to know why this happened to me. I believe the only way I can<br>ever know why this happened is to have all the truth come out in a<br>public inquiry.<br><br>My priority right now is to clear my name, get to the bottom of the case<br>and make sure this does not happen to any other Canadian citizens in the<br>future.<br><br>I believe the best way to go about achieving this goal is to put<br>pressure on the government to call for a public inquiry.<br><br>What is at stake here is the future of our country, the interests of<br>Canadian citizens, and most importantly Canada's international<br>reputation for being a leader in human rights where citizens from<br>different ethnic groups are treated no different than other Canadians.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>there're too many hoax anecdotes like this floating around on the internet, it's hard for us to believe something like this unless you can show some proof.<br><br>i wouldn't be surprised if something like this actually happened, desperate times cause desperate people, but until there's any proof, i won't believe it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually, I have been reading this on the newspapers too. (Canadian news).<br><br>It is true that he was captured. I was shocked that an unknown and innocent person can be forced into such destitude. It worries me that anyone travelling to the U.S. can be subjected to this kind of harressment.<br><br>What is most shocking to me that a lawyer was not allowed to intervine. Why shocking? In a democratic society, the few persons qualified to speak on our behalf is a lawyer, so if the lawyer is not allowed, where is the democracy? How can one prove his/her innocence if you are not even allowed to bring in a lawyer.<br><br>I don't think it is only about Canadians being subjected to this kind of harressment. It is just unfortunate that it happened to a Canadian.<br><br>Well, some might argue, that this is specifically targeted at Canadians because they objected to the Iraq war. But I think that is a whole other issue altogether.<br><br></div>
