              <p>It seems as if disaster after disaster is hitting the human race at a higher rate than in the past. It seems as if almost every day there is a new crisis or another earthquake in the world. Does anyone think the end of our current civillisation as we know it is coming? Some people have been predicting the 'reset' of human civillsation predicted by the Mayans in the year 2012, Many have divided opinions on how it is going to happen, some ways:</p>
              <p>1. Yellowstone Caldera in US may explode with enough force to cover the United States under 1 metre of volcanic ash and bring about another ice age</p>
              <p>2. Global warming accelerates to the point where the polar ice caps melt totally and plunge much of the world under water. Anyone remember "Waterworld"?</p>
              <p>3. Currently we are overdue for another Meteorite to hit the Earth and cause another species threatening event</p>
              <p>4. Supervirus like H5N1 bird flu becoming airborne and wiping out a third of the human race</p>
              <p>5. Another World War caused by the escalating prices of oil, because rising oil prices cause rising food prices worldwide, mass starvation and fighting breaks out, cumulating in Nuclear weapons being used, creating another Nuclear winter.</p>
              <p>Just wondering, cos I'm not a doomsday nut, but I think it would be really something if we saw the end of the world in our generation. I mean, everyone has gotta die sometime, right? When your time is up, means your time is up. I think the first way we will go is through global warming, where the polar ice caps melt and rising sea levels cause humankind to flee to higher ground. I just wonder how it would be like.</p>
              <p>Btw I don't believe in any religion, so all those crazy people expounding their own particular brand of poison fcuk off. People die, they are gone, thats it. There is no God.</p>

              <p>I know what you mean, but this time this 2012 prediction really seems to have a lot of scientific basis behind it.</p>
              <p>I think there is no more hope for the world already. The planet cannot support 6 billion people consuming and consuming. What can we do to save our planet if the governments of the world only want to sacrifice the environment and continue consuming natural resources?</p>

              <p>Don't be pessimistic. As Shakespear once said " nothing's good or bad but our thinking made it so". In the bigger scheme of things, everything has its place and role. <br><br>I may sound cruel but disaster has its place and purpose with regard to life. Throughout history, disaster regulates and controls human population growth. Until human becomes the Master of many things....</p>
              <p>According to wikipedia, our current world pop is 6.7 bil and it will be 9 bil in 2042. In the long run, can Mother Earth continues to sustain our blatant production? Seriously, <br>I can't see how without the help of Father Disaster.    <br><br>Here some websites on population growth.<br><a href="http://www.globalchange.umich.edu/globalchange2/current/lectures/human_pop/human_pop.html">http://www.globalchange.umich.edu/globalchange2/current/lectures/<br>human_pop/human_pop.html</a><br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_population">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_population</a><br><a href="http://desip.igc.org/populationmaps.html">http://desip.igc.org/populationmaps.html</a></p>

              <p>I tot you were being scientific?</p>
              <p>Even if all our polar ice caps melt, the world will not be totally covered in water, there will still be much land. In fact polar ice caps have totally melted before in our planet's history. The movie Waterworld, in has sea level as 28,000 feet above our current sea levels is obviously rubbish.</p>
              <p>There were virtually no polar ice caps in the time of the dinosaurs and they still had plenty of land to roam.</p>
              <p>The effects of all our polar ice caps melting would be quite different... a lot of coastal areas will be flooded and ecosystems thrown out of order, but life would still go on.</p>
              <p>A runaway greenhouse effect could also turn our planet into something like Venus however, that would be rather bad.</p>
              <p>I believe one guy once said something though: we don't have the power to safe the planet, life is tough enough to survive a lot of things, the real question is if we have the power to save ourselves.</p>

              <p>Although he does have a point there, I think that there have been so many bad events this year and only half a year has passed... Seems to be more than in previous years...</p>
              <p>You said something about an asteroid due to hit Earth? Do you have a source? From what I've read I believe most scientists agree that all that is crap, but maybe I was reading about a different something that was supposed to hit Earth.</p>

              <p><br>We don't have enough nukes to destroy the earth 6000 times over (the more often quoted figure is 4-5 times) as in destroy the physical earth... what this means is that we have enough warheads to end major human civilization as we know it by nuking every important town or city, effectively killing most of the world's human population.</p>
              <p>However this is nothing compared to the energy an extinction-level-event asteriod impact will release... ie. the one that some theorized killed off the dinosaurs, the energy released in that impact is many times that of our entire nuclear arsenal... in fact the energy released in such a disaster (ie. the one that is supposed to have killed the dinosaurs) is equal to several million nuclear warheads being exploded all in one instant at the impact spot.</p>
              <p>It releases much energy it can heat the surface of the earth worldwide to an average temperature of 100 degrees C. If you are not in shelter you will be boiled alive. The EMP shockwave released by the impact will also burn out all unshielded electronics worldwide, returning us to the dark ages.</p>
              <p>Also the ejecta thrown up by the impact will blot out the sun for months, causing worldwide temperatures to plummet and plant life (that still exists) to die, leading to a bloom and death of fungi when food for them runs out. Life on earth would certainly come to a standstill, but eventually recover in the long run as ecosystems spring back from the disaster.</p>
              <p>If human soceity survives that event is another thing to be see. </p>

              <p>A pandemic can lead to worldwide panic and market crashes as well as so many bad things that it just boggles the mind to think about it. But in such times war is certainly one of the things that can happen.</p>
              <p>At the end of the day, if you read up on chaos theory you'll know that it's very difficult to predict what will happen, but that when things go bad, generally they take a turn for the worse before the system starts to stabilize again.</p>
