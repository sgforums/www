              <p>I think ending soon .</p>
              <p>More and more earth quake .</p>
              <p>I got this theroy donno correct a not .</p>
              <p>I think the reason why more and more earthquake is happening is because . Humans are taking a lot of oil away from those underground holes . then after they finish taking those oil right . Then the hole empty already wat . Thats when the earth above will become to heavy and crush through the hole which once contain oil .</p>

              <p>It seems as if disaster after disaster is hitting the human race at a higher rate than in the past. It seems as if almost every day there is a new crisis or another earthquake in the world. Does anyone think the end of our current civillisation as we know it is coming? Some people have been predicting the 'reset' of human civillsation predicted by the Mayans in the year 2012, Many have divided opinions on how it is going to happen, some ways:</p>
              <p>1. Yellowstone Caldera in US may explode with enough force to cover the United States under 1 metre of volcanic ash and bring about another ice age</p>
              <p>2. Global warming accelerates to the point where the polar ice caps melt totally and plunge much of the world under water. Anyone remember "Waterworld"?</p>
              <p>3. Currently we are overdue for another Meteorite to hit the Earth and cause another species threatening event</p>
              <p>4. Supervirus like H5N1 bird flu becoming airborne and wiping out a third of the human race</p>
              <p>5. Another World War caused by the escalating prices of oil, because rising oil prices cause rising food prices worldwide, mass starvation and fighting breaks out, cumulating in Nuclear weapons being used, creating another Nuclear winter.</p>
              <p>Just wondering, cos I'm not a doomsday nut, but I think it would be really something if we saw the end of the world in our generation. I mean, everyone has gotta die sometime, right? When your time is up, means your time is up. I think the first way we will go is through global warming, where the polar ice caps melt and rising sea levels cause humankind to flee to higher ground. I just wonder how it would be like.</p>
              <p>Btw I don't believe in any religion, so all those crazy people expounding their own particular brand of poison fcuk off. People die, they are gone, thats it. There is no God.</p>

              <p>... I'm no Doomsday Nut either, but our ever increasing Human Footprint will eventually see to it that this planet, will become less and less hospitable to live in, given to the cause of Global Warming...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>... however, not being pessimistic but rather a believer that Lightning Does Strike Twice at the Same Tree, we're way overdue for another meteor the size of which, decimated the dinosaurs who were in existence for millions of years... we've only been around a couple of thousand years, and just look at the negative impact we have on planet Earth... and this is apart from the human race's warring tendencies...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>... with consideration of the above, even if Devine Judgement was to come upon us all, do you think we deserve the Benefit of a Doubt? Do we have sufficient Redeeming Attributes to extend our existence here? Personally, I am doubtful... but by the way of the Universe and calculated probabilities of the scientists and astrologists who have been studying Impact Earth, I am more apt to believe we will be seriously devastated by that long overdue Mother of all Meteors.... whether any of us will be left afterwhich, no one knows...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>... but we can all quite safely 'assume', Impact Earth will/may not happen in our lifetime...</p>

              <p>nonsense la.. the world has ALWAYS had tons of natural disasters and all kinds of shit happening to it. The only difference now is that we have CNN and BBC and Channelnewsasia to tell you about it. You take away global media, and you think you'll know about the indonesian tsunami ? the myanmar cyclone ? the china earthquake ? 911 ?</p>
