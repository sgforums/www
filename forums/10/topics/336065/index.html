              <p><strong>Point #1</strong></p>
              <p>Dramatic epic collapse of the US dollar. It could be a elaborate sinister ploy to plunder world money, collapse economies. Increasing elite pay salaries and civil services</p>
              <p><strong>Point #2 </strong></p>
              <p>"Why did they fail to detect or prevent 9/11? Because they didn't have enough money. So we'll give them billions more."</p>
              <p><strong>Point #3</strong></p>
              <p>The US is in debt and social security has made it a bankrupt</p>
              <p><strong>Point #4</strong></p>
              <p>Suspicious evidence have been found regarding the investigations on 9/11 that it may be a deliberate conspiracy</p>
              <p><strong>Point #5</strong></p>
              <p>Why is the F.B.I. still failing in its fight against terrorism? Because the rights of American citizens are preventing the agency from carrying out its job.</p>
              <p><strong>Point # 6</strong></p>
              <p> American citizens had assumed that the Patriot Act and the FBI Guidelines assured that only foreign aliens could be placed in military detention centers, unprotected by the U.S. constitution. But on June 10, 2002, an American citizen was declared by Bush, without due process, to be an "enemy combatant" and to have no constitutional protections. This American citizen was thrown into a naval brig in South Carolina.</p>
              <p><strong>Point #7</strong></p>
              <p>The Bush administration wants us to believe that we are in an actual state of war--and therefore must operate under restricted wartime civil liberties. You can't take a government seriously when it says we're in a state of war and yet refuses to reduce the record-breaking number of immigrants it's allowing into the country each day.</p>
              <p><strong>Point # 8</strong></p>
              <p>the parallels between Nazi Germany and the Bush administration are striking. Bush's creeping police state is being ushered in through exactly the same means that Hitler used to overpower the German people.</p>
              <p><strong>Point #9</strong></p>
              <p>With the world economies in rubble, the NWO agenda pushes on to influence all the governments in the world who are dependent on the US dollar to follow its example to stay in power</p>

              <p>Again let me state as i have done so earlier, there are signs of

              <p>New World Order may or may not become a phenomenon.  a phenomenon often refers to an extraordinary event. But any event which has similar  characteristics may be considered as one  . In philosophy, the use of the word phenomenon differs from other uses in that it refers to perceived events. Phenomena may be perceived through a person's senses or with their mind.</p>
              <p>The noumenon (plural: noumena) classically refers to an object of human inquiry, understanding or cognition.</p>
              <p> Roughly, a noumenon may be distinguished from the following concepts, although there is debate of the synonymity between them:<br>Thing-in-itself, an actual object and its properties independent of any observer.<br>the Absolute, the totality of things; all that is, whether it has been discovered or not.</p>
              <p>For example take the phenomenon of a Possession. A possession is someone who has been taken over by the demon or devil. Till now there has been no evidence of demons or satans but the phenomenon of possession is often attributed to psychological conditions by the medical world. Here, we have 2 different views - one from a superstitious/religious point of view while the other is from a scientific point of view. But both refer to the same event. and one explaination cannot try to discredit the other mainly because one is not proven to be true yet. so in that sense it doesnt mean that the particular explaination does not exist.</p>
