Your mother is the administrator of the money, so we call her the <br>Government. <br>3. We're here to take care of your needs, so we'll call you the People. <br>4. The nanny, we'll consider her the Working Class. <br>5. And your baby brother, we'll call him the Future.</p>
              <p>"Now, think about that and see if it makes sense." <br>So, the little boy goes off to bed thinking about what Dad has said.</p>
              <p>Later that night, he hears his baby brother crying, so he gets up to check on him.</p>
              <p>He finds that the baby has severely soiled his diaper.</p>
              <p>So, the little boy goes to his parent's room and finds his mother sound asleep.</p>
              <p>Not wanting to wake her, he goes to the nanny's room. <br>Finding the door locked, he looks in the peephole and finds his father in bed with the Nanny.</p>
              <p>He gives up and goes back to bed.</p>
              <p>The next morning, the little boy says to his father, "Dad, I think I understand the concept of politics now."</p>
              <p>The father says, "Good, son, tell me in your own words what you think politics is all about." <br>The little boy replies, "The President is screwing the Working Class, while the Government is sound asleep. The People are being ignored and the Future is in deep shit."</p>

              <p>u dont need it at least according to the PAP. coz it will give them more overheads and inconvenience, so rather than concentrating on more important issue, the PAP will need to spend more time to "fix" you if u have more civil rights.</p>

              <p>A little boy goes to his dad and asks, "What are Politics?"</p>
              <p>Dad says, "Well son, let me try to explain it this way:<br> 1. I'm the head of the family, so call me The President.<br> 2. Your mother is the administrator of the money, so we call her
              the<br> Government.<br> 3. We're here to take care of your needs, so we'll call you the
              People.<br> 4. The nanny, we'll consider her the Working Class.<br> 5. And your baby brother, we'll call him the Future.</p>
              <p>"Now, think about that and see if it makes sense."<br> So, the little boy goes off to bed thinking about what Dad has
              said.</p>
              <p>Later that night, he hears his baby brother crying, so he gets
              up to check on him.</p>
              <p>He finds that the baby has severely soiled his diaper.</p>
              <p>So, the little boy goes to his parent's room and finds his
              mother sound asleep.</p>
              <p>Not wanting to wake her, he goes to the nanny's room.<br> Finding the door locked, he looks in the peephole and finds his
              father in bed with the Nanny.</p>
              <p>He gives up and goes back to bed.</p>
              <p>The next morning, the little boy says to his father, "Dad, I
              think I understand the concept of politics now."</p>
              <p>The father says, "Good, son, tell me in your own words what you
              think politics is all about."<br> The little boy replies, "The President is screwing the Working
              Class, while the Government is sound asleep. The People are being
              ignored and the Future is in deep shit."</p>
              <p>LOL. Can you believe how true that is?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>its just something i found in some other forums but if you would
              switch the roles properly u guys should see it that its the same
              with singapore. The government is screwing with us whereas the
              president is asleep</p>

              <p>I think you can pretty much use that to describe every country in the world really.</p>
