            <div class='col-md body'>SINGAPORE : The Singapore Government is restoring the monthly pay cuts taken by political, statutory and judicial appointment holders as well as Administrative Service officers over the past four years.<br><br>The restoration will be done in two steps on July 1 this year and January 1 next year.<br><br>A statement from the Prime Minister's Office says pay is being restored because the economy has recovered and is growing again.<br><br>The first pay cut of up to 10 percent took place in November 2001 because of the highly uncertain economic outlook after the September 11 terrorist attacks.<br><br>The second cut, again of up to 10 percent, was in July 2003 after the SARS outbreak.<br><br>The cuts affect not just ministers and senior civil servants but also the President, judges and Administrative Service officers.<br><br>On top of the restoration, the Government is also changing the way public sector salaries are adjusted.<br><br>To keep public sector pay competitive, it has been automatically benchmarked to selected salaries in the private sector since 1994.<br><br>But in the 10 years since then, adjustments were only made in four years, because economic conditions have been unstable and private sector pay has been more variable then expected.<br><br>So from now adjustments will no longer be automatic.<br><br>The Government will still track private sector pay, but it will also take into account the broader state of the economy each year. - CNA<br><br>[/quote]<br><br>tts fast...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

I doubt Mr. Lee vision of releasing these top scholars or civil servants back to the private sector or be entreprenuers will yield much results. they have too much a comfortable life in the public sector. but on the other hand, i really want to see how these top scholars can prove to us they can stop hiding behind their scholar tag and survive on their own.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Today's papers (18th June 2004) featured a small but bloody interesting article. 400 top politicians, civil servants, etc will have their pay reinstated by 10% then another 14-19% (total 24-39%)by 2005. This is in lieu of the improving economy. WTF... Hmmm let's look at yesterday's papers (17th June 2004)... 990 new millionaires, with at least S$1.7 million in liquid assets! Civil servants count amongst these well-heeled folks too...<br><br>I cannot understand what is going through the minds of these people. Let's do the maths: using the recent article on well-paid administrative officers with an average salary of around S$300k, we're looking at around S$2000-$3000 in pay restoration, easily. That's S$1 million in restored pay, per month, and to well-heeled individuals mind you. People who don't bat an eyelid for $3000. What's $1 million? Twenty-five thousand ordinary folks can benefit with a $400 pay increase per month with that cool million! TWENTY-FIVE THOUSAND needy Singaporeans... compared to 400 who don't need it.<br><br>The rich get richer, the poor stay poor... when times SEEM bad, you cut and squeeze. When times SEEM good, you reward yourselves. To ordinary folks like you and me, it makes no sense at all.<br><br>I liken Singapore to a tree. If a tree is weak, you water it, you give it fertilizer, you tend it. You basically strengthen the roots. Then in turn, the leaves, flowers and fruits are beautiful, bountiful and strong. The tree stands tall and strong.<br><br>However, if you turn it around... when a tree is weak, you tend the flowers, the leaves, you pay attention to the top, neglecting the foundation. In the end, the tree will fall, regardless of how wonderfully kept the top was.<br><br>Even if you want to run Singapore like Singapore Inc, please treat the employees well. If not, your erstwhile loyal employees are going to jump ship. Trust me on that.<br><br>Lau Ah Pek<br>18.06.04<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br></div>
