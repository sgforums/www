But in financial terms, it is a large transaction, in the region of 3.5 billion pounds.<br><br>"And the financial implications would really depend on the eventual financing structure and the level of pressure it brings to bear on the financial profile of the ultimate acquirer."<br><br>While the P&amp;O board has made its recommendation based on price, some say the strength of the bidding company is a key factor to consider.<br><br>Roger Tan, Investment Analyst, SIAS Research, said, "The target company will usually look at a few other points. One, is that the management that is taking over the company has a good track record. Two, when the management comes in, whether their corporate culture would gel with the target company's corporate culture. Last but not least, whether the management that is coming in would be able to add value to the firm after taking over. So price is not the only major consideration."<br><br>A tie-up between P&amp;O and PSA would create the world's largest ports group.<br><br>PSA has not disclosed how it plans to finance the P&amp;O purchase, and there are concerns it may take on too much debt.<br><br>Dubai Ports, on the other hand, is reported to have issued a US$3.5 billion Islamic bond last month to fund the deal. - CNA/ms<br><br><a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporebusinessnews/view/192243/1/.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporebusinessnews/view/192243/1/.html</a><br><br></div>

Hillary Clinton of New York and Robert Menendez of New Jersey</a></strong> said they will file legislation prohibiting companies owned or controlled by foreign governments from purchasing port operations in the United States, citing national security dangers. The bill targets the sale of the British firm P&amp;O Ports to Dubai Ports World.---<br>BY STEVE HARRISON,sharrison@MiamiHerald.com.18.02.2006.<br><br><blockquote><br>''Our ports are the front lines of the war on terrorism. They are both vulnerable targets for attack and venues for smuggling and human trafficking,'' Menendez said. ``We wouldn't turn the border patrol or the customs service over to a foreign government, and we can't afford to turn our ports over to one either.''<br><br>Earlier this week, both Republican and Democratic lawmakers expressed concern about the Dubai deal's impact on national security, as well as what some say was the ''secretive'' manner in which a U.S. government committee signed off on the sale.<br></blockquote>2.<strong><a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060219/ap_on_re_us/port_security;_ylt=AmVTVmz_bXjj..hb1z2aA9d34T0D;_ylu=X3oDMTBjMHVqMTQ4BHNlYwN5bnN1YmNhdA--" rel="nofollow">Firm Sues to Block Foreign Port Takeover</a></strong><br><br><blockquote><br><br>By TED BRIDIS, Associated Press Writer ,18.02.2006.<br><br>WASHINGTON - A company at the Port of Miami has sued to block the takeover of shipping operations there by a state-owned business in the United Arab Emirates. It is the first American courtroom effort to capsize a $6.8 billion sale already embroiled in a national debate over security risks at six major U.S. ports affected by the deal. .............<br><br>A New Jersey lawmaker said Saturday he intends to require U.S. port security officials be American citizens, to prevent overseas companies operating domestic shipping facilities from hiring foreigners in such sensitive positions. Republican Frank A. LoBiondo, chairman of the Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Subcommittee, cited "significant" security worries over the sale to Dubai Ports World.<br><br>In New York, families of some victims from the September 2001 terror attacks planned to criticize the deal during a press conference Sunday with Democratic Sen. Charles Schumer (news, bio, voting record), a leading critic of the sale. Schumer said he is dubious any assurances can justify involvement by the United Arab Emirates in American ports.<br><br>Schumer and other critics have cited the UAE's history as an operational and financial base for the hijackers who carried out the attacks against New York and Washington.<br><br>"A lot of families are incensed by this, because you're talking about the safety of the country," said William Doyle, whose son Joseph died at the World Trade Center. ""We have a problem already in our ports because all of our containers aren't checked, but now they want to add this unknown?
