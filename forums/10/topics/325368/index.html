              <div class="article-publish">
              <p class="author">By Chris Smith</p>
              <p class="published-date">July 24, 2008 12:00am</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p class="standfirst"><strong style="display: block;">I CAST my memory back to an Australian-born blonde, who was arrested in Bangkok in 1996 for smuggling drugs.</strong></p>
              <p>With
                  4kg of cannabis and 500 amphetamine tablets, she faced a death
                  sentence. There she sat, curled up and weeping, inside Lard Yao women's
                  prison, also known as the "Bangkok Hilton".</p>
              <p>To describe this facility as dangerous and disgusting is supremely
                  generous. She was sitting with 120 other women, in a rat-infested dorm.</p>
              <p>Soon after, her rich daddy came to the rescue, posting $80,000 bail.
                  An Australian Embassy car took her from prison and she was never seen
                  in public again.</p>
              <p>Twelve years later, Lisa Marie Smith remains one of the world's most wanted fugitives.</p>
              <p>Some reports say she could be in Europe, maybe Greece, where she has undergone cosmetic surgery to avoid detection.</p>
              <p>Australian Peter Lloyd, a well-read journalist who has reported on
                  the fate of Schapelle Corby and the Bali Nine, may well have thought of
                  Lisa Marie Smith's escape when he was granted release from a Singapore
                  jail yesterday after posting $45,000 bail.</p>
              <p>Escape is a risky manoeuvre. If it backfires, it could see him
                  slapped with 20 additional years on whatever sentence he got if found
                  guilty for drug trafficking and/or possession of the drug ice.</p>
              <p>Is there room, secretly, to adopt the Michelle Leslie strategy, and
                  pay his way out of the more serious charges? In the days after her
                  arrest, Leslie's boyfriend made a series of cash transfers, which have
                  since been alleged to be the first steps towards bribing her way out of
                  police custody.</p>
              <p>That is justice Bali-style, but in strict Singapore that could see him face further charges.</p>
              <p>Instead he could defend his serious charges of seemingly indefensible proportions - a perilous route to traverse.</p>
              <p>Not for me, not ever. He should flee the region at the first opportunity. I would, without question.</p>
              <p>Walking into one of Asia's most filthy and intimidating jails will
                  immediately convert anyone to angelic pursuits. Whether it's
                  Singapore's Changi Prison, or Bangkok's Bang Kwang maximum-security
                  jail, it's enough to bring on acute nausea.</p>
              <p>At the latter jail, nearly 8000 men in death row conditions serve
                  sentences of 20 years or more for big-ticket crimes - from drug
                  smuggling to murder.</p>
              <p>I met convicted drug trafficker Paul Hudson there in the '80s. Maybe
                  it was the ball and chain that threw me most; then again, the decrepit
                  and putrid group cells turned my stomach.</p>
              <p>Then there was the sight of the late Australian League player Paul
                  Hayward, shivering and sickly in his cell. The armed guards had this
                  sneering nastiness, like some tatty gang of bandits ready to maim the
                  next prisoner who stepped out of line.</p>
              <p>These are the realities now facing our alleged drug trafficker and
                  popular TV reporter as he contemplates life in his own unmitigated hell
                  hole. He has lost his career. He now risks contracting disease, such as
                  HIV through prison rape. And reports of his status as a gay man will
                  not help.</p>
              <p>My advice is to run, Peter, run - because there's a ball and chain with your name on it.</p>
              <p>Why your first-hand experiences of life inside such deadly squalor,
                  gained as a reporter, were not enough to steer you clear of trouble in
                  this region, is an unfathomable mystery to me.</p>

              <p>he is not suggesting anything offiensive i believe...but something hidden in the lines betweenChangi  and Bankok jails ect...Cant be sure, maybe heis  meaning to say something degrading about singapore,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But i agree Loyd with his expereince as a journalist should know better not to mess around with drug laws in s'pore.. He is not an ordinary ignorant aussie, he is  well travelled and knowledgeable, probably complacency did him in.</p>

              foreign correspondent Peter Lloyd has vowed to stay in Singapore to
              face drug charges that could put him in jail for 20 years.</strong></p>
              <p>While
              there have been calls for him to run, Lloyd, 41, told The Sun-Herald
              yesterday: "I've never ever considered attempting to flee. I will
              remain in Singapore."....</p>
              <p>Some commentators have suggested Lloyd should jump bail and run. The
              legal source said if he did he would never be able to return to
              Australia due to an extradition agreement between the countries.</p>
              <p>"If I were to jump, I would not go to a country with a treaty. I
              should go to Indonesia or Thailand. I have seen some people do it," he
              said.</p>

              <p>read the Oz medias lately so u can understand some of their views better.</p>
              <p>Who dunt know SG is a dictator's country?</p>
              <p>I am proud to be one of the en-slaved citizen!!</p>
              <p>We need not scrap to the back page of Status to get laws</p>
              <p>to fix any one who sells drugs.</p>
              <p>Our penalty is inhuman.<span style="color: #ff0000;">But to distribute drugs then destory </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">lifes of drugs addicts  and their family is worse.</span></p>
              <p>So SG is ,again,proud to be inhuman to prevent more addicts and their</p>
              <p>family to be destoryed.</p>
              <p>If there are two evils we have to choose one.We choose the</p>
              <p>less.</p>
              <p>u have been warned and still sell drugs here!!</p>
              <p>How brave u are!!</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">2.Sell drugs and still not hurting anyone?</span></p>
              <p>SG people.WE have a big culture gap here with Oz about drugs.</p>
              <p>In down under,some 40% of adults have tried illict drugs.</p>
              <p>http://www.crikey.com.au/Your-Say/20080722-Comments-corrections-clarifications-and-cckups.html</p>
              <blockquote>Statistics from the Illicit Drug Reporting Survey indicate that at
              least 40% of adult Australians have used an illicit drug at some point
              during their lives -- overwhelmingly they do not go on to become
              regular and problematic users, instead they are indistinguishable from
              other members of the community.</blockquote>
              <p>Some of them become addicted.</p>
              <p>u can get drugs there much easier than SG.</p>

              <blockquote>So if the Singaporean government, which by the way is a virtual
              <span style="color: #ff0000;">dictatorship</span>, wants to crack down on stuff - why not start on
              employment law?<br><br>That might be a good idea - instead of scraping
              the barrel to find new, interesting and ridiculous laws to charge Peter
              Lloyd with.  <span style="color: #ff0000;">A guy who wasn’t hurting anyone</span>.</blockquote>
