How much did you give? </div></blockquote>ok, here is some action which i think not many of us are aware of:<br><br>An Honest Day's Pay for an Honest Day's Work?<br>By Sylvia Lim<br><br>Sylvia, Chairman of the Workers' Party, is a Law Lecturer and a former police inspector<br><br>Singaporeans cannot afford to be arrogant these days. From being one of the 4 Asian tigers of the 1990s, Singapore's economic growth has been falling behind the rest of the developing Asian economies since the Asian financial crisis in 1997 (M Bhaskaran, 2004). Competition from low-cost countries who have built up capabilities has forced painful restructuring of businesses in Singapore in order to attract job-creating investments and to reduce off-shoring of existing Singapore jobs.<br><br>Faced with pressures to reduce costs, businesses invariably look at manpower costs. At the national level, policies have been changed to reduce wage bills e.g. reversal of the decision to restore the employers' Central Provident Fund contributions back to 20%, discouraging seniority-based wages and promoting flexi-wages.<br><br>To what extent will pro-employer policies be pursued at the expense of workers? Changes to the Employment Act passed by Parliament on Sep 21, 2004, should raise alarm bells for Singapore workers.<br><br>What happened in Parliament<br><br>By the amendments, the Commissioner for Labour was given the power to allow certain employers not to pay for extra work done by non-executive workers earning not more than $1,600 per month. Such extra work would include working overtime and working on rest days and holidays. Prior to the changes, such employees were statutorily protected under the Employment Act when they did extra work, being entitled to be paid not just their basic hourly pay but also 1.5 to 2 times their basic pay. The recent amendments are so wide that it is likely that, with the Commissioner's approval, the worker may receive no pay at all for the extra work done.<br><br>In moving the amendments, Acting Minister for Manpower told MPs that employers needed flexibility to deploy their work force. According to him, business cycles would mean there would be busy periods and lull periods. Therefore, employers should be allowed to give workers time-off during lull periods and, correspondingly, extra work done during busy periods would not be paid but would be compensated by time off during lull periods. The purpose of this restructure, as is the often-cited purpose in Singapore for any wage restructure, is to save jobs.<br><br>In exercising his power under the amended Section 41A of the Employment Act, the Commissioner for Labour will exempt employers from paying workers for extra work after considering "the operational needs of the employer and the interests of workers".<br><br>In opposing the amendments, Workers' Party Secretary-General and MP for Hougang Low Thia Khiang highlighted that the change would have the effect of removing protections for the low wage earners who had the weakest bargaining power with their employers, particularly in this lacklustre job market. Instead of having the law to safeguard them, the amendment would expose them to exploitation.<br><br>Impossible task for Commissioner for Labour<br><br>As businesses are generally run to derive maximum returns for shareholders, many employers would guarantee their employees only the minimum required under the law. Now that the law has allowed the Commissioner to grant exemptions, it is certain that employers would want to put up cases for exemption.<br><br>How will the Commissioner perform this virtually impossible task of excusing employers from paying employees, and say that it is for the employees' own good? The justification will probably come down to one of employers' costs. If the wage bill eats into the employer's profits, such that retrenchments are an option the employer is considering, then the Commissioner may exempt the employer from paying employees for extra work in order to forestall the retrenchments.<br><br>What severity of employer's "operational needs" would justify the Commissioner's exemption of employers? Would it be just to ensure the company breaks even, or to ensure that profitable companies keep up their profit margins to maximise shareholder's returns? Singapore has already seen pre-emptive retrenchments in profitable government-linked companies such as the PSA (Port of Singapore Authority), which were supported by the government as necessary moves. There is hence no assurance that, after all the pain of working extra for free, the worker's job is secure.<br><br>How the worker will be affected<br><br>Arguments that the worker will be compensated with time-off in lieu of pay are little comfort to him due to the heavy price he will have to pay.<br><br>First, he may be required to work longer hours within a working day or week, for no extra pay. For instance, he may be required to work for longer than 8 or 9 hours per day, or longer than 44 hours per week. Secondly, he may be required to work on rest days or on holidays, for no pay.<br><br>Prior to the changes, workers working extra hours sacrificed rest, and family and social life, because they were assured of supplementary income. Now, they may be required to do extra work for no pay, to be compensated by time-off, which will probably be given at a time of the employer's choosing. The time-off could be given even several months down the road.<br><br>On the other hand, there may also be workers who hold a second job due to the low wages they earn in the first job. By impinging on their time after work and on rest days / holidays, their ability to earn extra income will be curtailed. This could be dire for some families.<br><br>It is interesting to note here that, according to the Labour Force Survey Report 2003 (Ministry of Manpower), the average working hours for the poorly educated was higher (51 hours per week) than the national average (49 hours). The Report attributed this to the fact that more hours had to be put in to earn a living for the less educated (and presumably, poorer paid). Cleaners, labourers and related workers worked an average of 58 hours per week, with the average for female workers in this category being 62.3 hours per week.<br><br>Some might argue that the worker could always leave for a more scrupulous employer if things got too bad. If jobs were in abundance, probably so, but a lot would depend on prevailing market conditions and the mobility of the particular worker.<br><br>In the current employers' labour market where good jobs are not easy to come by, many workers may not be able to be choosers. Two days after the changes were passed in Parliament, the local media highlighted the outsourcing of jobs by SATS (Singapore Airport Terminal Services, a subsidiary of Singapore Airlines). A cleaner earning $1,400 per month whose job was outsourced told the media that she had been offered the same job by the new contractor for less than $1,000 per month and had to take it because she needed the job to support a child.<br></div>

It is not easy to see one's own fault or shortcomings no matter how enlightened or intelligent one may be.<br><br>Therefore, I must admit the in my postings about process management, I might have committed certain errors too like the emperor's new clothes.<br><br>Anyway, I would take this opportunity to explain certain things about my posting.<br><br>I wish to say that my objective is not to impose any management ideas or concepts on anyone. Rather I had posted strongly in some instances on process management to show that there are alternative solutions to many of our current top-down intuitive autocracy based on the man and his ideas system or belief.<br><br>In my opinion any management or government that is based on such self-centred policies and intuitive controls practised by our top-down system of government will only achieve so much and no more. It has a lot of limitations.<br><br>Process management called OSP was posted at thread "Practical Efficiency and Productivity" in Market Place of this forum having been published in the Recruit of ST on 27.12.2004 of the same name. People may not find process management useful because of prevalent past habits with intuitive decisions and ad hoc management practices. It may take some time for people to discover its usefulness to go for processes to be objective, accountable and involve the whole team to produce implementation efficiency and results.<br><br>In Singapore, because we are too strongly based on intuitive personal efficiency, we have been encountering a great deal of problems with implementation to date. Many governemnt policies or economic restructuring plans do not receive the fullest implementation support of all staff of the whole governemnt because they have remained as intuitive - policies or assumptions. I need not elaborate for its merits or demerits as I believe my posts at Market Place of this forum can be read and verified by many of its own rationale and merits. May be it will take time and patience for people to test out the process management beneifits.<br><br><blockquote><strong>have you not realized that large numbers of your threads have very few relevent replies and that there have been very few responses to the specific issues raised in your posts?<br><br>Maybe Its me.

How?</strong></blockquote>In posting in forum, we are all equal. My opinions are not higher than anyone. I feel that you should not feel constrained in any way by my views on management as they are just my opinions. Just be patient and read my rationale in those posts mentioned and test out the ideas if you will.<br><br><blockquote><strong>You said<br>---<br>"through internalizing natural efficiency and knowledge applications and teamwork into attainable accountable and transparent work processes."<br>---<br>wtf does that mean?  wtf is 'natural efficiency' and 'knowledge applications'?  I guess you are saying:<br><br>Have a focus on efficiency and applying knowledge (meaning wat? being able to apply what you help you complete the task at habnd?) and teamwork at every level. Set realistic targets, and monitor progress towards those targets.?</strong></blockquote>The existing management habits are too much entrenched in selfness and intuitions or talents or ability of individuals or the man at the helm or one man show. If we want to be good efficient or excellent or competitive, such a system will not work.<br><br>The alternative is to enable or empower staff through setting work processes so that they can take over the implementation if not part of the decisions making at the operation level. If Singapore is to succeed in competing with the world competitiveness, I personally believe it has to avoid and tone down on individualism and  top-heavy management system depending on one-man become efficient or competitive.<br><br>To do so, there has to be enabling work processes with organizations practising delegations through open and accountable work processes instead of going for micro-management as seen happening too often in our system.<br><br><blockquote><strong>You also said:<br><br>---<br>"Empower all staff and people and try not to be over-judgmental or overtake them with assumptions, ideas and concepts which at the end will only restrict creativity, entrepreneurship and contributions.<br><br>Mistakes in education streaming, CL2, over-promotion of academic talents at the expense of practical knowledge applications and oversight in economic restructuring to value-adding high technology model are all caused by top-down system which restrict our scholars  to move more shiftly and creatively forward to reach higher plain."</strong></blockquote>Many policies of our government did not succeed because there are abstract ideas, concepts or assumptions not easily understood or implemented by all.<br><br>There have been many feedbacks in forum pages of Straits Times on this topic - all talks and no actions or lack of midfielders in our systems.<br><br>It is sad but true that after many years we still hear a lot about the same policy and nothing much was accomplished due to lack of attainable empowering work processes below the senior officers or leaders to make things happen.<br><br>I have suggested in many posts how the policies should be made more attainable in processes. Read my posts about "Leaderships" at Market place.<br><br>---<br><br><blockquote><strong>huh?<br><br>Do you mean:<br><br>Leadesr should not stifle the Staff but should allow them leeway to contribute and exhibit creativity and entrepreneurship. To this end, Leaders should be open-minded and not stick rigidly to their own ideas and concepts.<br><br>(The governemnt) has made many mistakes.<br><br>In education, some of these mistakes include the streaming system, recent de-emphasis on the chinese langauge(?).

They are unable to exercise creativity, etc and their develpment have been handicapped as a result.<br><br></strong></blockquote>Our society has to change a lot of its past management habits and practices on developing personal efficiency, abilities and talents.<br><br>Such a system is too individualistic and cannot bring about change. Change can happen only in my opinion through the intervention of process management where staff will know what to do and how to implement all decisions and policies. We have as a top-down management system neglected coordination and mass knowledge applications which can happen only when all are practising process management. I hope you will now understand a little more about my posts concerning management.</div>
