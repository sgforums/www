            <div class='col-md body'>Buildings are built for a purpose. There is already a oversupply of office space in CBD area. Building for the sake of building is not good policy. Take for example KL.. till today, the Petronas Towers has never been fully occupied.<br><br>Simply going high is not that easy. Imagine the footprint required for carpark + the traffic scheme around that area.<br><br>Take a look at the Suntec Area.. traffic situation is quite bad already.<br><br>If want a "pride" structure.. Me think.. the Istana.. should be retrofitted into a theme park while still serving as the CEO office. With people mover systems that allow ppl to peek into the cabinet meeting rooms.. This.... then really first in the world.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Anyway, if I'm not wrong, the proximity of the CBD to Changi Airport forbids the building of extremely tall structures. Apparently there's a limit to how tall buildings can be before they start to affect the airspace for aircraft.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>interesting that PM lee made a similar comment which appears in today's straits time's headlines. at least they are considering letting the height rule go. anyway, not necesarily do these buildings need to be funded by the govt. the world financial centre in shanghai is funded by a businessman. the tallest buildings in singapore now are owned by banks. maybe at most the new building might be a new home for temasek holdings, where from the top they can literally look on the world...like an evil empire...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think national pride in local singaporeans are low enough- being overseas- I frequently  (over)hear singaporean students asking each other about how to get permanent residency in australia. If I am to open a migration consultancy - probably I would make alot of money from singaporeans in Australia who are eager to get the prized pr ship here.<br><br>Jobs are scarce. So do we add another building to boost local pride? No. Money should be injected into the economy to help singaporeans find a job. Policies should be changed to protect the jobs of fellow singaporeans. Help should be given instead of saying one is responsible for the whole family when one cannot help it. Elitism should be lessened but now we all know it is a fallacy if we are talking about abolishing elitism.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Singapore is still a young nation with many fundementals to solidify - our administration is still quite shaky, even though they do not admit it. Even Lee Kwan Yew has admitted to being a bit of a gambler with certain policies. Certainly, our current status does not qualify us to have a structure for "national pride"?<br><br>Furthermore, our economy is still trying to regain its footing after the recent bout of economic crisis, with more to come, given the weak US dollar, and the high price of oil, which our economy needs. Why spend money on something that people might not neccessarily like/agree on?<br><br>The Esplanade was controversial enough, are you sure that Singaporeans would stomach another facade such as a simple structure for us to show off to the world?<br><br>There are many things to consider indeed, and these two are just but a few of them before we even start thinking of building.</div>

Singapore currently only has one(to me) building of true international fame and of national pride, and that is the esplanade. i personally feel that we need something that is known worldwide to the people at home, not to sailors(keppel harbour) or travelling businessmen(changi airport).<br><br>with the new city extension at marina bay, i feel a new world's tallest, or at least within the top 5 should be built in singapore. we are one of world's greatest financial centers(second richest at the last time i checked). such a structure would also imbue incredible national pride.(realistically, other than arts savy people, who are truely proud of the esplanade anyway?)<br><br>please offer your opinions.    </div></blockquote>We already got our very own COE, GST, ERP etc etc which is a REAL  national pride <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"></div>
