              <p><strong>By Zakir Hussain</strong></p>
              <p>FOR 50 years, the PAP has stayed in power because it has delivered progress to the people, its leaders often point out.</p>
              <p>But Law Minister K. Shanmugam feels younger voters can erode its dominant position should the party fail to convince them that Singapore, more than most countries, needs a strong leadership and a political system that allows for effective and speedy decisions to be made.</p>
              <p>He gave this warning to his party members in an editorial in the latest People's Action Party bi-monthly magazine, Petir.</p>
              <p>Mr Shanmugam appears to have his eye on the clock when he issued his word of caution, saying no political party had stayed in power continuously for more than 70 years.</p>
              <p>The way for the PAP to outlive this record, he feels, is to provide greater political education for Singaporeans, in particular, students.</p>
              <p>However, he said: 'The education should not trumpet the virtues of any particular system.'</p>
              <p>Instead, students should be taught, among other things, how political systems work in different cultures, the impact of geographical and social factors on societies and why city states rise and fall.</p>
              <p>'This will make people look carefully at the liberal democratic model and help them decide which aspects best suit Singapore,' he said as he set out how the PAP can communicate better its message that Singapore needs good governance and that only the PAP can deliver it.</p>
              <p>His concern comes at a time when a younger generation of better-educated voters feels the political process and system in a democratic state should be based on the Western model of liberal democracy.</p>
              <p>Mr Shanmugam and government leaders reject the view, arguing that the best systems are those that fit the society they govern.</p>
              <p>'Not every aspect can be transplanted in toto across cultures, without regard to different economic, social and geostrategic situations,' said the Law Minister.</p>
              <p>It is a position he has argued vigorously in favour of in the past three months: first to a group of international lawyers meeting here in October, then the Harvard alumni in Singapore last week, and now, PAP members.</p>
              <p>Mr Shanmugam, who is also Second Home Affairs Minister, said the PAP's message had resonated with the older generation who experienced the turmoil of Singapore's early years.</p>
              <p>'But the collective memory of this is not as strong among newer generations, whose viewpoints will increasingly influence the political process,' he added.</p>
              <p>Younger Singaporeans may therefore believe that the Western model of liberal democracy can be adopted without trade-offs, he said.</p>
              <p>'Singaporeans are entitled to decide whether they want the trade-offs.</p>
              <p>'And if the majority chooses slower development and a lower quality of life, and is willing to accept more tensions within our society in return for changes in the political system, then so be it,' he said.</p>
              <p>'But that choice must be an informed one,' he added.</p>

              <p>But their real goal is to indoctrinate young people to vote for PAP and counter online criticism of PAP. Young people surf net see critics of PAP, so now back in school must counter the critics, so start "education" camapaign.</p>

              <p><br>if the real goal is to indoctrinate pple to love pap and secure their power, then dont have to adopt democracy system liao....might as well go the way of the communists and stifle the voice and aspirations of the nation...like that the pap will hang on to power all along without the need for us to vote and we sing the pap march song from kindergarten and be totally absorbed into its propaganda.....</p>
              <p>it is the our distinguished education system that has put us ahead in many fields (but only alas to be restricted by its small populace) and make us marketable in world economy and attractive to many other foreign students to come here to realise their full potential.....</p>
              <p>most of us are politically apathetic is because we are victims of our own progress in this short impressive history of our country..looking back,.... and which most of us cant deny.</p>
