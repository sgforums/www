              <p class="intro"><em><strong>''THE
                  proposed national science curriculum risks sending science education
                  backwards, with the nation's deans warning the course is beyond the
                  skills of most teachers and fails to provide a grounding in "real
                  science".</strong></em></p>
              <p><em>In a submission to the National
                  Curriculum Board, the Australian Council of Deans of Science,
                  representing almost all the nation's universities, says the curriculum
                  needs to have the traditional disciplines of physics, chemistry,
                  biology and mathematics at its centre. </em></p>
              <p><em>The national curriculum proposes teaching science through to Year 10
                  by focusing on big issues, such as climate change, in order to teach
                  scientific thinking and processes and reveal the underlying
                  disciplines. Separate subjects in physics, chemistry and biology would
                  not appear until Years 11 and 12. </em></p>
              <p><em>The council says the approach "requires far greater discipline
                  expertise" than the current model, and "runs a very high risk of
                  failure" given the shortage of science and maths teachers and the
                  drafting of other teachers into these subjects. </em></p>
              <p><em>The deans instead propose organising the science curriculum around
                  the key phenomena in the universe. ACDS executive director John Rice
                  said science was the exploration of a range of phenomena that occurred
                  in our world. </em></p>
              <p><em>"Within the myriad phenomena that you see ... there are a few that
                  give you insight in how to understand all the rest," Professor Rice
                  said. </em></p>
              <p><em>"It might be good to get students to look at what are the basic
                  phenomena of all science and how they work. That would be a good
                  underlying, organising principle for the curriculum." </em></p>
              <p><em>The ACDS submission says exploring issues such as climate change are
                  important for engaging students but not sufficient in giving them a
                  grounding in the traditional disciplines. </em></p>
              <p><em>"(They) may provide greater motivation towards science," it says.
                  "However, the measure of a science education still remains the scope
                  and depth of physics, chemistry, biology, mathematics, etc, that
                  students have learned and are able to apply. </em></p>
              <p><em>"The science disciplines represent the distillation of human thought
                  about particular natural phenomena and how best to understand them." </em></p>
              <p><em>The national curriculum also proposes a significant shift in the way
                  science is taught, away from the traditional "transmission" method
                  where a teacher imparts knowledge. The new curriculum is centred on
                  students, involving them in choosing the scientific concept or topic to
                  be studied. </em></p>
              <p><em>The teacher then provides activities to explore the ideas, and,
                  using that experience as a basis, introduces the scientific terms and
                  concepts that students can then apply to new situations. </em></p>
              <p><em>The ACDS says this model for teaching "requires far greater discipline expertise than the transmission model". </em></p>
              <p><em>"In theory, such an approach to curriculum should deliver superior educational outcomes," it says. </em></p>
              <p><em>"In practice, in an education system not prepared for it, it may
                  well deliver poorer outcomes, with real science, as embodied in
                  physics, chemistry, mathematics and biology, downgraded." </em></p>
              <p><em>Professor Rice said the deans supported the concept of taking a
                  broader approach to the teaching of science, moving it away from
                  learning formulas. </em></p>
              <p><em>"We don't want a return to the transmission model where you have a
                  catechism that people can memorise and transmit to the student," he
                  said. "But if that's all you have, at least that can be done. What this
                  new curriculum is asking for is a genuine understanding of some
                  scientific phenomena that requires a much more sophisticated
                  understanding than a lot of teachers have." </em></p>
              <p><em>He said teachers with such understanding were in the minority,
                  particularly given so many science teachers had been drafted from other
                  areas. </em></p>
              <p><em>"It's like saying we want people who can fly the latest FA-18 and
                  then saying we'll put in people who can fly Tiger Moths. There's bound
                  to be a lot of crashes," he said.''</em></p>
