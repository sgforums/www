              <p>But seriously, do you want to see people misused the retirement money and lost everything, which the ending is likely to jump off a building or MRT tracks.

              <p>CPF started as a force saving so that it helps to put down roots for singaporean, further it allows retirement saving and medical saving and continue evolved to insurance and unit trust....these are all part of long term financial planning....this model looks fine so long as rate of low inflation and incremental wage increase is faster than inflation because you need to make payment for all financial commitment.</p>
              <p>Than it comes to the characteristics of ownership where withdrawer age and amount was witheld in both Age and minimum sum amount.</p>
              <p>But the landscape of singapore economies has changed the old model no longer can substantiate this model of force saving to pay for affordable housing, affordable retirement and cover hospital bills. <strong>No More</strong> can these tools for financial planning can be applied.</p>

              <p>Depressed wage and demand push on housing thru liberal immigration policies are crowding out Singaporean.....it is impossible to regroup unless you can come up with newer model to replace the old ones.</p>

              <p>True, and I do not agree on Minimum Sum thingy, asking for $120,000 (As of 2003 value) by 2013 in Retirement Account? WTH!!?? After buying a HDB 3 ~ 4 rooms, how to get that much again without using them to invest / buy stocks etc (Just prudently put money in CPF and earn the 2.5 ~ 4% depending on accounts)?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But, that does not equate to one should support certain welfare policies, which often coupled by higher tax and tend to be easier abused by nasty people. (I myself, is not a rich student, is just a modest person who lives in a no bigger than 4 room HDB ever.)</p>

              <p>But seriously, do you want to see people misused the retirement money and lost everything, which the ending is likely to jump off a building or MRT tracks. I still think that CPF is the way to go, in long term prospect. It is just the method and reality (High price of everything) must change.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Since when these reports seemed to bash PAP as much as possible, without a little logical thinking.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Afterall, CPF is introduced by UK's colonial master.Thus, not the Lee's fault.</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When CPF was first started by the British Colonial Government in 1955 - it was intended to be an <strong><span style="color: #800080;">optional and voluntary</span></strong> retirement savings <strong><span style="color: #800080;">in addition to the pension scheme</span></strong>.</p>
              <p>When LKY, Toh Chin Chye and Goh Keng Swee took over the Self-Rule Government in 1957 - the State Treasury was bankrupted by the previous Government led by the Chief Minister Lim Yew Hock.</p>
              <p>LKY, Toh Chin Chye and Goh Keng Swee saw the opportunities offered by the CPF, and developed the CPF further<strong> </strong>as a <span style="color: #800080;"><strong>cheap source of funding</strong></span> for the Government plans to develop the infrastructure, which at the same time was <strong><span style="color: #800080;">made compulsory</span></strong> to enlarged the net to capture a wider section of the population.</p>
              <p>The attraction offered to Singaporeans was that it was a guaranteed retirement savings plan - with interest of 2.5% per annum compounded annually, with the minimum sum draw down age tied to retirement at 55.</p>
              <p>Regretably this withdrawal age of 55 was subsequently revised to a later date of 62 as recommended in the Howe Yoon Chong report - and was later revised to 63 to be implemented by 2012; and with further provisions for this to be changed again to 64 years by 2015, and then 65 by Year 2018.</p>
              <p>In the late-1980s, new plans were introduced to deduct for compulsory subscription to Medisave; and subsequently in the 1990s when Medishield was also added - (with the deductions ranging from $30 to $705 depending on the insured person's age - Pg 30 of Annual Report 2007 - premium discounts of $33.50 TO $282 is given subject to past period of insurance).</p>
              <p>Additonal deductions were introduced in the 1990s for old-age benefits.</p>
              <p><strong>All these deductions were in excess of the 2.5% interest payable per annum.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>These deductions co-incided with population growth studies that showed a steady decline in the number of births.</p>
              <p>This situation can only cause systematic dysfunction to the CPF balancing acts that had ensured revenue earning potentials to be greater - if not equal - to the amounts paid out with compounded interests.</p>
              <p>For the CPF to succeed, the number of retiring Singaporeans should be very much less and there should be an increasing number of new workers contributing into the CPF scheme.</p>
              <p>Those contributing must be more then those withdrawing, and this growth should be consistent every year.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The CPF is designed to be like a pyramid - with a wide base and a narrow apex.</p>
              <p>With the birth rate decreasing, the new participants entering the CPF scheme every year is shrinking, compared to the numbers of older Singaporeans retiring.</p>
              <p>The CPF pyramid base is getting smaller, even as the number of aged is getting bigger from the baby boom that began in the mid-1940s after WW2.</p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.asiaone.com/News/The%2BStraits%2BTimes/Story/Higher%2BCPF%2Breturns%2Bfrom%2Bnext%2Byear.html">In 2007, the ratio was 8 people aged 15 to 64 for every senior citizen aged 65 and over, and the ratio will fall to 4 to 1 in 2030; and according to a UN study – Singapore’s population will be fourth oldest in the World by 2050. </a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Slowly, the pyramid is being inverted - with the wider base now at the top to represent the larger number of retirees withdrawing their CPF savings, and the sharp pointed end now at the bottom reflecting the declining birth rates contributing into the CPF.</p>
              <p>Under such circumstances, can there be sufficient monies left to payout to the growing number of Singaporeans retiring at about the same time ?</p>

              <p>Is it any surprise to see that the efforts of the resident CBM here is obviously to sabotage the thread with its flippant and irrelevant replies, and get all attempts at serious discussion to be driven off track - simply to bring attention to its own stupidity ?</p>

              <p>True, and I do not agree on Minimum Sum thingy, asking for $120,000 (As of 2003 value) by 2013 in Retirement Account? WTH!!?? After buying a HDB 3 ~ 4 rooms, how to get that much again without using them to invest / buy stocks etc (Just prudently put money in CPF and earn the 2.5 ~ 4% depending on accounts)?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But, that does not equate to one should support certain welfare policies, which often coupled by higher tax and tend to be easier abused by nasty people. (I myself, is not a rich student, is just a modest person who lives in a no bigger than 4 room HDB ever.)</p>

              <p><br>supposedly govt reinvested prudently on CPF thru Temasek.....to continue to yield positive equity return therefore to them it is not negative equity return on capital against inflation. Considered your 4% interest is profit after TAX.....</p>
