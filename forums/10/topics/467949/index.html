              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">Prashad, director of international studies at Trinity College, Connecticut, and author of the splendid </span><em style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">The Darker Nations</em><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">, which should be read as a preamble to this book, sets the scene right from the start - using the requisite Fanon quote; by 1961, what was configured was a fight between the Third World Project ("for peace, for bread and for justice") and the Atlantic Project. Key actors: the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), the de facto secretariat of the Third World Project, and the Group of 77 developing nations, created in 1964 to act on behalf of NAM in the United Nations. </span><br><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The founders of the NAM enjoyed iconic status in the post-colonial world; Jawaharlal Nehru in India, Gamal Abdel Nasser in Egypt, Sukarno in Indonesia, Josip Broz Tito in Yugoslavia.</span></strong> Yet they knew this was an uphill battle. As Prashad notes, "the UN had been hijacked by the five permanent members of the Security Council. The IMF [International Monetary Fund] and the World Bank had been captured by the Atlantic powers, and the GATT [General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, precursor to the World Trade Organization] was designed to undermine any attempt by the new nations to revise the international economic order". </span><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;"><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">As for the Atlantic Project, a 1969 quote from Henry Kissinger - co-destructor of Cambodia, Argentine leader Augusto Pinochet enabler, disgusted Saudi ally (the "most feckless and gutless of the Arabs") and praiser-in-chief of the Iranian Shah ("a tough, mean guy") - would suffice: "Nothing important can come from the South. The axis of history starts in Moscow, goes to Bonn, crosses over to Washington, and then goes to Tokyo. What happens in the South is of no importance." </span><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;"><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">Atlanticists were fiercely against the "no importance" Third World Project, but also against social democracy and communism. Their Holy Grail was to wallow in easy profits provided by a new global geography of production, "technological shifts that enabled firms to take advantage of differential wage rates" - most of all, those very low wages paid all across East Asia. </span><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;"><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">So the stage was set for the emergence of neoliberalism. Here Prashad moves in parallel with the indispensable David Harvey, detailing how the Global South became ripe to be fully (re)exploited; bye bye national liberation ideas of collective good. </span><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;"><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;"><strong style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">Keep the barbarians out </strong><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">With the IMF currently part of the troika dictating austerity to most of Western Europe (alongside the European Commission and the European Central Bank), it's easy to forget that in 1944 things were already pretty warped. The developing world had no say whatsoever in Bretton Woods, not to mention any sort of control over the UN's five-member Security Council. It was the silence of the lambs; the wolves prevailed, and inequality was set in stone. </span><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;"><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">Prashad proceeds with the indispensable details of how the US dollar became the effective world currency, with the US swinging the price of the dollar globally, regardless of any consequences; the formation of the Group of Seven as essentially an anti-developing world mechanism (and not anti-Soviet); and of course the much-dreaded Trilateral Commission, set up by Chase Manhattan's David Rockefeller to impose the will of the North against the South. </span><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;"><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">And guess who was the Trilateral's intellectual architect? The ineffable Zbigniew Brzezinski, later president Jimmy Carter's consigliere. Dr Zbig wanted to "contain the "contagious threat of global anarchy". Divide and rule, once again; the periphery needed to be put in its place. </span><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;"><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">By the way, one should always remember that in his 1997 epic </span><strong style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">The Grand Chessboard</strong><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">, Dr Zbig, who became the foreign policy adviser to Barack Obama in 2008, wrote, "The three grand imperatives of imperial geo-strategy are to prevent collusion and maintain security dependence among the vassals, to keep tributaries pliant and protected, and to keep the barbarians from coming together." For a long while the "vassals" were easily contained; but Dr Zbig, one step ahead of Kissinger, was already planning how to contain the two key "barbarians", ascending Eurasian powers Russia and China. </span><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;"><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">The Group of Seven anyway was a roaring success, pushing its "theory of governance" everywhere, implemented by - who else - the Bretton Woods mafia. Prashad neatly defines it: "What went by the name of neoliberalism was less a coherent economic doctrine than a fairly straightforward campaign by the propertied classes to maintain or restore their position of dominance", via the David Harvey-coined "accumulation by dispossession", now also known by millions of Europeans under the codename "austerity". </span><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;"><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">The numbers tell the story. In 1981, the net flow of capital to the Third World was $35.2 billion. In 1987, $30.7 billion left the Third World for Western banks. Praise the Lord and his law set in stone, also known as Structural Adjustment, based on "conditionality" (savage privatization, deregulation, destruction of social services, financial "liberalization"). </span><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;"><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">Paraphrasing Dylan, when you got nothing, you still got this nothing to lose. There was never any political strategy by the North to deal with the debt crisis of the 1980s. The Global South lambs were only allowed in a sorry procession to receive their structural adjustment consecrated host one by one. </span><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;"><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">But still that was not enough. With the fall of the USSR, Washington was free to develop Full Spectrum Dominance. Those who did not fully abide were branded "rogue states" - as in Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea and even, for a while, Malaysia (because it would not bow to the IMF). </span><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;"><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">But then, slowly but surely, the Global South began to rise. Prashad details the reasons - the commodity boom driven by China; commodity profits improving Latin American finances; more foreign direct investment roaming the world. The Global South started trading more within itself. </span><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;"><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">Then, in June 2003, at the margins of the Group of Eight gathering in Evian, France, emerged something called IBSA (the India-Brazil-South Africa Dialogue). IBSA was keen to "maximize the benefits of globalization" and promote sustained economic growth. Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim defined it at the time as "an ideology in the best sense of the word - an ideology of democracy, diversity, tolerance, a search for cooperation". </span><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;"><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">In parallel, China was - what else - booming. It's essential to remind anyone at this point of that fateful November 1978 trip by Deng Xiaoping to Singapore, where he was hosted by Lee Kuan Yew; Prashad could have built a whole chapter around it. This was the clincher. Deng knew right away that he would milk the guanxi ("connections") of the Chinese diaspora for all it's worth. I'll never forget my very own first visit to Shenzhen only one month after Deng's fabled Southern Tour of January 1992. That's when the boom really started. At the time, I felt I was mostly neck-deep in Maoist China. </span><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;"><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">Fast forward to China now helping to develop Africa. Vast swathes of the developing world would not consider blindly adopting a</span><em style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">zhongguo moshi</em><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;"> - the Chinese Model. It's more like Prashad introducing this wonderful quote from Donald Kaberuka, a former minister of finance in Rwanda and now president of the African Development Bank: "We can learn from [the Chinese] how to organize our trade policy, to move from low to middle income status, to educate our children in skills and areas that pay off in just a couple of years." </span><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;"><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;"><strong style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">BRIC by BRIC</strong><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;"> </span><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">Which brings us to the BRICS, created as a group in 2009 out of the BRIC-IBSA union - and now the top locomotive of the Global South. </span><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;"><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">By then, inevitably, Blame China had already become an established fine art in Washington; the Chinese must imperatively become consumers.

So the great Fernand Braudel was already right when he wrote </span><em style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">The Perspective of the World: Civilization and Capitalism, Fifteenth- Eighteenth Century</em><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">, stressing this would be the "sign of autumn" for Atlantic hegemony.</span><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;"><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">Of course there are huge problems with the BRICS, as Prashad details. Their domestic policies can indeed be interpreted as a sort of "neoliberalism with Southern characteristics". They are far from being an ideological alternative to neoliberalism. They have been helpless to counteract the overwhelming military hegemony of the US and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (see, for instance, the Libya fiasco). And they are not the embryo of a revolutionary shift in the world order. </span><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;"><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">But at least they are "allowing a breath of fresh air to oxygenate the stagnant world of neoliberal imperialism". </span><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;"><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">The fresh air will circulate in the form of a new development bank, a BRICS Bank of the South version of the South American Banco del Sur, founded in 2009 (here's Prashad's </span><a style="color: #0000cd; text-decoration: underline; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;" href="http://www.counterpunch.org/2013/03/27/china-finds-its-place/">critical take</a><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">.

They are already evolving as a powerful geopolitical actor stressing multi-polarity. They are bound to be joined by the next BRICS - the MIST (Mexico, Indonesia, South Korea and Turkey). And don't forget Iran. Time for BRICS MIIST? </span><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;"><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">What's graphically obvious is that the Global South has had enough - from the ravages of casino turbo-capitalism to NATO playing Robocop from North Africa to Southwest Asia, not to mention Eurasia being encircled by that Dr Strangelove chimera - a missile shield. </span><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;"><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">The Global South remains fraught with absurdities; one just has to think of the oil and gas GCC petro-monarchies - those paragons of "democracy" - now configured as an annex to NATO.

Prashad attempts an objective analysis in terms of the unity of the Global South, drawing on the work of Indian Marxist Prabhat Patnaik. </span><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;"><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">Patnaik is a sound fellow. He knows that "a coordinated global resistance is not on the horizon". Instead, "he emphasizes the centrality of building resistance within the nation-state, and his analysis can easily be extended to regions (he writes mainly of India, but the analysis he provides is equally applicable to the Bolivarian experiments in Latin America)". </span><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;"><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">So the road map spells tackling the "peasant question", which is essentially about land and rights; and to concentrate on the immediate struggles of improving people's living and working conditions. Inevitably Prashad has to refer to Bolivian vice president Alvaro Garcia Linera, one of Latin America's top contemporary intellectuals. </span><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;"><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">In many aspects, where the emancipation of the Global South is more advanced is in parts of South America; I was hugely impressed when I was in Bolivia in early 2008. Prashad neatly summarizes Linera's analysis of how the process develops:</span></p>
              <blockquote style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">It begins with a crisis of the state that enables a ''dissident social bloc'' to mobilize the people into a political project. A ''catastrophic stand-off'' develops between the bloc of power and the bloc of the people, which in the case of Latin America was able to be resolved for the moment on the side of the people. The new government must then ''convert opposition demands into acts of state,'' and build a deeper and broader hegemony by ''combining the ideas of mobilized society with material resources provided by or via the state.'' The turning point (''point of bifurcation''), for Garcia Linera, comes through a ''series of confrontations'' between the blocs that are resolved in unexpected ways, with either the consolidation of the new situation or the reconstitution of the old. We are at or near the point of bifurcation. What will come next cannot be predicted.</blockquote>

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">What is definitely known by now by the best minds in Asia, Africa and Latin America, is that there was never an end of history, as parroted by pathetic orphans of Hegel; and there was never an end of geography, as parroted by "world is flat" globalization dancing fools. </span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #362f2d; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px;">For those of us who participated in the South Commission and in the preparation of its report and recommendations, the announcement of setting up of the Brics bank, at its just-concluded summit in Durban, is a moment not only to celebrate but to reflect.</span></p>
              <p><br style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: #362f2d; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px;"><span style="color: #362f2d; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px;">Further, its raison d’etre is to claim some autonomy from the traditional Bretton Woods Institutions, which is heartening. This was in fact the reasoning behind the South Commission’s recommendation, in chapter four of the report, A Challenge to the South, which was released in 1990.</span></p>
              <p><br style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: #362f2d; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px;"><span style="color: #362f2d; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px;">In A Challenge to the South the idea of a South Bank was also derived from the same analysis and towards the same purpose — a form of liberation as well as a form of sharing of wealth and opportunity within the south family. Therefore, one could argue that it was more inclusive. “Finance has proved to be the critical missing link in the entire range of south activities. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #362f2d; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px;">Schemes of cooperation whether in trade, production and investment, education or science and technology, need adequate financial resources to be viable. We have selected several areas in which cooperaton in financial matters or financing of cooperation in economic matters is greatly needed in the long run…notably a South Bank, which would initially finance trade and ultimately provide development finance.” (quoted, pg 165)</span></p>
              <p><br style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: #362f2d; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px;"><span style="color: #362f2d; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Lest we forget, the leader of the South Commission, Dr Julius Nyerere could anticipate as far back as in 1987, the dangers that lay in store for the countries in the southern continents if they did not form their own economic clubs and mobilise their own resources to design their own political economy destiny.</span></strong> He would often refer to the EU as the model of self-strengthening , as well as the OECD secretariat in Paris, to argue that we need similar consolidation of our economies apart from regular key intelligence to enable us to keep going as was provided by OECD secretariat to the EU governments.</span></p>
              <p><br style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: #362f2d; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px;"><span style="color: #362f2d; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px;">Nations such as members of the Brics group have woken up to the idea of bonding across our continents, after the economies of the North went into crisis and really ran a tsunami over the southern countries too, who had become more engaged with them, than with each other. The meltdown of 2008 and the later financial crisis in the “advanced” countries has woken up the Brics.</span></p>
              <p><br style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: #362f2d; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px;"><span style="color: #362f2d; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px;">It does not surprise me to read that South Africa had mobilised all the nations of South Africa and all the commissions within the continent to attend the Brics conference. For all its internal troubles, fractured states, the African continent aspires, and seems to have succeeded in that aspiration, to unite itself as a continent and not as a summation of individual nations.</span></p>
              <p><br style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: #362f2d; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px;"><span style="color: #362f2d; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px;">Whether we recall the famous appeal by a former President of South Africa, Thabo Mbeki, in his poetic speech “I am an African”, or the structural power of the African Union, Africa wants to put forward her continental identity.</span><br style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: #362f2d; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px;"><span style="color: #362f2d; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px;">As we have known over the several decades from being colonised states, to being so-called liberated countries, media reports us to each other in the most negative terms. South Africa in Indian media is seen as “dangerous to walk in the streets, crime everywhere, rape every three seconds crumbling with severe unemployment”.</span><br style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: #362f2d; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px;"><span style="color: #362f2d; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px;">The Rainbow Nation is only a dream. All of it is true , as it would be true to read South African newspapers on India — corrupt, violent rapes, entrenched casteism, you name it.</span></p>
              <p><br style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: #362f2d; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px;"><span style="color: #362f2d; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px;">When I visited South Africa earlier this month after a break of 10 years and spent more than 10 days in three cities and read the newspapers, I realised how much the news we receive, is misleading. The finance minister is a confident leader and holds much strength, Parliament and its committees are functioning vigorously, inter-African meetings are galore. The one I attended was convened by the inter-parliamentary union of Africa in a hall in Johannesburg, meant for their meetings, which I believe takes place four times a year.</span></p>
              <p><br style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: #362f2d; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px;"><span style="color: #362f2d; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px;">The newspapers were so similar to India’s newspapers, full of political and economic news, unlike many other country papers, which basically are glossies. The announcements include programmes and new laws by the various premiers of provinces, similar to what the chief ministers of our states do.</span></p>
              <p><br style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: #362f2d; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px;"><span style="color: #362f2d; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px;">The constant debate of the National Development Plan, columns with debating controversies. Where they beat us Indians, the most news hungry people in the world in my opinion, was that every lamp-post had a poster, a double fullscape size rectangle stuck on flat matting, tied to the pole, with very bold large capital letters giving the latest, almost previous hour, political news as you drive, whether in Johannesburg or Pretoria.</span></p>
              <p><br style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: #362f2d; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px;"><span style="color: #362f2d; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px;">In preparation for Brics, there were campaigns and mobile exhibitions and arrangements to hold discussions not only all over South Africa, but also all over the continent on the meaning of Brics and how to bring forward South Africa as a strong leader, supported by the continent.</span></p>
              <p><br style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: #362f2d; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px;"><span style="color: #362f2d; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px;">A decade or so ago when my husband the late L.C. Jain presented his credentials to the then President Nelson Mandela, he entitled his acceptance speech as “Africa – the Continent of Hope”. As can be expected the President loved the idea of faith expressed in the speech, and wanted a copy of the argument on which Jain had built his speech.</span></p>
              <p><br style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: #362f2d; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px;"><span style="color: #362f2d; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px;">We read every day how the continent of Africa is the most endowed that the rest of the world wants, namely energy, natural resources, oil from there, and how China, apart from other international powers, is working to exploit these resources for its own progress. It is interesting, if not troubling, that this matches our understanding or description of what colonisation was all about.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #362f2d; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px;"> This continent of hope is also extremely vulnerable at this time, as she suffers from a lack of financial strength as well as stable governments while the world wants to harvest her resources. But Julius Nyerere, otherwise called Mwalimu, or Teacher, was acutely aware of the vulnerability of the African continent and was appealing to all, especially China and India, to be the leaders of real emancipation, namely economic emancipation — an extension of what M.K. Gandhi called economic freedom for the more vulnerable countries.</span></p>
              <p><br style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: #362f2d; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px;"><span style="color: #362f2d; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px;">Thus, while Brics is the first brick in memory of Mwalimu Nyerere, its vision needs to match the purpose he had in mind — to build an equitable and non-exploitative economic south.</span></p>
              <p><br style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: #362f2d; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px;"><span style="color: #362f2d; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px;">The writer is a member of the erstwhile South Commission 1987-1990</span></p>
