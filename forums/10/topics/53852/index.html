            <div class='col-md body'><strong>LTA's puzzling line of reasoning </strong><br><span style="font-style: italic;">If it is more costly to build a train station later, why wasn't the station between HarbourFront and Outram Park built?<br><br>by Lee Han Shih</span><br><br><a href="http://www.todayonline.com/articles/4020.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.todayonline.com/articles/4020.asp</a><br><br>REMEMBER the grassroots leader who drove his Mercedes to a charity event to get free textbooks? Even if you ignore the morality of the issue Â— the books were meant for the needy and not for someone who owns a Mercedes Â— it was a dumb move anyway, as the money he lost on the wear and tear of the car, and the petrol he used, exceeded the value of whatever books he managed to grab at the event.<br><br>For years, this was the best example of how Singaporeans can be penny-wise but pound-foolish. Then, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) came along with its decision on the Buangkok MRT station (picture).<br><br>Buangkok, in the Hougang area, is one of 16 stations on the $5-billion North-East MRT Line (NEL). The line was built by the LTA and operated by publicly-listed SBS Transit.<br><br>Three days before the NEL began its commercial run on June 20, SBS suddenly announced that it had decided not to open the Buangkok station because it did not think there would be enough traffic to justify the trains stopping there.<br><br>Predictably, the residents of Buangkok raised a howl. After all, if the Government had spent $5 billion to build a railway, what was the reason for not opening one or more stations there? Isn't that a waste of public money?<br><br>No, the LTA answered. It said the low traffic volume in Buangkok meant that SBS stood to lose $1 million to $2 million a year if it opened the station and that would translate into higher fares for commuters.<br><br>The LTA also went to some length to defend the building Â— but not the using Â— of Buangkok station. It said that even if some of the stations are not used for the time being, it was much cheaper to build all the stations along the NEL at one go. Putting up 16 stations for the NEL and opening only 14 of them (the Woodleigh station is also closed) is, therefore, the best use of public funds, it said.<br><br>This was the same argument the LTA presented its boss, Transport Minister Yeo Cheow Tong. On July 13, Mr Yeo told reporters that Woodleigh station may not open for seven to eight years Â— "if you don't build it now and you build it later, it's going to be a lot, lot more expensive". Putting up MRT stations by stages was not a good way to use public money, the Minister added.<br><br>Now the LTA has contradicted itself Â— and Mr Yeo as well Â— in a letter to The Straits Times on Wednesday. Answering a reader's query on why there was no station between Outram Park (designated NE3) and Harbour-Front (NE1), the LTA said the distance between the two stations is 2.6km and "is much longer than the average station spacing".<br><br>It added that it had made provisions to build a station in between (presumably to be called NE2), but "we have not built it as there is no current need to do so". But "in the long run ... (changes) may justify another MRT station being built".<br><br>Excuse me? The LTA did not build NE2 because there was no traffic, but it built Buangkok and Woodleigh stations anyway despite the lack of traffic for these two stations. If, as Mr Yeo said, it could be "a lot, lot more expensive" to build a station later, shouldn't the LTA have built NE2 together with the rest of the stations and save the public "a lot of money"?<br><br>There is more. The Buangkok station cost $80 million to build and is good for perhaps 20 years. This means a depreciation of an average of $4 million a year Â— regardless of whether the station is open or closed. If the Buangkok station is open, the annual $4 million depreciation is spent to serve the public. If it is closed Â— as it is now Â— the $4 million goes down the drain.<br><br>So, why is the LTA willing to keep Buangkok closed and let $4 million go to waste every year so that SBS can save $1 million to $2 million?<br><br>The LTA may argue that it could not command SBS, a commercial concern, to open the station and incur a loss from doing so. But why not? SBS made a commercial decision to operate the NEL and if it overestimated the ridership and ended up making a loss, this is what business is all about. The losses should be borne by SBS and its shareholders, and not by raising fares or closing one of more stations so that SBS can recover from its mistake and make money from the operation. Why, in other words, should commuters and residents of Buangkok suffer for a bad decision made by SBS?<br><br>Of all the issues left unanswered over the Buangkok station, this is the most puzzling: The willingness of the LTA to help a commercial concern like SBS make money.<br>.<br>SBS made a commitment to run the North-East Line. If it can't do the job, it is the LTA's duty to take the line back and give it to someone who can.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i have some questions and comments about his article.<br><br><blockquote><strong>"Excuse me?

Or is it just a facade of being privatised? Who is the majority shareholder? Temasek Holdings ie the government? Just because there are some private shareholders does not mean it is privatised. Just like the facade of our 3 "private" telcos operating in our "deregulated" telecommunications sector, privatisation is in name only. The fact is that the government still has controlling interests over all these companies, SBS included.<br><br>And if it is privatised, why is SBS, a supposedly "private" company, punishing the public for its ineptitude in the running of the NEL to protect its (SBS) pockets, when in REAL private companies who don't have the authorities on their side, the company's pockets are hit?<br><br>Do you see the conflict of interest here? The LTA, a government agency, is helping SBS, a government-owned company (again, despite all pretences to the contrary) cover up and tide over its incompetence and hurting the public (which the LTA is supposed to speak for).<br><br>Either way, the facts stand that either:<br><br>- the LTA (a government agency whos stated aim is to serve the public) is protecting the interests of a private company over that of the public or,<br><br>- the LTA (a government agency) is protecting the interests of a company owned by the government (Conflict of interest)<br><br>Then again, whats new?</strong></div>

Was it for economic or political reasons ?<br><br>Back in the 1950's and 1960's, many businesses, and especially those controlled by the Chinese educated, were not supportive of LKY, who was seen as an upstart 'new kid on the block', pushy and arrogant; and who could not speak a word of Mandarin, let alone any dialect.<br><br>You will be surprise to know that these Private Owned Bus Companies operation had covered every corner of Singapore even at that time, and Seletar was well served, including the entire length of Yio Chu Kang Road, as well as to the remote corner of Ama Keng in Chua Chu Kang.<br><br>Even at the present day in 2003, Private Owned Bus operators are only too eager to be let loose and compete with SBS to operate full time on routes that SBS claim are not profitable.<br><br>The only reason that this has not been done on a wide scale, is that it will only show up the weakness of the big boys.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In the end it's their funeral, they annoy consumers who are inconvienced and have to pay more, they are adding in their own way to the already mounting woes of Singaporeans aroung in these times, reflecting in reduced productivity and yet again in the overall showing of the nation.<br><br>Just look at SIA, cabin crew ratings are down and they are still in denial. When will they wake up their idea and listen to what the masses are feeling? Without the people there will be no company, all most want is a fair deal, not constant hardball with sudden retrenchment and working for wages that forces us to live virtually on nothing while watching FTs come in and take the positions that are really needed.<br><br>Myopic I think, in the long run it's only going to hurt Singaporeans as a whole. And while insulated from it for some time, the upper management of this country will feel the heat sooner or later... I just hope it won't have to reach that point.<br></div>

Please, refer to the facts and look at Temasek's (and hence the governments) stake in it and therefore their clout within SBS before coming up with an answer.<br><br>Look at it this way, being a facade of being a private company while in actual fact being an extension of the government's control of Singapore, actually makes it easier for them to stiff Singaporeans (like they're doing now) because they can hide behind that excuse of being a "private company" to justify price hikes, than being a wholly owned government subsidised company, because any attempts to hike fares as a government subsidiary would run into more opposition from the people.<br><br>Benefit of the doubt? Theres no need to, just run a check on how their profits continually increase year after year. The information would be readily available on their website. And since they obviouslly f***ed up the show when doing their studies on NEL ridership, why should we accept the studies on NEL-bus service at face value without any questions?<br><br>ST, the difference between SBS and SIA is that SIA is a GLC competing in the real world with real competitors where it cannot hide behind government rules, anti-competitive measures and government-controlled watchdogs, while SBS is "competing" in a PAP-world where the above don't apply and the "competition" are other GLCs.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>For those not really affected by the NEL, here's the story from a north-easterner. I am staying in between Kovan Station and Serangoon Station.<br><br>The recent adjustments of bus services, practically cut all my buses. I have a bus-stop in front of my house, but it's practically useless now. Only 82,80,153 and 136 is available, it used to be double the amount, and mind you, those cut were the main trunk services to town etc. 82 goes to shenton way, which in their way, should be cut, because it's a duplicate(Tanjong Pagar MRT). 80 goes to Harbourfront(???) and 153 goes to Bukit Merah via Toa Payoh, and 136 loops Hougang and AMK(???)<br><br>By using SBS's method of which services to cut, only 153 should remain, but of course, that's not what i wish.<br>The services they have diverted/cut are:<br>85(cut)-goes to Harbourfront/Zouk<br>111(orchard-buona vista)<br>97 (city hall-jurong east)<br>81(Pasir Ris-Outram)<br><br>It is clear the services which have affected me are very important routes.<br><br>I now have to wait for either 82,80,153 to go to the nearest NEL. Note that these are trunk,not feeder services. I now have to take a trunk service to 2 stops away to take the NEL. It has not only inconvenienced me, but i also have to pay more.<br><br>Further inconvenience includes getting back from town, where i have to catch the train, then transfer to the bus, hoping that there's still a last bus.<br><br>I feel sad for the many commuters who depend on service 85 which goes into punggol. Many of them are more badly affected than i am, especially the students from the various schools there.<br><br>If i had known NEL would cause the services to be disrupted, i'd rather not the NEL be built.<br><br>I feel that the transport system in Singapore is far from world class. Our buses doesn't seem to be cleaned at all. We are forced to take multiple transfers. We 'lan-lan' also must take SBS even if we hate it to the core, unless we travel on foot.<br><br>Talk about consumer choice.....<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Bah, at a recent press confrence, concerns about SBS latest actions met with unproductive stonewalling and the public left with more questions then answers.<br><br>SBS has failed to answer several contradictions pointed out in their offical stand, and said they would "look into it (ie.dismiss it)" and finally in a show of their true colours, said, "well, you can't please everybody."<br><br>With big brother on their side, SBS has little to fear. It has the customer gripped firmly by the neck and can choose to listen or not to listen on their whims. I wonder how serious they actually are about listening. If they are not, they should just hold a press confrence and say "it's our way or the highway." and safe us the trouble to bother to voice out and to resume our little lives as pawns and cogs in the machine.<br><br>If SIA tried a stunt like what SBS is pulling now, it'll fold up pretty fast.
