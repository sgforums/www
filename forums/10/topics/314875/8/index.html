              <p>Are you ignorant or simply foolhardy? Just because I allegedly
                      "ridiculed" your idea does not in any way suggest I'm against
                      minimum wage, does it?</p>
              <p>To drive home my message to someone obscenely dense : I think
                      your idea of a multi-tiered minimum wage policy is both unfeasible
                      and working against the principles minimum wage is supposed to
                      serve. In short, the brand of multi-tiered minimum wage actually
                      does more to accentuate social inequity than narrow the income gap.
                      That said, I am all for minimum wage (the brand you see worldwide -
                      whether it works and how effective it is are an entirely
                      separatematter). Period. Sharp and concise. Does that answer your
                      question? (For the record, I belong neither to the middle nor lower
                      income strata in the strictest demographic definition churned out
                      by the regime's statistics, but the point about having minimum wage
                      to reduce social inequity isn't lost on me)</p>
              <p>As for your point, I was questioning the viability of your
                      "creative" suggestion - at which point did I assert my idea (when I
                      never even mentioned one) to be right and absolute? How you liken
                      my "attitude" to this regime is beyond me - if anything, I find it
                      perplexing you find your views absolute and untouchable (so who's
                      behaving like the infamous regime now?)...</p>

              <p>Ok. So lets stick to the "fundamental".. minimum wage policy that protects the lowest strata of our society.</p>
              <p>Is there any policy available on planet earth that protects the middle income group?</p>
              <p>Or are you saying this group of workers need no protection ?</p>

              <p>Do not be mistaken - at no point did I suggest I've got the cure to address all the social ills that exist. The fact of the matter concerning the minimum wage is, its very primary purpose exists to tackle the social inequity confronting the lower strata of society and it functions on the basis of equality (obviously, it will hardly affect skilled labour whose income far exceeds the minimum wage, but they too are technically "covered" nevertheless). It just doesn't make sense to implement a "minimum wage" that targets every marginalised group imaginable, does it? If anything, any idea that seeks to target an exclusive group (be they middle-income, females, blacks, or any other group) would only serve to further accentuate the income divide (which simply defeats the whole purpose of the minimum wage), wouldn't it?</p>
              <p>I don't think the middle-income group's woes could be addressed by any minimum wage policies. Assuming the premise of the local context, the whole crux of your perceived middle income problem stems not from the labour policies (nothing to do with minimum wage to begin with since it's non-existent in Singapore) as much as it does from a whole bunch of immigration and social policies. Put it this way : if your gripe stems from the influx of cheap, lowly-paid foreigners (and if you're familiar with the similarities of US, this is not quite a problem with illegal aliens as these people are legitimately entitled to work in Singapore) being allowed to take on jobs your parents are capable of performing (thereby inducing the wage suppression), would you not agree the problem actually stems from the lax immigration policies more than any labour or wage issues? Clearly, it's not rocket science to comprehend tweaking the wage policies to compensate for an inherent flaw in immigration isn't exactly going to address the problem.</p>
              <p>In essence, all I am saying is minimum wage is neither an issue nor a solution towards addressing the middle-income woes you've addressed. Take a shot at such sandcastles built in the air then... <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>

              <p>I bet you didn't know that 1.6% is the fixed D rate at the current economic downturn, and at the highest 3 years ago, it was 3.2%. I gave 1.8% as a very conservative estimate already, although money is still being lost to inflation.</p>

              <p>You don't go NS, and you don't stay in Sg now, you won't know exactly what was said la... Even during NS, I took over guard duties for others, and taught tuition during nights out, just for extra money. I can also tell you that my driving lessons are paid for by these extra money I earned.</p>
              <p>Also, when I would want to buy something, I do not ask for extra money too. I will wait for my next paycheck from tuition or other sources. Money saved is saved; try not to touch them unless absolutely necessary. This is just my money habit.</p>

              <p>It is because of the power of compounding that I am going to make it a point not to spend much on anything unnecessary early in life. Anything wrong in sharing my thoughts about money habits?</p>

              <p>If you have read true rags to riches stories, you will see how these people think and earn money even as a child. At my age, they already have at least 10 times my current savings. Which is why it is important since young... Before you get married, before you have to pay for mortgage, before your family gets sick, before your parents need medical care, etc... If you wait till all these expenses arrive, it will be too late.</p>
              <p>I shall share with you a recent article I read. Do tell me if it is relevant.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Four Levels of Wealth</p>
              <p>There are basically four levels of wealth you must aim to attain.<br> <br>Level 1: Financial Stability<br> <br>The first level of wealth is known as financial stability. This is<br>the most basic level of wealth that you must first attain.<br> <br>You have achieved Financial Stability when:<br> <br>1. You have accumulated enough liquid assets to cover your current<br>expenses for a minimum of six months.<br> <br>2. In addition, you have life and hospitalization insurance to<br>protect you and/or your family's lifestyle should you be<br>permanently disabled, unable to work or if you pass away suddenly.<br> <br>When you have attained this first level, you will have the peace of<br>mind that should any unexpected challenges befall you (like<br>retrenchment, business failure, pay cut, death or disability), you<br>and your family's lifestyle will not be compromised. Or worse, you<br>or your family will not slide into debt.<br> <br>Once you have achieved this, you must then aim to achieve...<br> <br>Level 2: Financial Security<br> <br>You have achieved Financial Security when you have through the<br>investment of time, money and ideas, accumulated a critical amount<br>of Positive Cash Flow Assets that generate enough passive income to<br>cover your MOST BASIC expenses. <br> <br>In other words, when you reach this level, you can stop working and<br>maintain a very basic lifestyle. It also means that if you continue<br>working, all your active income can be channeled towards your<br>investments and this will further compound your assets and increase<br>your in-come streams.<br> <br>Of course, we shouldn't be satisfied at being at this level. Once<br>accomplished, you must then aim to go for...<br> <br>Level 3: Financial Fre-edom<br> <br>Many of us have heard of the dream of achieving financial fre-edom<br>but what does it really mean? <br> <br>Well, Financial Fre-edom is when you have through the investment of<br>time, money and ideas, accumulated a critical amount of Positive<br>Cash Flow Assets that generate enough passive income to sustain<br>your CURRENT LIFESTYLE.<br> <br>When you reach this level of Financial Fre-edom, you can choose to<br>stop working and still maintain your current standard of living...<br>indefinitely! <br> <br>In reality, most people who achieve financial fre-edom love their<br>work so much that they continue working not because they have to,<br>but because they choose to. <br> <br>I can tell you from personal experience that it is a great feeling<br>to have...being free of financial pressure &amp; worries and working<br>purely out of passion!<br> <br>Obviously, the more expenses you have now, the more luxurious and<br>indulgent your standard of living, the longer it will take for you<br>to achieve financial fre-edom. <br> <br>So besides increasing your passive in-come, reducing your<br>unnecessary/frivolous expenses will accelerate your way towards<br>this fourth level. Finally, you must aim to achieve...<br> <br>Level 4: Financial Abundance<br> <br>So what is the ultimate level of wealth you can achieve? Financial<br>Abundance is when you have through the investment of time, money<br>and ideas, accumulated a critical amount of Positive Cash Flow<br>Assets that generate enough passive income to sustain your DESIRED<br>LIFESTYLE.<br> <br>Your desired lifestyle is the amount of monthly expenses it will<br>take for you to live the life of your dreams. This is totally<br>subjective depending on the lifestyle that you desire. <br> <br>If your desired lifestyle is to live in a 20,000 square-feet<br>bungalow with a swimming pool, send your kids to the best schools<br>and drive a Mercedes Benz S-Class, then you could be looking at a<br>monthly lifestyle that'll cost a cool $50,000. <br> <br>Of course the more luxurious your desired lifestyle, the longer it<br>will take for you to achieve financial abundance.<br> <br>The moment you reach the level of Financial Abundance, you will be<br>able to choose to stop working and live your dream lifestyle<br>indefinitely. <br> <br>Again, most people who do reach this level usually love what they<br>do so much that they keep on working for fun, channeling 100% of<br>their active income towards charitable causes and further<br>compounding their wealth. <br> <br>With the right strategies and plans in place, you too will be able<br>to achieve this ultimate level of wealth.</p>
