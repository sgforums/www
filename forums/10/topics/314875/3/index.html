              <p><br>Why it sounds like a govt tagline? Sometimes I am happy to see PAP run the show......because in the hands of other parties, if we go by their speeches, really can't imagine what would happen to our economy. Our govt is well-known in being rationale and practical in running the economy and will choose to ignore people if they see it as unhelpful.</p>
              <p>Woah.....if FTs come and compete for the job because of the higher pay, they are welcomed to do so??? Do you make sense? Ask yourself. Wouldn't this lead to job shortage internally?</p>

              <p>then don't you think it is the job of your DEAR government to decide its labour policy to allow or disallow foreigners in? whether there is a shortage or not, it is all market play that the government can tweak the knobs on. the opposites is exactly what is happening now. open the floodgates and all hell breaks loose.</p>
              <p>well, i can think of a few good men from abroad who can do a better job than the current government. they probably cost a fraction of our million dollar ministers. can they apply?</p>

              <p><br>That's a fair statement.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately this tagline has been adopted by the PAP rather than the WP. To benefit individuals, you need to benefit them collectively and put a safety net to help those below. But minimum wages are hardly the way the best to do so.</p>
              <p>As proven in my arguments with Ms Jojo, if you keep listening to the people, there won't be an end to the problems solved and created, make-believe or not.</p>

              <p>you need to understand that this is not a zero sum game. a shrewd government will maintain a good balance. `opening the market' is obviously the flavor of the decade.</p>
              <p>you, together with the PAP, will be unduly worried come the US election. when this is over, and if the democrats wins, FTA will be put in the cold storage because the 2 presidential nominees recognize that FTA has marginalized its own country and people.</p>
              <p>the fact that singapore is run by techocrats with herd mentality is not helping. it never leads, it always watches on the side and if things are proven to be good, then singapore jumps in. so, i will see if singapore maintains that totally open economy concept or backtrack. </p>
              <p>and you looked like the herd of the herd.</p>

              <p>I have been saying this recently in the forum, just in a different form... Many people spend over their means, and the only thing they do to salvage is to ask for a pay raise, and nothing else. Don't get the raise, then blame the company and the government.</p>

              <p>this sound mightily like a government tagline.</p>
              <p>minimum wage advocation is not for across the board. please get
              this right so a meaningful discussion can prevail. if you are
              currently a manager, or even a fresh grad getting into his/her
              first job, the market rate dictates the wage. i am not sure about
              others, but i will not advocate minimum wage for these group of
              employees.</p>
              <p>i support minimum wage for menial, entry level jobs such as a
              sweeper, gardener, cleaner, etc. the rising cost of living will not
              wait for one's wage to catch up. the train left the station
              already. for a singaporean living here, especially those who are
              less educated and less mobile, to be subjected to harsh competition
              from china, india, vietnam or the philippines who is willing to
              take a fraction of the pay for a particular job is not fair. say
              the government does its homework and decide that S$1100 is the
              minimum sum that a poor can get by monthly, it should then decide
              on the range of jobs that should have a starting pay of S1100.
              then, if the foreigners want to come and compete for these
              relatively `high' pay job, they are welcome to do so. then they can
              pit their skillsets and shows that they are better than
              singaporeans. no quarrel here. the best person for the job wins,
              regardless of nationality. but if they come and say, "psk,
              psk, i can work for 40% less....", then there is no story here.
              Singaporeans are definitely marginalized. no wonder those in these
              strata of society are pissed off.</p>
              <p>singapore compete on the ground of efficiency and effectiveness,
              a hi-tech no corruption environment. it is already not the cheapest
              place to do business. but it has its distinct advantages. it
              continues to pay high wages to talents, locals or foreigners.</p>
              <p>However, for the government to flip the coin when it comes to
              entry level jobs and poorer singaporeans; and say that we need
              to be as cheap as possible is a fucking, outright hyprocrisy.
              even when sweeping the floor, we need someone to do a good job
              sweeping and not some half baked job because the sweeper comes
              cheap. if we can need to pay TOP wage for the man at the top, why
              can't we extend the same logic to the all levels of job, including
              the sweepers and the guy who clears up the mess on
              the table the richer singaporeans leave at the
              foodcourt/hawker center? well, let's not talk top wages.
              let's start with FAIR wage first. </p>
              <p>must you all be in the position of these `cornered' singaporeans
              and experience first hand the hardship before it becomes
              obvious?</p>

              <blockquote>
              <p>i support minimum wage for menial, entry level jobs such as a
              sweeper, gardener, cleaner, etc. the rising cost of living will not

              <p>The solution is not to compete through productivity. Listen to the government on this part and you will forever be stuck in such a never-ending race. So what if you have gone and take another course to up your productivity? Very very soon, another FT with better productivity will come along and compete. Then you take another course to upgrade yourself. Then another better productivity FT come along again. This is a never ending cycle.</p>

              <p>No, minimum wage should be fix according to the grades. Positions which are prone to wage competitions from FTs .</p>
              <p>Example.</p>
              <p>Low grade min income $A/hr ( Cleaners, Domestic helpers, Construction workers)</p>
              <p>Lower middle grades min income $B/hr ( Junior clericals/administrative, assistant/helpers etc)</p>

              <p>This is completely ridiculous - a minimum wage seeks to ensure the basic needs of the lowest strata of society are adequately taken care of, not ensuring you get a pay that commensurates with your ability to reflect your status or redefine the social stratification.</p>
              <p>The only variation in minimum wages I know of are those which set different guidelines for different cities (within the same country) due to the differing cost of living, which makes perfect sense. The Chinese adopt this system and plans are afoot in the UK to increase the minimum wage in London...</p>

              <p><br>That would only make sense if you had sound legislations and policies in place. Without any effective functioning trade unions nor any credible opposition in parliament to hold a bunch of despots to account for the seemingly foolhardy policy of pursuing an open-door policy to foreigners just to induce an artificial wage suppression to woo foreign investors with its provision of a cheap source of labour (both skilled and unskilled), what sort of market forces are you talking about?</p>
              <p>The brand of free-market economy in this regard that exists in this regime is no more rational than that being touted in North Korea.</p>
