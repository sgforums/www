              <p>Haha......so many economies have repeatedly shown that a minimum wage hurts more in the long run.</p>
              <p>A market exists because there's demand and supply. The pay exists because it is agreed implicitly upon by employees and employers.</p>
              <p>You're essentially removing that equation by introducing such a law.</p>
              <p>Employees get higher pay and would agree, but employers would not. So, they will fire workers and reduce demand for workers. Yet, the supply for workers who agree to this new pay will not fall, in fact, they would rise! So you get job shortage, and a resulting lower productivity in return for this so called welfare.</p>
              <p>The consequences will only show in the long-term.</p>

              <p>Hi Kilua</p>
              <p>I didn't fire them sooner because the owner had set guidelines on how many employees she wanted to work on each shift. When the minimum wage was increased I was able to convince her to allow me to get rid of some of the dead weight. And to reward the people that were hard workers.</p>
              <p>There were also a lot of adjustments that I had to make to keep the restaurant running smoothly. It is always harder to keep your customers happy with less employess.</p>

              <p>Many people forget the most fundumental characteristic of a market: The implicit agreement between the employer and employee. This is a form of the 'invisible hand'.</p>
              <p>So if you guys push for a minimum wage in the name of welfare, then you guys are also forgetting that personal choices will be at stake since people CHOSE to work despite the low wages.</p>
              <p>Instead of minimum wages, we should push for more accessible education and training, meaning subsidising and creating more job fairs and so on to lift these people from the low-paying job.</p>
              <p>When they move on to a higher-paid one, the low-paid one will experience a reduction on workers and the pay will naturally go up there.</p>
              <p>Of course this leads to another problem because all these assumes a closed-market context. In actual fact, the increase in pay would simply entice foreign workers and depress the pay again.</p>

              <p>The question being asked is that the current minimum wages or the current level of wages are not enough to meet the standard living here.</p>
              <p>Will raising the wages help? What do you think caused our living standards to be that high in the first place? It is us. The very people who are complaining that wages are low.</p>
              <p>Living Standards are a vicious cycle. The biggest reasons for raise of living standards are when people spend and spend and then expect more. How do they spend and expect more? When they have more money.</p>
              <p>I saw somewhere in the thread that by raising minimum wages, we will see that people will spend their wages to reduce the debt rather than spend more. I guess you are terribly wrong. Guess whats the reason behind the huge number of people reported to be "CARD SLAVES". People who spend more than they should using their credit cards not on paying their debts but for so called their "living standards". As a result they have to declare bankruptcy.</p>
              <p>There is already a wage guidelines out there. Like it or not, this is a competitive society. I am a graduate who has a great job in junior management. My pay is not too bad but there are others who are same age as me earning more, driving bigger cars, going to more expensive places. Do I yearn to be like them? I will strive but I dun envy them. At the end of the day, its about being ambitious but yet being contented. And if you want something, go out there and fight for it.</p>

              <p><br>The problem is that wages increment impacts inflation. It will be balanced if people will curb their spending even their wages are increased. Unfortunately we see people spending more than they can whenever they get some money. My own family already have classic examples of these people. Get $10, spend $15. If this is so, when will this cycle end? If inflation increases because I spend more, then tomorrow I go back to my company and say, Hey u must increase my wage because I need to spend more. When will this end?</p>

              <p>minimum wage advocation is not for across the board. please get this right so a meaningful discussion can prevail. if you are currently a manager, or even a fresh grad getting into his/her first job, the market rate dictates the wage. i am not sure about others, but i will not advocate minimum wage for these group of employees.</p>
              <p>i support minimum wage for menial, entry level jobs such as a sweeper, gardener, cleaner, etc. the rising cost of living will not wait for one's wage to catch up. the train left the station already. for a singaporean living here, especially those who are less educated and less mobile, to be subjected to harsh competition from china, india, vietnam or the philippines who is willing to take a fraction of the pay for a particular job is not fair. say the government does its homework and decide that S$1100 is the minimum sum that a poor can get by monthly, it should then decide on the range of jobs that should have a starting pay of S1100. then, if the foreigners want to come and compete for these relatively `high' pay job, they are welcome to do so. then they can pit their skillsets and shows that they are better than singaporeans. no quarrel here. the best person for the job wins, regardless of nationality. but if they come and say, "psk, psk, i can work for 40% less....", then there is no story here. Singaporeans are definitely marginalized. no wonder those in these strata of society are pissed off.</p>
              <p>singapore compete on the ground of efficiency and effectiveness, a hi-tech no corruption environment. it is already not the cheapest place to do business. but it has its distinct advantages. it continues to pay high wages to talents, locals or foreigners.</p>
              <p>However, for the government to flip the coin when it comes to entry level jobs and poorer singaporeans; and say that we need to be as cheap as possible is a fucking, outright hyprocrisy. even when sweeping the floor, we need someone to do a good job sweeping and not some half baked job because the sweeper comes cheap. if we can need to pay TOP wage for the man at the top, why can't we extend the same logic to the all levels of job, including the sweepers and the guy who clears up the mess on the table the richer singaporeans leave at the foodcourt/hawker center? well, let's not talk top wages. let's start with FAIR wage first. </p>

              <p><br>Why it sounds like a govt tagline? Sometimes I am happy to see PAP run the show......because in the hands of other parties, if we go by their speeches, really can't imagine what would happen to our economy. Our govt is well-known in being rationale and practical in running the economy and will choose to ignore people if they see it as unhelpful.</p>
              <p>Woah.....if FTs come and compete for the job because of the higher pay, they are welcomed to do so??? Do you make sense? Ask yourself. Wouldn't this lead to job shortage internally?</p>
