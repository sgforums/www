              <p>One of the advantage behind implementing a minimum <strong>HOURLY</strong> wage is to protect all employees in Singapore regardless of nationality/race/age/educational level. Say our lowest hourly wage in Singapore is $4/hour for an employee working in a fast food outlet or some long kang digger occupation, by increasing that hourly rate to say....$12/hour, it would encourage people working at the minimum hourly rate to be more <strong>productive</strong> at their job, encourages more people taking up lower income jobs or skilled jobs, providing a <strong>lifestyle confidence</strong> and <strong>future security guarantee</strong> to low income earners, leading to the increase in quality of service and committment in low income jobs, <strong>minimised salary exploitations</strong> from any employers, transforming and marketing Singapore into a workforce of talents to the world market and displaying our political strength and security to our neighbouring countries and the rest of the world.</p>
              <p>The action would seal the significant salary and lifestyle gap between the lower income earner group and the middle income earner group. Once the minimum HOURLY wage is set, the employers would have to implement it and lower income earners in the company will benefit immediately. How the rest of the hourly wages are adjusted for middle income or higher earners will be determined by the employers themselves. The move will create workforce benefits for employees across the market, as employees are now ranked accordingly to how much they earned per hour based on their monthly wages. Say, instead of giving a pay rise to an employee, the employer could choose to reduce the number of working hours which the employee works in a month and still remained paid the same amount of monthly salary. Thus providing more time and relaxation for employees to recharge themselves and at least keep up with their  productivity in the workforce or even increase in productivity.</p>
              <p>This would also instill some form of pride and respect among the lower income earners in the workforce as even long kang diggers would be regarded as a profession waste recyclers if they are paid professionally.</p>
              <p>16/f/lonely is an individual who doesn't have a vision for the people and the country of Singapore, and it is understandable that she is unable to provide or support with any <strong>positive</strong> feedbacks or suggestions as "she" is still "young" and probably still feeling "lonely". I'm so glad that Singapore is managed by "HER".</p>

              <p>Unfortunately you missed out a few points.</p>
              <p>1) What should the minimum wage be? You, my dear friend, as a employee will be happy, but the employer? And when employers pull out or some even become bankrupt as they find that they cannot pass on the extra costs, who do you think suffers most ultimately? YOU!</p>
              <p>2) Will people really be encouraged to bemore productive? WRONG. I don't blame you for saying that people will be more productive, because it was indeed one of the benefits IN THEORY. What really happened, as the govts found out was people became LESS productive. Apparently the people worked fewer hours for the same pay.<img title="Laughing" src="http://sgforums.com/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing"></p>

                  the last federal minimum wage increases in 1996 and 1997, the nation
                  experienced lower unemployment, low inflation, robust growth and

              <p>Why shouldn't the middle income group be protected from wage depression too ?</p>
              <p>Let say you set the minimum wage at $5/hr.</p>
              <p>Say, the middle income group's range has always been $15/hr-$20/hr. Will a $5 minimum wage has any effect on this group ? ZILCH !</p>
              <p>And there you have , another middle income squeeze.</p>
              <p>With a multi-tierd system.. it protects minimum wage across the board, with some exemptions ofcors !</p>
              <p>Like I said, this idea is new.. but it doesn't means it is not feasible.</p>

              <p>This is not wrong.</p>
              <p>But people have dignity and pride. Nobody is willing to readily rely on welfare, onli the lazy and greedy ones do.</p>
              <p>The gahmen can do more to help them be sufficient by providing the infrastructure they need to be self sufficient.</p>
              <p>I am in the USA , and the old are able to go around freely in their little electric scooter. All the pedestrians are paved and buildings has codes to ensure they are not stuck in any single locations. The public transports are handicap friendly. This inturns makes it easy for families with their strollers to get around..</p>
              <p>They have age and illness discrimination laws to protect them.</p>
              <p>The poors gets true subsidised assistance.</p>
              <p>The public schools are free.</p>
              <p>I tell you. There's so much more our gahmen can do.. but are too lazy to use their brain.</p>
              <p>Here, if you are poor.. it is because you choose to. Not like in Singapore.. everything also is lan lan. Get the drift ?</p>
              <p>And so it becomes an atrocious act when the gahmen pays themselves so much money.. and compare SG to first worlds.. trust me.... we are still FAR FROM IT.</p>
              <p>In Singapore.. it is almost impossible to have a second career because of age discrimination.. but in USA.. many people are in their second or third career.</p>
