              <p>Haha......so many economies have repeatedly shown that a minimum wage hurts more in the long run.</p>
              <p>A market exists because there's demand and supply. The pay exists because it is agreed implicitly upon by employees and employers.</p>
              <p>You're essentially removing that equation by introducing such a law.</p>
              <p>Employees get higher pay and would agree, but employers would not. So, they will fire workers and reduce demand for workers. Yet, the supply for workers who agree to this new pay will not fall, in fact, they would rise! So you get job shortage, and a resulting lower productivity in return for this so called welfare.</p>
              <p>The consequences will only show in the long-term.</p>

              <p>So why is child labour an issue? Why do so many countries enact legislations that outlaw child labour since that too, in theory, hurts the economies in the long run?</p>

              <p>This is completely ridiculous - a minimum wage seeks to ensure
              the basic needs of the lowest strata of society are adequately
              taken care of, not ensuring you get a pay that commensurates with
              your ability to reflect your status or redefine the social
              stratification.</p>
              <p>The only variation in minimum wages I know of are those which
              set different guidelines for different cities (within the same
              country) due to the differing cost of living, which makes perfect
              sense. The Chinese adopt this system and plans are afoot in the UK
              to increase the minimum wage in London...</p>

              <p>The solution is not to compete through productivity. Listen to the government on this part and you will forever be stuck in such a never-ending race. So what if you have gone and take another course to up your productivity? Very very soon, another FT with better productivity will come along and compete. Then you take another course to upgrade yourself. Then another better productivity FT come along again. This is a never ending cycle.</p>

              <p><br>The surplus we keep as foreign reserves.</p>
              <p>I'm not saying a surplus is good, the best would have been neither deficit nor surplus. But an exceptionally high surplus indicates that S'pore is exporting goods and services far more than it imports.</p>
              <p>Considering how much we actually import, this is really no mean feat. If we do not KEEP training, we would have ended up like USA which is running a deficit of $3T.</p>
              <p>At this rate the USA greenback keeps flowing out, there'll come a time when it will collapse. It really is just a matter of time.</p>

              <p><br>Unfortunately those soft lands the US made over those years were because the FED cut interest rates everytime something happens.</p>
              <p>By doing so, the effects will merely be transferred to another part and consumers carry on. But there will come one day the US will face a big recession chiefly because the debt is simply unsustainable.</p>

              <p>Yeah these low  interest rates make me crazy lah!</p>
                  <p>Worse case scenario the US stops buying golf clubs and shower curtains from countries with cheap labor.</p>
                  <p>And starts making it's own junk again.</p>
                  <p>My main concern is that the US leftist party will gain the white house and start monekying around with the economy. Instead of the mild recession that the US is heading for we could experience a mini-depression.</p>
