              <p>Observing the increased in the population of unhappy/sad/depressed Singaporeans around us, especially when taking public transport, I feel that the source of that unhappiness is not caused by lifestyle but the minimum amount of money  or "dough" that Singaporeans earned are not adjusted compared to the cost of living in Singapore.</p>
              <p>This could be an increasing problem for Singaporeans now and even worse in the future.</p>
              <p>Should the minimum income be adjusted so Singaporeans could focus on growing the economy than making ends meets?</p>

              <p>looking at the never ending price hikesssssss,</p>
              <p>I support min wage to be implemented.</p>
              <p>Looking at the cost of living and pressure of living and low quality of life, I think it may reduce some mental cases and suicides if implemented.</p>
              <p>this is a cruel world. more cruel than before and no end in sight. raped by the world.</p>
              <p>exception will be when your life and career was preplanned by someone and born with golden spoon and inherited stinking loads of money. no need to prove to be successful. Just take.</p>

              <p>A minimum wage could be defined as the lowest hourly rate that is acceptable to every Singaporeans in Singapore.</p>
              <p>By setting a minimum hourly wage, it will serves as a standard which employers must obey by law to prevent labour exploitations, protects all employees in Singapore and significantly reduces gap between the lower income earners and the middle-income earners and higher-income earners.</p>

              <p>No, minimum wage should be fix according to the grades. Positions which are prone to wage competitions from FTs .</p>
              <p>Example.</p>
              <p>Low grade min income $A/hr ( Cleaners, Domestic helpers, Construction workers)</p>
              <p>Lower middle grades min income $B/hr ( Junior clericals/administrative, assistant/helpers etc)</p>
              <p>Middle grade min income $C/hr ( Engineers, Teachers,  Technical  positions,  Middle management executives etc)</p>
              <p>Upper grade income .. no minimum wage since it wouldn't matter anyway. ( Doctors, Bankers, CEOs etc )</p>

              <p>first of all, look at your income expenses balance sheet, and decide for yourself which are unnecessary spendings.</p>
              <p>second, when your income &gt; expenses, what have you done to your extra savings? Just save in the bank and wait for interest like what is being done with the CPF?</p>
              <p>third, are you only blaming others? Eg blame the govt, blame your wife for spending money, blame your children for spending so much, blame your parents for spending so much, etc? Do you think you yourself has no blame?</p>

              <p>Total bull-shit.</p>
              <p>What you're saying applies to a closed-economy.</p>
              <p>If my wage increase but all my $$ goes to import and not local produced goods, how can that lead to inflation?</p>
              <p>If we set minimum wages, it would simply depress our GDP further, in view of our appreciating currency.</p>
              <p>Yet, it is not as simple as it looks. The afore-mentioned will only occur if we assume that S'porean skills are not as high-valued. If we're highly valued for our productivity, then the impact will not be so great.</p>
              <p>BUT, we should still not have minimum wages. How are we gonna expect SMEs to survive, and SMEs play a big role here.</p>

              <p>Total bull-shit.</p>
              <p>What you're saying applies to a closed-economy.</p>
              <p>If my wage increase but all my $$ goes to import and not local
              produced goods, how can that lead to inflation?</p>
              <p>If we set minimum wages, it would simply depress our GDP
              further, in view of our appreciating currency.</p>
              <p>Yet, it is not as simple as it looks. The afore-mentioned will
              only occur if we assume that S'porean skills are not as
              high-valued. If we're highly valued for our productivity, then the
              impact will not be so great.</p>
              <p>BUT, we should still not have minimum wages. How are we gonna
              expect SMEs to survive, and SMEs play a big role here.</p>
