              <p>You might need more than just a shrink given your challenged
                      intellect though. What are your links supposed to prove? That
                      minimum wage segregated on the basis of professions exist?</p>
              <p>So much for a "creative" novel untested idea that's as feasible
                      as a lunatic's ramblings.</p>
              <p>And what's the fuss with the multi-tiered middle income you're
                      advocating? Just because you fall in that tier, this lot deserves
                      additional protection? If this group needs protection in view of
                      the income squeeze, why not go one better and ensure even the
                      richest of the rich are entitled to a safety net that ensures their
                      income gap to those below them also stays intact?</p>
              <p>More importantly, who determines which profession should fall
                      into each tier (I presume there're actually "superior" professions,
                      eh?) - you? Why not go further and advocate further "protection"
                      with a more concise minumum wage policies on the basis of gender,
                      nationality, ethnicity, religious persuasion or political
                      affiliation? Maybe you'd like to shed some light on how such a
                      ridiculous idea could be implemented - for all you know, that might
                      just nail you the Nobel Prize if you could putÂ that idea of
                      yoursÂ to work and elevate you from your "middle" class status
                      to one that would require no protection.</p>

              <p>If you want to keep following people's backside .. I ain't stopping you. That's the easiest way isn't it ? Since you no need to come up with ideas.. just use what's been used and tested... easy peasy.. no need to use your blain. Good for you!!</p>

              <p>Sorry dude, if you think the middle income group don't deserve protecting that's your prerogative.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, most of my friends and their parents falls under the middle income group. And looking at the current Singapore's context, they DO need wage protection due to the droves of FT entry.</p>
              <p>If you want to argue further .. I suggest you go read up more on minimum wage. It's not a very difficult chapter to understand.</p>

              <p>If you want to keep following people's backside .. I ain't stopping you. That's the easiest way isn't it ? Since you no need to come up with ideas.. just use what's been used and tested... easy peasy.. no need to use your blain. Good for you!!</p>
              <p>Sorry dude, if you think the middle income group don't deserve protecting that's your prerogative.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, most of my friends and parents falls under the middle income group. And looking at the current Singapore's context, they DO need wage protection due to the droves of FT entry.</p>
              <p>If you want to argue further .. I suggest you go read up more on minimum wage. It's not a very difficult chapter to understand.</p>

              <p>Are you ignorant or simply foolhardy? Just because I allegedly "ridiculed" your idea does not in any way suggest I'm against minimum wage, does it?</p>
              <p>To drive home my message to someone obscenely dense : I think your idea of a multi-tiered minimum wage policy is both unfeasible and working against the principles minimum wage is supposed to serve. In short, the brand of multi-tiered minimum wage actually does more to accentuate social inequity than narrow the income gap. That said, I am all for minimum wage (the brand you see worldwide - whether it works and how effective it is are an entirely separatematter). Period. Sharp and concise. Does that answer your question? (For the record, I belong neither to the middle nor lower income strata in the strictest demographic definition churned out by the regime's statistics, but the point about having minimum wage to reduce social inequity isn't lost on me)</p>
              <p>As for your point, I was questioning the viability of your "creative" suggestion - at which point did I assert my idea (when I never even mentioned one) to be right and absolute? How you liken my "attitude" to this regime is beyond me - if anything, I find it perplexing you find your views absolute and untouchable (so who's behaving like the infamous regime now?)...</p>
