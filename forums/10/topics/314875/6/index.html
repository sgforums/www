              <p>Yah.. Costco sells mostly in bulk that's why it's cheap. But you must purchase membership to shop there.There quality is actually not too bad, but ofcors not as good as the regular retail lah.</p>
              <p>Cheap is cheap.. but mostly are imports from CHINA and South America.</p>
              <p>And please hor, when you are here.. and please inform your other colleague.</p>
              <p>when you dine in restaurants.. remember to tip. It is not to reward the server.. but you are actually paying their wages.</p>
              <p>Tip is 15% of the bill.</p>
              <p>For a bigger group is 18%.</p>
              <p>They may initially not like to serve Asian tourist.. because they always never tip o or just tip 1-2 lollar. But after you tip them the first time.. and you go back again. they will be more than happy to serve you properly.</p>
              <p>And after you finish your meal.. please don't sit around and chit chat ESPECIALLY if the restaurant is crowded. It's bad manners, and they need to clear the tables for next customer so they get more tips. OK ?</p>

              <p>With a multi-tierd system.. it protects minimum wage across the board, with some exemptions ofcors !</p>

              <p>You might need more than just a shrink given your challenged intellect though. What are your links supposed to prove? That minimum wage segregated on the basis of professions exist?</p>
              <p>So much for a "creative" novel untested idea that's as feasible as a lunatic's ramblings.</p>
              <p>And what's the fuss with the multi-tiered middle income you're advocating? Just because you fall in that tier, this lot deserves additional protection? If this group needs protection in view of the income squeeze, why not go one better and ensure even the richest of the rich are entitled to a safety net that ensures their income gap to those below them also stays intact?</p>
              <p>More importantly, who determines which profession should fall into each tier (I presume there're actually "superior" professions, eh?) - you? Why not go further and advocate further "protection" with a more concise minumum wage policies on the basis of gender, nationality, ethnicity, religious persuasion or political affiliation? Maybe you'd like to shed some light on how such a ridiculous idea could be implemented - for all you know, that might just nail you the Nobel Prize if you could put that idea of yours to work and elevate you from your "middle" class status to one that would require no protection.</p>
              <p>So what garb are you trying to espouse?</p>

              <p><br>No problem, but please don't make me sound like some smartass. These are my opinions with what I know.</p>
              <p>1) The exploited part is not what I said. In fact, there's hardly such a thing as exploited because even in the case of sweatshops, it is ultimately the worker's choice to work there. The word 'exploit' must be the most overused word I've heard from the opposition. Unfortunately, there are indeed such cases, where children are actually abducted or lured to work. But this is not the norm.</p>
              <p>I don't quite get the 2nd part.</p>
              <p>2) You get job shortages because employers will lower their quantity demanded of workers and not the demand itself. If quantity demanded falls, and yet at the same time, quantity of workers rise, you get a job shortage in that particular job market.</p>
              <p>This phenomenon is different from say.....demand for workers rising from firms because when demand itself rises, the quantity of workers demanded would rise per unit wage. This translates to firms themselves offering higher wages to get the required number of workers. But when wage alone increases and this is the only factor, the demand itself does not increase. QUANTITY demanded falls. Firms will not willingly increase their wages because they have no reason to. To offset this, they will lay-off workers. Yet at the other side, QUANTITY supplied by workers will rise, and this will lead to a shortage of jobs to go around.</p>

              <p><br>That's correct.</p>
              <p>So instead of proposing min wages, alternatives can include subsidising SMEs which I believe the govt is already doing so that they can offer higher wages and more workers.</p>
              <p>Of course, the $$ will still come from our pockets, so there's really no forseeable solution besides the good old reformative training, much as we (and I) hate.</p>
              <p>If oversupply is the cause of low wages in certain job markets, training would cause supply of labour in these markets to shrink and force wages up. Of course, this is where the problem of FTs come in.</p>

But this is not the norm.</p>
              <p>I don't quite get the 2nd part.</p>
              <p>2) You get job shortages because employers will lower their quantity demanded of workers and not the demand itself. If quantity demanded falls, and yet at the same time, quantity of workers rise, you get a job shortage in that particular job market.</p>
              <p>This phenomenon is different from say.....demand for workers rising from firms because when demand itself rises, the quantity of workers demanded would rise per unit wage. This translates to firms themselves offering higher wages to get the required number of workers. But when wage alone increases and this is the only factor, the demand itself does not increase. QUANTITY demanded falls. Firms will not willingly increase their wages because they have no reason to. To offset this, they will lay-off workers. Yet at the other side, QUANTITY supplied by workers will rise, and this will lead to a shortage of jobs to go around.</p>

              <p>1. i still don't get you. in the singapore context of this discussion, where singaporean today compete with cheaper FTs who has almost an easy access to singapore; you claimed these menial workers are worse off with minimum wages. you specifically arrowed the singaporeans as receiving the short end of the stick. i just need a simple explanation from you to back up what you said. personally, i cannot comprehend that, hence your clarity in this is appreciated.</p>
              <p>2. whether a company hire more or less, pay more or less for a worker, is not a factor of wage alone. the operating expenses consists of many, many elements, one of which is the wage of the worker. if a company produce a goods or services that is in demand, and has good operating profit, wage of the workers itself will not make or break the company. it will be simplistic to blame the wages of the workers as the cause of competitive capitulation of a company or economy. costs can be reduced/improved through other areas, by having a different cost structure through improved efficiency, or having a different go-to-market strategy. perhaps the product/services in question is not relevant to the market anymore. what i am trying to get at is if a company do not just equate singapore's favourable workforce environment with wage alone, why are we shooting ourselves in the foot by doing so? often times, the government positioned singapore as a preferred business destination because of an educated workforce, smart, hardworking and perhaps obliging. we never mentioned that we are cheap. now, all of a sudden, not only do we have to be all of the above, we need to be `cheap'  as well. and then again, there's a double standard to this. `cheap' if you have a menial job but folks like us who's white collars and professionals needs to be highly paid because we need the brightest.</p>

              <p><br>It's really hard to explain....really.</p>
              <p>2) Ok, you are right that there are other factors. But, put it this way. A wage factor affects the market different from the other factors. A wage increase/decrease that comes about for reasons other than changes in the market will cause a shortage/surplus accordingly. A wage increase/decrease that comes about because of changes in the market will not cause this. This is because a direct wage change is not the result of changes in the demand and supply of labour. Because demand and supply of labour remains the same, quantity demanded and quantity supplied will adjust instead. Because both quantities expressed are now different, firms expressing less demand for workers, while more workers are now willing to work for the firms, you get a shortage.</p>
              <p>1) I claim the lowest of the lowest will be worse off, because of part 2. It makes sense that firms will lay-off the least productive, who are usually this group of people.</p>
