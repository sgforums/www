              <p><strong>Shenzhen Post, 17 Jun 2009</strong><br><br> <strong>Acting Mayor of Shenzhen: Shenzhen to surpass Singapore</strong><br> <br> Since former Party Secretary of Suzhou, Wangrong, was transferred
              to Shenzhen as Acting Mayor, the relationship between he and Singapore
              had been the topic that got extensive solicitude of China’s media. <span style="color: red;"><strong>Guangzhou
              Yangcheng Evening News recently reported in headline, “Wang Rong: Learn
              from Singapore, Challenge Singapore and Surpass Singapore”.</strong></span><br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>The 51 years old Wang Rong had assumed Suzhou
              Party Secretary since 2004 and the Suzhou Industrial Park presented a
              trend of accelerated growth during his office term. </strong></span><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">Senior
              Minister Lee Kuan Yew used to, when taking part in the 15th Anniversary
              of Suzhou Industrial Park on May 26th, concluded with a sentence of
              “the pupils outdoes the master. ”</span></strong><br> <br> Suzhou Industrial Park was established 15 year ago. The total output
              value and fiscal revenue of this Park last year were 100 billion yuan
              and 20 billion yuan respectively. The Park that accounted 3.4% of the
              land and 5.2% of the population of Suzhou created 16% of the city’s
              aggregate economic volume.<br> <br> Yangcheng Evening News reported, Shenzhen had emphasized to learn from Singapore and challenge Singapore since last year. <span style="color: red;"><strong>Wang
              Rong used to visit Singapore and had many contacts with Chinese
              officials, so he had the voice in what to learn and how to learn.</strong></span><br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>In addition, Guangdong Provincial Party Secretary
              Wang Yang had always advocated the concept of challenging Singapore
              since taking office and Wang Rong’s background and experience just meet
              Wang Yang’s requirements.</strong></span><br> <br> Director of Singapore Research Center of Shenzhen University, LV Yuanli
              said, “as a scholar studying Singapore, I have the instinctive
              excitement when hearing Wang Rong is from Suzhou. His advocate of
              learning and challenging Singapore will certainly help strengthen the
              ties between Shenzhen and Singapore and also will help Shenzhen to
              learn from Singapore’s experience.”<br> <br> Lv Yuanli pointed out Singapore has a Suzhou Industrial Park in Suzhou,
              an Eco City in Tianjin and a Knowledge City maybe in Guagnzhou, but
              nothing in Shenzhen. “It’ll be beneficial if Shenzhen has some
              projects,” he said.<br> <br> A Guangzhou official said Guangzhou had recently broke out several
              events of senior officials falling. Some began to worry that if it
              would impact the confidence of Singapore and ASEAN to Guangzhou.
              “Taking Singapore as an example, there were two delegations of
              high-level government and business circle visiting Guangdong, one of
              which was led by Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong, and signed several
              cooperation agreements including the Guangzhou Knowledge City that is
              being researched. We don’t hope those events will affect Singapore’s
              investing confidence and Wang Rong’s transfer will definitely help to
              stabilize this situation. ”<br> <br> However, not everybody support the idea of challenging Singapore.
              Former Mayor of Shenzhen, Xu Zongheng used to tend to the idea of
              “learning from Hong Kong and serve for Hong Kong”, which is obviously
              opposite to Wang Yang.<br> <br> Shenzhen senior scholar Zhu Jianguo said when being interviewed that
              although Xu Zongheng had commit corruption, the concept of “learning
              from Hong Kong and serve for Hong Kong” had gained public approval,
              because most of Shenzhen people were familiar with Hong Kong and the
              idea was easily accepted.<br> <br> -------------------------<br> <span style="color: navy;"><strong>More at <a href="http://singaporenewsalternative.blogspot.com/">Singapore News Alternative</a>:</strong><br> <br> 1.
