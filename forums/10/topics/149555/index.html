            <div class='col-md body'>Are you ready for the red pill?<br>The defining dramatic moment in the film The Matrix occurs just after Morpheus invites Neo to choose between a red pill and a blue pill. The red pill promises "the truth, nothing more." Neo takes the red pill and awakes to reality--something utterly different from anything Neo, or the audience, could have expected. What Neo had assumed to be reality turned out to be only a collective illusion, fabricated by the Matrix and fed to a population that is asleep, cocooned in grotesque embryonic pods. In Plato's famous parable about the shadows on the walls of the cave, true reality is at least reflected in perceived reality. In the Matrix world, true reality and perceived reality exist on entirely different planes.<br><br>The story is intended as metaphor, and the parallels that drew my attention had to do with political reality. This article offers a particular perspective on what's going on in the world--and how things got to be that way--in this era of globalization. From that red-pill perspective, everyday media-consensus reality--like the Matrix in the film--is seen to be a fabricated collective illusion. Like Neo, I didn't know what I was looking for when my investigation began, but I knew that what I was being told didn't make sense. I read scores of histories and biographies, observing connections between them, and began to develop my own theories about roots of various historical events. I found myself largely in agreement with writers like Noam Chomsky and Michael Parenti, but I also perceived important patterns that others seem to have missed.<br><br>When I started tracing historical forces, and began to interpret present-day events from a historical perspective. I could see the same old dynamics at work and found a meaning in unfolding events far different from what official pronouncements proclaimed. Such pronouncements are, after all, public relations fare, given out by politicians who want to look good to the voters. Most of us expect rhetoric from politicians, and take what they say with a grain of salt. But as my own picture of present reality came into focus, "grain of salt" no longer worked as a metaphor. I began to see that consensus reality--as generated by official rhetoric and amplified by mass media--bears very little relationship to actual reality. "The matrix" was a metaphor I was ready for.<br><br>In consensus reality (the blue-pill perspective) "left" and "right" are the two ends of the political spectrum. Politics is a tug-of-war between competing factions, carried out by political parties and elected representatives. Society gets pulled this way and that within the political spectrum, reflecting the interests of whichever party won the last election. The left and right are therefore political enemies. Each side is convinced that it knows how to make society better; each believes the other enjoys undue influence; and each blames the other for the political stalemate that apparently prevents society from dealing effectively with its problems.<br><br>This perspective on the political process, and on the roles of left and right, is very far from reality. It is a fabricated collective illusion. Morpheus tells Neo that the Matrix is "the world that was pulled over your eyes to hide you from the truth....As long as the Matrix exists, humanity cannot be free." Consensus political reality is precisely such a matrix. Later we will take a fresh look at the role of left and right, and at national politics. But first we must develop our red-pill historical perspective. I've had to condense the arguments to bare essentials; please see the annotated sources at the end for more thorough treatments of particular topics.</div>

It also extended for a further two years the detention orders of 17 other men. In total, 36 men accused of plotting to carry out bomb attacks continued to be held without charge or trial under the ISA. The authorities said that many of the men, who were arrested in 2001, 2002 and 2004, were members or supporters of an Islamist group, Jemaah Islamiyah. The ISA violates the right to a fair and public trial and the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty according to law.

Ignorance is bliss."<br><br>Has everyone taken the BLUE pill? Every one is happy in little<br>Pleasantville Singapore. We circulate an old article below which gives many food for thought.<br><br>By: kelvint...@...<br>Date: 1 Jan 2002<br><br>http://www.geocities.com/kelviÂ­ntan73/articles/matrix.htm<br><br>The Matrix is certainly a great movie, with a lot of philosophical<br>and religious themes. "The One" seems to refer to the Messiah Jesus<br>in Christianity while I like what the boy in the Oracle's house<br>teaching Keanu how to bend a spoon: realize that there is no spoon in<br>your hand, only electrical impulses in your brain, and then it will<br>be yourself that bend and not the spoon.<br><br>James Gomez has released his book, Self Censorship: Singapore's<br>Shame. In that book, he explained very concisely how the notorious<br>climate of fear works in Singapore. This made me recall The Matrix<br>once again. As I recalled, The Matrix mainly examines the question:<br>What if what we believe is reality is actually a dream, and reality<br>is actually a nightmare we'd rather not have to deal with?<br><br>As I was recalling the movie, I saw for myself its relation to<br>Singapore. It is amazing how the themes spoke to me about<br>the 'climate of fear' that is present here. I could now understand<br>better how it is possible for some people to feel this cognitive<br>dissonance about Singapore when the majority of the Singaporeans do<br>not seem to feel it. I remember watching the National Day parade<br>each year, observing so many Singaporeans in the National Stadium<br>displaying such a deep sense of pride in Singapore and I was<br>wondering to myself, "You mean they don't realize the truth?"<br><br>The objective of this article is to give my personal and hopefully<br>unique review of the Matrix and how Singapore, to me at least, is so<br>much similar to the movie. I will be using what I learn in the<br>movie to come up with a model that explains Singaporean's political<br>behavior, hopefully enhancing what James Gomez has said in his<br>brilliant book.<br><br>Basically, the 'Matrix model' divides Singaporeans into three<br>different categories. Through the interactions of Singaporeans<br>belonging to the different categories, I hope to be able to offer<br>insights to the political behavior of Singaporeans. I shall be<br>using quite a few quotes from the movie as I explain. Of course, I<br>do not expect others to see it the same way as I do. I think the<br>directors of The Matrix wanted each of us to interpret for ourselves<br>whether we truly live in a Matrix. This article is my interpretation.<br><br>Three categories of Singaporeans<br><br>"Repression, Sir is a habit that grows. I am told it is like making<br>love-it is always easier the second time! The first time there may<br>be pangs of conscience, a sense of guilt. But once embarked on this<br>course with constant repetition you get more and more brazen in the<br>attack. All you have to do is to dissolve organizations and<br>societies and banish and detain the key political workers in these<br>societies. Then miraculously everything is tranquil on the surface.<br>Then an intimidated press and the government-controlled radio<br>together can regularly sing your praises, and slowly and steadily the<br>people are made to forget the evil things that have already been<br>done, or if these things are referred to again they're conveniently<br>distorted and distorted with impunity, because there will be no<br>opposition to contradict." (Lee Kuan Yew as an opposition PAP member<br>during 1956 speaking to David Marshall)<br><br>For those of you who did not manage to get his book, James Gomez has<br>explained very well how is it that many Singaporeans are immediately<br>disturbed whenever one of them try to discuss politics in a critical<br>manner. I have experienced that for myself when I discuss such<br>issues with my own friends so I can vouch for that. After watching<br>the Matrix, I begin to classify Singaporeans into three categories.<br><br>Category One: The people living in the Matrix<br><br>The first category, which I think form the largest majority, is<br>similar to the many people living in the Matrix. The majority of the<br>Singaporeans, in my opinion, do not realize or have never found out<br>the truth behind the PAP's control over their lives, the media and<br>the law society. The actual events of the 1987 Marxist conspiracy<br>and what happened to Francis Seow were also hidden from them. I<br>think this probably categorize those people who cheered with such<br>pride during National Day. In my opinion, I cannot imagine anyone<br>feeling such pride for Singapore if they bother to research into<br>these events.<br><br>For these category of Singaporeans, whenever they hear someone like<br>Chee Soon Juan, whom I put as belonging to the third category of<br>Singaporeans, telling them about the truth behind Singapore's<br>Micropolis disaster or the Suzhou Industrial Park Fiasco, they may be<br>thinking, "What is this ingrate saying? I am proud of Singapore and<br>to me, the PAP is the only party capable of leading Singapore." At<br>this point, Morpheus made an insightful remark about the Matrix:<br><br>Morpheus: (Talking to Keanu) Unfortunately, no one can be told what<br>the Matrix is. You have to see it for yourself.<br><br>Thus, for this majority group of Singaporeans, nobody can make them<br>realize what is really going on in Singapore. Until they witness<br>first-hand for themselves, they will reject any thesis that tells<br>them they have been misled. Furthermore, they may not appreciate<br>realizing the truth because once they do, they are very likely to<br>move into the next category of Singaporeans, which I would describe<br>below as a very disturbing phase. Keanu Reeves himself initially did<br>not appreciate Morpheus trying to free his mind, Morpheus later<br>remark to Keanu:<br><br>Morpheus: I feel that I owe you an apology. There is a rule that<br>we do not free a mind once it reaches a certain age. It is<br>dangerous. They have trouble letting go. Their mind turns against<br>them.<br><br>How true that is for this category of Singaporeans! I will describe<br>later in the end how I came to "free my mind".<br><br>Category Two: The blue pill (Ignorance is bliss)<br><br>Morpheus: (Talking to Keanu) You take the blue pill and the story<br>ends. You wake in your bed and you believe whatever you want to<br>believe. You take the red pill and you stay in Wonderland and I show<br>you how deep the rabbit-hole goes.<br><br>In the above scene, the blue pill was offered to Keanu such that,<br>when he takes it, he will return to the Matrix world and remembers<br>nothing. Keanu, and apparently, all the other people of Morpheus's<br>gang, chose the red pill to begin their battle against the Matrix.<br><br>The second category of Singaporeans, to me, are those who may<br>have 'taken the red pill' and found out about all these events. They<br>might have realize that, you cannot possibly be happy living in<br>Singapore knowing all these information. Thus, they begin a process<br>of trying to expel the knowledge from their mind. When I saw the<br>character, Cypher, in the Matrix, it suddenly dawned upon me that he<br>represents this particular category of Singaporeans. Let's take a<br>closer look at his words:<br><br>Cypher: (Talking to Keanu) I know what you're thinking, because I've<br>been thinking the same thing. Actually, I've been thinking it ever<br>since I got here. Why oh why didn't I take the blue pill?<br><br>Later in the movie, Cypher was talking to those sentinel agents,<br>planning to betray the rest. These are his words:<br><br>Cypher: (Talking to Agent Smith) I know this steak doesn't exist. I<br>know that when I put it in my mouth, the Matrix is telling my brain<br>that it is juicy and delicious. After nine years, do you know what I<br>realized? Ignorance is bliss.<br><br>Ignorance is bliss! "How true that is in context to the climate of<br>fear in Singapore," I realized. Therefore, these Singaporeans are<br>perhaps thinking to themselves, "Why must I know all these? Is it<br>not easier to accept the PAP's rule and focus on making money and in<br>raising up a happy family? Who cares about freedom of speech and<br>transparency when we have safe streets in Singapore?"<br><br>Agent Smith: Then we have a deal?<br><br>Cypher: I don't want to remember nothing. Nothing! You understand?<br>And I want to be rich. Someone<br>important. Like an actor. You can do that, right?<br><br>From my own experience, I am aware that there are Singaporeans whom I speak to in typical 'coffee shop talk' who might have the same<br>perspective as Cypher. It always amazes me that, whenever I bring up<br>any social issue that attempts to question the way the PAP is running<br>Singapore, I can clearly see that they are very uncomfortable. It is<br>written all over their faces!<br><br>I used to wonder why are they always so quick to change the topic or<br>so quick to contradict whatever I say with a display of blind faith<br>in the authorities. After watching and hearing Cypher, I begin to<br>realize that they are only rational in doing so. I believe that they<br>are well aware of the real danger if they ever were to pause to<br>seriously consider such issues, which I will describe below<br><br>To these Singaporeans, whenever anyone, Chee Soon Juan for example,<br>tries to tell these Singaporeans the truth, it is immediately<br>rejected, not because these Singaporeans do not believe it, but<br>because they chose not to. These Singaporeans may have attended the<br>many political meetings in NUS, where opposition members like J B<br>Jeyaratnam and Chiam See Tong constantly urge them to take the lead<br>to change the climate in Singapore. Although they realized what is<br>going on, the vast majority would not bother entertaining such<br>thoughts. They have learned from their own cognitive dissonance that<br>such thoughts would only cause them perpetual discomfort.<br><br>Thus, if they continue to feed on such thoughts, they may eventually<br>have to act on it. Examples were made out of Chee Soon Juan and Tang<br>Liang Hong to illustrate to these people that acting on such thoughts<br>are likely to result in huge losses for themselves and their<br>families. Since they have made the choice to stay and make a home in<br>Singapore, they do not want to remember anything else other than the<br>apparent prosperity that they see around themselves.<br><br>These Singaporeans will not be seen in the National Day Parade<br>cheering for Singapore, unlike those in the first category, because<br>they still, in some sense, know what is going on. In my opinion, it<br>is impossible to expel such knowledge completely; I have tried to do<br>so myself without much success. There is a philosophical saying,<br>Better Socrates dissatisfied than a fool satisfied. Better a man<br>dissatisfied than a pig satisfied, that might be applied here.<br><br>These Singaporeans are what Catherine Lim described as those who<br>possess a "Great Affective Divide" for Singapore. The term that was<br>recently initiated by the PAP, 'cosmopolitans' could also apply to<br>these people.<br><br>Category Three: The red pill<br><br>Now, this last category represents people like J B Jeyaratnam, Chee<br>Soon Juan, Francis Seow and all the other exiles from Singapore. I<br>could include Dr Toh Chin Chye in it as well. All of us are aware of<br>the history of the first two and we clearly do not envy them. The<br>supposed 'climate of fear' that exists in Singapore politics is a<br>very scary force to change. Those who really want to change this<br>climate, must be prepared to free himself from this fear and live<br>with whatever consequences that might happen. Keanu Reeves himself<br>have to overcome many of his own doubts about him being 'The One',<br>even dying before being resurrected, before he can unleash his full<br>potential. Too bad real life is not like a movie, or is it? :-)<br><br>My own testimony on how I taken the red pill<br><br>I ask myself, "Which category do I belong to?" I would say I am<br>somewhere in between the second and the third one. I am clearly not<br>someone willing to pay the price like Chee Soon Juan and yet I am<br>clearly not contented to take the blue pill and forget everything.<br><br>I remember the period when I first took the red pill and found out<br>for myself about this climate of fear. It was my first year in NUS.<br>I attended this closed door Philosophy seminar where the topic was on<br>the role of Philosophy in Singapore. I think Cherian George was also<br>present in that seminar, somewhere in July 1994. The discussion<br>turned into an issue about whether the government is open to the idea<br>of Singaporeans thinking for themselves. As a "newbie<br>undergraduate", I tried to make a point then that Singaporeans have<br>no freedom of speech and the government does not want us to<br>contribute to policy making. I think it was Cherian George that<br>later asked me, "If you think freedom of speech is so important, why<br>didn't you parade with banners in Singapore urging for a change?" I<br>remember replying, "Look what happen to Chee Soon Juan."<br><br>At that point of time, there was a combination of chuckling and some<br>silence, but I did not know why. After the seminar, I met up with<br>some of my friends who gave me a rather stern look and said something<br>like, "Why did you say things like that? Didn't you know that S<br>Vasoo was among the audience?" To be frank, at that time, I did not<br>know who S Vasoo was. Later I found out that he was the PAP MP who<br>sued Dr Chee Soon Juan in court in 1992-93.<br><br>And guessed what? I felt scared! I really did feel fearful. I went<br>back home and started wondering, "Oh no! What have I done?" I begin<br>to wonder whether my grades would be condemned from now on, whether<br>my future will be ruined and so on.<br>Looking back, I guess I was too fearful, for my situation now would<br>not have been so if they really kept tabs on me. But the point is<br>still that, for the first time in my life, I experienced for myself<br>the climate of fear in Singapore. Ironically, I originally wanted to<br>be a journalist in the Straits Times. After swallowing that 'red<br>pill', I begin to research more into the history of the press in<br>Singapore. It was then that I found out what happen to the Singapore<br>Herald and the Far Eastern Economic Review. I guess I kissed that<br>dream goodbye after that.<br><br>I also began researching into Singapore's history in 1987, not the<br>official government version, but one told by Francis Seow in his<br>book, To catch a Tartar. After finding out what really happened in<br>the 1987 ISA arrests, I was shocked. I cannot believe that, during<br>that time, I actually ran in front of the TV then whenever they<br>started playing the patriotic songs, Count on Me Singapore and We are<br>Singapore, to sing those songs with a great sense of pride. I guess<br>if any of my friends tried to tell me then what really happened in<br>that year, I would have rejected everything they say completely.<br>Thus at this present moment, I can understand the reaction I get from<br>my friends whenever I try to discuss about politics, after all, I was<br>in their shoes before.<br><br>Conclusion<br><br>I love The Matrix so much for giving me the inspiration to come up<br>with this article. If you were to ask me whether I regretted having<br>taken the red pill, I would say, "No!" I always believe it is better<br>to be Socrates dissatisfied than a fool satisfied. But I understand<br>that my fellow Singaporeans are only rational in remaining apathetic,<br>because if you want to settle down and make Singapore your home,<br>having these thoughts will be very harmful to your mind.<br><br>That is an important reason why I need to get out of Singapore,<br>temporarily at least, for now J. I am not willing to pretend it does<br>not affect me. And I know that, the longer I remain here in<br>Singapore, the more I will have to expel all these thoughts out of my<br>mind. I would hate it if I one day have to put the cross on the<br>lightning symbol of the PAP, during the elections if I get to vote,<br>for 'fear' that my career would be affected if I did not do so; that<br>is a real possibility if I were to settle down here. I do not want<br>my kid to come up one day and ask me, "Daddy, why didn't you stop the<br>PAP earlier from making Singapore to be a city of fear," because I<br>will not know how to answer him.<br><br>I thank God that he has given me an opportunity to experience life in<br>another culture. I want to find out for myself whether I am better<br>off being a second class person in a racially discriminating society<br>like in the US, or being a second class person in a politically<br>discriminating society like Singapore (Of course, Singapore, in my<br>opinion, also practice racism. It is just that I belong to the<br>majority race so I have to look closely to feel it, you can read my<br>viewpoints towards racism in Singapore here) I may not be able to<br>fly like Keanu Reeves did in the last scene of the movie, but I am<br>certainly looking forward to a different environment here.<br><br>Any one with comments on this article can add it here.<br><br></div>
