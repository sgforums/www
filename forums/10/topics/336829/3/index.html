              <p>walau, i know a lot  civil servant vote of opposition last election leh.</p>
              <p>be realistic, there are no such thing as demotion, penalty ect. Because they need civik servant to work, to run the country,ect., if they are gonna harrass civik servant for voting for opposition, then who is going to work?</p>
              <p>civil servant are piad to do the job for the govt. Haha hear this i know one guy who wanted to vote for PAP but when he saw the form he read the instruction wrongly and voted for WP instead!..Thats not his fault.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Civil service is structured and people have to move up the rank . If they are going to sack this person or that person, then that structure is messed up, and there will be problems with effeiciency.</p>

              <p>haha... SM and MM go count vote, like so obvious, and how fast and how many can they count? that's just being chilish. ISD agents are... civil servants. Gurkhas? what reasons will the election committee have to allow the gurhas near the voting areas?</p>

              <p>Not all civil servants are made equal.</p>
              <p>There will always be some who see themselves as just that, the servants of the people, there to serve the rest of his/her fellowmen. There are others who see the "civil servant" not as serving the general population, but as serving the civil service, a.k.a. the government. So depending on which mindset they have, they can choose to align themselves with the People's ideals or the Government's. As mentioned by others, some of the people in our Goverment served the Japanese during the war. Do you think that at those times, they served the invaders (as "civil servants" too) to help the people, or to save their own heads? In times of need, many will place self before others. And with the economy in the current state, how do you think many of the civil servants chosen for this task will react?</p>
              <p>Something to think about.</p>
              <p>As for the fear of whether votes will be used against them, fear can be an irrational state of mind. It matters not whether the probability of something is high, so long fear is put into a man, he is likely to succumb. I only hope for the sake of the nation, the People can rise up against their fear and take the leap of faith.</p>
