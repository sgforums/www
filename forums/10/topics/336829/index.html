              <p>Tuesday, 11 November 2008</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.yoursdp.org/images/stories/items/ballot-box.jpg" border="0" alt="" width="145" align="right"><em>Singapore Democrats</em><br><br>There
              are rumours floating around that the PAP may call for a snap election.
              A few of SDP's friends have told us that some of their civil service
              friends have received letters asking them to undergo training as
              election officials.<br><br>There are also whispers that there is
              heightened activity at the Elections Department. In addition, some
              schools have been identified as nomination and polling stations.</p>
              <p>Of course, these are unconfirmed stories. We have not been able to verify their accuracy. <br><br>We
              would not be surprised, however, if the PAP junked their five-year term
              and go for early polls. Given the economic situation which is going to
              get worse – much worse – in the coming few years, the PAP may be
              tempted to go for elections sooner rather than later.<br><br>Of course,
              Mr Lee Kuan Yew's age is a major factor. Without him, PAP would be
              without its ballast. The octogenarian PAP-founder is still at the
              front, back and centre of everything the Government does, even
              outperforming his prime minister son.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>We have seen some semblance of cohesiveness amongst the opposition during the last elections, but unfortunately all that was smudged by more in-fighting in the election's aftermath. What the opposition needs is a power-broker, someone who could trash out the details to convince the various parties to adopt a common platform as part of fulfilling the greater good, while at the same time fulfilling each party's stake or interest. I'm certain even extreme ideologues within the opposition can understand the simple maxim -  strength through unity. It also takes discipline and fortitude, not by illusions of any mass hysteria which Singaporeans just would not stand for. Look at the reform movements worldwide, has any one movement be founded in a day? Till the day they(the opposition) can actually pull that off and in spite of the obstacles hampered upon them put out a common disciplined campaign, the opposition in Singapore will just be rendered helpless in the face of the mighty mammoth PAP. </p></div>

              <p>Actually this is not surprising at all and the recent airing of the race issue dovetails nicely with the agenda of preparing the Chinese majority for an election. Expect to see more subtle hints being dropped in the media on how race, religion and cultural superiority impacts on good governance and investor confidence in the run up to any impending election. The PAP contribution to maintaining Chinese majority dominance cannot be allowed to be forgotten by the electorate. Furthermore, the organisational machinery of the Opposition is still not up to par yet so why wait for them to get better. Beat them when they're weak and keep them demoralised.</p>
              <p>Now is really the best time for an election. If the PAP continues to maintain a majority, they will have the mandate to rule for 5 more years which is probably enough to weather out a tough global economic climate. When things pick up, the PAP can point to their good leadership during trying times. That's the kind of credit that's very good to have going forward. If the PAP puts off an election now, things may still be gloomy when they have to call for an election and that at the very least puts the PAP majority under unnecessary risk. Also, a PAP win now will secure their mandate and silence opposition towards any tough measure implemented after the election.</p>

Furthermore, they have a chance of retaking one of the opposition seats, given Chiam See Tong's age, I doubt he will run for another term. So the ruling party might have a chance of retaking one of the opposition seats, and maybe more, depending on how much the present boundaries are altered. </p></div>

              <p>THE Elections Department has started preparations for the next general election, which is due at the latest by Feb 2, 2012.</p>
              <p>It has identified 28,000 civil servants to become election officials, and has begun sending letters out to them.</p>
              <p>Replying to queries from the Straits Times, a spokesman for the Elections Department confirmed that it started sending out the letters last month. These letters notify the public officers of their selection as election officials and the training they will undergo.</p>
              <p>Officials will be given one of seven roles, ranging from the highest position of returning officer, who is overall in charge of organisation at a polling station, to counting assistants who tally up votes.</p>
              <p>Training covers election laws, the electoral and voting procedures, and the handling of voting queues and issues on Polling Day, such as voters who turn up without proper identification.</p>
              <p>Although 28,000 public servants are being called up, the actual number deployed will depend on the number of contested constituencies.</p>
              <p>The spokesman added that prior to 2004, election officials were called up for training only after the writ to dissolve Parliament was issued by the President.</p>
              <p>By law, Nomination Day has to be at be least five working days after the writ is issued.</p>
              <p>In 2004, the Elections Department decided to call up civil servants for training much earlier.</p>
              <p>In November that year - three years after the 2001 election - it sent notices to 20,000 civil servants to call them up for training.</p>
              <p>The General Election was held eventually in May 2006.</p>
              <p>The Elections Department spokesman told The Straits Times yesterday that some schools have been designated as polling stations for the next election.</p>
              <p>'Such routine activities are part of our efforts to enhance service delivery,' she added.</p>
              <p>Asked if the plans were an indicator of an early election, the spokesman said no.</p>
              <p>Nevertheless, the moves by the Elections Department have sparked speculation that a snap election may be on the cards.</p>
              <p>At a dialogue with young Singaporeans two weeks ago, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, in response to a question whether polls could be held ahead of the 2012 deadline, said it was possible.</p>

              <p>We would not be surprised, however, if the PAP junked their five-year term and go for early polls. Given the economic situation which is going to get worse – much worse – in the coming few years, the PAP may be tempted to go for elections sooner rather than later.<br><br>Of course, Mr Lee Kuan Yew's age is a major factor. Without him, PAP would be without its ballast. The octogenarian PAP-founder is still at the front, back and centre of everything the Government does, even outperforming his prime minister son.</p>

              <p>not surprising , considering the PAP score well when the election are held during Crisis/recession period.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>any point worth considering is the health of LKY. maybe they try to held it earlier so that the minister mentor can still be part of campaign and be the triump card.</p>

              <p>it won't make a big diff politically when they hold the elections. maybe less work for them to convince the voters? even if they dun hold the elections during times when the economy is poor, majority of singaporeans still would have more confidence in them than the opposition. the opposition here comes across as more divided than united. also, those working for the civil service will most likely vote for pap too. are there any brave civil servants who dared to vote for the opposition?</p>

              <p>i am former civil servant who vote for Opposition every election. i dont feel i got prosecuted at all. this is just urban legends that the PAP will know who vote for opposition.</p>
