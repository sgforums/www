As the economy has become more global and Singaporeans have become more mobile, many Singaporeans have acquired foreign citizenships and reluctantly renounced their Singaporean citizenships even though they may feel a strong emotional attachment to Singapore. Foreigners who have been resident in Singapore for long periods and qualify for Singaporean citizenships are reluctant to naturalise as it would mean giving up citizenship of their native countries. Those who are dual citizens at birth may find it unjust that they are denied their birthright to citizenship of other countries where they were born or that of their parents. Male dual citizens are also not allowed to renounce Singaporean citizenship after the age of 11 and before attaining majority at the age of 21, such that they have to serve National Service at the age of 18 for a country to whom allegiance they may almost immediately abjure that means PRs kids which are not born Sporeans."</div>
