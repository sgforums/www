The real FINAL FIGURE is when an economical dowturn occurs, and these new converts stays on. And you can be sure, the FINAL FIGURES will be MUCH lesser for those who chooses to stay on... be it for personal social reasons or the lack of finances to fly away...<br><br>As I've said, our opinionated government has yet to learn their lesson on their blind faith in FTs, &amp; PRs... It will well have to turn out just like with Casinos...which by then, would be far too late and much damage done.<br><br>Observedly, with every turn-around of their policies, they seem to want to up their salaries... just think; increasing their salaries for doing damage-control all these while and into the future as well??? I believe we will feel less pinch if they up their salaries and PREVENTS damages to society.<br><br></div>

Think once the exodus figure exceeds 8500 per year , they have to seriously think about dual citizenship. If not no of reservists will shrink steadily too since first generation PR has no NS liabilities.<br></div>
