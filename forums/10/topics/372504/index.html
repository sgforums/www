              <p>In singapore, the PAP holds a supermajority of the seats in the parliment, which means they could actually push forward a number of  conterversial changes to Singapore without fearing they would lose any votes.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Take for example, legalising homosexuals and allowing homosexuals to adopt and get married, increasing taxes to get a NHS system and all that.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Don't you think that one of the primary reason why we criticisng the PAP is not just because we don't have a bigger opposition party in the parliment, but because they are too spineless to enact a number of conterverisal changes to the nation?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If having a supermajority of seats in the parliment is not enough for us to recongise the minority in our nation, the LGBT community for example, what's the point of holding on to a supermajority in the nation?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>MM Lee and the PAP loves to argue that we should wait for a time where Singapore becomes more open minded to homosexuality before decriminalising homosexaulity, but what happens if the public becomes less intolerant of those groups of people, and more opposition parties that might be even more conservative than the PAP rise to power? </p>
              <p>Won't it be harder to pass all those controversial Legislative acts if that happens?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If the public is already bitching and moaning at you for not representing their interest enough, yet you managed to retain a supermajority, why can't the PAP just make use of their supermajority?</p>

              <p>Because the majority of the nation would seek to oppress the minority. The very definition of democracy is giving the majority a say over the minority.</p>
              <p> And also because they can afford to. The PAP can afford losing a few seats and stay in power.</p>
              <p>However, the reason why we have rights is because there is a need to protect these minorities from discrimination and harm.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Even then, there are limits to democracy, which is why we don't give people direct democracy. What happens if we give people the right to vote over raising and lowering taxes?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Would a majority of people even vote for raising taxes even though the national treasury might be broke, like what happened in California? No.</p>

              <p>Just because they are the PAP doesn't mean I must disagree outright. If there is any specific policy created by the PAP that is beneficial to the general public, I would gladly side with the PAP on those <strong>specific </strong>issues.</p>

              <p>Exactly. That's one reason why I am angry with the PAP. In my opinion, they have become too obsessed to maintaining their supermajority as opposed to making use of that to give benefits to minority who is being discriminated.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It's not an issue about the PAP being too strong in the parliment, it's about the PAP being too strong yet being too scared to make use of that advantage.</p>

              <p>I think that it is worth the cost of losing a few seats in the parliment to the opposition if they can decriminalise homosexuality, legalise gay marriages. </p>
              <p>That's being a statesman and not being a politician.</p>
              <p>It is ridiculous to believe that any opposition party would dare to push something as conterversial as homosexuals being allowed to get married  or adopt kids, or increasing taxes to give us an NHS system.</p>
              <p>Especially when the support of the opposition party is already very weak to begin with.</p>

              <p>In singapore, the PAP holds a supermajority of the seats in the parliment, which means they could actually push forward a number of  conterversial changes to Singapore without fearing they would lose any votes.</p>

              <p>Don't you think that one of the primary reason why we criticisng the PAP is not just because we don't have a bigger opposition party in the parliment, but because they are too spineless to enact a number of conterverisal changes to the nation?</p>

              <p>MM Lee and the PAP loves to argue that we should wait for a time where Singapore becomes more open minded to homosexuality before decriminalising homosexaulity, but what happens if the public becomes less intolerant of those groups of people, and more opposition parties that might be even more conservative than the PAP rise to power? </p>
              <p>Won't it be harder to pass all those controversial Legislative acts if that happens?</p>

              <p>If the public is already bitching and moaning at you for not representing their interest enough, yet you managed to retain a supermajority, why can't the PAP just make use of their supermajority?</p>

              <p>MY bet is that most will go to PAP,  as the furture for them, therefore, PAP is not superparty, nor is it some super miracle. All these scholars can see and do research for themselves to choose PAP, that is why PAP is so successful, because it can attract young talents and intellectual scholars to carry on and improve it party glory. These peoples can see the furture with them in it. And that is where opposition failed, not because they are not good, but they failed to attract these young talents to help them out. </p>
