The link between the ballot paper number and the electoral register through the counterfoil does facilitate tracing from a ballot paper to a voter's identity on the register. However, ballot papers can be examined only under strict conditions, and there are safeguards that make it extremely difficult to find out how any particular voter voted.</blockquote>Reasons behind the serial numbers:<br><br><blockquote>Counterfeiting of ballot papers and stuffing the lot into the ballot box cannot be completely ruled out. Then, there is "chained balloting", where the perpetrator hands a marked ballot paper to a voter to cast and buys a blank ballot paper from the voter on return from the polling station. He then marks the blank paper for the next voter from whom he can buy another blank vote. Finally, there is also the possibility of persons impersonating voters whom they know will not be voting.</blockquote>The reasoning might be sufficient for some, however I beg to differ. Given the possibility of voterÂ’s identity being revealed, those within the Government sector cannot help but worry about the possible detrimental impact of their decision. The reasoning provided shows plain laziness on the part of the organizing electoral committee.<br><br>If the concern on hand is the counterfeiting of ballot papers, I would suggest that the ballot paper be contained within a sealed foil, only to be opened in full view of the conducting officer. The serial number would be printed on the foil. I agree that these would increase the manpower involved as well as the cost to carry out a single election, but try telling me that it is a bad attempt to ease the psychological concern of the voters regarding the secrecy of their votes.<br><br>But given the reputation of our present government who would stoop to all possible levels to gain the upper-hand for their electoral campaign, I doubt this or other suggestions would be even considered, let alone implemented.<br></div>
