The unsed votes have to be accounted for with their serial numbers. I think there are lots of research on how to prevent ballot stuffing while protecting secrecy on the internet. Maybe someone should compile the options and present it as an alternative and lobby for the change.<br><br>taken from, vote.nist.gov/threats/papers/ChainVoting.pdf<br><br>Ballot Distribution Security:<br>Strictly account for all ballots printed, with the requirement that all ballots not packaged for delivery to the polling place be destroyed. Multiple witnesses must be present at every stage of ballot processing to assure that no ballots escape. When the polls open, election workers must verify that the inventory of ballots delivered matches the manifest for the polling place.<br><br>Absentee Ballots:<br>Mark absentee ballots distinctly to distinguish them from ballots voted at the polling place.<br><br>Prevent Ballot Counterfeiting:<br>Use special inks and papers to deter counterfeiters.<br>Serial Number Ballots:<br>Each ballot should have a unique serial number printed on a tear-off stub. When the voter signs in to vote, this serial number should be recorded. When the voter returns his or her ballot to be deposited in the ballot box, this number should be checked to verify that the voter is voting the same ballot they were issued. If the stub is already torn from the ballot or if the stub number is wrong, the voter should be subject to investigation and possible arrest. To protect voter privacy, the ballot should be contained in a privacy folder that exposes only the ballot stub and serial number, and the stub should be removed before the ballot is slid from the privacy folder into the ballot box. Alternatively, using serial numbered ballots: Note the time of issue of each serial numbered ballot, without noting the identity of the voter to whom that ballot was issued, and use this to enforce time limits on how long a voter may take to vote a ballot.<br><br>other useful links include<br>www.nyvv.org/doc/TearOffBallotStubs.pdf<br><br></div>
