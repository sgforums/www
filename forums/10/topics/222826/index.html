            <div class='col-md body'>They came out with the idea, ministers' reward for performance be pegged to the lowest 20% of Singaporean. This is in line with what government should be in the first place.... from the people, by the people and for the people. How can one gauge ministerial performance adequately then? Comparing to the Swiss ministers, are their performance monetary compensation form from the formulative basis of top end private professionals? Isn't it an honour just to be able to serve? Shouldn't there be Good Government Practice instead?<br><br>That Peg Formula to top private professionals is flawed to me simply because there shouldn't be any need to adjust (and adjust again) at all in any economic conditions.<br><br>How can a country be inclusive if the elected alternative MPs ain't 'allowed' the right to use funds as their constituent rights based on... ? Are we so afraid of competitive spirit? A good sportsman would say that the greatest enemy is himself/herself. If that's the case with the same funds granted to all parties inclusive, may the best people in the interests of Singaporean show the most cost effective use of it. What idea must be exclusive to any one party that cannot be tapped by another if that idea is for the good of Singaporean as a whole?<br><br>It's crap to say the fund offer by the current ruling party is conditional. Are Singaporean rights conditional to whichever the ruling party? Once you form the government, you shouldn't be partying, right?<br><br>What meritocracy are we talking about? What inclusive society are we talking about? What with the NOT to focus on our differences but on our sameness, common destiny about?<br><br>Then again, is CSJ only a 'one dimensional politician' - Freedom or prison? Should political leaders request for donation for their own plight? Are they going to ask the people to provide ammunition in times of battles as well? Leaders should be inspiring and leading not begging, no? Show us how you can lead within existing system and improve upon it when you are granted that priviledge to after you are elected. Don't cast doubts in your children's minds with your noble deeds, for they too have their own rights to live like other children without stigma.<br><br>True, what sound good in words may not be so in practice, but we sure would like to see 'untested' candidates show their individual worth collectively rather using the party machinery to be elected... the M n the H did not win against the C in that light they still lose as they did not stay to fight. And the current duo 'have people's interests and hearts' have to change political tack 'to serve'? To win or to serve, that is the question.<br><br>What I want to see in my MP or candidate leaders, can he/she ride the public transport daily, or weekly or even quarterly, seeing him/her walking around without any fanfare in my neighbourhood (You would notice dried ground near pavement edge being covered with green grasses only when there's visits by VIPs or seeing the pavement flooded during every heavy rain pour) and even eating their meals with their families in my constituency hawker centre. Or even see my MP when I want to see him/her not through assistants (they are not elected in the first place) who are only interested in what types of flat I am staying in. I certainly don't want to see my MP's face on the newspaper which I can tear, or on the TV which I can switch off. That's connecting that got nothing to do with 'quality performance'.<br><br>So does the WP or any good alternative party can ever form the Singapore Government without any ripples? And shouldn't that be the test of the political system of Good Government?<br><br>A little grass' view.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br></div>
