              <p>This sounds weird but people when going for a specific jobs always have hidden fantasies about that perfect job.</p>
              <p>Whether it job satisfaction or pay, we always think of the best but almost end up disappointed, so is this the fault of the employers or the employees?</p>
              <p>Up till now, being disappointed with the jobs I undertaken, make me jobphobia if you can use that term.Being so frustrated I quit looking for any jobs<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/thumbs_up.png" alt="thumbs_up.png">It's like wanting to be a chef but end up as kitchen assistant beck and call....so what you think and see is not what you get make many workers here feel jaded.</p>

              <p><br>what is a company? -&gt; it does Business.</p>
              <p>why does it exist?   -?  it wants to earn Money. to do business.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>many employees are praised often to make them want to and willing to put in more effort than they would.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>its a psychology game.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>a manager is all about playing with psychology.</p>
              <p>he is just an employee but acts like the boss and thats why people call managers a 'boss'.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>they just want to protect their rice bowl. why would they want to motivate you? so that they get all the credits. all your credits go to him.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>to get the most juice out of each sub-ordinate, this manager, an employee, uses management techniques by way of psychology to get what he wants. After all, he does not know how to actually do it. he may know something about the overall picture but he is not the doer. what does he do? errm...find ways to make others work for him.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1 way is to psychologically saiko the subordinate to make them feel important.</p>

              <p>It's very common for company to put up misleading title to attach people to join the company. And sometimes, it depends on luck too. Even if you have great culinary skill, it doesn't mean you will be promoted to be a chef if there are enough chefs in that restaurant.</p>
              <p>Your statement reflect that either you are living in a protected environment with everything going smoothly or like a frog in a well. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>

No matter what industry a person is in, he/she holds the ultimate decison in choosing the job. If we look at our job objectively, the only reason why we join a company is due to personal choice. We cannot blame the company for giving us misleading titles, because we make the decision to join the company ourself.</p></div>
