              don't see the needs in paying service &amp; conservancy charges. $40-$75 a month quite expensive. HDB should reduce the price.

              <p>Sorry... I disagree.</p>

              <p>It takes 2 hand to clap..... Unless you are saying that  over 50% of each Block of flats are now being used to house FW..... then it could hardly explain the amount of litters around.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In some sad way..... <strong>S'porean now no longer take pride of their surrounding</strong>. Just look at the MRT station..... 10yrs ago, you hardly ever see any youngest eating and drinking in the station or trains..... by since the rule have been relax..... look at the suitation now.... <strong>look at how youngest don't even care ppl are staring at them as the eat chips and drink bubble tea</strong>...... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="icon_evil.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is <strong>S'poreans mentality</strong> that is the problem.....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>"Ooh... I pay service &amp; conservancy charges what <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="icon_exclaim.gif"> Ain't it the <span style="color: #ff0000;">responsible of someone</span> to 'clean' after me"</strong> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="icon_question.gif"></p>

              <p>... TRUE again, and I do agree that attitudes of kids these days are the doings of today's career-centered parents (not that they could help it) as well as school's liniency towards disciplining them, sparing much the rod... but I'd like to give locals the benefit of the doubt, as I do believe CWO has done its job in squashing the Litter Bug in many...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>... however, now that Foreigners are in our midst in housing estates, they are reviving the littering habit again as they probably come from lands wherein littering isn't much frowned upon...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>... and I do agree also, that some locals harbours the mentality that since they have paid hard earned money for conservancy, they erroneously &amp; narrow-mindedly presumes that they may litter as they so please, because they have paid for the premises to be cleaned up...</p>
              <p>... but what drives them to do such things &amp; harbour such mentalities, one should ask? Was it that too much was sharged for conservancy? Was it that conservancy along with everything else are annually increased? </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>... hmmmm... I wonder what or which might be the cause...that loses peoples sense of OWNERSHIP and or BELONGING?</p>

              <p>ooh..... and another thing about <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Ownership</span></strong> or <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Belonging</span></strong>......</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You won't just throw stuff around your house and wait for your parents or wife/husband to clean up right..... the reason is not really that you 'Own' the house..... but because the Town Council ain't sending a FW to help you clean. So anything you throw will more or less lay there till <strong>SOMEONE</strong> clean it up.....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>But if the same stuff is thrown at the lift landing</strong>........ <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="icon_idea.gif"> Then it would ''Disappear'' the next day...... if not, I 'complaint' to the Town Council lor.....  </p>

              <p>That my friend..... is <strong>Mentality</strong>, not loss of sense of OWNERSHIP or BELONGING.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A Question -</p>
              <p><strong>Your friends, brothers, sisters house doesn't belong to you.... nor do you have ownership...... but is it correct to litter there</strong> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="icon_question.gif"> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Your upbringing won't have allow you to do so..... so why is it <strong>'Alright'</strong> to litter just because you don't have a sense of OWNERSHIP or BELONGING of the areas around you <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="icon_question.gif"></p>
