              <p><strong>... the writer asked a very pertinent question; are we getting VALUE for the money we are paying? </strong></p>
              <p>... well, I just want to add that this question is also VERY applicable to what kind of value Singaporeans are getting as citizens, from all the Taxes &amp; high costs of living as well as CPF we have to bear with?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>===============================================</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Conservancy charges: Is HDB giving value for money collected?  <br>  <br>Tue, Feb 12, 2008<br>The Straits Times  <br></strong>        <br>  <br> <br>A RESIDENT of a five-room HDB flat pays $73.50 a month in service &amp; conservancy charges and another $90 in parking charge.</p>
              <p>A resident of a similar-size flat in a typical condominium pays about $200 per month. But that includes water, electricity, maintenance, mandatory lift check, cleaning service every day, clean lift, pest control, pleasant landscape, security, security cameras, covered parking lot, swimming pool, tennis court, function room, barbecue pit, recreation events, managing agent fee, some surplus for sinking fund at year-end and so on.</p>
              <p>The HDB resident gets a parking lot and a not exactly clean environment.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> <br>Is the HDB overcharging residents or is it not doing enough to get value for residents?</p>
              <p>My friend lives in a condo, pays $200 a month and get all the things I mentioned, while I pay $163.50 in service &amp; conservancy charges and for a parking lot. I get a dirty lift and floors. Furthermore, the HDB collects parking fines and hourly parking charges and keeps them.</p>
              <p>As a big buyer, the HDB certainly has better bargaining power than the condo. The $163.50 paid to the HDB is excessive.</p>
              <p>The HDB must explain how it spends the money it collects.</p>

              actually, it's true. well i think the conservancy wasn't that high, but the sum's around there. if you have like 2 cars it's actually cheaper or as expensive to stay in a condo.
              
              one thing though, is that person sure inclusive of ultility bills? 0.o

              well the extra cash to buy the condo is one thing, but the fact remains regarding all that extra for another like 40 or 50 dollars. I don't believe the condo is running at a loss so that means that either HDB is over charging or freaking inefficient in this regard.

              <p>I wouldn't rule that out but the money goes into services and conservancy and not the construction of facilities. Besides, it kinda covers improvements made to the estate. For a clearer understanding perhaps Low Thia Khiang and Chiam See Tong can come out to explain also.</p>

              <p>I get what you mean but there are differences and not everybody pays the same rate. Check your local town council website. Out of the blue I'm getting a sports complex/community club at my doorstep, covered linkways to the bus-stop etc, improvement works. I think we can afford to pay for the maintenance of security, swimming pool as well but it wouldn't be feasible for various reasons. Think condo owners and HDB owners are paying for different things but i would suppose the basics would cost quite a bit as well.</p>

              <p>Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that Opposition MPs ought to explain. I'm just saying that they are in the position to  do so in the event some people think that PAP MPs "refuse to be transparent" about it and actually wants to go and ask an MP about it. With or without PAP support, people living in opposition wards still pay services and conservancy charges. So it doesn't matter who you ask.</p>

              <p>Unless you are living in a mega projects, your maintanence fee usually cost &gt;$250 per month. Plus, some condo only entitle you to 1 free parking lot. If you own a second car, you might not be give a lot, or you will have to pay a montly fee on top of what you are paying.</p>

              <p>This part is so very true</p>
              <p>Let's put it in another way:<br>If you got money and you are dissatisfied with HDB's service, why choose to stay in a HDB, increasing the total demand on flats and thus the price, and depriving someone else who wants to stay in a HDB flat in that area?</p>
              <p>A 5-rm HDB costs maybe around $600k, but a condo can be at least twice that amount (the more average ones). In addition, if I'm not wrong, interest rates of HDB loans are lesser than that of bank loans for condos.</p>
              <p>Then again, to be fair, HDB should also make sure that living area should be pleasing to the eye (take a look at fernvale HDB... it's quite new and nice). However, if the HDB has a "not so clean" environment as the author has described, he has the right to complain.</p>
              <p>I would also like to use this post to compare with things happening in Hong Kong. Hong Kong is, along with Singapore, one of the 4 Asian Tigers. Hong Kong has usable land area almost that of Singapore, yet a much higher population than Singapore. Their property prices are also very high, higher than that in Singapore.</p>
