So I want to seek clarification and hold a regular meeting to clear the confusion.<br><br>'People might think that terrorism is not a serious problem. Indeed, terrorism is a very serious problem,' he said.<br><br>Later, the cleric met separately Australian Ambassador to Indonesia David Ritchie and a member of the European Parliament, Mr Hartmut Nassauer.<br><br>What emerged was an agreement between him and the foreign envoys that terrorism was not associated with a particular religion and that the US and Indonesia should continue to work together to fight the threats of terrorism.<br><br>As for his earlier remark, Mr Hasyim said he believed there were terrorist organisations in Indonesia, but he did not know for sure whether JI did exist in Indonesia.<br><br>'In the past 30 years I have been in NU, I have never known of such an organisation, where its office is and who its figures are,' he said in a joint press briefing with Mr Boyce after their meeting.<br><br>'It could be an underground group, but that is still based on intelligence reports. We still don't know the truth,' he said.<br><br>He added: 'I never meant to undermine our efforts to fight terrorism by saying this.'<br><br>While the ambassadors tried to smooth over the differences of opinion, observes said that they appeared to have been disappointed at the way Mr Hasyim contradicted himself and his organisation's stance on terrorism in Indonesia.<br><br>A Western analyst said: 'The US government and its allies have relied on Mr Hasyim as the leader of the largest Muslim organisation to support the campaign against terrorism.<br><br>'He should have known that this kind of statement would send the wrong signal both to Indonesians and the international community.'<br><br>Many believe that Mr Hasyim, like other Indonesian politicians, including Vice-President Hamzah Haz, was merely playing to domestic audience with his latest anti-US statement.<br><br>Analysts and foreign observers said his statement was probably politically motivated, citing the fact that he was considering running for presidency or the vice-presidency.<br><br>Mr Muniem Sirri, a Muslim scholar from the Paramadina Foundation, said: 'By saying that JI did not exist, Mr Hasyim only gives room to the hardliners, making it seem like he is protecting them.'<br></div>

This means that if there is no Umno, PAS and Keadilan will be the basis of national politics to Malay Muslims,' said Datuk Mustafa.<br><br>A fortnight ago, the unflappable politician experienced 25 minutes of provocative and intense questioning by Mr Tim Sebastian, the host of BBC talk show, Hardtalk.<br><br>Datuk Mustafa then declared that the session was not challenging enough.<br><br>In the 1999 general election, PAS won 27 parliamentary seats on the back of deep divisions in the Malay community over the sacking and jailing of former deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim for abuse of power and corruption.<br><br>Umno's representation in Parliament dropped from 94 seats in 1995 to 72.<br><br>Between 1995 and 1999, the ruling party's share of the popular vote declined from 36.5 per cent to 29.5 per cent.<br><br>In 58 parliamentary constituencies in West Malaysia with more than two-thirds Malay voters each, Umno's share of the votes fell from 62 per cent in 1995 to 49 per cent in 1999.<br><br>Since that electoral success, PAS members have been setting their sights on the ultimate prize: ruling Malaysia.<br><br>Over the past four years, party leaders have worked hard on the Muslim ground and tried to get closer to Chinese and Indian voters.<br><br>During the party assembly, Kelantan delegate Hassan Mahmood urged the party leadership to work doubly hard to attract the Chinese vote. 'To attract the Chinese, PAS needs to raise issues about the economy and education and give assurances that their lifestyle will not change,' he said.<br><br>The party is also considering allowing non-Muslims to be associate members.<br><br>But realistically, leaders like Datuk Mustafa know that many non-Muslims will always be suspicious of the Islamic state agenda of PAS.<br><br>He also knows that it will be difficult for a party with limited resources, reach and appeal to win any of the parliamentary constituencies in Sabah and Sarawak, where indigenous non-Muslims still form a significant proportion of the electorate.<br><br>So the best way to come to power is to target the 72 constituencies currently held by Umno.<br><br>Said Datuk Mustafa: 'We win the Umno seats, we become the backbone.'<br><br>That goal will not be possible in the coming elections, he knows.<br><br>But party insiders are counting on demographic changes, continued infighting within Umno and growing religious interest among the Malays to deliver the votes in Malay-majority constituencies.<br><br>They believe that PAS will achieve power through this route one day.<br><br>Datuk Mustafa yesterday signalled the party's intentions to travel along this path.<br><br></div></blockquote>i rather have UMNO ruling Msia den PAS..they r bad news to tis region...especially Singapore...<br>October getting nearer..the date Mahadir leaving the office is getting nearer too...will UMNO survive after he left office?<br>i really cant imagine wat will happen in the coming future if PAS rule Msia...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sorry to have been away, the bomb blast in Munbai affected me alot as I just checked out the previous day to return to Singapore. So no mood to post for a very long time. (near death experience) .. this is the second time it happened. I was actually in USA during September 11 2001, flying from LA to Cincinatti .. so I definately am evaulating my life piorities at the moment.<br><br>Anyway, Malaysian election will be called in December 2003, they need to use the schools for the election venues .. As soon as OIC meeting is over and fasting month done with, the Malaysian parliament will be dissolved and the campaigning begins. The election roster is ready and the posters are waiting in the warehouses.<br><br>The basic UMNO strategy will be essentially to win Sabah, Sarawak and Johor undisputedly to win the election (hence all the goodies to these 3 states) .. then the rest will be Perak, Selangor, NS, Penang and Malacca for the Chinese votes. The government can then afford to allow Pahang and Kedah to fall to PAS.<br><br>That is the worst case scenario painted by certain pundits.</div>
