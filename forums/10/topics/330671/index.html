              <p><span id="intelliTXT">With all the furor about
              foreigners and their place in society, in addition to Singapore's low
              fertility rate, let me present some fresh new ideas for solving these 2
              problems and ensuring Singapore's prosperity into the indefinite future.<br> <br> First, all Singaporean males must be streamed. The smartest 1% will be
              groomed to be the future leaders, although this proportion may
              disappear once all sons of elite Singaporeans are counted. Of the
              remainder, the strongest and healthiest 20% will be forcibly drafted to
              the SAF to protect the interests of elites and FTs. The remaining 80%
              shall be indentured labor, eliminating the need for foreign workers.<br> <br> The same applies to Singaporean females. The best-looking 1% will be
              reserved as the wives for the future leaders, while the rest will be
              free to date and marry talented foreign men. None shall be allowed to
              breed with the inferior Singaporean male stock. Given the dislike for
              local men by Singaporean girls, this will not be too hard to achieve.<br> <br> Finally, foreign talent must be well-treated. Voting rights shall be
              reversed, with elites and foreigners holding the power of the ballot
              while local Singaporeans are denied it. This is to prevent uppity
              locals from disrupting the peaceful lives of FTs and elites. Freedoms
              are also to be similarly regulated, with foreigners having absolute
              freedom of speech and movement and Singaporeans having to have an ERP
              chip implant that monitors their movement via gantries, and immediate
              decapitation for anything said against the government and FTs. Also, it
              shall no longer be a crime to kill a Singaporean, but when a foreigner
              is killed, 9 generations of the family of the Singaporean responsible
              will be shot.<br> <br> <br> <br> I hope my ideas are of use in deciding Singapore's future. We live in a
              constantly changing world, and old ideas such as the superiority of
              Singaporeans over foreigners must be discarded. </span></p>

              <p>IMO, its one of the main reason the lower and lower middle income groups, on average get lower raises that those in the higher income group.</p>
              <p><em>".......inflation running at 6.5% erases the 3.3% wage gains that the poorest
              tenth of the population enjoyed last year, even as the top tenth picked
              up an 11.1% increase in income."</em></p>
              <p>And the Government talks about keeping wages low? We it does seem to be working, for the group that needs the increase more than the higher ups...</p>

              <p>IMO, its one of the main reason the lower and lower middle
              income groups, on average get lower raises that those in the higher
              income group.</p>
              <p><em>".......inflation running at 6.5% erases the 3.3% wage gains
              that the poorest tenth of the population enjoyed last year, even as
              the top tenth picked up an 11.1% increase in income."</em></p>
              <p>And the Government talks about keeping wages low? We it does
              seem to be working, for the group that needs the increase more than
              the higher ups...</p>

              <p>tere is asimple way out of this problem. Introduce  a fixed wage , it doesnt have to be high, it can be reviewed annually, or every 6 months</p>

              <p><br>And this is a typical and common among we young couples, we do discuss among ourselves on how to live in the future..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1. high cost of living</p>
              <p>2. high cost of houses</p>
              <p>3. The need to competite with FTs in lowering our salary expectation</p>
              <p>4. The need to be better than FTs so as to maintain our jobs</p>
              <p>5. The need to paid phone bills, taxes, Gst, and all other bills.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Unlike some uncles older day, O level can liao, no FT or foreigner worker competition, lost cost of living, and lots of opportunity. Today U grad also hv to struggle, if my bf go for master, we still hv to struggle more n more, then come the childrens upbringing, very costly too. Then the bloody govt will lure us to buy car, condo, apartment..insurance etc etc..me commit suicide liao</p>

              <p><span>With all the furor about foreigners and their place in society, in addition to Singapore's low fertility rate, let me present some fresh new ideas for solving these 2 problems and ensuring Singapore's prosperity into the indefinite future.<br><br>First, all Singaporean males must be streamed. The smartest 1% will be groomed to be the future leaders, although this proportion may disappear once all sons of elite Singaporeans are counted. Of the remainder, the strongest and healthiest 20% will be forcibly drafted to the SAF to protect the interests of elites and FTs. The remaining 80% shall be indentured labor, eliminating the need for foreign workers.<br><br>The same applies to Singaporean females. The best-looking 1% will be reserved as the wives for the future leaders, while the rest will be free to date and marry talented foreign men. None shall be allowed to breed with the inferior Singaporean male stock. Given the dislike for local men by Singaporean girls, this will not be too hard to achieve.<br><br>Finally, foreign talent must be well-treated. Voting rights shall be reversed, with elites and foreigners holding the power of the ballot while local Singaporeans are denied it. This is to prevent uppity locals from disrupting the peaceful lives of FTs and elites. Freedoms are also to be similarly regulated, with foreigners having absolute freedom of speech and movement and Singaporeans having to have an ERP chip implant that monitors their movement via gantries, and immediate decapitation for anything said against the government and FTs. Also, it shall no longer be a crime to kill a Singaporean, but when a foreigner is killed, 9 generations of the family of the Singaporean responsible will be shot.<br><br><br><br>I hope my ideas are of use in deciding Singapore's future. We live in a constantly changing world, and old ideas such as the superiority of Singaporeans over foreigners must be discarded.</span></p>
