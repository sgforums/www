              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;">MY FAMILY went to Taiwan recently and visited three of its night markets, including the famous ones at Shilin and Fengjia.</p>
              <p>   The night markets were crowded and many customers bought takeaway food to snack on while walking. But what surprised me was that there wasn't a single dustbin to be found, yet there is no rubbish on the streets.</p>
              <p>   Not knowing where to throw our rubbish, we put it into plastic bags and took it back to our hotel.</p>
              <p>   Our Taiwanese tour guide told us that Taiwan's campaign to get people to take their trash home has been going on for several years. It garnered strong opposition at first, and the officials in charge had to endure a barrage of public criticism. But the government pressed on, and taking rubbish home has now become a habit among the Taiwanese.</p>
              <p>   Singapore is renowned for its clean streets, but it seems other places are catching up with us or have even surpassed us or have been surpassed us - and we are doing anything about it.</p>
              <p>   I am not suggesting that we immediately remove rubbish bins from the streets. Besides, Taiwan's system is not that draconian - if you buy something from street vendors, they will help you discard the rubbish you are holding.</p>
              <p>   But we should recognise one thing: When one generates rubbish, one should be responsible for it.</p>
              <p>   We should not litter - there are stiff penalties for those who do - and it would be good if we took rubbish home for disposal.</p>
              <p>   If we all play our part, we will be the ones enjoying the benefits of a clean Singapore.</p>

              <p>Singapore has already been removing more and more rubbish bin in the public.</p>
              <p>Last time even lamp post at carpark got those small bin...</p>

              <p>Remind me of few year back when NTU or NUS remove rubbish bin... the move was met with a strong negative reaction from the students and people...</p>
