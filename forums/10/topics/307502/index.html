              <p>Hi</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>lowering wages to me is the most commonly used way to be competitive.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>sg costs have risen greatly. salary should not go down to please the employers who earn more and more. Rich are earning more. 10% more.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>salary is basically stagnant to me,  except the news just report 3% rise.</p>
              <p>of course, I must say, I  believe, given our bombasticos are so stedi and honest and never lie wan.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>but Hong Kong is more competitive than sg in the following few aspects that come to mind :</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1. Z E R O  G.S.T.  that means zilch gst to pay.</p>
              <p>2. Z E R O Estate Duty. that means zilch Estate duty.</p>
              <p>3. substantially lower income tax : 5% less.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>can sg be competitive in other ways that do not need to further lower the employees in sg and instead increase income by lowering tax? meaning, salary can remain low but income tax can lower and thus resultant income is able to offset the rising costs. so many, if not everything, has price risen. the meagre pay rise, if any, is difficult to cover the numerous price rises. cost of living certainly appears to continue to go up.</p>
              <p>can sg remain competitive without keep lowering salaries?</p>
              <p>what else can it do to meet the challenges of the new era?</p>
              <p>HK seems doing better.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>

              1. Hong Kong GST
              There was a proposal to implement GST last year, but it had been shelved because of the objection from public.
              
              2. Hong Kong Estate Duty
              There is "Estate Duty" in HK, we call it Rate and Rent in HK. Recently, the rate is waived due to government surplus.
              
              3. Hong Kong Income Tax

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">So in summary the Government have to babysit companies to make they competitive in the Global market? They have to use your tax money to subsidize companies like how the Bumis are doing in Malaysia. The Government have dunno what SME fund etc to help SMEs but to take on the initial burden....Put it this way...it is human to take things for granted.</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Don't complain then if you get axed because you got replaced  by technology then. Sure, we already have FTs to be more productive. Isn't FTs what everyone is bitching about right now? Steamlining production processes = more axes too. Diversity usually requires you taking on more responsibilities. Are you ready for that? If you decide to specialize instead of diversifying, you need the skills and be ready to respond immediately to the fast changing environment. Are you? To enjoy economies of scale you need to build up a customer base and expand your markets which ultimately boils down to more work too, and lots and lots of planning. Are Singaporeans ready to do that, to search for answers instead of waiting for the solution to drop onto their laps?</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Individuals may ...</p>
              <p>become "more" productive? never say die? accept lower salaries? Make Plans? Don't have "me" time? Allow themselves to be scolded? Allow themselves to be worked long hours? "Change" without bitching and crying?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">So you are saying ultimately every single Singaporean should not be responsible for their own lives and not look at themselves and should instead put the blame on the Government not doing more and Companies being slave drivers and only know how to exploit Singaporeans? This is not an elitist attitude. Seriously you will be scared if you see how the Chinese in Shanghai are working and even the Thais (Thank god that their political situation is so fluid)!! </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">How about some self-reflection before pointing fingers to everyone else to solve the problem? Of course there are things the Government can help but they cannot provide the answer to everything, or does the truth hurt? </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Anyway, what is wrong being more productive and having the never say die attitude. What is wrong with planning for yourself and your family? What is wrong with change? What is wrong being told off because you did a silly mistake? The problem is Singaporeans think too highly of themselves. Btw I'm Singaporean and not some FT snatching your rice bowl.</span></p>
