              <p>Many complain about FWs living near us and cramping up our transportion systems and public recreational facillities.</p>
              <p>The reason for the influx of FWs, of about 600,000 of them, was due to the mega IR projects. This project will be completed estimated within 2 years or earlier.</p>
              <p>An estimated 80% of then be sent back to their home country, with the 20% remaining (only 120,000) for HDB and govt infrastructure projects.</p>
              <p>This post is not about IR or the FWs, but more critically - what happens when they leave. Affected ones are:-</p>
              <p>a. Businesses livehood, such as food, beverages and housing.</p>
              <p>b. Project Engineers ( many of them ) on IR.</p>
              <p>c. Skilled workers in the construction industry.</p>
              <p>These are our countrymen/women, and something must be done to help them, otherwise, they may not be as prepared as other industries.As a solution to help these people, my proposals are:-</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">a.Food, beverages, housing and transportation Industries</span></p>
              <p>Businesses in the food, beverages and housing industry better start saving up their monies instead of splurging it away, such as boy toy WRXs for their sons. With monies saved, they can invest in other financial instruments for profit, rather than to later whine to the State( we taxpayers) for relief or handouts.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Project Proffessionals ( Singaporeans )</span></p>
              <p>As the job opportunities will be limited once the IR projects are completed, Project proffessionals must start planning now:-</p>
              <p>1. Find out what if the company is planning for later projects or if they have the financial capital to continue on to overseas IR projects in Asia, such as Philipines, Malaysia Iskandar, or Vietnam.</p>
              <p>2. If not, source out companies that do. Chances are, local companies are only the sub-contractors of major firms, such as Sumitomo. As sub-contractors, they do make huge sums on mega projects, provided good salaries for qualified personnel. Time to smooch and smooth with these companies, with IR experiences obtained.</p>
              <p>3. Keep one's ears to overseas projects. Expertise in our own IR will stand one in good stead. Espacially in Asia, that saw the value of revenue it can generate.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Skilled workers ( Singaporeans )</span></p>
              <p>Skilled workers such as crane operators are known to make $10,000 a month. But it will last only as long till the IR is completed. The next projects are sorely limited.</p>
              <p>My solution is that, if your father, brother, uncle, etc is a crane operator or supervisor in that industry, to learn another asian language in their spare time now, or take classes.</p>
              <p>Their skills obtained in this IR projects are good, but the next mega projects will be overseas, and if they can speak the lingo, they will stand a good chance to join with the company there or apply individually with companies there.</p>
              <p>Our country don't mind if fellow citizens work overseas. We only find it disturbing when one gives up his/her citizenship, and don't return when our country faces a crises where their expertise can lend a hand to jumpstart industries, or as medics to ferry casualties when natural disasters or conflicts breaks out.</p>
              <p>We have no wish ot rely on  foreigners or ex-singaporeans for help, just as NMP Sylvia Lim (WP) had publically told IBA to back off and don't want foreign law society to interfere with our society's affair. </p>
              <p>Just my 2 cents looking into the crystal ball of 2 years time. </p>
