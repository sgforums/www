Our system is different, it's good, it's good for Singapore and it works."<br><br>He says some Singaporeans want a more open, multi-party system.<br><br>Mr Lee says the opposition parties are capitalising on this by asking for their votes, not because of their abilities or policies, but because then, the opposition would exist.<br><br>But he questioned if this would make things better for Singapore.<br><br>Mr Lee says: "What is the opposition's job? It's not to help the PAP do a better job ... because if they help the PAP do a better job, you're going to vote for me again and they're going to be out of a job for a long time. So their job is to make life miserable for me.<br><br>"Right now we have Low Thia Khiang, Chiam See Tong, Steve Chia. We can deal with them. Suppose you had 10, 15, 20 opposition members in Parliament. Instead of spending my time thinking what is the right policy for Singapore, I'm going to spend all my time thinking what's the right way to fix them, to buy my supporters votes, how can I solve this week's problem and forget about next year's challenges?"<br><br>Mr Lee says while any Singaporean can enter politics, the quality needed to get elected must be very high.<br><br>He says this is why the PAP has assembled a strong, national team with a long term view - one that would work together and fight to realise its vision for Singapore.<br><br>At the rally, Mr Lee also named four potential office bearers, whom he will appoint after the elections.<br><br>They are Grace Fu, Lee Yi Shyan, Masagos Zulkifli and Lui Tuck Yew.<br><br>Mr Lee says if they are elected, they will be appointed parliamentary secretaries and ministers of state, adding that some of them have potential to go higher.<br><br>He described them as "big people with broad shoulders" who could deal with big issues and would serve the people well.<br><br>As to whether there would be more office-holders, Mr Lee says only time will tell as he learns more about the new candidates and their abilities.<br><br>Earlier, Mr Lee says he is especially proud of the bicultural candidates - those who are equally comfortable speaking Chinese and English, like former IE Singapore CEO Lee Yi Shyan. - CNA/de<br></div>
