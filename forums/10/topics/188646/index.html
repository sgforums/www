I believe the younger generation of people are no longer interested to be upgraded from one HDB to another HDB. What we need today is to be given more opportunity to progress so that we can upgrade to private and landed property just like what our minister and their family chain is enjoying right now.<br><br></div>

Or rather, is that anything new? What other democracy on this planet empowers a party to make use of taxpayers' money to 'buy' votes(think upgrading which started in '97 to your Progress Package this time around)? And what other electorate on this planet allow themselves to be blackmailed?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>However, if a vast majority - and supposedly well-educated - of the electorate decide to return Fascists to power on their own free will due to such short-sighted enticements(evidently, they haven't been educated enough to learn that their cost of living and countless complains - stemming from all sorts of fee, fare, tax hikes - are intrinsically linked to politics), should we really sympathise with them? If people are convinced one-party rule is the way to go and choose to do their darndest to ensure the present status quo remain, I suppose those hypocrites(ie.clowns who vote for PAP yet whine and moan over the slightest things from fare hikes in public transport to increase in GST) should just shut up and live with the consequences of their action. That's their just dessert anyway.<br><br>I suppose the only victims in the whole process are the ones whose interests are compromised as a result of the action of those hypocrites living in our midst. As Churchill once said, "the inherent virtue of socialism is the equal sharing of misery" - just curse your luck for living in the midst of such a society.<br><br>Hmm..in case anyone needs reminding and decide to vote blindly, maybe they should just take note that there hasn't been an increase in cigarette prices and public transport fares this year - on top of that, the government has even generously dished out some appetizer called 'Progress Package'. Wondering if the status quo will somehow be restored(in layman terms, whether what you get from the Progress Package will be sufficient to cover the increase in fares, taxes and what not over the next 5 years) after the elections...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  Then again, I would hardly be surprised that there'll still be enough muppets out there who genuinely believe Singapore is transforming into the paradise God had intended to compensate for its inherent lack of natural resources that come polling day, the votes will invariably be chanelled in one direction disproportionately...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
