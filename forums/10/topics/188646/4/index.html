Not too sure if I am correct to say that their main GDP contribution is the export of maids. Just wondering if you have dive there before? One can mutter almost anything there without fear of being held accountable for their words, i.e. I can call you, say, a cheat and liar and a womaniser and even a changi village shell station back lane worker. Nice place to dive, huh?</div>
