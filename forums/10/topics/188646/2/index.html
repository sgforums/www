I hope positively for the better.<br><br>1. It is not true those oil companies won't invest because of the way opposition should win an edge here. they think in term of long term investment returns, and getting an edge here, also of money value and strategic concerns plus market conditions: we are a peaceable people : just how we conduct our rallies. Sharply we dismiss all and fulfill all legal requirements.<br><br>2. If the PAP loses big, there will still be in control, and the message is not just the opposition is telling them but we the people of Singapore are not to be sidelined and marginalized.. There would be a strong voice in the parliament for the people. Instead of catering to the wishes of the rulers<br><br>3. We wanted a better place for our children and also ourselves.. Winning by the PAP may only provide a watershed for their total abuse of powers to suppress all voices of the conscience towards good. When they talk about the have-nots among us, do they really care? Then they may do those things like giving to help  but in a committed way like providing essential survival need for the needy all through the year? There are sufficient surpluses in our economy to do it, without having to dig into reserves. The opposition on the other hand, has to really do well or else they will be kick out pretty fast next election! Those national reserves are not an emergency holding, they can be depleted by any garmen should there is a need or call for it.. Serving to the welfare of the people is a very important and integral part of the GovernmentÂ’s duty, any government will fail when the poor go begging!<br></div>
