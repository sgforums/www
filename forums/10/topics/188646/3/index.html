            <div class='col-md body'>You know, people keep talking about needing world class salaries to attract world class people...and having people with a proven track record.<br><br>In light of those concerns, and in keeping with our foreign talent policy, I propose that we invite the Right Honourable Prime Minister Tony Blair to be our prime minister.<br><br><img src="http://www.newspapersoc.org.uk/documents/publications/pr2003/Tony%20Blair%20CMYK.JPG"><br><br>Hold on! I can hear you screaming and howling, "Is he on drugs?!! What a preposterous Idea!" Hear me out. This is an issue of great importance. So just hear me out.<br><br>Tony Blair, throughout the last nine years, has shown himself to be:<br><br>- <strong>A person who believes in the free market.</strong> For instance, once in power, he allowed gordon brown to set the Bank of England free from political control. This means that the BoE can plan for the long term, instead of having to follow the short-term policies of politicians. This has been hailed by many economists as a master-stroke. Of course, this might not work for SIngapore. But that is besides the point. The point is that he has demontrated a free-market ethos. Under him, the UK has boomed, and has continued to boom. This makes him very suitable to lead Singapore.<br><br>- <strong>A person who can balance the demands of Human and Social Rights with the demands of Law and Order.</strong> This can be demonstrated by looking at the legislation and policies he has implemented. In 1998, he Passes the Human Rights Act and the Crime and Disorder Act. One the one hand, he has guaranteed fundamental rights to UK citizens by incorporating the European Convention on Human Rights into UK law. On the other, he has introduced a raft of measures designed to deal with antisocial behaviour and low level offending.<br><br>- <strong>A great orator and greatly respsected by the World</strong>, in particular the United States of America. Thus, having him as our leader can only be a boon to Singapore. If he is our PM, Singapore's international Status will no doubt be elevated.<br><br>- <strong>He is available</strong>. Circumstances have made employing him something within the realms of possibility as opposed to something that is mere fantasy.<br><br>- <strong>Costs can be Cut</strong>. It is a truism that the government has a responsiblity to spend taxpayers' money wisely and prudently. Accoring to the Guardian, in 2002, his annual salary was in the region of Â£200 000. That makes its about S$600000. Say we increase his pay to S$1.5 million. Surely he cannot resist such a pay rise!<br><br>Yes, he has made mistakes. Going to Iraq was undoubtedly a disaster, in terms of international relations. However, I do not thinkit is fair to judge him on one incident. It was a mistake and he had to make a decision. It was, on hindsight, a wrong decision. We should not allow a moment of weakness to detract from his other acheievements. On balance, therefore, I think it is clear that he is the man for us. With him as our PM, Singapore will and can progress economically, socially and politically.<br><br>Think about it.</div>

If people are convinced one-party rule is the way to go and choose to do their darndest to ensure the present status quo remain, I suppose those hypocrites(ie.clowns who vote for PAP yet whine and moan over the slightest things from fare hikes in public transport to increase in GST) should just shut up and live with the consequences of their action. That's their just dessert anyway.<br><br>I suppose the only victims in the whole process are the ones whose interests are compromised as a result of the action of those hypocrites living in our midst.
