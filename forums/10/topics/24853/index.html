They are so glamourized that books, movies(enemy at the gates), toys figurines (you'll never find figurines of a combat engineer of an armoured vehicle mechanic) and even videogames (silentscope, counterstrike, metalgear,...) are create based on their job....of course many are misconceptions.<br><br>Are you a sniper? If your are you won't feel the glamour cos you already are a sniper and your whole platoon's snipers...you won't feel unique.....but to other non-snipers.....you are the main man.<br><br>Of course if you're talking about  training/exercise and even war, then I agree with you. Many Commander tends to forget about snipers.....that's why sniper must be team independent in the field......that's their speciality.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i've used before the Steyr SSG-69 PI ..i find it suitable for asians in the region due to its design. If u compare it with the american Remington M24 SWS, its even much heavier and long for us to use. I agree that 5 rds is way too little for the standard issued magazine...but its like that..u got to make good use of it..snipers have to be part of a infantry platoon or assault group. working alone in pairs sometimes not effective, if enemy firepower is too strong, the snipers will be dead in a matter of time.. (e.g read the story of the two american snipers in black hawk down..u will noe what i mean). Perhaps our army should get a anti-material sniper rifle. ..will be quite using... add in a thermal scope... will can detect body heat behind walls...quite useful for urban areas like s'pore...the best sniper rifle we have .. the AI L96A1... apparently..the commandos sent their snipers for a competition in USA...they came out first ...among the other europe and asian countries...<br><br>oNe shot..one kiLL <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
