Is ASEAN Scholarship really a scholarship?<br>The figures here was at my time. It should be slightly higher now but not too far different.<br><br>The annual "scholarship" is only a mere S$2,300. School fees are FOC for scholars, which actually is very low even if you're not on "scholarship". The S$2,300 is not even enough to cover my daily living expenses - accommodation in a hostel cost me more than S$100 per week. (same price in Presbyterian Hostel and Anglican Hostel in the East Coast)<br><br>---&gt;This is rubbish!!! In uni, per annum is $4600 dollars that is per semester it iis $2300. And even if u stay in single room the most u can spend up to is $1800. U still have 500 dollars left. Dun tell mi this is not enough for personal use?? No one ask u to get a galfren and spend ur money like some rich playboy!!! I even have time to give tuition to earn extra money while studying and dun really need much money from my parents. Who do u think who u are to deserve 10ks worth of scholarship when u merely just did well in spm or stpm.<br><br>5. Higher Standard in Cambridge O-level and A-level?<br>Singapore exams follow the Cambridge O-level and A-level. If you believe that Cambridge O-level and A-level is of higher standard than Malaysian exams, you're in for a surprise. Just look at the results for both O-level and A-level and see the number of A's. It's like sea of A's. In TJC, the number of people who obtained A's for their Mathematics was higher than 80%!<br><br>----&gt;Cmon, I am a johorian myself. Study in spore more than 10 years!!It is true that many ppl score As in math but it is a fact that these student are pretty good. I have cousins and frens taking spm and stpm....their level of difficulty can never match those of Singapore...in fact it is child play. I only cast my eyes on students from foon yew taking UEC....their mathematics papers are hard and very comparable to spore standard. Are u just jealous that so many ppl gets As??? Go take S paper then and score distinction for it lo...<br><br>7. Immaturity<br>One thing that struck me instantly in the Singapore education is the quesionable maturity level of Singapore students. For 17-18 year old students of A-level, I find it very weird that their favorite activity is sitting around in circle and sing. Even when I was younger, we never do that. Our favorite activity could range from football to joining certain activities of some clubs or societies, but never sing like young pampered children. Some friends in Malaysia at that time were already starting their own business. My form 5 class monitor had his own small stall in pasar malam. Now compare that with my A-level classmates,...<br><br>---&gt;True that many Singapore gina are not mature, but dun tink Msian are better. Opening stall in pasar malam wun get u rich! if u tink that is a very mature thought, u can always go back to open one, hopefully it is not one selling pirated CDS!!!! Writing stuff like this makes me doubt ur level of maturity too!!<br><br>10. Unhealthy Competition<br>I was placed in the top class in Temasek Junior College. TJC was the top 3 colleges in Singapore at that time. While certain competition is definitely good, what I've seen happened in TJC will make anyone with some sense speechless.<br><br>----&gt; When is tjc ever top 3?? From ur post i can tell that u re a narcissistic person who tend to exaggerate ur own abilities and not happy that there are many ppl that are of equal wif u.<br><br>In short, What u have said are mainly farce information. If u are so unhappy Asean din extend ur scholarship or wat so ever, den dun even take it in the 1st place!! This show u have not  give deep consideration of what u want to be when u were abt the age of 17 or 18 years old. Hence, in short u do not have what it takes to be an elite!<br></strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If he's really cut out for something, he'd be involving himself in his research, his studies and going out + having fun instead of whining like someone who apparently is having problems with the privileges that he has been given.<br><br>The rest of us live in the real world, and we have our real challenges. If he had to give up his scholarship today, I'd love to see which Kumpulan will take him in.</div>

Though it is globally-recognised, few take the examination, widely seen as very difficult, and those who do are largely non-Bumiputras. Though recognized internationally, most universities, particularly in the UK, consider STPM results equivalent to GCE A-Level results though the latter is generally much easier.''<br><br>quoted from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sijil_Tinggi_Pelajaran_Malaysia<br><br>STPM is quite a controversial exam, i will not elaborate on this, those who<br>are interested to know more can read about it in wikipedia. Although wiki does not mention its source of info for this topic, but based on my own experience as well as my friends, what it is said about STPM  is quite true.<br><br><strong></strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: darkblue;"><strong>I'm not sure whether I want my son and daughter to grow up in such environment. Having spent my time in Singapore for more than 10 years, both as an ASEAN Pre-U scholar, and later studied my degree course and working there, I see more disadvantages than advantages in the ASEAN scholarship.<br><br>It could be the biggest legalised con-job by the Singapore government on unknowing Malaysian talents.<br>Posted by Mark Eleven at 11:41 AM </strong>[/quote][/b]</span><br><br><span style="color: darkred;"><strong>The Kuok Foundation which you mentioned probably belongs to one of M'sia and S E Asia's most wealthy family in our region.<br><br>The Kuok Foundation is so rich($) that if it decides to give you a sum of money much more than it gave you, they could easily do so...no problem at all.<br><br>But the Asean scholarship given out to you belongs to the taxpayers pockets; and I believe every cent given out, has to be accounted for.<br><br>The point here is, it is very unfair for you to be camparing the worth of the scholarships given to you from these 2 different institutions.  You ought to know that Kuok Foundation does not give out scholarships so extentsively as what the Sinkapore gives out for Asean scholarships.<br><br>You impress me as someone who is too overwhelm by the material things in life.  I may as well add that: Money is not everything... By itself money alone cannot make you happy all time.  Your high intellect &amp; excellent academic results do not fit well with your moral character &amp; integrity.<br><br>You feel so bitter that you have been cheated by the Sinkapore garment  through your own personal experience that you even contemplated in not allowing your children to be living in Sinakapore.<br><br>By all means, you are free to quit and I don't think we need a M'sian beneficiary like you who is so ungrateful.  You really give a bad name to other M'sians who are here.<br><br>Maybe you should lodge a complaint to your M'sian Education Minister  and ask his ministry not to accept anymore free scholarships given by Sinkapore.<br><br>Alternatively you should consider paying back the amount of money you received from the Asean scholarship to the Sinkapore garment. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> </strong></span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The problem with blogging is that many 'righteous' bloggers speak from the heart and mix their comments with a c-o-c-ktail of half-truths and emotional tandrums.<br><br>There is absolutely no way to prove whether the blogger is basing his points on genuine real-life experiences. Even if that were true, i find it an almost completely one-sided affair. Given what he has said, his life as an ASEAN scholar is one of misery and hardship, instead of any assumed 'fast-track' towards a better education.<br><br>Having studied with ASEAN scholars, i find most of them savvy, street-smart, and analytical. They are definitely a cut above the rest, but exude none of the arrogance associated with some govt scholars. Many come from humble backgrounds in Brunei and Malaysia, where biased educational standards in their home countries prompt them to seek alternative routes in SG.<br><br>Like the blogger mentioned, most have to rent apartments or hostels, which suck up the bulk of their allowances. Strangely enough, i have never heard anyone of them 'complain' about limited budgets, or face significant difficulty is securing their daily expenses. Many give private tuition to earn extra money.<br><br>Whether such scholars are being 'scammed' is purely down to how large the malcontent among the ASEAN scholar base really is.</div>
