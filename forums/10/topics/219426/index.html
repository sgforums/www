Actually, not only Iran could be pro-Euro, but OPEC did throw that idea around a little too seriously.  </div></blockquote>A conspiracy theory that is not too far fetched.<br><br>Neo Conservatives have been using carrot and stick to convince OPEC members to stick to the Petrodollar regime.<br><br>The carrot; The Iraq war. The US taxpaxers has been funding the US military to mop up oil supply in the international market for strategic reserve to boost crude price, this provides a incentive for OPEC (especially the Saud family of Arabia)  to continue to trade oil in USD. It's also serves to slowdown China's economic growth, due to higher cost for importing crude.<br><br>However, due to the impending US presidential election 2005, the Bush administration did not raise taxes to finance the Iraq war. Instead, the Bush administration cut on social sercurity, healthcare and education budgets to finance the war in Iraq. Even that was insufficient to upkeep the cost on the war on terrorism.<br><br>As a stop gap measure, the US treasury started to issue more bonds to increase the money supply to finance the war. This resulted in the decline of the value of the USD. To arrest the decline of the USD, the Federal reserve started increasing interest rates for USD, in an attempt to salvage the situation.<br><br>The stick; Regime Change by military force. Any oil producing country's government that attempts to breakaway from the petrodollar regime will be toppled. Iraq was allowed to sell oil under the UN oil for food program in the year 2000. Saddam demanded that all his oil should be paid in Euros. This was a calculated move on Saddam's part to upset the petrodollar regime which was to trigger the invasion of Iraq as a friendly reminder to other OPEC states, especially Saudi Arabia not to take that course of action.<br><br>Iran has started an oil bourse that trades oil in Euros in 2006. International news coverage of the "rogue" nuclear in Iran is designed by the Neo Cons as a pretext for embargo of Iranian oil or military regime change of the Iranian government at some point of time should the need arises.<br><br>Americans by voting the Democrats to control both houses of the Congress has upset the Grand Strategy of the Neo Cons.</div>
