I think she's uterly ruthless, heartless and deserves to be condemned.<br><br>PLUS the best part is, she is in UNI and she is not bad looking.  Whatever happened to the father of the baby who doesn't stop her from doing so, either way, she will live with a guilt conscience forever.<br><br>What do you guys think?<br><br>Why do people actually resort to such measures? -desperate, bright future ahead and can't let the kid spoil it?- i guess there are more to this den i have mentioned, so pls tell me.</div>

First i think the problem lies with the bf. He should have the decency to stop the death or at least be responsible over the mess he has created. n next, 9 mths of carrying a life, the parents have no idea what their daughter is doing? Yes, the girl is a major fault. Study so much and yet do things as stupid as this.  If anyone of the girl's friend read this, tell her i think she is stupid, so so so stupid. a disgrace to all who have been through proper education but can't think. And have no responsibility. She should jus *burn*</div>

He must have dumped her else she wouldn't have got rid of the baby.<br>She must be not in the right frame of mind to have done this.<br>Parents must also take responsibility cos they don't even realise their daughter is in this state.

            <div class='col-md body'>For her to go thru all dat physical pains of labour all by herself, can any1 survive dat in a "clear" state of mind? She muz haf went thru hell for the past few months.. all alone, helpless, lost, scared.. &amp; finally desperation led to such tragedy. There had been too many similar reported cases of "dumped babies" b4, so y did she still do it? Is she totally unaware of the consequences or she really thinks dat she can get away scot-free?<br><br>Sure she messed up her own life.. she deserved to b penalised. But when things go wrong, pple start pointing fingers, calling names, its no wonder y she, a role model (under pple's impressions) wans to escape.

            <div class='col-md body'>I think everyone needs to learn how to solve their problems wisely. Just hiding and running away from them will not solve the problem. Running away from her problem is what the girl is doing when she chucked the baby into the rubbish chute...I dunno if she still possess this thing called conscience, if she does, I think it will haunt her for the rest of her life for doing something as cruel as this to her own flesh and blood...<br><br>We can blame a lot of people in this case, but in the end, prevention is still better than cure.<br><br>i.c.y</div>

We are also allowed to have guys in our room, in fact I have had guy friends in my room before until the next morning. The most important thing is not what people around us think, but what we know we do and didn't do. So if one has enuff self-dicipline and control, staying in the same floor with the opposite gender doesn't make anymore difference than staying in a single gender dorm. If there is no self-control present, no matter what rules are enforced, the person will still find a way to break the rule...<br><br>It all lies within ourselves.
