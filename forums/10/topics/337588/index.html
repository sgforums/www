              <p><strong>PAP aims to click with young online</strong> <br> <br> Singaporeans can now go online to watch short videos of People's Action
              Party (PAP) MPs at events on the party's revamped website that was
              launched yesterday.<br> <br> <img src="http://www.asiaone.com/A1MEDIA/digital/11Nov08/others/20081118.091645_pap_website.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br> <br> It is a new way to reach out to young and IT-savvy voters, said party chairman Lim Boon Heng last night.<br> <br> 'New media is facilitating change. Our party is gearing up our
              resources to harness this new platform,' he told 1,500 activists and
              unionists at the PAP's awards ceremony.<br> <br> 'It will change some of the things that we do at our branches.'<br> <br> For instance, at each of the 84 branches, two or three party activists
              will now report on events, and put up slideshows and video footage on
              the party website.<br> <br> 'Since the new media is reaching out to more and more people, not just
              the young but also some of the older ones who have got into IT, the
              party should use it as a medium for reaching out to people,' Mr Lim
              told reporters later.<br> <br> His comments follow recent moves to ease the ban on party political
              videos. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong indicated at this year's
              National Day Rally that he was in favour of relaxing existing rules.<br> <br> A government-appointed advisory council on new media issues is expected to make known its recommendations.<br> <br> Once the new rules are clear, Mr Lim said the party will ensure that
              its branches abide by them. Currently, the videos on its website are
              more like slideshows.<br> <br> Some MPs like Mrs Josephine Teo plan to do more than videos. Her Toa
              Payoh East branch intends to set up an account on social networking
              site Facebook for residents to communicate with her and with one
              another.<br> <br> That is because traditional ways of outreach are not as effective with the young.<br> <br> 'When we go on house visits, the young people are not at home. And they
              don't go to the Meet-the-People sessions and they do not participate in
              community club events,' she said.<br> <br> Even so, Mr Lim reminded party activists not to neglect face-to-face
              contact with people, a practice which has been beneficial to the party.<br> <br> The PAP has won the mandate of the people since 1959, he said, not only
              because of good leadership that has renewed itself but also due to its
              strong network of activists who help out at the weekly Meet-the-People
              sessions and other party functions.<br> <br> He singled out as party stalwarts former MPs Phua Bah Lee and Yeo Toon
              Chia, both of whom won the party's meritorious service medal.<br> <br> Mr Phua, first elected as an MP for Tampines in 1968, was known for
              dealing with the problem of unemployed Singaporeans running pirate
              taxis, and mobilising the public's support for national service.<br> <br> Mr Yeo, the first MP for Ang Mo Kio, set up a network of branches when
              the housing estate was carved up into five constituencies at the 1980
              General Election, and into two more parts in 1984.<br> <br> Mr Lim gave credit to Mr Yeo for mentoring and helping him and other
              new MPs in these constituencies at the time, including PM Lee.<br> <br> He added that both Mr Phua, 76, and Mr Yeo, 67, are still actively serving the party at the branches.<br> <br> The party also gave Bukit Batok branch an award for consistent good
              work. Mr Lim said this is a testimony to the leadership of the ward's
              late MP Ong Chit Chung, who died in July.<br> <br> He also reminded party members of their role in helping Singaporeans cope with this current downturn.<br> <br> 'Our activists need to be more vigilant, so that we can respond to their concerns and needs quickly,' he said.<br> <br> <a href="mailto:chinlian@sph.com.sg">chinlian@sph.com.sg</a><br> <br> This story was first published in The Straits Times on 16 November 2008.</p>
