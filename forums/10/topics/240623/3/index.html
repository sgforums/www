Isn't it a fact that there are discontent people in singapore? hasn't it occured to you that we were referring to the PRESENT, isn't it a fact that the ruling party's popularity has been dropping over the years? Can't you make a connection between the two? Isn't it obivous that when i say 'people',  those people i was talking about are the discontent? also, don't forget that those remarks are made in comparison with the chinese minority in other countries. The chinese minority have small political representation in whichever country they are in, because of the fact that they are a minority. So they can't complain, they can only suck it up and live their lives the best way they can.<br><br>Anyway, hasn't it always been the gov's way, when people ask for changes, gov always come back and say, no if you want this or that you have to work harder, blah blah, and then people say, no, gov have to change first in order for us to have this or that..blah..blah..see what i mean about gov pointing finger at people, and people pointing finger at gov?

The statement that i made was a NEUTRAL one, you understand what NEUTRAL means right?<br>So, if you want to judge LKY and his policies, go ahead, be my guest, but it's got nothing to do with me, ok? because i only made a neutral statement.<br><br><blockquote>This is not about anti-LKY.

You accuse me of being insulting to the chinese singaporean. c'mon, if it was really true, i would have been fiercely attacked by other forumers and even the forumer that i was having a discussion with, didn't seem to think that i was insulting the chinese singaporean. So why only you seem to think that? <span style="color: red;">I think you've got a real corrupt mind, that's why you always seem to take the negative view of what people are trying to say. </span></div>

If you were to go to a client using the very same report that we were discussing, and you made such comments like that, you would be scolded and humiliated by the client.  That's the real world for you. If you don't understand how to read statistics report, that's ok, if you don't want to admit it, fine, nobody is forcing you to admit anything. You talk about 'objectivity' as though you understand the report very well, c'mon lah, earlier, you made a mistake about reading the report, you acted as though the report was giving contradicting information, but when you read it again after i point out your mistake, now you say  ''we are at liberty to use the info to fit or support whatever report or views in any manner we need''...you are dead wrong about that, there are many different types of reports used for different purposes  or different objectives. Clearly, you don't understand what the objective of this report is..if you make such naive statements. I have told you a few times already what the purpose of the report is...and you pooh pooh the whole notion and call it 'window dressing'. like that i can also say the same thing with your theories as well..they are just 'window dressing'  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

Nielsen's report that - "In South-East Asia, the picture differs, with Singapore the only market where the modern trade dominates."<br><br>Is it not a fact that the majority of supermarkets in Singapore is dominated by Government Linked - (not owned) - NTUC Fairprice ?<br><br>NTUC FairPrice Co-Operative is a supermarket chain based in Singapore and the largest in the country. The company is a co-operative of the National Trades Union Congress or NTUC. The group has 100 supermarkets across the island, with over 50 outlets of Cheers convenience in the island. NTUC FairPrice has partnered with ExxonMobil to run several stations with a FairPrice branding at the minimarts at their stations. The supermarket has a slogan known as Singapore's very own.<br><br>Do you need a more brilliant light to see that being the largest Supermarket store in Singapore, it is obvious that it will have the largest share of the market and revenue ? </blockquote>I got confused by your statement:<br><br><blockquote>Yes, there is no denial that modern supermarkets and hypermarkets are making their entry into Malaysia, Indonesia and even Vietnam - as reported in your A.C. Nielsen report.<br><br>However, the traditional neigborhood grocery stores continue to thrive in the sub-urban and rural areas - and away from the MAJOR URBAN CENTRES where the hypermarket and supermarkets will have the needed larger captive populations centers to form its base. </blockquote>Here, i thought you were talking about the situation in singapore.<br><br><blockquote>Then again, at the end of it all - after one earlier diversion, with another one here - where is the direction of your post in relation to this thread ?<br><br>If this does not prove that the Singapore Government's involvement in business - especially in the new hypermarkets and supermarkets concepts - have not already killed private enterprise in the neighborhood provision shops and grocery stores ? </blockquote>Well, it's partly your fault, because you didn't indicate which country/countries you were talking in the second paragraph.<br><br>Again, you misunderstand what i say, of course when you compare NTUC chain of supermarkets and convenience stores, with individual supermarket chains like cold storage, then NTUC is the largest, that's true. But what i'm saying is that you have to compare ALL THE OTHER SUPERMARKET CHAINS AND  WITH THOSE WHICH BELONG TO NTUC. Otherwise, how are going to show that NTUC dominate the grocery modern trade in singapore in terms of no of stores? Let's look at the figures, NTUC has got slightly more than a 100 supermarkets and cold storage has got about 80 supermarkets. So this shows, that the two chains dominate the market or it's called a virtual duopoly.<br><br>Ok, i should have told you earlier, when we are talking about the share of modern trade, we are referring to the sales in modern trade. So this means that even if there are many stores in a certain area, but it doesn't mean that the share of sales will be proportionate to the no of stores in that area. Let me give you an example.<br><br>Area 1 = 10 stores, share of sales = 30% of total sales at national level<br>Area 2 = 6 stores, share of sales = 50% of total sales at national level<br><br>this means that even though area 1 has got more stores than area 2, a larger share of sales still goes to area 2. It doesn't necessarily mean that just because you have more stores than another supermarket chain, that you should have more sales. And to proof that, we need to look at the data. So this means that you have to show the share data of NTUC and compare that with cold storage data and with the total combined share data of the other supermarkets.  <span style="color: red;">Ultimately, share of sales is more important than no of stores. </span></div>

One will say that Malaysia should end up paying a higher price for the building even if the land price is lower.<br><br>Yet, Malaysia is able to offset the high import costs paid with a weak ringgit, and still maintain a more competitive retail price to benefit its consumers, who are also protected by a very active Consumer Price Inspectors.<br><br>Comparing to Singapore, despite the fact that we have a stronger currency than Malaysia - by two times over - our cost of construction is higher than Malaysia, even when there are more Malaysian construction workers than Singaporeans.<br><br>Yes, I can believe your statement that "if singapore had land like their larger neighbours, sing gov might have a more diversified approach instead of just concentrating in the services industry."<br><br>The Singapore Government will hoard the land, and auction the land to the highest bidder over its desired price, which will make the final product costs to be atrocious, while increasing revenue to itself.<br><br>The obvious is being stated, as you seem not to be able to grasp some basic concepts. </blockquote>First of all, what is your definition of 'more competitive retail price'? And how do you compare this situation between msia and singapore? It may seem to you that the ringgit is weaker, therefore msia should end up paying a higher price for the building even if the land price is lower. Do you have any evidence that msia imports the amount of cement, steel bars, and most building materials that should make the prices of buildings more expensive? Again, this is your theory...but you show no proof. You cannot ignore the supply chain process and just focus on the strength of the sing dollar. At every step of the supply chain process, someone gets a 'cut' and this drives up the cost of the product. These so called active 'Consumer Price Inspectors', do you know how they operate? do you think they are able to cover the whole of msia? Why is it during chinese new year every yr, the chinese get slaughtered with 2 or 3 times more than what they usually pay for food? Again, those are just your theories, in theory, consumers are suppose to get protection, but in reality, it doesn't always happen. what i'm explaining to you are the realities of the market, the supply chain is a reality, so you can't ignore that it exists.<br><br>About the cost of construction in sinagpore, you also have to consider the higher cost of living in singapore compared to msia, that's why a construction worker in singapore gets paid more than in msia.<br><br>About the <strong>'NTUC Fairprice towards Singaporean Union Workers, its prices are not exactly 'FAIR'. </strong>, you have to compare their prices with other supermarkets in singapore in order to get a fair comparison. It doesn't make sense to compare that with the same items in msia and say that the prices in singapore are unfair. Like that i can also say, the price of mineral water in UK is much higher, so the prices in UK are unfair  or i can also say, the price of mineral water in indonesia is much cheaper, msia prices are unfair.<br></div>

The supply chain process is longer than that, each time it passes through someone hands, that person makes a profit from it. It's not a simple 'percentage' of costs like what you just said. Anyway, you only talk about msian costs, what about singapore's cost e.g. retailer, distribution, so forth?

            <div class='col-md body'>I fail to see how the UK can be used as any relevant example to our situation.<br><br>In LKY's own book, he portrayed that that the old situation as unreliable and what not, that it would guarantee good bus services and that it was inefficient to have too many bus services. That itself was sufficient justification for the Govt to buy over all the companies under one umbrella group.<br><br>However, now that I think about it, why did the Govt really need to have everything under one roof? That all the companies were making losses and in the red did not really mean that there would be no bus services whatsoever eventually, and typical with the PAP, he used that  alarmist reason to justify the Govt's takeover.<br><br>If one were to follow standard trends in economics, eventually there would be consolidation, and some apologists would have said that the PAP did them a favour. However, on hindsight, why did the PAP Govt do for? What gain did it get? Other than gaining a stranglehold on an essential service and thus the ability to manipulate the market wholesale? Certainly that is in line with the Govt's preference for control. It controls almost about anything that is an essential service to Singaporeans.<br><br>Ultimately, there was no real reason for it, and none of the companies had even collapsed or were even on the verge. If one uses Occam's Razor, the only simplest reason is political. Economically, the Govt could simply force all the companies into giving essential transport routes and maintaining certain standards of service which would mean very little Govt involvement ultimately.<br><br>It is certainly telling that when many private transport operators stepped up to say they don't mind servicing the public, the Govt slapped them with unreasonable restrictions which meant that it was neither competitive nor economically feasible for them to join. Obviously the Govt knew that and if they didn't, I wonder why we are even paying them this much taxes for the job they are doing.</div>

Otherwise, how are going to show that NTUC dominate the grocery modern trade in singapore in terms of no of stores? Let's look at the figures, NTUC has got slightly more than a 100 supermarkets and cold storage has got about 80 supermarkets. So this shows, that the two chains dominate the market or it's called a virtual duopoly.<br><br>Ok, i should have told you earlier, when we are talking about the share of modern trade, we are referring to the sales in modern trade. So this means that even if there are many stores in a certain area, but it doesn't mean that the share of sales will be proportionate to the no of stores in that area. Let me give you an example.<br><br>Area 1 = 10 stores, share of sales = 30% of total sales at national level<br>Area 2 = 6 stores, share of sales = 50% of total sales at national level<br><br>this means that even though area 1 has got more stores than area 2, a larger share of sales still goes to area 2. It doesn't necessarily mean that just because you have more stores than another supermarket chain, that you should have more sales. And to proof that, we need to look at the data. So this means that you have to show the share data of NTUC and compare that with cold storage data and with the total combined share data of the other supermarkets.  <span style="color: red;">Ultimately, share of sales is more important than no of stores. </span></strong><span style="color: darkred;">Here you go again, trying very hard to twist out of a tight spot that you got yourself with a brain that is no better than your mouth, and with more explanations and corrections.<br><br>Did you not make your demand quite clearly - as stated in my post of 9 March 2007 04.23AM ?<br><br>For your benefit of not confusing yourself, you did simply state -</span><br><blockquote><strong><span style="color: blue;"><span style="font-style: italic;">"Let me get this straight, so you are saying that the traditional stores continue to thrive in sub-urban and rural areas because the gov's hypermarket and supermarkets dominate the major urban centres?

And the pricing which is associated with brands, the same with bottled water lah.... </strong>[/quote]<br><span style="color: darkred;">Did I write about imported water, or was the comparison about water produced and bottled in Malaysia - labelled as <span style="font-style: italic;">'Product of Malaysia'</span> ?<br><br>You sure are desparate to score points that you are not even aware of the date of this discussion.<br><br>Keep grasping straws from thin air and you may just be drunk on water alone, without the need to sniff on saffron ? </span><br><blockquote><span style="color: darkred;">Why are you complicating a simple subject of eggs by spreading across several continents away ?<br><br>Why pick UK, and not Australia, or China, or Korea ?<br><br>Grade A eggs in Malaysia are sold at a controlled RETAIL price of 20 to 35 sen, which is about 0.15 cents - Malaysian retail price in Singapore currency.<br><br>If at this price, the Malaysian distribution chain will hive off 30 percent to cover their costs, this will make their wholesale price to be somewhere 0.245 sen or 0.12 cents.<br><br>Singapore's NTUC should be able to knock off another 10 per cent with its ability to pay cash and taking a bigger load for its more then 100 outlets.<br><br>With a stronger currency and ability to buy in bulk, and with shorter or less complex distribution tiers, we are paying much more then the Malaysians.</span><br></blockquote></div><div class="quote_body">I already talked about the supply chain process, the example you give here, is a very straightforward example in theory, but it does not apply in the real world. The supply chain process is longer than that, each time it passes through someone hands, that person makes a profit from it. It's not a simple 'percentage' of costs like what you just said. Anyway, you only talk about msian costs, what about singapore's cost e.g. retailer, distribution, so forth? And when we talk about the price, you also have to look at market factors as well, such as price perception, demand..and others. To go into business is not easy, there's a lot of things to consider. </div></blockquote><span style="color: darkred;">Your talk is about simple economic supply chain in your usual effort to impress but without addressing the core of the issue that are being debated.<br><br>Have you lost track of the entire thread - and this ongoing debate that started with you insulting the Singaporean Chinese for the inability to have any survival instinct, and dependent on government pacifiers ?<br><br>You made a digression with you A.C. Nielsen report to justify the fact that it was natural for hypermarkets and supermarkets to exist, even as I had indicated that the Government's involvement in the economy was to subjugate the Singaporean citizens to an economy of dependence on the Government.<br><br>And now you are digressing further with your useless shallow and superficial understanding of the mere supply chain structures ? Have you not considered the economics of the entire industry that is not merely restricted to the supply chain structures but involving the other sectors of the economy as well ?<br><br>For NTUC Fairprice to generate the kind of profit that it has reported on a year-on-year basis, NTUC Fairprice will have to and must shorten the supply chain line to the source, as well as to involve itself in the other aspects of the economy that has a handle on its cost of operations.<br><br>With the simplistic views, backtracking, remodelling, and flip-flopping of your positions and statements - what else can you offer to worm your way out of your insulting statements towards Singaporean Chinese.<br><br>Your insulting statement could have been acceptable towards Singaporeans in general - if you have simply stated :- <span style="font-style: italic;">"people point at gov, gov point at people, in the end that is the history of all singaporean residents"</span>.<br><br>Is it so difficult simply to admit that is was a silly remark made by you - when your hand wrote faster than your brain, which resulted in the statement being made with such authority ?<br><br>At least, we could have forgiven your brain for not being able to control the speed of your hand movements.<br></span><br>[quote]<strong><br>I HOPE I GET YOUR ATTENTION HERE, I HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT I'LL BE GOING OVERSEAS FOR WHILE, NOT SURE FOR HOW LONG SO I WON'T BE ABLE TO REPLY YOU ANYTIME SOON.
