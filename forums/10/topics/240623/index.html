            <div class='col-md body'>Because of the environment. First its too small for both private and government linked bodies to compete. The environment here is just not condusive for small businesses to take root and flower. Second because of the regulation and control here. Before we create anything we will ask for permission (regulation) first. Somehow I don't see an entrepreneur doing that. Here is a good place to work but not to start business. Third is the costs. There are cheaper places to start business. Here it might not pay cos rental is so high, your effort goes into paying for overhead costs before you can earn a profit.</div>

Also there's no guarantee of success on the first round, and its not easy to get the capital to start again.<br><br>Singapore is a place for those with deep pockets....<br><br>All the students today are loaded with so much workload that they entangled in the paper chase.

            <div class='col-md body'>Waah.. today got a feature on retail start up..but the rental to be as low as $1000 must be some ulu spot with small shop size.. the world is driven by efficient markets... if the traffic is good the landlord raise rental...<br><br>My friend leases a small shop in Queensway shopping Centre selling jeans rental $3000.. work enough only to cover rental and its tough work considering that she has to do all the packing labeling herself.<br><br>If its was Taiwan it would have been easier to sell in the streets or find a night market that has good traffic at lower rental.<br><br>I am quite unhappy with how Singpost overcharges the local business<br><br>For example Jap to Sin on EMS 900g<br>it would only cost 1660 yen or 21SGD<br><br>http://www.post.japanpost.jp/english/fee/intel/ems.html<br><br>but from Sin to Jap for a 900g on EMS it would cost 45.8SGD<br><br>http://www.singpost.com/quick_services/quicks_02postage_cal.asp<br><br>thats a whopping 100%++ more expensive... but i heard they are planning to liberalize  the market... hopefully the prices fall like the telcos<br><br></div>

When you look at the chinese minority in other countries, even those in developed countries like Canada, UK, US, Australia, either seem to do well in business or at the very least, make ends meet, call it survival instinct.

Is it the gov that kill off chinese entrepreneurship in singapore or is it the chinese singaporean who can't stop sucking the gov pacifier after all these years? Who is to blame?

            <div class='col-md body'>If you look at Singapore's economic environment, you will see that the majority is government controlled/linked, and in expanding their empire, starting from their home base, the smaller guys simply do not have the economies of scale to compete. Case in point, NTUC. Of course the people also frequent NTUC because they percieve NTUC to be cheaper, being government linked. So it is a vicious circle.<br><br>Singapore govt is pragmatic because the majority is chinese. Chinese are pragmatic and that's why they are successful the world over.<br><br>Sometimes it is not that we are afraid to fail, but because the people here are not receptive to failure. Fail once and you may never get to try again.<br><br>Now look at a guy who gets retrenched. What does he do? He drives a taxi. Life here is such that while you may never be rich, you will not starve. And in that I would say the government has done a good job in providing stability and jobs for everybody. Unless you are so unlucky as to not be able to drive, no money to learn and nobody to offer you a job. Which could happen.<br><br>Regarding the workfare supplement, why is it that you need to work before you are entitled to it? What if you really could not find a job?<br><br>Coming back to Singapore capitalist economy, you will see that it is become quite boring with the same brands being replicated in the shopping centres. Go to town, go to Ang Mo Kio, you will see the same brands again and again.<br><br>I am not an economist. I cannot back my claims with figures. But my instincts are strong. And they tell me, Singapore is not a good place to start a business. I might think differently in Hong Kong, for example. Especially if my uncle, my cousin, my sister are in successful businesses themselves. Even in Shanghai you can see the hope and daring of the people, and feel the vibe,  the bustle of the marketplace there. I have no solution. The market here is really very small. And if everyone around you have stable jobs in companies, why should you be any different? People are smart. If it pays to start businesses, they would have done so already. Why struggle for something uncertain and unprofitable if you are already comfortable.<br><br>Question is, when foreign investments move to cheaper places, what will come of people who have been trained to be worker ants do?<br><br></div>

with the CHINESE being the main racial group that provided the thrust that made Singapore a success for the British Colonial Rulers.<br><br>The British Colonial Rulers had given authority to the local community leaders to run the affairs of their respective communities, while the Colonial Government took care of the Internal and External Securities.<br><br>What happened to this entrepreneurial characteristics of the various communities in Singapore - especially that of the Chinese majority since LKY and his political party came into power from the late 1950s ?<br><br>Was there not a systematic dismantling of the economic power that were in the hands of the Chinese scions in Singapore, who posed a political threat with their private wealth, and the economic power that they wield over events in Singapore ?<br><br>During the early days of politics in Singapore, the various competing political parties had the moral and FINANCIAL support from the various businesses and individual personalities.<br><br>The well known scions with their large family wealth and private industry were able to own many aspects of Singapore businesses that kept Singapore humming - owning banks, newspapers, broadcasting media, printing houses, and many of the main infrastructural services.<br><br>These private businesses in private hands were at times influenced by partisan politics, contributing to the development of a vibrant political environment during the early days of the post-colonial period.<br><br>Can the LKY personality - that we know - tolerate such an environment ?<br><br>One example of the move to neutralise the political strength of private wealth can be seen in the manner in which the LKY government dealt with the Singapore public bus system - in which the strong hand of government killed a long established lucrative business operated by private capital and initiative.<br><br>Many reasons were given for the dismantling of the <a href="http://www.smrtbuses.com.sg/transport/bus/HISTORY.HTM" rel="nofollow">ten public bus companies</a> that were in the hands of Chinese entrepreneurs that operated during the Colonial days to the early 1970s, when the ten bus companies were dismantled and consolidated into three regional companies, and then finally regrouped into one national Singapore Bus Services.<br><br>By the late 1970s, Singapore Bus Services was restructured through a name change into Delgro Corporation, with heavy NTUC participation and investment of funds generated and collected from a large pool of "forced" union memberships of the Singapore work force.<br><br>Not too long after, the Scheme B system was introduced to allow Private Buses to complement SBS, but with heavy restriction on its routing and operating hours that made it untenable for long.<br><br>Within five years, government linked City Shuttle Service was formed, followed by Trans Island Bus Services.<br><br>By 2004, the bus transport system was restructured and merged with the operations of the MRT system - to form SMRT and Singapore Shuttle Bus.<br><br>The heavy hand of Government involvement stretched across the entire spectrum of the economy, in which political appointees to various government linked companies are given the extra perk to cut through red-tapes, allowing  them to operate with less restrictive rules when compared to private ventures.<br><br>From its PRIMARY function of representing workers' welfare, the National Trade Union Congress has used its position - and using its financial strength through workers' contribution - to muscle out private enterprise in unfair competition backed by government help.<br><br>Neighborhood stores that served the various communities simply faded from their traditional roles, and despite the supposed economies of scale with operations provided by NTUC Fairprice - are the prices anything but fair ?<br><br>The two preceding examples reveal the government  policies of the Ruling Party aka the Government in creating a <a href="http://www.politicos.co.uk/books/69235.htm?ginPtrCode=10410&amp;identifier=" rel="nofollow">'Political Economy of Social Control'</a>.<br><br>For over 45 years, the Ruling Party has made 95 per cent of the population live in Government built housing by simply increasing the cost of land for private development - that will naturally force private housing to be much higher than public housing.<br><br>Ingeniously, having forced private housing to be higher in price, HDB then moved public housing prices closer to a "shoulder distance" in pricing to that of private housing.<br><br>Unfortunately, the 95 per cent of Singaporeans do not actually own the HDB building that are leased for 99 years only; and unlike freehold properties purchased, the funds used on 99 year property will simply evaporate at the end of the 99nth year.<br><br>Much like the value of a car worth zero - at the end of the ten year COE.<br><br>With a one party dominated parliament, a slew of legislations were easily passed to allow the government to dominate the economic and political landscape; and in the process rounding up Singaporeans like cattles into the absurdly demarcated politcal-electoral corals.<br><br>With a negative attitude towards Social Welfare - what pacifier from this government are you referring to ?<br><br>If at all, Singaporeans have been offered a goreng pisang that certaily will not help us with our present political-economic constipation. </span><br><br></div>

Being a majority in singapore, the people have been given 'goodies' over the years and these 'goodies' are the pacifiers, designed to keep the people content and quiet.

I'm not surprised that the sing gov took over the private transport companies, after all, it is a public service and the gov aimed to make it uniformed, efficient and accessible to people from all walks of life.<br>In countries like UK, where the gov had privatised some of their train lines, it turned out to be a disaster and the gov had to buy back these lines, and in the process, lost huge amounts of money. The public transport system is not a very good example of the gov getting their 'greedy' hands on the local economy, i don't think. Another forumer mentioned about AMK NTUC hypermarket, i think that's a better example. There are some areas in economy where i think that the gov should allow the  local businesses to thrive.<br><br><blockquote>From its PRIMARY function of representing workers' welfare, the National Trade Union Congress has used its position - and using its financial strength through workers' contribution - to muscle out private enterprise in unfair competition backed by government help.<br><br>Neighborhood stores that served the various communities simply faded from their traditional roles, and despite the supposed economies of scale with operations provided by NTUC Fairprice - are the prices anything but fair ?</blockquote>Ya, i agree with this, as mentioned earlier. Just diverting a little, if we compare what's happening the retail sector in msia, you will find that it is not that different from what's happening in sing. According to a well known market research company, the current trend is that more consumers are going to large retail outlets, e.g. hypermarkets, departmental stores and less people are going to the small grocery shops. In msia, these hypermarkets and departmental stores are not GLCs. I think the sing gov should allow local businesses to thrive in the large retail outlet sector. With that in mind, getting into the large retail outlet business is a very expensive affair and small time businessmen cannot afford to get into it. The realities of the markets in both msia, sing and other asian countries is that consumers are moving towards the large retail outlets, so small time businesses are slowly being squeezed out (when i say small time businesses, i mean grocery stores and the like).<br><br></div>
