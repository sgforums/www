Just diverting a little, if we compare what's happening the retail sector in msia, you will find that it is not that different from what's happening in sing. According to a well known market research company, the current trend is that more consumers are going to large retail outlets, e.g. hypermarkets, departmental stores and less people are going to the small grocery shops. In msia, these hypermarkets and departmental stores are not GLCs. I think the sing gov should allow local businesses to thrive in the large retail outlet sector. With that in mind, getting into the large retail outlet business is a very expensive affair and small time businessmen cannot afford to get into it. The realities of the markets in both msia, sing and other 7asian countries is that consumers are moving towards the large retail outlets, so small time businesses are slowly being squeezed out (when i say small time businesses, i mean grocery stores and the like).<br></strong></blockquote><span style="color: darkred;">In Malaysia, the hypermarkets are located in major concentrations of population, serving the market on a regional basis.<br><br>However, the Malaysian land mass prevent the hypermarkets from extinguishing the usefulness of the neighborhood stores - those small grocery shops in the housing estates of Malaysia.<br><br>The Malaysian market is different from Singapore - as they are two distinct  physical characteristics, and the impact of the hypermarkets onto the neighborhood stores will be different in Malaysia and Singapore.<br><br>Whichever the market place - whether in Malaysia or Singapore - have these hypermarkets ever passed off their savings to the consumers, or have they incurred higher costs in their massive operations ?<br><br>In view of the small land area in Singapore, the close proximity of small neighborhood stores will provide competition to the nearest Hypermarts, making it necessary for the small neighborhood stores to be snuffed out.<br></span><br></div>

I can't comment on that because history has already been written and singapore is the way it is today largely because of LKY. I'm not a historian, economist, or a political science expert, so it wouldn't be fair for me to comment.  In my opening statement, i don't know how you can say that i belittle the pioneers; I was referring to LKY's time and the present, not before that.<br><br><blockquote>The ten bus companies had provided efficient public service since the Colonial Days - why did LKY and his Government decide that these bus companies to be inefficient when they took control of the seat of political power ?<br><br>Was it not a fact that the ten bus companies became inefficient only due to the Government refusal to allow bus fares to increase, so as to allow these companies to cover costs to improve their services ?<br><br>Is this not a familiar tune that is so easily acceded to - when the same is asked by the present bus companies owned by Government Agencies and managed by Government appointees ? </blockquote>Those days, LKY had his 'grand' plans for the future, so taking over the public transport system is not a surprise. Whether any other leader would have done the same thing, one can only guess, maybe they wouldn't have done it as drastically as how LKY did. But change is inevitable, it was bound to happen sooner or later because singapore is a small domestic economy and for the gov to take over the public transport system, is not a very difficult thing to do.<br><br><blockquote>Was it not a fact that when LKY first entered politics, he was not well accepted by the Chinese community - especially the local Chinese business and clan associations ?<br><br>The reason was that LKY was an English educated Chinese, graduating from Cambridge, and could not read nor write a word of Chinese, besides not being able to speak any Chinese dialect.<br><br>During the early development of local politics of the 1950s, those Chinese businessmen, associations and clans had given their support to the various political parties - and in order to penetrate the majority Chinese community, LKY had to join forces with the Chinese educated - (those whom he later branded as Communists). </blockquote>Yup, politics is a dirty game, it was then and it still is now, rather obvious, don't you think?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div>

It was a mistake to begin with, yes, the gov shouldn't have privatised the train lines and the private companies which took over wasn't capable of running the lines. So at the end of the day, it was the public who suffered; my point is that certain things such as the public transport system should be handled by the gov.</div>

Please refer to the Ac nielsen report.<br><br><strong>''Competition for the grocery dollar continues in Asia Pacific with hypermarkets and convenience stores mushrooming'' </strong> - 5 October 2006, Ac Nielsen<br><br><a href="http://my.acnielsen.com/site/20061005.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://my.acnielsen.com/site/20061005.shtml</a><br><br>According to the AC nielsen report, the growth of the share of the modern trade also includes small format stores such as modern convenience stores and personal care stores and/or pharmacies. The results are based on FMCG categories tracked by AC nielsen.<br><br>Here are the definitions:<br><br>Modern trade channels: Large format and small format stores<br>Large format stores: Hypermarkets, supermarkets (chain as well as independent)<br>small format stores: convenience stores, personal care stores and/or pharmacies<br><br>Extracts from the report:<br><br><strong>''Concentrated supermarket-dominant markets<br><br>In Hong Kong, Singapore and the Pacific, the modern grocery trade accounts for more than 90 percent of packaged grocery sales and the markets are dominated by a limited number of chains. Supermarkets are the most frequently used channel by the vast majority of shoppers, typically visited twice a week or more.<br><br>Meanwhile convenience stores are well established in these markets, where 50 to 60 percent of shoppers use them regularly on average, once a week, and less frequently than the use of Supermarkets. In Hong Kong however, with the much higher frequency of shopping, over eight in 10 shoppers are using convenience stores, on average, three times a week.<br><br>Hypermarkets are either non-existent in these markets or very limited. In Singapore, where there are now nine Hypermarkets used by a quarter of shoppers, only four percent use them as their main grocery store.<br><br>Hypermarket-dominant markets<br><br>Among the three markets in the hypermarket-dominant category, Taiwan is significantly more developed than both Malaysia and Thailand, with 90 percent of grocery sales going through the modern trade nationally compared to less than 50 percent in the other two countries. Hypermarkets are the main store format for more than 50 percent of shoppers in Taiwan, Malaysia and Thailand, and the majority of households use them on a regular basis, typically two to three times a month.''</strong><br><br>If you read the report thoroughly, you will find that singapore is along side countries like HK and Taiwan in terms of share of the modern trade, which accounts for more than 80% and is still growing. In singapore, supermarkets are the most frequented and hypermarkets the least. Whereas in msia, hypermarkets are the most frequented among the modern trade channels. All the asian countries in the report have experienced growth in the share of the modern trade except for Philippines.<br><br>Your theory about <strong>''the Malaysian land mass prevent the hypermarkets from extinguishing the usefulness of the neighborhood stores - those small grocery shops in the housing estates of Malaysia.'' </strong>is not exactly true when you look at the results from the report. There are many factors as to why msian consumers choose to frequent hypermarkets instead of the traditional stores, and land mass may not be a very good reason. We have to look at consumer behaviour studies in order to understand the current trends in msia, singapore and other countries as well; the above report only shows the  trend but it doesn't explain the reasons for it.<br><br>Your theory about <strong>''the close proximity of small neighborhood stores in singapore will provide competition to the nearest Hypermarts, making it necessary for the small neighborhood stores to be snuffed out.''</strong>, again it is not really true because according to the report, only 4% of consumers use hypermarkets as their main grocery store (although 25% of consumers use hypermarkets). However, it doesn't mean, that the small neighbourhood stores are not being snuffed out; the share of traditional stores are decreasing and one of the reasons could be because of competition with supermarkets. This is my analysis following the results from the report.<br><br>Your question on <strong>''Whichever the market place - whether in Malaysia or Singapore - have these hypermarkets ever passed off their savings to the consumers, or have they incurred higher costs in their massive operations ?''</strong><br>I will answer that if i can find another report whereby i can use the results to give a proper explanation. i will leave it for now.<br></div>

The full account of the disastrous effects of the two World Wars on British society has yet to be told, but of one thing I am clear; they gave a tremendous boost to statist trends in the UK. In 1914 de facto nationalisation of the railways was enacted for the duration of the war with direct government control not ended until 1921. In the meantime, indirect control was ensured by a Ministry of Transport, created for the first time in 1919. In 1939 the beginning of World War Two saw the railways taken over once more by the government, and this time there was to be no reprieve. On the 1st January 1948, the railways were nationalised. For almost 50 years there followed a steady decline. British Rail become a byword for inefficiency with the British Rail sandwich a national joke. And there was the clear and ever present danger which attends any state monopoly. A national strike would at any moment bring the whole network grinding to a halt.<br><br>In 1994 the wheel turned full circle and the rail system was returned to private ownership by the then Conservative government. This was both bad and good news. <span style="color: red;">The bad was that the government chose an unusual and complex method of organising the railways</span>. The system was fragmented into 25 train operators and a single monopoly track provider. Most railways around the world have the trains and track owned by the same company, and indeed this was the system in the UK prior to nationalisation. Amongst other problems, <span style="color: red;">the present set-up has meant that the railways seem to have more regulators and politicians meddling than in any other UK privatised industry</span>.<br><br>The good news is that the new train operators have introduced a 1,000 extra services per day compared with the last year before privatisation. Last year, passenger numbers were up by 30 per cent and freight movement by 33 per cent. Railtrack is under pressure from train operators to improve repairs and speed up train schedules, but <span style="color: red;">here the structure imposed by privatisation is a hindrance</span>. Railtrack feels that it has not felt the full benefit of the increase in passengers and freight and consequently has not acted with the required alacrity.<br><br>The Hatfield accident and aftermath must be seen against the backdrop of a heavily regulated privatised industry gingerly finding its feet. Broken rails are relatively common and there are evidently two of them somewhere in the country each week. But they have only caused 6 fatalities in the last 30 years (including Hatfield). The speed restrictions were a massive overkill, the reaction of an industry under political pressure. It seems clear that if the rail network had been returned to the position it had prior to nationalisation, there would not have been the divorce between track and train operators and economic incentives would have made the national rail go-slow less likely.<br></span></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by saffron60:<br>My point earlier was that the current trend is that more consumers are frequenting large retail outlets, actually what i meant was the large format stores in the modern trade. Please refer to the Ac nielsen report.<br><br><strong>''Competition for the grocery dollar continues in Asia Pacific with hypermarkets and convenience stores mushrooming'' </strong> - 5 October 2006, Ac Nielsen<br><br><a href="http://my.acnielsen.com/site/20061005.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://my.acnielsen.com/site/20061005.shtml</a><br><br>According to the AC nielsen report, the growth of the share of the modern trade also includes small format stores such as modern convenience stores and personal care stores and/or pharmacies. The results are based on FMCG categories tracked by AC nielsen.<br><br>Here are the definitions:<br><br>Modern trade channels: Large format and small format stores<br>Large format stores: Hypermarkets, supermarkets (chain as well as independent)<br>small format stores: convenience stores, personal care stores and/or pharmacies<br><br>Extracts from the report:<br><br><strong>''Concentrated supermarket-dominant markets<br><br>In Hong Kong, Singapore and the Pacific, the modern grocery trade accounts for more than 90 percent of packaged grocery sales and the markets are dominated by a limited number of chains. Supermarkets are the most frequently used channel by the vast majority of shoppers, typically visited twice a week or more.<br><br>Meanwhile convenience stores are well established in these markets, where 50 to 60 percent of shoppers use them regularly on average, once a week, and less frequently than the use of Supermarkets. In Hong Kong however, with the much higher frequency of shopping, over eight in 10 shoppers are using convenience stores, on average, three times a week.<br><br>Hypermarkets are either non-existent in these markets or very limited. In Singapore, where there are now nine Hypermarkets used by a quarter of shoppers, only four percent use them as their main grocery store.<br><br>Hypermarket-dominant markets<br><br>Among the three markets in the hypermarket-dominant category, Taiwan is significantly more developed than both Malaysia and Thailand, with 90 percent of grocery sales going through the modern trade nationally compared to less than 50 percent in the other two countries. Hypermarkets are the main store format for more than 50 percent of shoppers in Taiwan, Malaysia and Thailand, and the majority of households use them on a regular basis, typically two to three times a month.''</strong><br><br>If you read the report thoroughly, you will find that singapore is along side countries like HK and Taiwan in terms of share of the modern trade, which accounts for more than 80% and is still growing. In singapore, supermarkets are the most frequented and hypermarkets the least. Whereas in msia, hypermarkets are the most frequented among the modern trade channels. All the asian countries in the report have experienced growth in the share of the modern trade except for Philippines.<br><br>Your theory about <strong>''the Malaysian land mass prevent the hypermarkets from extinguishing the usefulness of the neighborhood stores - those small grocery shops in the housing estates of Malaysia.'' </strong>is not exactly true when you look at the results from the report. There are many factors as to why msian consumers choose to frequent hypermarkets instead of the traditional stores, and land mass may not be a very good reason. We have to look at consumer behaviour studies in order to understand the current trends in msia, singapore and other countries as well; the above report only shows the  trend but it doesn't explain the reasons for it.<br><br>Your theory about <strong>''the close proximity of small neighborhood stores in singapore will provide competition to the nearest Hypermarts, making it necessary for the small neighborhood stores to be snuffed out.''</strong>, again it is not really true because according to the report, only 4% of consumers use hypermarkets as their main grocery store (although 25% of consumers use hypermarkets). However, it doesn't mean, that the small neighbourhood stores are not being snuffed out; the share of traditional stores are decreasing and one of the reasons could be because of competition with supermarkets. This is my analysis following the results from the report. [/b]</blockquote><span style="color: darkred;">From your A.C.

My earlier comments were based on the experience of people who lived through it and i know these people personally. You should take your own advice, since the report that you posted only showed HALF THE STORY of what actually happened.<br><br><strong>''Railtrack was a group of companies that owned the track, signalling, tunnels, bridges, level crossings and all but a handful of the stations of the British railway system from its formation in April 1994 until 2002. On October 3, 2002, the main operating arm - the owner and operator of the national railway network, Railtrack PLC - was sold by its parent company Railtrack Group plc to "not for dividend" company Network Rail (a company limited by guarantee) and was later renamed Network Rail Infrastructure Ltd. With that sale, the national railway network passed into the hands of a company without a share capital or shareholders, and in all essential senses the short, troubled and controversial life of Railtrack came to an end.''<br><br>''To bring Railtrack's administration to an end, the Government assisted in the formation of Network Rail, which bought Railtrack PLC from RT Group. Network Rail is a company without shareholders, and the Government insists that it is a private sector company, accountable to the public interest through regulation by the Office of Rail Regulation.''</strong><br><br>quoted from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Railtrack" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Railtrack</a><br><br>What happened in the end was that the gov took back the Railtrack's administration. However, there has been debate about whether Network Rail is a public sector or private private sector entity, but ultimately, it is under gov control.<br><br><strong>''There has been considerable controversy over whether Network Rail is a public-sector or a private-sector entity. Government ministers and former ministers appear to try to look both ways on this issue. On the one hand, they need Network Rail to be classified in the private sector to avoid the company's enormous debts (over Â£20 billion) being counted as public expenditure liabilities. On the other hand, they like the idea that the shareholders have gone and the public perception is one of renationalisation - "renationalisation in all but name" is a common media description of what happened to Railtrack when Network Rail took it over.''</strong><br><br>quoted from: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Rail" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Rail</a><br><br><strong>''Railtrack had been severely criticised for both its performance in improving the railway infrastructure and for its safety record.''</strong> You can read the full article of the events in wikipedia.<br><br>Here are some 'highlights' of the railway privatisation, quoted from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privatisation_of_British_Rail" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privatisation_of_British_Rail</a><br><br><strong>''Investment: It is a common view that the railways had been systematically starved of government investment since the 1960s as successive governments openly favoured road transport, and that when the railways were privatised they were already in bad shape and in need of renewal.''<br><br>''Since privatisation there has been considerable expenditure on modernising the system, but largely confined to a few routes. The consequences of the Hatfield accident in 2000 caused Railtrack to undertake large-scale track relaying without sufficient planning, and much of the work was substandard and subsequently had to be re-done. Railtrack's poor project management abilities were exemplified with the West Coast Route Modernisation project, which was intended to deliver a 140 mph (225 kmh) route in 2005 at a cost of Â£2 bn, but is finally likely to deliver a 125 mph (200 kmh) route in 2008 at a cost approaching Â£13 bn, which was a major factor in the company's financial collapse.''<br><br>''Profitability and Efficiency: One of the principal expectations from privatisation was that the railway service could be delivered more efficiently in the private sector because of the profit motive. The expectation that there were considerable costs that could be slashed from the system was not fulfilled; new operators found that BR had already done much of what could be done to improve efficiency. In addition, the profit motive was diluted when some of the passenger franchises ran into financial trouble and entered into management contracts with the franchising authority, which reduced the incentive to innovate. In addition, new health and safety requirements and the complexity of the privatised structure has thrown up additional costs in the industry. In all, the subsidy to the railway from the Government is considerably larger now than it was for BR.''<br><br>''Safety: This is one of the more emotive sources of argument. The railway can point to continued improvements in safety under privatisation; in fact the rate of improvement has increased compared to that experienced in the last years of BR. However, five serious rail accidents in the post-privatisation period (Southall (1997), Ladbroke Grove (1999), Hatfield (2000) Potters Bar (2002) and [Cumbria Rail Disaster [Tebay]] (2007)) all undermined confidence in the safety of the privatised railway and highlighted some areas where it appeared that new safety risks had been created as a result of the privatisation process (e.g. the separation of wheel from track).''</strong><br><br>When you read the list of effects, you will find that overall, there are more negative effects than positive ones,  (please take note that the article is based on arguments between the positive and negative effects of railway privatisation).<br><br></div>

And the report later explains in the detail about the shares in modern trade, so there's no contradiction in the figures, if that's what you are implying. i doubt that you are an expert in statistics, so you wouldn't know the methodologies used, so if you want to discredit this report, then you have to come up with proof of 'errors' of the methodologies in areas such as data collection, data sampling, data analysis and so forth.<br><br>Don't understand your question on <strong>''Is there objectivity to the different requirements from the reports ?''</strong>, what do you mean by different requirements?<br><br><blockquote>Yes, there is no denial that modern supermarkets and hypermarkets are making their entry into Malaysia, Indonesia and even Vietnam - as reported in your A.C. Nielsen report.<br><br>However, the traditional neigborhood grocery stores continue to thrive in the sub-urban and rural areas - and away from the MAJOR URBAN CENTRES where the hypermarket and supermarkets will have the needed larger captive populations centers to form its base.<br><br>Then again, at the end of it all - after one earlier diversion, with another one here - where is the direction of your post in relation to this thread ?<br><br>If this does not prove that the Singapore Government's involvement in business - especially in the new hypermarkets and supermarkets concepts - have not already killed private enterprise in the neighborhood provision shops and grocery stores ? </blockquote>Let me get this straight, so you are saying that the traditional stores continue to thrive in sub-urban and rural areas because the gov's hypermarket and supermarkets dominate the major urban centres? Bear in mind, the report only states the results of the current trend and it does not explain the reasons for it. But since you are creative in coming up with the reasons for that, then you would have to proof that:<br><br>1) the majority of supermarkets in singapore are gov owned, because the report stated that singapore is a supermarket dominated market<br>2) the majority of share of sales go to the gov owned supermarkets,<br>3) if you have figures for the gov owned convenience stores, even better<br><br>All you have now is just talk about NTUC but you don't have any figures to prove your point.<br><br>At first i said that i was diverting a little from the topic about NTUC, (because i was talking about the market trends) but i think i ultimately it is relevant to our discussions on the topic. I also said that there are some areas in economy where i think that the gov should allow the local businesses to thrive, but i didn't say that the gov is killing off private entrepreneurship. I also want to clarify that after i said ''Ya, i agree with this, as mentioned earlier'', i was referring to my statement about how gov should allow local businesses to thrive, not that i think that the gov is killing off private entrepreneurship. They may provide competition for other retailers but whether or not they kill private entrepreneurship in the grocery business, that has yet to be proven.<br><br>The report is relevant because earlier we were talking about NTUC hypermarket. So this report, shows the trend of consumer grocery spending in singapore as well as other asian countries. Well, you kept saying the gov killed private entrepreneurship because they went into the hypermarket and supermarket business, <span style="color: red;">so the report shows proof that there's a shift in consumer grocery spending which is a trend in most asian countries, which means that the consumers themselves change their way of grocery spending (although there may be many external factors which influence their decision) </span>. So, the behaviour of consumers in singapore are partially responsible for the shift in spending and it can't be said that it is entirely because of government intervention. You have to also take into account the behaviour of singaporean consumers and that some of the factors that influence their decision are not related to gov intervention or gov owned supermarkets and hypermarkets.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>To atobe</strong><br><br><blockquote>Why bother with any report ?<br><br>Just visit the nearest local NTUC stores and check out a few items, which they are supposed to have purchase in bulk to achieve economies of scale, backed up by our strong Singapore Dollars - what is the price of the goods sold in Singapore compared to the same products sold in their home country ?<br><br>Mineral water in 1.5 litre bottles from Malaysia retails at SGD 1.20, while the same is sold for 80 sens - (0.40 cents); grade A eggs from Malaysia retails at NTUC at 0.20 cents each, while the same is retailed at 0.20 sens in Malaysia - and the list continues.<br><br>Did we not hear from the Singapore's Government that we should have an economic philosphy of Singapore concentrating on our expertise in Services and Industry - leaving our larger neighbors to concentrate on Primary and Agriculture Industries ?<br><br>Was it not through this economic specialisation in comparative advantage - and with a stronger Singapore Dollar - that we were supposed to benefit from a lower cost for our essentials ? </blockquote>I guess if you are not in the business field, you wouldn't put much emphasis in reading business reports. The economies of scale applies to large chain hypermarket/supermarkets and chain convenience stores, whether it is a privately or gov owned. The mineral water you are talking about, is it the same brand? It would be more fair to use examples from the same brand.<br><br>Wow, 1.5 lit mineral water for 80 cents? That's very cheap, i have never come acrossed that even though i've been to msia many times. I think you may be talking about the price of the 1.5 lit mineral water which is sold at hypermarkets and that would most likely be the hypermarket's house brand. It's an unfair comparison to compare prices with hypermart's house brand (because their line of products are always cheaper than most brands in the same categories).<br><br>About the eggs comparison, SG$1 = RM2.30. What's there to compare? A msian who goes to singapore and buys eggs, pays double for it, not the same price he/she would pay when she is in msia. I don't think that comparison helps your argument much. If you are saying that NTUC are charging higher than normal prices for their products, then you have to compare their prices with other retailers in singapore and give those examples instead.<br><br>Let's use the 'imported egg' example in an economic context.<br><br>The cost of selling imported eggs in a singaporean retailer = opportunity costs + cost of production + transport costs + distribution costs + tax (import, GST) + miscellanous retailer costs<br><br>When you are only focusing on the exchange rate and the 'strength of the sing dollar', then you are leaving out all the other factors which influence  the price of eggs when it is sold in a singapore retailer. Another factor to consider is the higher cost of living in singapore compared with msia.<br><br>Let's compare the price of the egg in a retailer in the UK, it would be about Â£1 for a dozen eggs, which is about SG$0.30 per egg and RM0.60 per egg. so overall, it costs more to buy an egg in the UK, bear in mind, i'm not talking about imported eggs in the UK, i'm referring to the locally produced eggs. So, it shows that there are 'hidden' costs in involved in selling products. Some may be gov influenced,some market influenced, you have to distinguish between how much gov intervention is there in the market and the supply chain process in order to draw a connection between the prices of products sold in a retailer and gov intervention.<br><br>if singapore had land like their larger neighbours, sing gov might have a more diversified approach instead of just concentrating in the services industry. Why are you mentioning such obvious things?<br><br></div>

My earlier comments were based on the experience of people who lived through it and i know these people personally. You should take your own advice, since the report that you posted only showed HALF THE STORY of what actually happened.<br><br><strong>''Railtrack was a group of companies that owned the track, signalling, tunnels, bridges, level crossings and all but a handful of the stations of the British railway system from its formation in April 1994 until 2002. On October 3, 2002, the main operating arm - the owner and operator of the national railway network, Railtrack PLC - was sold by its parent company Railtrack Group plc to "not for dividend" company Network Rail (a company limited by guarantee) and was later renamed Network Rail Infrastructure Ltd. With that sale, the national railway network passed into the hands of a company without a share capital or shareholders, and in all essential senses the short, troubled and controversial life of Railtrack came to an end.''<br><br>''To bring Railtrack's administration to an end, the Government assisted in the formation of Network Rail, which bought Railtrack PLC from RT Group. Network Rail is a company without shareholders, and the Government insists that it is a private sector company, accountable to the public interest through regulation by the Office of Rail Regulation.''</strong><br><br>quoted from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Railtrack" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Railtrack</a><br><br>What happened in the end was that the gov took back the Railtrack's administration. However, there has been debate about whether Network Rail is a public sector or private private sector entity, but ultimately, it is under gov control.<br><br><strong>''There has been considerable controversy over whether Network Rail is a public-sector or a private-sector entity. Government ministers and former ministers appear to try to look both ways on this issue. On the one hand, they need Network Rail to be classified in the private sector to avoid the company's enormous debts (over Â£20 billion) being counted as public expenditure liabilities. On the other hand, they like the idea that the shareholders have gone and the public perception is one of renationalisation - "renationalisation in all but name" is a common media description of what happened to Railtrack when Network Rail took it over.''</strong><br><br>quoted from: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Rail" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Rail</a><br><br><strong>''Railtrack had been severely criticised for both its performance in improving the railway infrastructure and for its safety record.''</strong> You can read the full article of the events in wikipedia.<br><br>Here are some 'highlights' of the railway privatisation, quoted from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privatisation_of_British_Rail" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privatisation_of_British_Rail</a><br><br><strong>''Investment: It is a common view that the railways had been systematically starved of government investment since the 1960s as successive governments openly favoured road transport, and that when the railways were privatised they were already in bad shape and in need of renewal.''<br><br>''Since privatisation there has been considerable expenditure on modernising the system, but largely confined to a few routes. The consequences of the Hatfield accident in 2000 caused Railtrack to undertake large-scale track relaying without sufficient planning, and much of the work was substandard and subsequently had to be re-done. Railtrack's poor project management abilities were exemplified with the West Coast Route Modernisation project, which was intended to deliver a 140 mph (225 kmh) route in 2005 at a cost of Â£2 bn, but is finally likely to deliver a 125 mph (200 kmh) route in 2008 at a cost approaching Â£13 bn, which was a major factor in the company's financial collapse.''<br><br>''Profitability and Efficiency: One of the principal expectations from privatisation was that the railway service could be delivered more efficiently in the private sector because of the profit motive. The expectation that there were considerable costs that could be slashed from the system was not fulfilled; new operators found that BR had already done much of what could be done to improve efficiency. In addition, the profit motive was diluted when some of the passenger franchises ran into financial trouble and entered into management contracts with the franchising authority, which reduced the incentive to innovate. In addition, new health and safety requirements and the complexity of the privatised structure has thrown up additional costs in the industry. In all, the subsidy to the railway from the Government is considerably larger now than it was for BR.''<br><br>''Safety: This is one of the more emotive sources of argument. The railway can point to continued improvements in safety under privatisation; in fact the rate of improvement has increased compared to that experienced in the last years of BR. However, five serious rail accidents in the post-privatisation period (Southall (1997), Ladbroke Grove (1999), Hatfield (2000) Potters Bar (2002) and [Cumbria Rail Disaster [Tebay]] (2007)) all undermined confidence in the safety of the privatised railway and highlighted some areas where it appeared that new safety risks had been created as a result of the privatisation process (e.g. the separation of wheel from track).''</strong><br><br>When you read the list of effects, you will find that overall, there are more negative effects than positive ones,  (please take note that the article is based on arguments between the positive and negative effects of railway privatisation). </blockquote><span style="color: darkred;">If you are trying to impress by making useless extracts simply to create a huge envelope of fog that serves to confuse the entire picture, and extract yourself out of an untenable position - you found the wrong angle.<br><br>All that you have written above still does not back up your initial statement that Privatisation of the Railroad in UK cannot compare to the greater efficiency through nationalisation - in having the Government manage the Public Transportation system.<br><br>Your extracts above only clearly show the failure of the successive UK government - up till Thatcher and through John Majors leadership - in mishandling the privatisation of the UK Railroad system.<br><br>It is a poor example to support your position taken, and I have already indicated to you that prior to LKY's coming into politics, there already exist ten PRIVATELY OWNED Bus Companies that had provided efficient transport service to the Singapore Public.<br><br>On one front, we have the LKY Government refusing to allow the Private Companies to increase fares unless they show their ability to improve their transport assets. On the other side, the Private Bus Operators will not invest unless the Government agree to their terms of fare structure so as to be able to recoup their investment.<br><br>The failure of the Singapore Private Bus Companies was due to the Government's own political-economic-socialist plans, with the other big picture in mind to starve the Other Political Parties from receiving political support and political funding.<br></span><br><br></div>

Compared to North Asia, only 43 percent of sales in South-East Asia go through modern self-service grocery shops, although the shift towards the modern channels continues in nearly all countries. The most significant modern trade growth during 2005 has come from Malaysia, Indonesia and Vietnam. (Chart 4)''</strong><br><br>If you look at chart 3 and chart 4, you will know that the share of the modern trade in these countries are grouped together by regions, north asia, SE asia and south asia respectively. So what is wrong with comparing singapore's share which is relatively the same as HK and taiwan's share? All these countries have more than 80% share, compared to the countries in SE asia (except singapore), the share is between 17% to 48%.<br><br>So, what are you trying to imply? That the stats can be read differently because of that? But it's still correct right? And the report later explains in the detail about the shares in modern trade, so there's no contradiction in the figures, if that's what you are implying. i doubt that you are an expert in statistics, so you wouldn't know the methodologies used, so if you want to discredit this report, then you have to come up with proof of 'errors' of the methodologies in areas such as data collection, data sampling, data analysis and so forth.<br><br>Don't understand your question on <strong>''Is there objectivity to the different requirements from the reports ?''</strong>, what do you mean by different requirements? [/quote]<br><span style="color: darkred;">Where is the direction of your line of thinking ?<br><br>If you are trying to impress, you fail miserably.<br><br>All the charts that you can bring up does not hide the fact that in Singapore, the government has created a political-economy that makes one of the most entrepreneurial race become unentrepreneurial.<br><br>Concerning "objectivity" : surely you will know that whatever report - with data or charts - that  A.C.Nielsen produces, we are at liberty to use the information to fit or support whatever report or views in any manner we need.

Bear in mind, the report only states the results of the current trend and it does not explain the reasons for it. But since you are creative in coming up with the reasons for that, then you would have to proof that:<br><br>1) the majority of supermarkets in singapore are gov owned, because the report stated that singapore is a supermarket dominated market<br>2) the majority of share of sales go to the gov owned supermarkets,<br>3) if you have figures for the gov owned convenience stores, even better<br><br>All you have now is just talk about NTUC but you don't have any figures to prove your point. </strong></div></blockquote><strong><span style="color: darkred;">Now the 'brilliance in reading' that you accuse others of not having is reflected in your own anxiety to score points.<br><br>Are you changing my posted words to as - <strong><span style="font-style: italic;">the gov's hypermarket and supermarket</span></strong>, or did I state in very simple words that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">hypermarket and supermarket</span> in Malaysia are located in large urban population centers ?<br><br>It was clearly stated in your A.C.

I also want to clarify that after i said ''Ya, i agree with this, as mentioned earlier'', i was referring to my statement about how gov should allow local businesses to thrive, not that i think that the gov is killing off private entrepreneurship.

So, the behaviour of consumers in singapore are partially responsible for the shift in spending and it can't be said that it is entirely because of government intervention.

            <div class='col-md body'><br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by saffron60:<strong><br>I guess if you are not in the business field, you wouldn't put much emphasis in reading business reports. The economies of scale applies to large chain hypermarket/supermarkets and chain convenience stores, whether it is a privately or gov owned. The mineral water you are talking about, is it the same brand? It would be more fair to use examples from the same brand.<br><br>Wow, 1.5 lit mineral water for 80 cents? That's very cheap, i have never come acrossed that even though i've been to msia many times. I think you may be talking about the price of the 1.5 lit mineral water which is sold at hypermarkets and that would most likely be the hypermarket's house brand. It's an unfair comparison to compare prices with hypermart's house brand (because their line of products are always cheaper than most brands in the same categories).<br><br>About the eggs comparison, SG$1 = RM2.30. What's there to compare? A msian who goes to singapore and buys eggs, pays double for it, not the same price he/she would pay when she is in msia. I don't think that comparison helps your argument much. If you are saying that NTUC are charging higher than normal prices for their products, then you have to compare their prices with other retailers in singapore and give those examples instead.<br><br>Let's use the 'imported egg' example in an economic context.<br><br>The cost of selling imported eggs in a singaporean retailer = opportunity costs + cost of production + transport costs + distribution costs + tax (import, GST) + miscellanous retailer costs<br><br>When you are only focusing on the exchange rate and the 'strength of the sing dollar', then you are leaving out all the other factors which influence  the price of eggs when it is sold in a singapore retailer. Another factor to consider is the higher cost of living in singapore compared with msia.<br><br>Let's compare the price of the egg in a retailer in the UK, it would be about Â£1 for a dozen eggs, which is about SG$0.30 per egg and RM0.60 per egg. so overall, it costs more to buy an egg in the UK, bear in mind, i'm not talking about imported eggs in the UK, i'm referring to the locally produced eggs. So, it shows that there are 'hidden' costs in involved in selling products. Some may be gov influenced,some market influenced, you have to distinguish between how much gov intervention is there in the market and the supply chain process in order to draw a connection between the prices of products sold in a retailer and gov intervention.<br><br>if singapore had land like their larger neighbours, sing gov might have a more diversified approach instead of just concentrating in the services industry. Why are you mentioning such obvious things?<br></strong></blockquote><span style="color: darkred;">What makes you think that I am not in business ?<br><br>You have shown an immense talent at immersing yourself into looking at the small prints and miss out the bigger plot from the entire book.<br><br>For crying out loud, post as many 'cut-and-paste' - digress as much as you want - and make your best effort to fog up the entire thread - the fact will still remains simple - that despite the declared intention of NTUC Fairprice towards Singaporean Union Workers, its prices are not exactly 'FAIR'.<br><br>Yes, you are right with your claim that Singapore's land cost is high, however, who has set the land prices so high that businesses are passing off their cost to the consumers, while continuously raking in their profit.<br><br>Malaysia may have a huge piece of real estate, however, they have a weaker ringgit, and depend as much on the importing of cement, steel bars, and most building materials. One will say that Malaysia should end up paying a higher price for the building even if the land price is lower.<br><br>Yet, Malaysia is able to offset the high import costs paid with a weak ringgit, and still maintain a more competitive retail price to benefit its consumers, who are also protected by a very active Consumer Price Inspectors.<br><br>Comparing to Singapore, despite the fact that we have a stronger currency than Malaysia - by two times over - our cost of construction is higher than Malaysia, even when there are more Malaysian construction workers than Singaporeans.<br><br>Yes, I can believe your statement that</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">"if singapore had land like their larger neighbours, sing gov might have a more diversified approach instead of just concentrating in the services industry." </span><br><br><span style="color: darkred;">The Singapore Government will hoard the land, and auction the land to the highest bidder over its desired price, which will make the final product costs to be atrocious, while increasing revenue to itself.<br><br>The obvious is being stated, as you seem not to be able to grasp some basic concepts.<br><br>With a stronger dollar, and following the economic philosphy of comparative advantage, we were supposed to be able to buy cheaper primary and agricultural products for our daily essentials; yet the produce sold in the Singapore hypermarkets or supermarkets - are all much higher than those found in Malaysia.<br><br>Are you some connosieur of water, with your taste honed from a taste of fine wine ?<br><br>Bottled water consist of only mineral and distilled water - whatever the brands sold in Malaysia, the difference is only 10 or 20 sens.<br><br>The bottled mineral and distilled water sold in Malaysia, may not carry the same label as NTUC Fairprice will have their own house brands; while other Singaporean supplier may prefer to have their own OEM brand, and still retain the label indicating "Produced in Malaysia".<br><br>Why are you complicating a simple subject of eggs by spreading across several continents away ?<br><br>Why pick UK, and not Australia, or <a href="http://www.fas.usda.gov/gainfiles/200602/146176724.doc" rel="nofollow">China</a>, or <a href="http://www.fas.usda.gov/gainfiles/200609/146208829.doc" rel="nofollow">Korea</a> ?<br><br><a href="http://www.flfam.org.my/statistic.php?section=statistic&amp;page=statistic_7_2" rel="nofollow">Grade A eggs in Malaysia</a> are sold at a controlled RETAIL price of 20 to 35 sen, which is about 0.15 cents - Malaysian retail price in Singapore currency.<br><br>If at this price, the Malaysian distribution chain will hive off 30 percent to cover their costs, this will make their wholesale price to be somewhere 0.245 sen or 0.12 cents.<br><br>Singapore's NTUC should be able to knock off another 10 per cent with its ability to pay cash and taking a bigger load for its more then 100 outlets.<br><br>With a stronger currency and ability to buy in bulk, and with shorter or less complex distribution tiers, we are paying much more then the Malaysians.<br><br></span><br><br></div>
