              <p>It is very simple. There is no chicken or egg condition attached
              when people went to the poll to elect leaders to govern the
              country. Even if these leaders were elected without pays or with
              low pays they must still do their jobs well done and not give any
              excuses for any failure to try to explain them away or deny them
              with a chicken and egg poser.</p>
              <p>In the election the leaders do not tell the electorate they
              agree to stand for election only on certain conditions like they
              are not answerable for any failures beyond their control.</p>
              <p>They must show results and people are the final judge of any
              results or lack of results and people will remain their master and
              not become their servile slaves to let them do as they like due to
              any propaganda.</p>
              <p>Leadership should include ability to win over the people of all
              shape and sizes personality traits or dispositions. If they have no
              patience or personal EQ to win over the people in general and
              opponents as well they are not fit to be leaders period.</p>
              <p>Leaders must remain calm and act professionally and above board
              at all times no matter how trying the circumstances may be. If they
              cannot accept or tolerate criticisms right or wrong and try to fix
              them with underhand like sending cover agents to undermine civil
              views and opinions they are not good leaders.</p>
              <p>They must pass high standards of test such as the
              above-mentioned in order to lead the people with justice and
              equity, logic, rationale setting personal example with endurance of
              sacrifice as necessary like Nelson Mendela or Gandhi has done.</p>
              <p>Good leaders must answer to problems and issues as disclosed in
              NKF and not sue critics or oppositions for trying to question them
              over such problems.</p>
              <p>It is simply not right to put up all kinds of propaganda to make
              people look bad in order to make themselves too better especially
              in overseas visits to Middle East recently.</p>
              <p>This kind of government can be described simply as "Chih Li Bah
              Wai" or loosely translated "Biting the fingers that feed food" or
              "Getting filled at home while crawling out to serve others"</p>
              <p>It is wrong to use power to get their way like legalistic
              wrangling or passing all sorts of laws to get their way or to
              increase their own pays and rewards or undermine fair and free
              election like the GRC</p>
              <p>From the above review of our governing system it should be quite
              clear that our governing system has left much to be desired.</p>
              <p>This type of government is parochial and not sustainable
              especially in the internet age.</p>
              <p>Many loyal citizens here have put up their views on this subject
              with logic and rationale. There is an urgent need to overhaul the
              whole governing system for the better.</p>
              <p>Otherwise the government will continue to face criticisms and
              unhappiness as seen all over the island.</p>
              <p>Moreover our leaders are being paid handsomely at the world's
              highest salary for iron ricebowl bill collector without
              accountablity for major mistakes or errors as seen in Mas
              Selamat.</p>
              <p>He who pays the piper calls the tune. So it is wrong to keep
              denying or pushing away any problem by blaming on the people for
              wnatever reason.</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>If MHA is not up to the mark he should offer his resignation at
              least. If PM cannot solve the major problems like the rising costs
              of living or doing business or failure in uplifting the quality of
              life as reported by international index, he should either resign or
              reshuffle his cabinet.</p>
              <p>By blaming any failure to solve major problems or sending a team
              of counter-insurgency agent to call them names or discourage them
              from giving views and opinions is very unprofessional.</p>
              <p>Government has been high handed and arrogant for too long now.
              It will be too naive to listen to all the propagandas and even
              putting on thinking cap.</p>
