            <div class='col-md body'>My personal views:<br><br>1. Perceived as too arrogant: Look at the way James Gomez being thrashed. I tend to believe that JG had deliberately "forgotten" the submission of the form. But PAP called him a liar without concreate evidence is a turn-off. You can't read JG's mind, so you can't label him as a liar until he has confessed that he intended to cheat and discredit the government. A logical deduction or guessing shall not be the basis for calling a person a "liar". Imagine if WP do the same thin to PAP?<br><br>2. Foreign "talent" issue: We have too many foreign "talents" here. Gauging their job performances leaves many wonder what kind of "talents" they can offer to Singapore. If SIngaporean can do the job equally well, the priority shall go to Singaporeans. Govt can't control how the job market work, but they can put in incentives to encourage some form of behavior. For example, higher levies for foreign workers that do not possess the necessary skills that S'pore needs. And there has been many unhappiness over the fact that there is no benefits being a Singaporean. We pay the same tax, enjoy the same treatment as the foreigners. And worse, we need to serve NS and reservists while foreigners do not need to. The meagre amount of progress package or handouts are not good enough for me to think that I am being treated better than a foreigner. And not forgetting the fact that if there are any turbalances here, I am still staying. Foreigners will just leave. And yet the ricebowls are given to the foreigners SO EASILY. And since foreigners do not need to serve NS or reservists, can the government put in different tax structure for these foreigners, so that effectively, they will pay higher tax than Singaproeans? I am not advocating too much, just 1% more than what a Singaproean pay is good enough to convince us that we are being treated better than the foreigners.<br><br>3. Cost of living. This is easily understood. Take for example, the recent in crease in tuition fees at the universities. Since the government has been giving the same tuition subsidies to the foreign students (I heard that they will only need to work here after graduation for three years if they take up the subsidies), why can't we reduce their subsidies? If we go overseas to study, foreign governments do not extend the tuition subsidies to us. Again here, if the foreigners receive 10% less tuition subsidies is godd enough to convince us that we are being treated better than a foreigners. The savings can be used to grant some form of tax rebates to the Singapore parents who need to send their children overseas to study because we do not have enough vacancies in local universities.<br><br>So the message is: listen to the people, and make us feel being treated slightly better than the foreigners. We are here to stay, in war and peace. Don't tell us the foreigners can be a citizen - they still do not need to serve reservist. Or don't tell us their children will serve NS - they are enjoying the same benefits NOW.</div>

Actually I wanted to register quite long ago.<br><br>Because I have been talking to my reservist frens when we are at ICT. Many of us are so upset that we sweat and sufferred to protect the country, and foreigners did not contribute anything to our national security, and yet enjoying the same benefits as us. And some are just coming in to be citizen without being called up to serve as a reservist (as long as a citizen is below 40 or 50 year old, they are required to server in the reservist).<br><br>And you have heard that some had died during their NS/reservist duties.<br><br>Why not tax these foreigners and newly-converted citizens some kind of security tax? Giving reservist some miserable tax relief is not enough. Like that, I also want to be a foreigner. No need to go back every year for ICT. No need to fear that someone will take over my place when I am still in the ICT. No need to worry that I can't cope of so much work after I come back from reservist.<br><br>How unfair.</div>
