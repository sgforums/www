            <div class='col-md body'>Well I was treated that way too when I made a police report on my missing handphone. I won't elaborate on that. Anyway, they treated me like some small kid and took ages to get one freaking report done.<br><br>In any case, you can do what I did. Write a FORMAL letter of complaint to...to qoute myself as an example... I sent it to the NPC HEAD, the DIVISION HEAD and finally to the Commissioner of Police. Yeap. Thats what I did.<br><br>But if you dont want to lodge a complaint, then guess you can just forget abt it.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yoz bro.<br>sad to hear your case. but it no point using strong words on the line where you dare not put it across the policeman face to face.<br><br>if you seriously think you have a point to say, you say it. of course you did be smart not to make any personal or organisation attacked remark. i think you did be fine.<br><br>i have encounter with a TP some years back when i was caught twice in a day for having a illegal install foglight. Yes twice in a day when i dont even have  enough time to dismantle it. i talk aloud to the TP and state my point clearly and i keep talking for the next 10minutes. he finish issue the tickets but he has to stay and listen to me coz i say it rude for not explaining clearly what th reason for the ticket and why it was issue twice in  day. in the end he say i can make a report to the TP or what dept when i received official ticket notice.<br><br>dont worry about police. police job are not just to check ID on children not going home after 12midnight, but main duty to main security, crime prevention and impt solve cases of crime that already happen.<br><br></div>

What more do I need say?<br><br>Most of them are just there to perform set routines, and wait for 5pm or 6pm go back to their girlfriends and life.<br><br></div>

Not sure if you are being sarcastic or something. I have clearly stated that I went there to find out if t here is a name to such a act. And if the Police can do anything about it.<br><br>I did not even have a case for them to investigate nor wanted to start one.<br><br>Do you happen to be a police? You opinions are exactly the same as the officer, which is that I wanted to write a police report against the seller to charge him or something.</div>

NS men probs not only appear in the SPF. SAF and SCDF too. So i think it would be great if we include all this into the topic.</div></blockquote>Sorry I just changed my siggy to the xfire one. Regarding my older sig, it is not anti NS. It is to help people to understand that Police will not help with simple matters.<br><br>The difference between police and SAF or other forces is that, Police are the one who have the most contact with civilians.<br><br>Quoting from myself in my first post.<br><blockquote>They probably treated their jobs as conscript labour and took no pride or dedication in them. I find them pretty much unfit to be in direct contact with normal civilians.</blockquote>I guess my thread starter post was too long, points seems to have been lost to most people if they truly have read through.</div>
