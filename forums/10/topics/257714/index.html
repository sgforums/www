But then again, its trying to beat PAP with an election system that is engineered to keep PAP in Power.<br><br>But Winning a GRC is 1 of to things that has to be done. Winning to a point that PAP has less than 66.6% of the seats in Parliament.<br><br>But before that, till the next elections, everyone should spread the word on PAPs oppressiveness. All the mainstream media is controlled. so for now, by word of mount, thru the internet, spead the word, pass the message on. Use the internet, go to every well visited forum that you know of. Start by "verbabally" protesting in the internet. Do no relent till the next GE. Go forth and spread the word of democracy.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It is regrettable that our own people deliberately seek out destardly means of 'freebies'. The best response is to place recording cameras at the pumps itself to record the license plate number of each car. In the event any try to drive off without paying, the pump attendant can confirm the make and vehicle and lodge a police report.<br><br>The law can likewise ensure a punitive punishment for the offender, along with the option of banning him from driving all vehicles for a proposed duration.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i think an "ez link card system" should be implemented, where you can pay before you pump, at the petrol pump itself, without having to walk to and fro, which saves time and effort. Perhaps, it could put a nets machine there, put a counter there, with a petrol attendant there to collect payment.</div>
