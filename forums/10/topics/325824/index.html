              <p>My place here, geylang bahru blk 72, alot of China Chao Ah beng Ah Seng living here.Their bloody eyes, like to stare at you, or stare at you like as if you own them money.Just now when i was taking a lift up, three China guys wearing like ah beng, typical of them, stare at me like want to beat me.Then got one lady also came in together with us.When they got off at the six floor, i ask the lady if she's Singaporean.</p>
              <p>She said yes and then i decided to ask her what i felt to see if i am sensitive to China peoples.And the answer is yes, she agree with me and node her head, there are far too many China people in our area.And most of them, not the kind you think you would like to stay with.Alot of them, smoke, drink, wear like so chao beng.They come in large number here and can stay for as long as they can.How can they come here so easily?They can just come to Singapore and work so easily?No rules and regulations?Ask them to go to Australia or Malaysia and you see if they can go there so easily.I wonder what our government is up to!!!! I really want to make this topic hot enough to give the government a brake to ponder over their foreign talent policies.</p>
              <p>What kind of foreign talent they bring in! All these chao ah beng China guys are called foreign talents??? Pleaseee, this is my country Singapore, i dont want it to be call by foreigners ... small China!!! If you guys don't care about it, one day... our country MP will be replace by China talents too!!! Really had to think about these dangerous problems facing us now!!!</p>

              <p>i was shooting hoop nearby my place in the early afternoon yesterday when a youngish 3+ years old kid came to me and insists he wants to play ball too. so, i toss him my b'ball and he amazes me with his ball handling skills. i asked for his name, etc. and found out that he is a filipino kid whose parents moved here to work.</p>
              <p>for once, i decided to look on the bright side. i think there's hope for singapore basketball yet, if this kid decides to stay on.</p>

              <p>I think many of us have little issues with high quality FTs or kids, or even FWs.</p>
              <p>The problem is attitude. I mean, there are rude Singaporeans too, and if FWs or FTs are rude in a similar fashion, it's a small matter. But when FWs or FTs are rude in an arrogant fashion such that they or their culture/language are 'superior' to ours, then they don't deserve to be here. This applies to ang mohs too, not just PRCs or other Asian countries. The government aims to have a multi-cultural society; letting 'arrogant' or 'uncouth' pricks in is like taking a step backwards.</p>

              <p>IMO, if singapore don't bring in such ppl, then we are to sweep our floor, clean our rubbish etc ourselves? I don't wanna do that..</p>
              <p>But i agree that we have too many China ppl, maybe a good mix of thai, filipinos, vietnams etc MAY be better??</p>
