            <div class='col-md body'>With regard to the recently surfaced news about the chinese student lashing out at Singaporeans, I would like all readers to call together for the immediate cancellation of his tuition grant as well as his deportation from Our country.<br><br>I believe that there is no need for our government to continue their kindly grants to such traitorous ingrates. Quoting from The Newpaper, April 11th 2004, he had stubbornly refused to back down on his statements which called Singaporeans Â“brains are fed with pigswill, fat, have no intelligence, feel complacent even though they've only accomplished something smallÂ”. NOW EXCUSE ME. Firstly, I donÂ’t quite believe that we have been fed with pigswill, and not that I am going to participate in his level of intelligence, but if you have been watching closely, weÂ’re not the ones causing a worldwide epidemic, then saying itÂ’s not our fault, then using military hospitals to shamelessly cover things up in the presence of World Health Organisation (WHO). And for Singaporeans to feel complacent for what our government has done, who could blame them? Our government did a very commendable job stamping out those communists swine, establishing our country as a First World Nation even after being expelled from the Federation of Malaya and what more. Yes, we may be sheltered. Why? Simply because we have a reliable government, one which is not corrupt (and neither is it in their custom to be that way!).<br><br>Our country is facing unemployment rates of 4.7 percent of the last count, and yet our government is spending our taxpayersÂ’ hard-earned money on these ingrates? And worse yet, it is done without having them serve any bond? They are like vermin, coming over like a bunch of pests and then feeding of our people and running away. DonÂ’t get me wrong, I do not hate all of them. Rather, I am addressing specifically the bunch of students who had shamelessly insulted all Singaporeans just because a project mate of one theirs, who happened to be Singaporean, had apparently been contributing dissatisfactory amounts of work. I myself, am about to become another taxpayer and I would hate the thought that I am contributing to the education of such subversive crooks.<br><br>Worst off, the fire-starter had refused to retract or feel regretful for his statements, which had obviously angered more than one Singaporean, going to the extent of saying that despite our government paying for his education, he still had the right to Â“an opinion of his ownÂ”, and that what he did was Â“not defamatoryÂ”. Boy, he really must be enjoying the fact that we have at least a certain level of Freedom of Speech here huh.<br><br>Ladies and Gentlemen, the threat of such malicious minds looming amongst us is imminent and worse, growing. We must do what we can to stomp out these crooks among us, and I myself would very much like to start an online petition requesting for the nullification of his grant, and to have the appropriate authorities deport such a subversive antagonist back to where he came from.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i don't agree with you, just because we've been insulted doesn't mean we have to sent him back, we don't need to do things like this, i'm sure we're rational enough to know that what the chinese student said is pretty much a well known fact. sometimes i do feel that we're feed with pigswill if not where do you think people like kotex ,troy and panja came from? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> i feel that its better to look at ourselves and see where it went wrong with us <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Perhaps oldbreadstinks has mistaken my point.<br><br>Take it this way: A guest has arrived at your house for dinner. You cook for him and take care of him as well as you can. Then, he starts telling you your food sucks, your family sucks and whatever else you can imagine, just because you did not fulfill his level of expectations to his satisfaction. What would you do if that happened?<br><br>Now what's happening here is something more serious and daunting than we had previously thought. His act was against an entire nation of people, and when asked by the press if he regretted his statements, he stubbornly insisted on it, and even dared to further justify his ridiculous arguments. Isn't that something worse than appaling?<br><br>I think that our government should look into this matter more seriously than we think they should, because, if they don't, this will result in a possible snowball of tension between the two groups, and even worse, resulting in estranged ties on a political level.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>Firstly lets empathise with the CHinese National on his comment. In his country, he cant talk about his own country. here, he has a greater freedom of speech.<br><br>Also, this guy came with a great burden of needing to graduate to before he can go back, leaving his family for some time. alot of Chinese nationals dont understand why singaporeans just cant concentrate on studying resulting in this comment. If they feel so repulsed by it, then they shouldnt come here at all. when my friend go overseas to study like australia, they too get a culture shock and feel that Singapore education is too uptight. Going to a foereign country and leaving their family behingd is a traumatic experience and we should emhatise.<br><br>basically i feel that some undergrads are fraid of these chinese nationals becasue they are so hardworking. who then, despises them? Do we not fear their competitiveness. Problem is, there is a lack of interaction and understanding betwen this two group. Although both are yellow people, the background is totally different.<br><br>Furthermore ,most who come here are the only child and hence the emotional baggage. and when they cant cope with it (i can only speculate the handicap in english), they lash it out on us.<br><br>We perhaps should identify this student and counsel him rather than ostracize him.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i think that there's no doubt that this student had really gone overboard. even if what he said is true, he ought to phrase it in a better and less harsh way.... i mean yes u can have ur freedom of speech, but there's no need for u to slam the other party right?<br><br>if it was meant as a criticism, then he should put it in a more mature and responsible manner. maybe that would not haf caused so much debate and misunderstandings, and people would be able to see the big picture in a calmer mood....<br><br>but i agree with some of u that instead of being so narrow minded and petty, we ought to show the world that spore is capable of being magnanimous... and even tho his comments didn't come out as positive criticisms, we should treat it as one. so that instead of wasting our breath to argue it out who's right and who's wrong, we would be channeling our energy to thinking of ways to improve ourselves</div>
