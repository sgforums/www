            <div class='col-md body'>A long long time ago, in the name of avoiding welfarism government has already set up many GLCs to take over provisions of essential government services from medicare to postal, housing, transportations and utilities etc, with the intention to reduce their liability for provisions of government services.<br><br>Thus the same government which keeps telling people about the danger of welfarism has no longer provided anything to the citizens as it has largely farmed out provisions of such services originally paid under taxes back to the citizens.<br><br>Such government linked companies charge monopoly fees like the transport and utility companies to cover their costs of operations plus making of a profit. These profits are being used to reduce government costs and enrich the state coffers as well as to pay ministers and civil servants higher salaries and bonuses.<br><br>If all these back-charging of costs through GLCs are taken into account, citizens in effect are paying much more than taxes to support the government.<br><br>Instead of showing surpluses and profits from government linked companies, land sale profits from URA and HDB, ministers still keep increasing taxes and making more profits to justify paying themselves more and spending on extravagant seven wonders.<br><br>It is using peopleÂ’s monies to self-reward their own scholars and connection in many GLCs instead of passing profits back to the people. It is denying responsibility of helping the citizens who have been paying all kinds of costs unnecessarily on top of the taxes.<br><br><a href="http://www.friendster.com&lt;img%20src=">" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;www.friendster.com<img src="http://as.casalemedia.com/s?s=66151&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Ffriendster.com&amp;f=4&amp;id=0&amp;if=0"></a></div>

GLC,  Unions are under the control of the ruling party.<br><br>i watch the telecast of birth of singapore and LKY. LKY had indeed come a long way, but somehow i miss those scenerio where strong unions could go face to face with the govt.
