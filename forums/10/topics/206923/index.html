            <div class='col-md body'>Mr Wang Bakes Good Karma<br><br>Pulling a Fast One<br>Is Mr Wang done with PM Lee's rally speech yet? Almost. First, let's recap two major trends/policies for Singapore:<br><br>(1) Singapore faces the challenge of an ageing population (or so we're told). Current projections show that one in five Singaporeans will be over the age of 65 by 2030. The government therefore wants to encourage Singaporeans to have more babies.<br><br>(2) Singapore's economy lacks skilled manpower (or so we're told). The government wants to import huge numbers of foreign talents, to keep the economy going strong.<br><br>PM Lee's rally speech is perhaps the first time that the Singapore government has tied Point (1) directly to Point (2). Let's look at the relevant passage:<br><br>"Two years ago, we introduced major policy changes to encourage couples to have more babies. So far the results have been very modest. I understand why some Singaporeans do not want to have more children. But I have not given up hope and will continue to think of ways to encourage couples to have more babies.<br><br>Let me explain why we need new immigrants. To maintain a population of 4 million, Singapore needs at least 50,000 babies a year. Last year, we had 36,000 babies. This means that we are short by 14,000 babies. No matter how hard we try, it would be hard to produce another 14,000 babies. Hence we need to attract more immigrants."<br>Something is very wrong with the above reasoning, and no one in the blogosphere seems to have pointed it out yet. So I guess I'll have to do the job again.<br><br>This is it - babies are not adults. Adults are not babies. Let's imagine that PM Lee's baby-making incentives had succeeded beyond his wildest dreams and Singaporeans produced 75,000 babies last year. That means we would have 75,000 one-year-old cute little chubbies in Singapore today.<br><br>But babies can't work. They don't contribute to the economy. They're not research scientists, engineers, bankers or teachers. That would take another 20 to 25 years to happen.<br><br>Meanwhile, we import foreign talent. Let's say A*STAR finds a 40-year-old stem research scientist in the US and imports him into Singapore. He settles here, and because of his valuable skills, immediately starts contributing to the economy. However, he is not a baby.<br><br>In 20 or 25 years' time, he will be 60 or 65 years old and would have become one extra member in the senior citizen population for the Singapore government to worry about. In fact, the more we import foreign talent in their 30s and 40s, the greater our future "aging population" problem will become!<br><br>Of course, I have also oversimplified. The true dynamics are more complicated. For now, my point is just that PM Lee is talking nonsense here:<br><br>Last year, we had 36,000 babies. This means that we are short by 14,000 babies. No matter how hard we try, it would be hard to produce another 14,000 babies. Hence we need to attract more immigrants.<br>I see his attempt to tie the lack of babies to the immediate need for foreigners as just another sales strategy to convince the Singaporean public about his foreign talent schemes. Furthermore he gets to shift the blame ("See? YOU Singaporeans are not producing enough babies, so I, the Prime Minister need to import foreign talent").<br><br>The truth is - babies are not adults. Adults are not babies. PM Lee is surely smart enough to see that. I think that he thinks you're not. Here's another example of his quicksell tactics, from April 2006.<br><br>Meanwhile, Singaporeans are getting fooled. Look at poor Ms Lee Pai Ping, writing to the online ST Forum:<br><br>Aug 23, 2006<br>S'poreans have to pay a price for not heeding govt's plea for more babies<br><br>I missed Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong's National Day Rally Speech on television last Sunday.<br><br>When I read about it in The Straits Times the next day, a sudden sadness overwhelmed me.<br><br>The Singapore government has decided to be more aggressive in attracting immigrants with talents of all kinds to Singapore with the offer of Singapore permanent residence status, once purportedly aimed at graduates, professionals, bankers, lawyers and the like.<br><br>What a huge price Singaporeans have to pay for not heeding the government's persistent plea for higher birth rates among its people, and to be less picky about jobs.<br><br>I am for the Singapore government's move to import foreign talents to fill the gap and boost the economy by creating job opportunities as entrepreneurs.<br><br>But I shrug at the thought that some native Singaporeans, especially the young and educated of marrying age, do not think it their duty to marry and procreate as part of nation-building, and the unemployed who still fuss over jobs, choosing to remain jobless rather than accepting a job below their expectations.<br><br>Singaporeans should not be complacent. Nation-building is our utmost duty and responsibility.<br><br>Lee Pai Ping (Ms)<br>Ms Lee Pai Ping, try to understand this. If today we import skilled foreigners in their 30s because we lack Singaporean working adults, then our problem isn't with young, married, childless Singaporean couples today. The problem really happened 30 years ago - when the government was busy telling young couples then to "Stop At Two".<br><br>So no need to suffer all that guilt, Pai Ping. The government is to blame. That's what PM Lee doesn't want to tell you. He'd rather just blame you and make you feel bad instead.<br><br>Pai Ping isn't the only person who got suckered. Seems like a senior ST columnist also got suckered too. Click here to read the ST editorial of 22 August 2006. There he goes - putting the blame on "career-minded young couples" without kids. Or maybe the Straits Times guy does know the truth, but just wanted to perform one of those "nation-building-press" gymnastic tricks.<br></div>

The population explosion predicted 20 years would have happened and Singapore would still be a third world country today. The other option was the stop at 2 campaign. Now we are having problems trying to make up numbers with imported foreign talents. But are we sure we can keep the loyalty of such talents so that they will want to set up roots here? Or are such talents here for the one-off jumpstart of their professional careers? Can we afford single-parent families as the new nucleus of Singapore? Adoption is an option that cannot be disregarded for childless couples. Having one partner in a family is better than having no partner at all.</div>

First it was too many babies/kids, now they are afraid of too many aged.<br><br>It seems the only thing they are not afraid of is lots of money from our economy.<br><br>Right now, they say FTs and imigration is good. But I tell you, it will end up like Casino; initially NO, then when avenues for revenue becomes exhausted, YES to casinos.<br><br>All these FTs now, wouldn' they also become old and aged?? And do you believe all of them will stay, and that they will all turn out like the fine example in todays' Sunday Times???<br><br>It's going to be another LPPL policy. It's not even a solution, but another problem in itself. Look at the all the low-life PRCs who are making a mockery of our immigration system by getting married for the sake of a PR status!<br><br>FTs are just here for the SGD$.

The editors quickly decided to suspend Mr Brown's regular column indefinitely.<br><br>The incident appeared to contradict promises by Lee Hsien Loong, the prime minister, to promote more political discussion in the tightly ruled city-state. Â“We are building a more open society and encouraging freer debate,Â” he claimed in a National Day speech last week.<br><br>The reason the offending column hit a raw nerve was that it complained about the rising cost of living when the income gap is widening.<br><br>The social contract under which Singaporeans gave up certain civil liberties in return for prosperity is under threat.<br><br>There are other signs of official nervousness. New conditions for the circulation of foreign publications were recently imposed. Singapore banned outdoor demonstrations by international non-governmental organisations during next month's IMF/World Bank annual meeting. And Chee Juan-soon, a leading opposition leader, is being tried for alleged defamation against top government leaders and speaking in public without a police permit.<br><br>The moves come after the long-ruling People's Action party suffered an 8-percentage-point drop in support during May's general election, which focused on widening income disparity.<br><br>Shortly after the election, the government revealed that the income gap was bigger than at any time since independence in 1965. The bottom 30 per cent of households have seen incomes fall since 2000.<br><br><strong>Singapore's Gini coefficient, a measure of income inequality, places the city state at 105th in the world, between Papua New Guinea and Argentina, </strong>based on data from the latest United Nations Development Programme report.<br><br>A two-speed, dual economy appears to be emerging in Singapore,Â” said Citigroup.<br><br>Â“Globalisation, for a small open economy, may be having a disproportionately large impact.Â”<br><br><strong>The government has allowed some forms of freer _expression, particularly in terms of theatre performances because they attract a small audience.</strong><br><br>The recent Singapore Theatre Festival included several plays that were critical of the political and social climate.<br><br><strong>Â“The younger generation of journalists is trying to challenge the government and push the envelope on what it can report,Â” said a senior editor with Singapore Press Holdings, which publishes most of the local newspapers.<br><br>But the government is pushing back, warning journalists not to overstep what it calls Â“out-of-bounds markersÂ”.</strong><br><br>The information ministry said Mr Brown was Â“exploiting his access to the mass media to undermine the government's standing with the electorate,Â” when instead he Â“should offer constructive criticism and alternativesÂ”.<br><br>Singapore has tightened regulations this month on leading international publications, including the Financial Times, the International Herald Tribune, Time, Newsweek and the Far Eastern Economic Review (FEER).<br><br>The rules, which already apply to the Wall Street Journal Asia, require the publications to post a security deposit of S$200,000 (US$127,000, Â€99,000, Â£68,000) and appoint a representative in Singapore who could be sued, and gives the government the power to restrict their circulation. Reporters Without Borders, a Paris-based press freedom group, said the rules were meant to intimidate the international media from reporting on Singapore's domestic affairs and encourage them to practise self-censorship.<br><br>The information ministry said the press act Â“serves to reinforce the government's consistent position that it is a privilege, and not a right, for foreign newspapers to circulate in Singapore.Â”<br><br>Â“They do so as foreign observers of the local scene and should not interfere in the domestic politics of Singapore.Â”<br><br>The move came shortly after FEER published an interview with Dr Chee, whom it called Singapore's Â“martyrÂ”, and ahead of the IMF/World Bank meeting in Singapore next month, the biggest international conference it has ever held.<br><br>Dr Chee, who promotes the idea of civil disobedience, had suggested he might use the occasion to stage public protests.<br><br>Under an agreement with the IMF and World Bank, Singapore pledged to allow an approved list of NGOs to take part in the proceedings. But it recently said the NGOs would have to get police permits to gain access to the lobby of the conference centre, where they can Â“gather and engageÂ” delegates.<br><br></blockquote></span><br><br></div>
