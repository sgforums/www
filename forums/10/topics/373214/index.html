              <p><span class="postbody"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Reuters, 24 Aug 2009</span> <br> <span style="font-weight: bold;"> <br> <span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: normal;">Thai Shin says Temasek stake sale depends on market</span></span> <br> <br> BANGKOK, Aug 24 (Reuters) - <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: red;">A
              plan by Singapore's Temasek Holdings [TEM.UL] to sell its stake in
              Thailand's leading telecoms group, Shin Corp SHIN.BK, will depend on
              market conditions, an official at the Thai firm said on Monday.</span></span> <br> <br> The plan is followed closely by investors as it is likely to increase
              the volume of Shin shares trading in the market. Some analysts see the
              stock as a good proxy for Thailand's telecoms industry but say the low
              free float is a trading risk.
              <br> <br>"Our major shareholder has a policy to dilute its stake, but timing
              will depend on the economic situation and market conditions," Tomyantee
              Kongpoolsilpa, a senior manager for investor relations at Shin, told
              reporters.
              <br> <br> Shin was founded by former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra and control was sold to Temasek by his family in 2006.
              <br> <br>Shin's free float dropped to under 4 percent, below the 15 percent
              threshold required by the Stock Exchange of Thailand, following
              Temasek's $3.8 billion takeover.
              <br> <br> <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: red;">Under a
              complicated structure, Shin is 96.12 percent owned by two
              Thai-registered companies, Cedar Holdings and Aspen Holdings. Aspen is
              owned directly by a Temasek subsidiary, while Cedar is 49 percent owned
              by Temasek.</span></span> <br> <br> The Singapore state investment firm had planned to dilute its holding
              in Shin Corp to 49 percent, but the plan is on hold pending a probe
              into whether the takeover broke laws limiting foreign ownership of Thai
              firms to 49 percent.
              <br> <br>Kim Eng Securities said in a note that the Shin shares looked
              interesting because of third-generation mobile phone licences to be
              issued to its 43 percent owned Advanced Info Service (AIS) ADVA.BK and
              the progress of the IPSTAR satellite business run by its 41 percent
              owned Thaicom THCOM.BK.
              <br> <br>Shares in Shin, valued at $2.1 billion on the Thai bourse, ended
              0.9 percent higher at 23.00 baht after touching a 12-month high of
              23.30 baht earlier. The overall Thai stock market was 1.3 percent
              higher.
              <br> <br> <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: blue;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: normal;">The current value of Shin shares is under half the price Temasek paid,<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> 49.25 baht</span>, in January 2006.</span></span></span> <br> <br>Shin groups more than 20 companies in the wireless, satellite,
              Internet and media sectors, with AIS, Thailand's largest mobile phone
              operator, contributing more than 80 percent of its profit. ($1 = 34.00
              Baht) (Reporting by Pisit Changplayngam; Writing by Khettiya Jittapong;
