              <p>By Shawn W Crispin
              																	<br> <br> BANGKOK - When a state-linked Cambodian Internet service provider (ISP) blocked 
              																	access this month to a critical non-governmental organization report detailing 
              																	the government's alleged mismanagement of natural and energy resources, the 
              																	censorship closed the loop on the region's fast-closing cyberspace.
              																	<br> <br> The Cambodian government has prioritized improving its Internet controls and 
              																	legislation, despite the fact less than 0.3% of the population is online, one 
              																	of the lowest Internet penetration rates in the world. The recent bust of an 
              																	alleged terror plot against the government revealed that authorities had 
              																	capability to hack into suspects' - and perhaps perceived other adversaries' - e-mail accounts.
              																	<br> <br> It wasn't long ago that Asia's Internet was being heralded as an inexorable 
              																	force for democratic change across the predominantly authoritarian-run region. 
              																	Rising Internet penetration rates and the proliferation of websites that 
              																	provided alternative news and critical views, particularly in countries where 
              																	the state had long dominated information flows, marked substantial democratic 
              																	gains.
              																	<br> <br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Across the world, governments are now bidding to claw back those gains and 
              																	assert tighter control over the Internet through improved surveillance and 
              																	censorship capabilities.</strong></span> Meanwhile, new laws are granting state authorities in 
              																	many countries new powers to block and censor online content, often in the 
              																	arbitrary name of maintaining social order or national <a id="KonaLink0" class="kLink" style="text-decoration: underline ! important; position: static;" href="http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/KB27Ae01.html#"><span style="color: green;"><span class="kLink" style="color: green ! important; font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-weight: 400; font-size: 13px; position: static;">security</span></span></a>.
              																	<br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br> The battle for Internet freedom is particularly pitched in Southeast Asia, 
              																	where even nominally democratic governments are now cracking down on 
              																	journalists, <a id="KonaLink1" class="kLink" style="text-decoration: underline ! important; position: static;" href="http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/KB27Ae01.html#"><span style="color: green;"><span class="kLink" style="color: green ! important; font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-weight: 400; font-size: 13px; position: static;">bloggers</span></span></a> and ordinary Internet users. </strong></span>China has emerged as the 
              																	region's Internet censorship role model, with its successful use of 
              																	sophisticated filtering and surveillance technologies, widely known as 
              																	Beijing's "Great Firewall".
              																	<br> <br> Those capabilities have been widened through a new government-run computer 
              																	monitoring information system, known as the "Golden Shield Project". Of the 28 
              																	journalists now imprisoned in China, as tallied by the New York-based Committee 
              																	to Protect Journalists (CPJ), 24 of them were charged and sentenced for 
              																	articles and commentaries they posted online.
              																	<br> <br> In its recently released "Attacks on the Press" compendium, CPJ contends that a 
              																	growing number of Southeast Asian governments have moved to emulate China's 
              																	cyber-censorship techniques. The advocacy group argues that as Western nations 
              																	have moved to engage China's authoritarian regime, several Southeast Asian 
              																	governments no longer feel obliged to follow through on the democratic reforms 
              																	- including commitments to Internet freedom - the West had once pressured them 
              																	to adopt.
              																	<br> <br> Those pressures are expected to diminish further as the US looks towards China 
              																	to help bail-out its bankrupt financial and banking systems through the 
              																	continued purchase of US treasury bonds. The US's collapsing demand for 
              																	regional exports and flagging outward investments is expected to eventually 
              																	translate into reduced diplomatic clout in Southeast Asia, a retrenchment that 
              																	will likely enhance China's already rising regional influence.
              																	<br> <br> Long-time US ally Thailand stands as a case in point. The Thai government has 
              																	launched one of the most aggressive crackdowns on Internet freedom seen 
              																	anywhere in the world - so far without a peep of dissent from Bangkok's US 
              																	embassy. The crackdown was presaged by the passage of the 2007 Computer Crime 
              																	Act, which among other measures made the use of proxy <a id="KonaLink2" class="kLink" style="text-decoration: underline ! important; position: static;" href="http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/KB27Ae01.html#"><span style="color: green;"><span class="kLink" style="color: green ! important; font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-weight: 400; font-size: 13px; position: static;">servers</span></span></a> to circumvent 
              																	government blocks on websites an offense punishable by imprisonment.
              																	<br> <br> The Information Technology and Communication Ministry has since earmarked 
              																	millions of dollars to develop and deploy improved firewall technologies and 
              																	the ministry now maintains an Internet "war room" where officials conduct 
              																	surveillance over Internet content. The ministry said in early January that it 
              																	had closed down 2,300 websites for posting materials deemed critical of the 
              																	Thai royal family.
              																	<br> <br> The Justice Ministry has since indicated it will seek a court order to block 
              																	another 3,000 to 4,000 sites for the same reason. At least one Thai Internet 
              																	user is currently in prison for posting materials deemed offensive to the royal 
              																	crown, and two bloggers were temporarily detained but not formally charged on 
              																	similar charges in 2007.
              																	<br> <br> <strong>Cyber-backslider</strong><br> Nominally democratic Malaysia is another prominent backslider. The government 
              																	pledged in 1996 not to censor the Internet to lure foreign funds to the 
              																	Multimedia Super Corridor project, an ambitious state gambit that aimed to 
              																	incubate Malaysia's own version of the US's Silicon Valley. The no-censorship 
              																	policy allowed online news providers and bloggers to report and comment on news 
              																	that the state-controlled mainstream media either neglected or was instructed 
              																	from above to ignore.
              																	<br> <br> That commitment was symbolically dropped last year when the government ordered 
              																	local ISPs to block access to prominent blogger Raja Petra Kamarudin's Malaysia 
              																	Today news site, which has a larger readership than several established 
              																	state-influenced newspapers. He has been charged and detained under both the 
              																	Sedition and Internal Security Acts for online writings which were critical of 
              																	the government.
              																	<br> <br> According to the CPJ, it's still unclear whether Malaysian authorities have 
              																	deployed the same type of filtering and monitoring technologies seen in China, 
              																	but the government is known to <a id="KonaLink3" class="kLink" style="text-decoration: underline ! important; position: static;" href="http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/KB27Ae01.html#"><span style="color: green;"><span class="kLink" style="color: green ! important; font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-weight: 400; font-size: 13px; position: static;">monitor</span></span></a> Internet content through three different 
              																	state agencies, including the Prime Minister's Office. According to e-mail 
              																	correspondence shared with this correspondent, Raja Petra, now temporarily 
              																	released on Internal Security Act charges, is under family pressure to flee the 
              																	country rather than stand trial in Malaysia's politically compromised courts.
              																	<br> <br> The situation is worsening in less democratic countries. Vietnam, known to 
              																	maintain some of Asia's most extensive Internet controls outside of China, has 
              																	in recent months moved to introduce more stringent regulations governing 
              																	bloggers and their postings.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Singapore authorities recently harassed an Asia 
              																	Times Online contributor for a November story that detailed the island state's 
              																	mounting financial troubles. </strong></span><br> <br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Police claimed that the article had been sent with added malicious comments to 
              																	the head of state, opposition politicians and newspapers from the reporter's 
              																	e-mail account. The reporter denied the charge and police officials later 
              																	indicated that an unidentified hacker had sent the message from her account. 
              																	Either way, the reporter has been put on official notice that her online 
              																	writings and e-mail activities are under surveillance. </strong></span><br> <br> Meanwhile, countries as repressive as Myanmar are dedicating significant 
              																	resources to Internet censorship. The country's technological failure to 
              																	control the Internet was apparent for all to see when undercover journalists 
              																	sent footage and reports of the 2007 Saffron Revolution street protests to 
              																	outside news organizations, forcing the regime to unplug the Internet 
              																	altogether before its fatal, final crackdown. Still, it's unclear how many 
              																	undercover journalists the authorities have been identified and jailed as part 
              																	of their wider crackdown on dissent.
              																	<br> <br> There are indications that Myanmar authorities have since received censorship 
              																	training from Russian and Chinese officials. Some contend that this explains 
              																	the mysterious distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks on a number of 
              																	exile media groups' websites last year. Soe Myint, editor of the New 
              																	Delhi-based Mizzima News, said during a recent presentation in Chiang Mai that 
              																	the cost to effectively protect his website from future DDoS attacks is beyond 
              																	his news organization's financial means.
              																	<br> <br> Despite these growing attacks, there is some cause for hope. Human rights 
              																	organizations, investors and several prominent US Internet companies, including 
              																	Yahoo!, Google and Microsoft, agreed in a joint initiative last October to 
              																	follow guidelines to protect online expression and privacy when faced <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>with 
              																	repressive government requests for <a id="KonaLink4" class="kLink" style="text-decoration: underline ! important; position: static;" href="http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/KB27Ae01.html#"><span style="color: green;"><span class="kLink" style="color: green ! important; font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-weight: 400; font-size: 13px; position: static;">user </span><span class="kLink" style="color: green ! important; font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-weight: 400; font-size: 13px; position: static;">identities</span></span></a> or assistance in blocking 
              																	targeted websites. </strong></span><br> <br> Meanwhile, some regional media groups have received foreign assistance to 
              																	locate their servers anonymously and remotely in second countries to guard 
              																	against future DDoS attacks. And ever-evolving proxy server and other 
              																	roundabout firewall technologies continue to put Internet users in countries as 
              																	isolated as Myanmar a step ahead of government censors.
              																	<br> <br> Yet even with those agreements and technologies, Asia's Internet is a 
              																	substantially more dangerous space than it was previously. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Southeast Asian 
              																	governments are now responding with bigger budgets and heavier hands to the
