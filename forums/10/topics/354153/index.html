              Father of Singapore Stab Student Asks National Police for Help
              
              The father of a student who reportedly jumped to his death after stabbing his lecturer at the Nanyang Technological University, or NTU, in Singapore has lodged a complaint with the National Police, claiming the circumstances surrounding the death were â€œpeculiar.â€� 
              
              Hartono Widjaja said he had heard nothing from Singaporean authorities since the death of his son, David Hartanto Widjaja, on March 2.
              
              The response to his request to the police was hardly satisfactory, Hartono said. â€œWhat the police did is unclear,â€� he said. â€œThey didnâ€™t refuse my report but they didnâ€™t really accept it either. The officer said he wanted to talk with his commander first.â€�
              
              Asked what help he expected the police to provide given the jurisdictional considerations, Hartono said he still believed the police could help him uncover the true circumstances surrounding his sonâ€™s death.
              
              â€œAs of today, there has been no statement from Singaporean authorities or NTU about Davidâ€™s autopsy results. Itâ€™s been more than a month since his death.â€�
              
              He said the Singaporeans claimed that David died after committing suicide, but Hartono said he did not believe this.
              
              â€œI want the police and the government to help investigate my sonâ€™s case because his death was peculiar,â€� Hartono said.
              
              â€œIf David committed suicide by jumping from a building on the university campus, he would have suffered numerous fractures, but in fact he only sustained bruises.â€�
              
              David, whose nickname was Ming Ming, had just had his academic scholarship revoked before stabbing his professor, Chan Kap Luk Chan â€” from NTUâ€™s division of information engineering â€” who is reportedly recovering from injuries to his back and finger.
              
              David was an enthusiastic computer gamer and was known as outgoing, according to livinalife.blogspot.com, where friends gave testimony on the student and revealed that he had stopped communicating with friends about a week before his death.
              
              The Straits Times newspaper reported that David had been struggling with his final-year project, and that his academic performance had dropped off.
              
              National Police spokesman Brig. Gen. Sulistyo Ishak said the police would study Hartonoâ€™s complaint before deciding on what action to take, â€œbecause the case is outside our jurisdiction.â€�
