            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by PRP:<br><strong>[b]Details</strong><br><br>Under my my proposal,the 1st stage would be  parliamentary election.It should be all single seat constituencies.All parties would have to field a certain percentage of candidates from minority races.The election wouldn't involve  forming a govt.<br><br>A few month after parl. elelction,the 2nd stage would be electing a political party or a group of ppl to form a govt.Under this stage,the campaigning would likely to focus on national policies &amp; issues.All members of the govt shall automatically appointed as MP -- like the NCMP.[/b]</blockquote>Hi PRP,<br><br>The GRC concept has its merits when it come to fielding candidates from the minority races so as to ensure a fair and equity system truly based on meritocracy without eroding racial-cohesion. Your idea of respective parties fielding a certain percentage of minority races contesting for single seat constituencies is idealistic though not realistic. Singapore compromises of chinese majority and you are going to have a case of either all single seat constituencies won by the chinese candidates or you might face problem of segregating the constituencies into 'races'. All these are detriment to the society evolution and racial harmony.<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by PRP:<br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Proposed Parliamentary Election</span><br><br>I propose all candidates for parliamentary election should stand as an individuals and should not make use of political fund or machinary.They should win on the basis of individual merit &amp; effort &amp; shouldn't behloden to a political party</strong>[/b]</blockquote>If all individuals using own funds are to stand as candidates, it is not only going to destroy the parliamentary system that works well in a party-system parliamentary debate but also creating an unhealthy rift between the rich and poor.<br><br>On your proposal for 2nd stage election, as to whether it is a political party or a group of people that is forming a goverment, the allocation of funds to respective constituencies have not been taken into consideration. Matter gets worse if it is the latter group which form the government as they are face with the formidable task to channel limited funds into 84 wards or into their 'affiliated' party. This is likely going to create unhappiness in people living in constituency not funded time and again. If a political party is government, you are going have a similar case everywhere where funding are likely to be serve to their own party-constituency first.<br><br>There is no complete fairness in politics regardless the system.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br></div>
