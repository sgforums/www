Because from your other psots in this forum, I tend to get the impression that you treat any repressive policy as a good policy. And besides, the quality of a policy, even if measured in terms of results, should not just be measured in terms of economic results. If you check academia - reputable international academia, that is, not those from IPS or PERC - there is an argument going for zero growth, since the costs of moving economically forward are just too great for any society to handle.<br><br>ANd your last line is blaming Singaporeans for carrots?

Govt office holders need not take care of constuency works,so they can have more time for their responisbilities.<br><br>2.  When the whole country vote for a govt,there wouldn't be the problem of whether one is voting for an MP or a govt as ins present situation.<br><br>3.  When voters voting for a govt,it would be about national issue and not about local issues.<br><br></div>

Actually, my personal feeling is that if some person can swing SDP over on the right path, the PAP govt is sure to fall; the problem of course is tt SDP is still being controlled by demagogues like the Chee family... *sigh*... who are doing more harm than good to the opposition movement.</div>

Overwhelming support is necessary if u want to see the idea implemented.</span></div></blockquote>At your request, my views on your proposal are given below:-<br><br>QUOTEThe existing parliamentary democracy is an offshoot of the British Westminister model. It appears that under the Westminister model, a country should best be run by a three-component governing process consisting of what is generally known as three realms of the government namely: (W1) Executive, (W2) Legislature and (W3) Judiciary.<br><br>(W1) and (W2) are so closely intertwined under the Westminster model that it leads to compromises of the larger interests of the government as a whole which is not just concerned with effectiveness of implementation of government policies or decision but also to ensure in the process of implementation, the government will produce the greatest good to the greatest number.<br><br>As has happened over the past 40 years or so, the intertwining of W1 and W2, has downgraded our system to one of pursuing economic efficiency neglecting other important duties and responsibilities to the people - to bring about a just and equitable, cohesive, and integrated society.<br><br>Our MPs are wearing two hats and have become largely beholden to the executive for material promotion and rewards preferring to subscribe to the will and wishes of W1 rather than passinonately serving the larger goals of government.<br><br>Under such a system where MPs have become a mere appendix to the executive. We have reached a state of checkmate where the elected MPs were unable to serve the people dutifully. The executive on the other hand is seen to be protective of their status quo preferring to justify such control of the MPs in the dubious name of pragmatism, leadership or talents.<br><br>The intertwining of W1 and W2 has resulted in our executive pursuing a narrow agenda with extensive use of legalistic powers to justify their actions and policies rather than being accountability to the larger goals of the government.<br><br>Our Westminster-style government has been effective only for the executive in maintaining legalistic control of the people but not the larger goals of nation building.<br><br>If democracy (in the widest sense) is to work effectively, it must produce effective leadership and implementation of policies and decisions as well as a effective body of MPs playing their various roles and functions to serve the larger interest of all and not subjected to any supervision or pressure of the executives (W1).<br><br>Currently, our government is only pursuing a legalistic economic efficiency for the governing machinery resulting in high costs of living to citizens which the W1 considers impractical to accomplish. There is a lack of regard for Ombudsman role the MPs have to play to deal with harsh aspects of implementation of government policies and decisions and correct or moderate policy fallouts or side-efects called auto-piloting by top civil servant like Ngiam Tong Dow, The executive has by and large forgotten the larger goal of serving the greatest good of the greatest number.<br><br>There exist numerous problems with Ombudsman role of the MPs sidestepped in many policy implementation. Citizens have to contend with many executive legalistic wrangling of laws like the GRCs election system which are rammed down the throat of the people against their wishes.<br><br>In area of investments of citizens' funds and entries of government into traditional people's livelihood and businesses, there is a disregard too of the interest of the people. The government unabashly went into competitions in converting its traditional state services to corporatised GLCs to undermine citizens' rights and at the expense of larger interest of the people.<br><br>The outcome of such a system where the W2 are beholden to W1 and the executive has become almost unchallenged and supreme has been general loss of sense of nationhood among the ordinary citizens. There have been dropping of wages, emigration of local talents, higher costs of living of the majority of population and general dwindling of opportunities for the common people.<br><br>If Singapore is to evolve a more effective democracy, it should separate (W1) and (W2) with (W1) and not subject the elected MPs to the tight rein or  control of the W1. The candidates of MPs under W2 should stand for election separately. Candidates for W1 should be elected separated from among those widely acknowledged or known for effective leadership and implementation abilities or those based on assumptions from academic sources or narrow network of connection called grassroot or Young PAP etc.<br><br>In this way W1 and W2 will be given separate mandates to discharge their different roles without tweaking or compromises in the name of leaership, talent or pragmatism which cause high costs of living, dwindling of opportunities of common unnetworked citizens and many problems.<br><br>Certain membership club committee are elected in two slates e.g. SRC (I) Executive Slate - President and Principal Office Bearers like Financial Controller and Game Controller. etc and (II) Non-Executive - Committee Members from whom various subcommittee can still be formed. Committee members are more respected and know how to get certain policies moderated and corrected to prevent long-standing auto-piloting of fixed policies.<br><br>If your idea is accepted it will mean we will evolve to a model of democracy closer to that of the above-mentioned club system with MPs being elected in two categorise:<br><br>(P1) Non-constituent: Executive Slate- President/Prime Minister as Chief Executive plus Principal Cabinet Ministers which can be combined to make them more cohesive body to provide more effective leadership and implementation of policies and decisions.<br><br>(P2) Constituent: Non-Executive Slate - elected with the mandate to serve the larger goals of government e.g. Ombudsman and Municipal interests offering selective hearing of presentations of policies before they are introduced to ensure meeting of larger goals and results with the greatest interests to the greatest number.<br><br>Currently, our W1 is usurping all the functions of W1 and W2 with the MPs wearing two hats so to speak and unable to perform their ombudsman and municipal roles causing many problems like the high costs of living and lessening of opportunities to employment and business.<br><br>W1 could be likened to a runaway zealot who presumes to know everything and will override all other aspects of governance except for acceptance of its own policies and controls. Such a system as can be seen is lacking in competitiveness as witnessed by the groom and sense of helplessness during recent economic recessions with constant denial of problems with loss of people sector of economic competitiveness and solving many common-man problems.<br><br>We should try to evolve to a system of government which is more inclusive one which will serve the larger goals of government (4P) consisting of four components: (P1) Exectuve slate - candidates standing as President/PM/Cabinet Ministers (P2) Non-executive slate - MPs serving as Ombudsman to polish up policies and decisions and implementation so as to produce the greatest good to the greatest number. (P3) - Formed from P1 &amp; P2 (P4) Judiary - appointed by P3<br><br>If we want a more effective democracy which will be more adaptable to change and competitiveness in the globalised world of tomorrow, we should evolve the 4P model of democracy where the office bearers are elected separately from the rest of the MPs who will then be elected with the clear mandate to serve the larger role of government and not as an appendix to the executive. There is an urgent need to produce a system of government to serve the large goals one which will accrue all implementation of policies and decisions to the greatest good of the greatest number.<br><br>The exercise of extraneous powers of the executive or any power base within the executive over the body of MPs would be insidious and counterproductive to our continuous wellbeing and nation buidling.<br><br>It is being achieved without benefits to the masses but only concentration of extraneous power among a few at the top of leadership with constant legalistic wrangling and tweaking of laws and regulations and economic figures without clear accountability or shouldering of responsibility by whoever the power that be.</div>
