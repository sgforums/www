              <p>Abdullah surely knows Anwar has been framed the same way justices were kicked like footballs. Nevertheless he must play his trump card to win. This latest is a trump card because in a way it will cushion against further attack from Mahathir while it will serve to fend off Anwar.</p>

              <p>After reading daily all the "bombshells" reported in the news media, not only are you befuddled but you cannot help but come to the perception of the inability to differentiate  the wheat from the chaff, the sense from the nonsense, the true from the lies, the political chicanery from the political transparency - and the list goes on ........</p>

              <p><strong>PETALING JAYA: A statutory declaration is evidence given under oath
              which cannot be retracted, said a serving judge and several senior
              members of the legal fraternity. They believed private investigator P.
              Balasubramaniam’s act of retracting his initial declaration, which made
              serious accusations against Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun
              Razak, could open the former to perjury charges. According to the
              judge, who is an authority in criminal law, affirming a statutory
              declaration was akin to giving evidence in court. “Under the normal
              rule of evidence, one cannot withdraw it unless he has very strong
              reasons.</strong></p>

              <p>It seems very easy for a ruling party to get rid of an opponent. They are the script writer, movie director, police, judge, anti-corruption authority.
