              <p>Malaysia's opposition leader Anwar claims purported medical report clears him in sodomy case</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><a id="articleLocation" title="Click to view map" href="http://politics.sgforums.com/forums/10/topics/#"><span style="color: #2d648a;">KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia</span></a>:</strong> Malaysian opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim on Tuesday urged police to drop a sodomy probe against him, citing a purported medical report that indicates the accusation was fabricated.</p>
              <p>A copy of the handwritten report, on what appeared to be stationery from Pusrawi Hospital, was posted on two Malaysian news Web sites, Malaysia Today and Malaysiakini. The June 28 report, apparently signed by a doctor who examined the male aide who has accused Anwar of sodomy, indicates no evidence of an assault was found. But the doctor suggests the patient go to a government hospital to get a second opinion and notes that the man intends to file a police report.</p>
              <p>The authenticity of the report could not immediately be ascertained. Hospital officials contacted by The Associated Press declined to comment. A government minister and a police statement did not say whether the report was genuine.</p>
              <p>But Anwar told a news conference that that the report proves that the sodomy allegation — the second against him in a decade — was trumped up.</p>
              <p>The hospital report "confirms our contention that the allegations ... are baseless and politically motivated," said Anwar.</p>
              <p>The new accusation surfaced last month as Anwar became a powerful force in Malaysian politics and said he was poised to unseat the government, which has a slim 30-seat majority in Parliament.</p>
              <p>Anwar urged police to "stop their investigations" immediately, accusing top police officials of being part of a political conspiracy to derail his opposition campaign to end the ruling coalition's 51-year lock on power.</p>
              <p>"I condemn in the strongest terms their negligence, dishonesty and recklessness in humiliating the nation by dragging us all through this vile and filthy charade," he said.</p>
              <p>Sodomy, even between consenting adults, is punishable by up to 20 years in prison.</p>
              <p>The report said the doctor advised the 23-year-old aide to go to a government hospital for a second examination. It is not clear what transpired there, but the accuser filed a complaint at a police station against Anwar the same day.</p>
              <p>A sticker with the accuser's name, age and a bar code is affixed to the top of the two-page report. Handwritten notes indicate the doctor found no anal bleeding, tears or scars. Under "diagnosis," the doctor has written "tro assault (sodomize), advise he go to the gov. hosp. (plan to do police report)." Malaysiakini notes that "tro" stands for "to rule out."</p>
              <p>Some of the notes are illegible. At the bottom, below a signature, the report is stamped with the name of the doctor and hospital.</p>
              <p>A police statement said "all kinds of allegations are floating around this case in the blogosphere. It would not be in the best interest of the police to respond to all these accusations as the case is still under investigation."</p>
              <p>The statement urged people "not to jump to conclusions."</p>
              <p>It also denied Web site reports that the doctor who examined Anwar's aide was detained or asked to change his diagnosis. The doctor's whereabouts are unknown.</p>
              <p>At a separate news conference, Home Minister Syed Hamid Albar only described the report as a "piece of evidence," declining to comment on its authenticity.</p>
              <p>Anwar said he is convinced the medical report is not a fake because the police and the hospital have not denied it is genuine.</p>
              <p>Also Tuesday, Health Ministry Director-General Mohamad Ismail Merican said the details of second medical examination "have not and will not be disclosed to any unauthorized personnel or agency."</p>
              <p>If the report turns out to be genuine, it would bolster Anwar's bid to return to Parliament in a by-election.</p>
              <p>He was barred from contesting general elections in March — when his coalition made spectacular gains — because of a previous corruption conviction in connection with the 1998 sodomy accusation. The ban expired in April.</p>
              <p>Anwar denied both the sodomy and corruption charges but was sentenced to 15 years in prison. The sodomy charge was overturned in 2004 when he was freed after six years in jail.</p>

              sex scandal is always a good bet to get rid of one's political rivals.
