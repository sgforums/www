More than $200 million was spent on SRS. Many former HDB staff joined Surbana with very little pay cut. Some fortunate ones might have pay increases despite very attractive  SRS given to them.<br><br>After July 2003, some departments are created for the remaining Heads of Department (HOD). It appears the new Departments were created to accommodate the former HOD’s rather that the functional needs of HDB. Many functions within the Building Group are not well defined and possibly duplicating  in some areas. It may be better  to collapse into  fewer Departments within the Building Group. On national level there are many duplicating  functions at URA, BCA and HDB. For examples, HDB has BCU which performs the same function as BCA; Research and Planning Department in HDB is similar to URA. Why not make it a one stop service to serve  the public better and at the same time some cost serving?<br><br>There are too many Audit checking , design review and control function performed by HDB nowadays on Surbana. This is due to the overstaff in HDB and to create “ unnecessary” auditing work to justify their existence. Too many audit checking, design review and control function by HBD have caused additional cost to the poor contractors who are already suffered badly by the economic downturn and the material increases.<br><br>If HDB needs to carry out frequent audits, design reviews and con trol functions because Surbana cannot achieve the desired results, then HDB should deduct/reduce the consultant’s fee paid to Surbana. Surbana is being paid too high consultant’s fees and is making  huge profit. It is not fair to other consultants in the private sector. Which consultant is making as much as the Surbana staff? All these are the tax payers’ money. Why is HDB helping Surbana to pass the manpower cost to flat purchasers? Why Surbana  staff are paid  QP allowance when  the works are all normal standard. Depite the high salary cost for Surbana staff, Surbana is still making huge profit. Is HDB and MOF prepared to review the professional fee/ management fee paid to Surbana.<br><br>During the heavy  building period , HDB built some 60,000 dwelling units (DU). To-day HDB builds very few DU’s. However, the manpower on site site supervisors is still very high or very little reduction. Can HDB justify the manpower cost in terms of DU’s and manpower needs. Too many site supervisors are employed by HDB despite the construction slump. All the site supervisors are very well paid and well above the market rate. Why HDB needs to help them again and again after paying them SRS? Many new Poly and University  graduates are suffering from unemployment. Why HDB is paying Surbana or HDB Corp a management fee for the employment of the clerk-of-works? There are other well above market rate management fees paid to HDB Corp or Surbana by HDB. Does it defeat the whole purpose of ‘privatization’?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It took Journalist Lee Han  Shih several months's thorough research on HDB inefficiencies and financial losses to finally convince the government of overstaffing and loss making in HDB.<br><br>Even as the government finally admitted Lee Han Shih's findings, and disbanded loss-making overstaffed former HDB, it did so only by dragging its feet and even went to the extent of paying huge compensation of 45 months' of last drawn salaries and reemploying the retrenched staff in subsequent recorporatised HDB.<br><br>I wonder if any private citizen is able to convince the government again it is second-time wrong in re-formulating HBD with expensive staffing without justifying its existence on ROI.<br><br>My guess it that without a chestful of facts and figures and the detailed analysis and presentations of overstaffing and duplications of functions at Surbana, the government is not going to listen as in the NKF case.<br><br>Without very substantial figures and facts, why would the minister in charge admit any problems. He would wait till there is public outcry or complaint like in PSA and SIA before taking actions.<br><br>For now he would let the taxpayers pay for the losses on Surbana without as after all the monies are taxpayers' monies not the minister's monies.</div>
