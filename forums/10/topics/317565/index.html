              <p>CPF as originally conceived was citizens' retirement nest-egg.</p>
              <p>Through greed to fill government's own coffers, Housing Tax (Land charge of S$80,000.00 per 3-room flat) drained off their CPF.</p>
              <p>Apparently government has lost the zeal in looking after citizens' retirements some time around the beginning of 1970s after Minister Mah has changed the basis of low-cost housing pricing with a double-charge on lands which were already paid for by citizens under taxes from cost-break-even to market-price because of greed (looking with green eyes at the increased balances of citizens' CPF).</p>
              <p>Now Minister Khaw also looks at the CPF and finds that given the CPF balances there is no problem in getting citizens to pay for the increasing medical costs by means of the insidious means testing.</p>
              <p>CPF is now being sucked dry bit by bit. Citizens will not be surpised another minister will soon try to get people to pay more of their other expenses like education fees etc because it is easy to take their monies via the CPF.</p>
              <p>Where is the original retirement planning announced by the government for the citizens now with CPF being treated as easy money to be taken by government bit by bit to enrish its own coffer.</p>
              <p>Where are our talents. What talent do our ministers have to look after our needs and retirements?</p>
              <p>Meanwhile billions of citizens' monies in the surpluses hoarded by the government from over-charging on lands and housing and withholding of spending on taxes collected are lost in Shin Corp, Global Crossing and UBS etc.</p>
              <p>Where is the logic of government ? It is to look after the citizens' needs or show off their own glories or success or paying for their millions-dollar self-rewards.</p>

              <p>The bearable bear,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is no good for karma to sell out fellow citizens' interests to please whoever in power to gain own favor or to tell lies like you are doing about my views on means testing. I never suggested or supported means testing which is a insidious way of over-charging people for their basic needs already paid for by them through taxations and their built-up surpluses.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Read my many posts consistently asking for change to this kind of governing the country which is immoral and evil for the reasons as stated in this and many other posts.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This system of over-taxing and recovering all costs of services including means testing charge employed in the running the government will allow the government to hoard more and more monies and surpluses with all kinds of hidden charges and profiteering through falsely claiming no free lunch or digging into citizens' dwindling savings or CPF is unconscionable and evil.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There is no danger from welfarism but sadly the greatest danger is exploitations of the citizens stifling the economy and demotivating the people.</p>
