            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Bluerray........... Yes there might be agents taking advanatage of the situation and trick the PDMMS to come here to do things like masseur. But the question now is that the PDMMS are coming here to ply an illegal trade that is conducting prostitution under the pseudo of massaging works. The situation is quite serious, if u ever have a chance to go to those neighbourhood area, u will see that many scantily clad ladies are seen in these "massage" shops. If the problem is not serious, SG govt will not go to the extent of forcing those shops to shut down. Yes u may sympathize with ur countrymen, thats for sure, but think along this way, would u allow other country citizens to conduct illegal trade in ur country? Would u be all too happy to see prostitutes loitering at your backyards? When we see news of 'snakeheads' smuggling Chinese citizens to the states, Europe, etc............, can u blame the coast guards of those nations from arresting them? Yes, those illegal immigrants may be suffering back in their home towns and they wish to get a better life in other nations, but must the host nations give them leeway?</div>

Why is it that these prostitues able to thrive here in Singapore? Becos there is a huge demand.

            <div class='col-md body'>Bluerray, I think u got it wrong again, no body did not discriminate or downplay the contribution of foreigners in Singapore........But this PDMMS saga from the start till the end is an attempt to stamp out VICE if u did not know. It just happen that many PDMMS are involved in this trade, thus they are put in the limelight, this was never a campaign to terrorize or harass ur country men ok?! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Blueray I think u stil dun get the issue. The entire saga is to clamp down on illegal activities like prostitution, it so happn that massage trade is the one they are clamping down on, it so happen that many PDMMS are involve in massaging trade, some individuals went on to think Singapore is out to expel all PRC citizens.<br><br>I know thatit is embarassing for a person to hear their own country men not conducting in an appropriate manner in the host nation.

            <div class='col-md body'>Blueray, in response to your argument that sg is swindling the PDMM, I merely highlight it is not one sided. CN also have even more canning people that con SG gahment too. See from both side and you will understand better.<br><br>Whenever you read the news from the cn, read it from their perspective. China consider it as success as they manage to squeeze from a minor controlling stack in SuZhou to major controlling at no cost to their country. Of course it is a success to them at the great expense of sg.<br></div>
