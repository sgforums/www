I fully support our government actions to clamp down on illegal massaging trade. But the problem now is that some forummers here just can't grasp the fact that both parties(foreign prostitues and local men) have to take the blame. They only condemned one side which is immature.<br><br>Another problem which u fail to see is that singaporeans are also guilty of exploiting foreigners which in the end led to these people involved in ileegal sex trade.

            <div class='col-md body'>The logic is like some time back, some illegal immigrants are drown as they attempt to use float and other devices to attempt to swim to Singapore from the sampan operated by snakeheads. Can the family members of the decease claim compensation from the coast guar for "driving them to the extreme?" I believe many already noe the consequences of being caught, as you will be caned and jailed. But you still see throngs of ppl attempting rite? So are you going to blame Singapore for "not giving living spaces for them? To thrive? To work?"<br><br>Due to recent economical success, the coastal regions of China has gain economical success. We do read of news of some girls from poorer regions flocking there to take part in prostitution and are caught by local police. Are you going to write to the People's Daily and complain abt the police for being too harsh on those girls. They are not sympathetic to their economical situation back in their home town? Can you? Does this have any logic? Trust me, if the situation of those seedy "massage parlour, hair saloon" worsen, I believe the police in china would definitely instill in laws to shut them down.<br><br>Lastly, this is just domestic affair, rite?

No pun intended.<br><br></div></blockquote>Your arguements are flawed.<br><br>1) I do not see China students in Stansfield / Informatics having their mums around. What i see is a huge amount of China students in Primary, Secondary Schools and Polytechnics(maybe ?) whose mums tag along.<br><br>2) PDMMs are technically not Tourists, who spend large amounts of money in a few days' stay.<br><br>3) How many of these PDMMs can afford real estates / private properties ? They can't.<br><br>So please tell me how most of these PDMMs contribute to Singapore. Note that China nationals do not equal PDMMs. In fact, these PDMMs would have had enough of locals. Do you seriously think they will recommend their family and friends to tour and spend in Singapore ? Nope.<br><br>You also mentioned that you trust the local media(state controlled) and ideas(from zzdidi) contradicting it, is a big no-no. Kudos to that.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>In fact, i'm waiting to see if these PDMMs and China students scheme (from our ingenious ruling party)even yield results at all.<br><br>The bottomline, as i've said, is <strong>No Money, Don't Come !</strong><br><br>You also mentioned that your friend is hiring PDMMs for his restaurant. Well, this is great. But what happens to their lowly skilled local counterparts ? The local aunties have their pay undercut by these PDMMs and now i see coffeeshops hiring PDMMs who cannot even differentiate between 'Bandung' and 'Milo'.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>What most of the posters are unhappy about, are their ungratefulness towards the SG govt. We made concessions and PDMMs still demand for more. Tell me if there are any Indian PDMMs here in SG.<br><br>There should be requirements for students who seek education in SG. I even encountered students whom i need consistently to translate for, during my time in poly. These students struggle with English and most locals could barely understand their presentations.</div>

My references were directed at the RELEVANT parties. As said by another forumer, there are pdmms who teach mandarin, are they a burden to our society?<br><br>What I am highlighting is that, we should not label singaporeans as evil when pdmms decide to come to singapore nor should we push all the responsibility to singaporeans when these pdmms demand for jobs. Today they demand for jobs, tomorrow they demand for voting rights (since policies affect them), what else will they demand for?<br><br>If you want  to go to another country, make sure you can find a job first. Many pdmms can do it. Many have done it. Expecting the singapore govt to spoonfeed them with jobs, throw money at them and give in to all their unlimited wants is absurd.<br><br>Our govt doesn't even do that for the voters/citizens, do you think they will do it for the pdmms?<br><br>As for employers hiring foreigners, that has been disected to the extreme and is not the main focus of this thread. I'm not worried about losing my job to the pdmms, I'm not very good with my hands anyway.</div></blockquote>Well said!<br><br>From the way these PDMMs' behaviour and the way the China national's arguments on this subject matter on this thread,<br><br>We S'poreans really have to worry of what may hve happened in the future.<br>they will demand for their political rights when they become citizens who will be the doom day of our next generation in S'pore.<br><br>I was in overseas including Brunei for the past 10 years and obey the local laws strictly.Lately. an influx of prostitutes from China on the pretext of tourists not only bring shame to us as overseas chinese and affect also the cultural value of the country people.<br><br>I will bring the matter up to the MPs in our GRC and investigate the root of this PDMMs' saga.</div>
