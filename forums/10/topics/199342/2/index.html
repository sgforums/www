If any gathering of five or more people is to be deemed illegal, applying the rule rigidly, then I'd say that a live football match would be a gross violation of the rule.<br><br>So it all boils down to how they want to apply the rule. They may close an eye to certain gatherings while cracking down on others as they see fit. When you have a rule that's open to interpretation, you have a rule that's open to potential abuse.<br><br>The sensible thing would to be scrap the rule, but then again, I don't suppose the relevant parties would want to scrap the rule considering how it can be used to silence dissent and suppress opposition.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

Irate citizens are not terrorists, this distinction has to be made pretty clear. This law, allows the policeman on the ground to arrest and detain without having to do much in the way of an investigation because it is not required by the particular legal Act.<br><br>This particular law only leaves it open to abuse by irresponsible people in theory, because it is an arbitrary law.<br><br>As I've said, the other laws which are on our Statutes, already take care of real threats to national security.We still have the ISA, which already covers a wide range of threats to internal peace and stability of the nation as a whole. Why the duplication of services?</div>

It showed double standards. Needless to say, there are also other considerations which resulted in this. As said, a lot of international events are happening, and we can't afford to leave a bad impression. Each good impression we create helps to increase our future chances of holding more international events.<br><br>While there is indeed no proof that those are Mr Brown's supporters, there's also no proof that those study mamas are also terrorists.

It makes no sense to leave some space for them in case they want to be a Singaporean again. This applies to their children as well.

That clause about foreigners holding work permit can't marry Singaporeans, is true. However, it applies only to those holding work permits. Once they expire, they have to go back to their home country, renew it or with permission, apply and be a PR here. My guess is that they never applied to be a PR, so that's why their kids aren't given priority. What worsen this situation is that if their kids are not even born in Singapore.<br><br>It doesn't matter if their wives aren't locals, it only matters if their kids aren't locals. That's why differences arise.</div>
