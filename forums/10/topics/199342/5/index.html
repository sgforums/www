Tell us how much have these PRC people been contributing to singapore?<br>So....S'pore, schools like Stansfield, informatics..how much have these school contributed to our economy?  90% came are to work and making money to pay for their school fees.

Obviously for this policy, the implementation is in dire need of review. The processes and procedures associated with this policy are not carried out as what is laid down in the policy I would presume?<br><br>I believe the intention of the policy is good. But through very bad implementation of processes and procedures, we see too many maybe even under-qualified mum+kids coming through and the social problem that came thereafter. Under-qualified can mean education and financial.<br><br>That is why I think a REVIEW of the policy is paramount. And depending on how efficient our gahmen is, let's wait and see if there are any changes.

Although China education do teach English, their standard is still not as good as Spore. Maybe for Chinese, they are way ahead of Spore but I still tink English in Spore is still a notch higher for the time being. This could be one of the draw factors as in Spore we have both English and Chinese. Listening to their English vocabulary and grammer grasp would indicate they are weaker but they are learning everyday neverthless. I presume they will overtake Spore in another decade on English language command and then Spore will no longer be a hot favorite place for those PDMM + kids and hopefully all social problem associated to them will disappear <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
