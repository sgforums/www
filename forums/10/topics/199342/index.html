If you want to grant them jobs, then I say grant jobs to unemployed Singaporeans as well. If you want to come here to make a living, then I say you should do it the old-fashioned way - through hard, and more importantly, [b]honest</strong> labour.[/b]</blockquote>the mata will jz say "oh cos no one made complains... we only act upon complains n tip offs"...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sometimes, it pays to read the NE messages printed in school handbooks.<br><br>"No one owes Singapore a living."<br><br>Since they don't owe, they can leave any time they wish and not to stay here to complain.<br><br>Besides, it's not that they can't get a job in Singapore, technically they aren't even allowed in Singapore without the proper papers. Under the law, they would be illegal immigrants. Singapore has already made allowance to let them stay here and have jobs, and still complain?<br><br>On a sidenote, there could be other reasons why the police is not called in. Quite a lot of embassies are located near the Chinese Embassy. If the riot police is called in, it would alarm them, thinking that something is wrong. It would affect us badly if news got out. Knowing how journalists could actually make a mountain out of a molehill, the government would know better than risking it. World Bank and IMF meeting is coming, we don't need bad publicity now. If the organizers decide to pull out at the last minute, we are at the losing end.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I was really wondering, there are many contract jobs and temp jobs out there, like data entry, clerk and admin personnel. These jobs are not those hard mannual labour, but gd air-con ones. The problem is why PDMMS dun want to take them up? Why choose those massage jobs. I was quite shock when I watch the Channel U talk show on PDMMS, a PDMM actually claimed that she never noe massage jobs are "linked with sleaze" or it is illegal for her to work, she even claim most of her PDMM clicks are doing decent jobs "no one is doing illegal stuff"!!.Funny hor!! She say until machiam like Singaporeans are deliberately picking on them and discriminating them!<br>From my impression, many Chinese are coming to Singapore hoping to study/work and eventually settling down here. Is Singapore govt sending the wrong message that Singapore is a place easy to get PR?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Firstly, the PDMM was cheated into believing that they can find easy employment in Singapore.<br><br>Their agents most probably cheated them of their money when they bring them over and ditched them.<br><br>As for proper job, they are not english educated so they cannot do any desk job effectively and most of them are not as educated as the Singaporeans.<br><br>As for the sleaze trade, the police did not effectively clamped down on the massage parlour as they have not broken any law.<br><br>The massage parlour offers easy money in which they can put to very good use when they exchanged into the china currency.<br><br>They did not intend to settle down in Singapore as they just making use of the free education offered by the policy makers here as a stepping board.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Guys,<br><br>Take it easy lah.  PDMMs are also humans with the same human wants as any of us:  money, companionship, sex, love, power, etc.<br><br>I can understand our protectiveness and disgust at how they approach these objectives sometimes.....but in the end, we're all just being human.<br><br>If we take a step back and review the whole situation, I think there are bigger, more fundamental issues to address (instead of PDMMs).<br><br></div>
