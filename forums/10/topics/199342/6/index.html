Although China education do teach English, their standard is still not as good as Spore. Maybe for Chinese, they are way ahead of Spore but I still tink English in Spore is still a notch higher for the time being. This could be one of the draw factors as in Spore we have both English and Chinese. Listening to their English vocabulary and grammer grasp would indicate they are weaker but they are learning everyday neverthless. I presume they will overtake Spore in another decade on English language command and then Spore will no longer be a hot favorite place for those PDMM + kids and hopefully all social problem associated to them will disappear <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> </div></blockquote>I dont agree with u this is the procedure flawed.<br><br>This PDMMs' issue had been surfaced a few years ago but the authorities had turned a blind eye to the illegal and immoral activities which these PDMMs had carried out , can the authority said they are awaken only  now but   this is  only  minority PDMMs' cases???<br><br>Now,we see 80 plus PDMMs protest at China Embassy and demand FOR JOBS.<br><br>We want to know what criterials that we allow these PDMMs and their child to be selected and admitted to our PUBLIC SCHOOLS WHICH ARE HIGHLY SUBSIDISED BU OUR TAX PAYERS'$.<br></div>

Yes why no change to policy? What are the criteria to admit those china kids + mum etc etc...<br><br>Now if all along this problem has been ard, our local gahmen policy makers really owe us a BIG explanation on why nothing is done to review the policy? They waiting for more deaths to justify a change to policy? Then I will everyday pray for more deaths associated to PDMM to wake them (policy makers) up!!!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

No more election, turn Sg into the Dynasty and rename PM to Emperor.<br>2. All Sgrean male need to serve as Eunuch and Female as maid in the country for 2 years, thereafter require to report back to the palace every year for a couple of weeks to upgrade their Eunuch and Maid skills.<br>3.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by sohguanh:</div><div class="quote_body">My own gut feeling of this current social problem is partly a mis-juddgement on the gahmen authority policy. Their intention was good. They want to get the best or brilliant China young kids into Spore in the hope that as they blossom and grow up, they will stay in Spore and who knows be the future generation of Spore leaders. Something abit similar to import foreign sports talent like table tennis gers.<br><br>The error come in as they set too low a criteria so we see lot's of china mum+kids thronging spore with limited funds brought over. So the one year no jobs is the basis of the amount of money the mum+kids bring to spore. After tat, they gotta work to earn a living as money brought from china is not enuff. Now when they want to work, they face a lot of obstruction as the barriers are set too high!<br><br>So now those mum are in catch22 situation, cannot work so work illegal lor and if say go back to China, they are worried their kids will lag behind in the China education system especially in the Chinese Language stream. It is a dilemma for them.<br><br>So our beloved gahmen in setting the policy indirectly created this mess. Their objective is good but they did not forsee or overlook other areas associated with the policy. Now with so many bad news reports going on, it is HIGH time the policy are reviewed IMMEDIATELY. One year no work is too low a criteria, they should lift it to say 5 years no work. Then this will help to turn away lot's of unaffordable china mum+kids from coming over in the first place.<br><br>Now who says scholars and highly educated policy makers do not make mistake? They make mistake too and their mistake repercussion is wide as they involve lots and lots of pp nation-wide. Compare to say a mistake you make in a company where at most you are sacked and damage is kept within a limited group of ppl as in company and customers.<br><br></div></blockquote>More lame attempts to shore up the political base. Rampant importation of foreign kids to acheive what? Something that the govt threw away in the mid-1980s with their hairbrained schemes that insulted a whole upper-middle class of Singaporeans that they upped and left for abroad.<br><br>Still want to make such a mistake and behave in such a presumptious manner. I really don't know what to say.The person in charge of this PDMM policy, intended or otherwise, owes the people an explanation and he/she better take responsiblility for this mess and step down.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The idea of getting overseas children to come to Singapore to have their education was first mooted in 1998 during the 1997 Asian Economic Crisis, the idea was pushed and exhibited during overseas trade shows in 1999...<br><br>Remembered in 2001, there was an article about a study mum who was engaged in sex trade to finance her son through the primary school education. In the article, it was stated that she was not rich and had to borrow money to come to Singapore, and in order to finance their expenses here and to return debts back, she turned into the vice. All these were done in the convenience of her rented house until the anti-vice unit caught up with her after a tipoff...<br><br>To them, these study mums think it's our government's liabilities to provide them the means of living here, which otherwised. It's their own responsibilities to finance their own livings here... We don't owe them anything and they should do their own self-reflections on which are the options for them rather than whining at their embassy and requesting them to intervene and negotiate for employment opportunities for them...</div>
