            <div class='col-md body'>Sept 15, 2005<br>Hot babe? Such a girl used to be called 'cheap'<br><br>I AGREE fully with Mr Kelvin Lau that 'TV show shouldn't plug premarital sex' (ST, Sept 13). It is confusing for teenagers when, on the one hand, their parents and teachers tell them not to engage in premarital sex or at least delay it till they are more mature and able to differentiate between love and lust, and, on the other hand, some TV programmes are conveying the message that it is 'fashionable' and 'cool' to lose one's virginity at an early age.<br><br>Opening of desalination plant a watershed<br><br>Enlist mosquito's natural enemies to fight dengue<br><br>Hot babe?

So, to qualify as a hot babe, a girl is supposed to have many boyfriends and have had many sexual encounters.<br><br>In the past, we would call such a girl 'cheap' or 'promiscuous'.<br><br>I was shocked when my daughter told me that most of her friends think it is perfectly normal for young women to cohabit and change boyfriends. They also say that these women and their boyfriends do not necessarily plan to marry each other. It seems that cohabiting is just a convenient arrangement for them to meet their needs for companionship and sex.<br><br>I hope that such women are psychologically prepared to face the consequences of accidental pregnancy - either becoming single parents or having an abortion if their boyfriends don't love them enough to marry them or share the responsibility of bringing up their babies.<br><br>Parents naturally want to prevent their daughters from having to learn the lesson the hard way. That's why they object to premarital sex.<br><br>TV producers should be more sensitive to parents' concern. There is enough material elsewhere to corrupt young and impressionable minds.<br><br>Lim Choon Kheng (Mdm)<br><br>----<br><br>I am struck by the 2nd last paragraph, if i have a daughter, would I object to her having pre-marital sxx?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You have to accept the fact that our country is in the midst of "opening up" movement lah. U know singaporean too conservative in the past, now our government want us to "wake up" and "open up", so that we can be more creative and have a more "X-factor" in our citylife.<br><br>Crazy Horse coming soon lah in this Dec, we can expect alot of old uncles open up themselves as well lah. Joo Chiat KTVs also "open up" lah, see many many PRC gals and other foreign talents lah.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Foreign talents are opening up in Chinatown as well. More PRC gals are loitering around Outram MRT on the way to pearl's centre. What about Geylang? too many foreign talents where many locals like to go over to scout for one to find pleasure. I believe Singaporeans are shadowing themselves pretending to be conservative. People just pretend just to attract attention. Such lamers should be stone-throwned to death</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Premarital Sex is a norm for teens from broken family. If your daughter is not brought up well, then such problem would occur. If you ask the question, Such question trigger parents' mind that the person asking such question is a bad parent. That is to say, your daughter is not being brought up properly and is not getting enough attention at home. The girl who bragged about on tv is not bragging at all. She's showing her regrets of doing it with her boyfriend.<br><br>The programme is to let you decide whether is it a right thing or a wrong thing to do before marriage. It's to show you the bane of society. Moronic parents would think otherwise. heartlanders are a bunch of sick morons complaining nonsense.</div>
