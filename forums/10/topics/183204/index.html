            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><span style="color: red;"><strong>Will it kill us to have 20 opposition MPs?</strong> </span></span>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>The Straits Times reported on its front page, 17 March 2006, that the "No.1 concern" of potential Singaporean voters, aged 21-34 was the "cost of living, followed by jobs and housing." [1]<br>One would have thought that's typical the world over for almost all age groups, but it's headline news in Singapore.<br><br>What is unique about the political scene here is that, "about 40 per cent said political freedom issues would influence their vote, compared to 89 percent who said costs would." This was revealed 9 paragraphs down.<br><br>This is unique because in many other countries the question of political freedom is not even a concern. It is enshrined in their constitutions and earnestly protected by various independent institutions. They can take political freedom for granted where we can't.<br><br>Now 40% is higher than I expected. For a population that has often been said to be entirely switched off, this is a large number.<br>However, one voter whom the newspaper quoted may typify the other 60%. "I just want to have a job, have enough money, live in a safe country," Lina Salimah, 26, a restaurant hostess, said. "I will support whoever can promise me that and deliver on the promise." [2]<br><br>While her yardstick may be fair and unremarkable in most other countries with open elections, it isn't really meaningful in the Singapore context.<br><br>First, let's put aside the question whether any government short of a communist one running a centrally-planned economy can deliver jobs and money to every citizen. In Singapore at best our government can only create the optimal conditions for a healthy economy, rather than directly find you a job and send you a weekly paycheck.<br><br>However, our opposition parties aren't even in a position to be an alternative government. That being the case, it is absurd to expect them to make promises about delivering jobs and money in your pockets. So how does one apply this yardstick to opposition candidates when they are in no position to form the next government?<br><br>But if not that, then what other yardsticks are more realistic to measure opposition candidates by?<br><br>Singaporeans need a more sophisticated understanding of where we stand politically, and therefore what choices, realistically, are before us.<br><br>One unique feature of our political landscape is that some 80% of Singaporeans live in government-built flats. Unlike those living in private condominiums who have to form their own management committees and maintain their common areas, the 80% who live in public estates look to the political authorities to maintain the common facilities (e.g. lifts, covered sidewalks, exterior repainting) and oversee sanitation matters.<br><br>As a deliberate measure to reduce the average Singapore voter to myopic small-mindedness, the People's Action Party (PAP) government, from the 1980s onwards, has made each Member of Parliament increasingly responsible for the municipal affairs of his constituency. The implied threat is that the sanitation and upkeep of your housing estate, and thus the resale value of your home, is contingent upon who your MP is. If he is managerially incompetent, or if he is not a PAP man and therefore gets no co-operation from other government agencies, the general condition of your housing estate will deteriorate and the value of your property will fall.<br><br>One has to admit that this has been a rather successful weapon, even if the intentions behind it were less than admirable. It has made voters ever so conservative when it comes to how they vote.<br><br>It has heavily skewed our parliament in favour of the PAP, but also created in many voters' minds the notion that the "right" person to send to Parliament is an efficient estate manager. It does not matter if the man (or woman) has no views on trade globalisation, environmental degradation, educational reform, healthcare or human rights, so long as he can ensure the estate is swept every morning, blown bulbs changed promptly and shrubs pruned, then he's "my man".<br><br>The PAP having made this their selling point for several elections in the past, the result you can see: we have some of the dullest "debates" in one of the world's most emasculated parliaments. Many observers have noted how even the Nominated Members of Parliament ask better questions than PAP members [3].<br><br>Yet, what is seldom realised is that by many accounts, the opposition-held wards of Potong Pasir and Hougang have so far compared creditably with the PAP wards. Even the Straits Times reported that,<br><br>In fact, so dominant is the PAP's association with efficiency and quality that one young voter, interviewed by one of my colleagues recently, had no clue she was living in one of only two opposition wards in Singapore.<br><br>Hougang was so clean and well-run that who else but the PAP could have been in charge, was her assumption.<br><br>-- Straits Times, 17 March 2006, Why PAP's<br>report card is glowing, by Laurel Teo<br><br>So, by this measure, it appears that even if estate management skills is all you want out of your MP, it doesn't mean that the PAP candidate is necessarily the better one.<br><br>The second main area of contact between voters and their MP is when voters want help in their struggles against the bureaucracy. That's where the weekly meet-the-people sessions come in. MPs can advise what help schemes are available for people who find themselves in a bit of a fix, or perhaps write a petition letter to give a little boost to the constituent's case.<br><br>Conceivably, a PAP MP may have more influence over the bureaucracy than an opposition MP. Bureaucrats may take more notice if the appeal letter is written by a PAP MP. Though this may be a fact of life, it would be a sorry fact, for one of the key principles of a democratic state should be the political neutrality of the civil service. They are not supposed to favour one political party over another. To expedite appeals from PAP MPs and turn a deaf ear to letters from opposition MPs would be malignant to the integrity of the civil service.<br><br>Rather than be a reason to vote PAP, this should be cause to watch eagle-eyed the way our bureaucrats do their jobs, in the longer-term interest of Singapore.<br><br>Now let's come back to jobs and the cost of living.<br><br>As I mentioned above, the reality is that the PAP will form the next government. They will be the only ones with the ability to determine economic policies. Asking opposition candidates what they're going to do to secure jobs and lower the cost of living is a moot question.<br><br>But this doesn't mean that whom we send to Parliament has no impact on jobs and the cost of living. What we need to ask ourselves is whether the best possible economic policies come out of a legislature with 84 PAP members (100% of seats), 74 versus 10, or 64 versus 20.<br><br>For many of us, intuitively, we believe that decisions are better when facts, assumptions and rationales are robustly challenged. The most dangerous form of decision-making is when everybody is in group-think mode, combined with too much deference to rank. Nobody dares tell the emperor, as sometimes must, that he has no clothes.<br><br>Yes, ultimately, it's a matter of faith rather than specifics. The opposition candidates can't tell you exactly what questions they are going to ask in Parliament over the next 5 years of the legislature's term. Their role must necessarily be reactive. Nor are all opposition candidates of equal calibre (but then neither are all PAP candidates of equal calibre). The voter has to ask himself: is this particular opposition candidate standing in my constituency more likely to ask searching questions and speak up for my concerns in Parliament than the PAP candidate?<br><br>Because if your MP doesn't speak up courageously in Parliament, he is throwing away your voice. And he is not doing his job to ensure that our government designs the best possible policies.<br><br>In the lopsided political situation that is Singapore, this is the question voters should ask when they cast their votes.<br><br><a href="http://www.yawningbread.org/arch_2006/yax-557.htm" rel="nofollow">Yawning Bread</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I look only one simple things. Can our life be improved immediately as I am short sighted to see anything more than 2 months or a year.<br><br>What is the more important thing to those who stay here and had participle in NS for defending singapore. I would think is decent life, quality paid work. If having talents running the show meant more outsourcing, contract employment and retrenchment. What there for us to ask for a decent life.<br><br>What can upgrading of flat or your town do for you, you sell high and buy high. Imagine if the whole singapore is selling, then whose buying? And no forgotting that there are still a lot unsold flat around. I would say forget about proverty brooming, it's no a poor man game.<br><br>There is an established systems that the way singapore is run. Road - LTA, Police - Home Affair, Army - Defence, Trade - MTI and so on. There are many working talents knowing the way to get thing right and whole hearted committed to serve Singaporean.<br><br>With talents running the show, we singaporean had to show our hand out waiting for the goodies. Worst of all, peoples think that we singaporean will grown to have a habit of expecting goodies.<br><br>Say to said this had and will never happened when our respected MM was running the show and we were living happily under his regime without handout. Do you agree.<br><br>My life and career here is likely to be history, I don't know when is your turn. Good luck to fellow singaporean.<br></div>

Or relief that the money is being channelled to visible assets that are returning a reasonable dollar value from the people who legally paid their due?<br><br>I shudder at the day my taxpayer's money is being used extensively in overseas acquisitions that reap little or no dividends and instead post short-term losses or create negative political implications between nations i.e. Shin Corp, Metropolis and Optus.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by king108:</div><div class="quote_body">Ask yourself a simple question whose money is that? </div></blockquote>My point exactly.

It is only how the money is being used that we should question. If as i mentioned, it simply gets redistributed into upgrading kittys during elections and kept in reserve in other times, can we truly believe the govt when they claim budget 2006 is a generous (if not myopic) package to alleviate the financial burden of the lower-income group?<br><br>Note that Steve Chia, despite being given an unimpressive tirade by some know-it-all ministers, presented some potentially realistic economic data that pointed to funds and figures of the national reserves being manipulated at will, yet our PM and finance minister LHL chose not to answer the suggestions directly; an odd reaction given the PAP's past credentials for taking damaging statements to task with point-for-point rebuttals.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by king108:</div><div class="quote_body">They have their own formation, why follow?

Don't sleep with eye open.</div></blockquote>The real question is why not? The carrot and stick campaign agenda by which the Ruling Party's engine has been running for so long has proven to be a huge hit with the heartlands. So given a radical shift, isn't it natural that the winning party will string along on a winning note? Having a stout 'HEART' is evidently NOT GOOD ENOUGH in the eyes of the Ruling Party, who still pride themselves on paper qualifications and scholarly 'TALENTS'.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by king108:</div><div class="quote_body">At the end of the day, whose money is that? where it originated from?<br>Looking at a superband with a lead singer, while the other superband consists of many solo on their own.

            <div class='col-md body'>The problem is that people tend to associate all the good work with the ruling party and not highlight enough of those raised or done in the opposition wards. And given the few opposition members around, we seldom hear much of what they do or their sacrifices? So, naturally the mindset is that all the good benefits will all be taken away if one voted for the opposition.  But why would it be bad to have more oppositions? If it takes a longer time to come to decisions in parliament, it only means that one is guaranteed that all voices are heard, issues are clearly analyzed. Why is there so much threat in that?<br><br>Contrary to beliefs, having more opposition members will not make things worst; infact, one may have the reverse. Unless, there are ways the system just makes it more difficult for the opposition MPs to serve their wards better? Then, there are obviously problems with this format such that it must be reviewed? From the speeches and media, I seem to get that impression (maybe I am wrong), but wouldn't it be some kind of veiled threat? E.g. if you are in the opposition ward, we wouldn't listen to you, lowest priorities, be stuck in 1980s (and images of gloomy buildings or derelit structures stick out). And going back to the basics, one should ask what are the duties of the MP? To listen to their residents, bring forward a case/issue, and help them solve their problems etc. So, how do we judge the calibre of the mp? Should one be so quick and dead sure that an opposition mp will not be equally or more hardworking and capable than a candidate from the ruling party stable especially the new faces? Sometimes it is not the qualifications or how much tea party one should pass through in order to meet the so called 'stringent criterias', you can still get all sorts of people.<br><br>If it is the genuine care and concern, how one connects with the residents and help them with issues that makes a good mp, does it matter if it was an equally dedicated opposition mp? In this vein, a good mp is one who dares to speak up because there is a pressing issue, and will not mince his/her word or conform for the sake of backlash from the party or  senior members. then, it would seem that the opposition mps have an advantage since he would have less baggage and will do even more to prove his or her worth in helping the residents? Unless the external conditions make it difficult to do so? then, this must be addressed. and is this the real issue? in life, do you give others enough chance and opportunities so that you yourself have an equal chance and opportunity at doing something, whether for yourself or to serve others? maybe it is good to think along this line or one will just be stuck in time, and it will take an even longer time to strive towrads true democracy. it is one thing for a small voice to be heard, and another thing if it becomes accepted and whether things get changed as a result. it is time to share the pie, but who decides? can one make a difference? And howlong would it take for there to be 20 opposition mps in parliament? at the rate it is going, half a century to be very optimistic or maybe not?  Will that be a happy or sad day for singaporeans?<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by king108:<br><strong>Will it kill us to have 20 opposition MPs?<br><br>Fellow BillyBong<br><br>At the end of the day, somehow we have some kind of common understanding.<br><br>However, I am more concern on local immediate issues.<br><br>I read the headling of the article the other ways [b]<span style="color: red;">Will it kill us to have 20 opposition MPs</span></strong>.

So why bother to suggest how difficult it will be running a nation while clearing out crap from entrenched ex-PAP politicials and ministers still with one foot on the gas, adamently refusing to let go?<br><br>The situation for Chaim and Low is already untenable and doubly tough. They make more established MPs and ministers like Lim Swee Sway and Abdullah Tarmugi seem lightweight, considering that neither has actually PARTICIPATED in a REAL ELECTION, having presided in walkovers in the past. We don't even have to mention other nameless armchair neophytes who have never experienced an actual contest, remaining in the shadows of heavyweights.<br><br>A quick but sure example can be Tanjong Pagar GRC. If MM Lee were to retire and no heavyweight is thrown in to salvage the constituency, will the people actually vote in the remaining 4 unknown candidates? Incidently, what have these 4 nameless neophytes done for their constituents?<br><br>Perhaps only a handful of current MPs can claim to have contested an election and actually 'WON'. Lee Yock Suan can no doubt draw strength from his narrow win in now defunct Cheng San GRC. That experience must have been his most rewarding election feeling: like going into a soccer match and winning by the odd goal.<br><br>Will it Kill to have 20 opposition members in parliament? Apparently...to the lightning bolt....yes.<br><br>It would be seen as abject FAILURE and the start of a crumbling decline of an autocratic regime.<br><br></div>

The problem is that PP and HG is so small, winning will bring glory to PAP, but may no be SM personally.<br><br>As a heavy weight member wining a small non-ruling party chief may lead others to consider it's a laughting stock in our singapore history.

We can expect bills amedments to be warmth hearted writen with passion feeling for all singaporean.<br><br>Upgrading topic can no and should no be longer a topic that be used for the debate of future election. If the ruling parties is still thinking of using it, let them use. I think with a proper planned, and no fear all out counter attack.
