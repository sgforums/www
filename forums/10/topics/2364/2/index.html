            <div class='col-md body'>*stretches and yawnzzz*<br>Waahhh.......I didn't know speakers' corner so happening suddenly??  Woahhhh.....Hot siaz!<br><br>Oh well......I see the topic arrrhh...I come in take a look and wala!!!  My eyes nearly popped out man!       <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  Cool it lah ppl.  I will onlie respond with respect to the topic I see and write about how I feel loh.       <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Me Singaporean...... but anti-malaysians??  Nah....if I anti-malaysians, it is equivalent to being anti-human-beings.       :p<br>Hmmmm......  Oh yeah...... I always encounter some weird attitudes whenever I go to Malaysia.  Once I admit that I am from Singapore, the locals seem to treat me with apprehension.  Of course, some Singaporeans may just react instantly and choose to get reallie mad loh.  But then again, has it not occur to us that the reason why we are being treated like that is becoz we treated them the same way?  Oh yeah......talk about contributing to their 'shopping economy'.  I like to go there shop shop at times.  And I open my eyes BIGBIG to see what is happening.  I see many Singaporeans, who are armed with lotsa 'strong' currencies, shopping like kings and queens there loh.  Ohh....I do admire their money power.       <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  But once I see the way these very same Singaporeans treat Malaysians who are serving them hor, I feel ashame.  They treat the locals like some slaves or servants, looking down on them (superiority complex since Singapore is flourishing?).  Woooahhhh.....now tell me, who likes to be looked down upon huh??  Do you?  If we answered 'yes' and swear that we will not react instinctively to those ppl who looked down on us, I think our screw loose leh.       :p<br>That means whatever treatment we give to others, we get whatever treatment in return.<br><br>I just went to KL.  My friend from PJ voluntarily acted as our tour guide for the two whole days we were there.  He is a Malaysian but he is willing to bring us ard loh.  Oh yes!  Who can resist shopping in KL (esp. Sungei Wang)?  I went there and I get different treatments.  Some salesgals just automatically stay away from me once they know I am a Singaporean.  I dun bite but why?       <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  Must be some other Singaporeans 'bitten' them before loh, I guess.  As much as they are stereotyping us, we are also guilty of stereotyping them aren't we?  Then hor......got some salesppl talk to me like I am their friend.  They got a shock when they finally realised I am from Singapore.  But nevertheless, they still con't talking to us.  Why?  Perhaps me and my friends treated them as our equals and they find it weird that we are not locals??  Hmm.....points to ponder....      <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Its not about Singaporeans vs Malaysians loh.  Its about human vs human.       <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">   In our daily lives, the very same thing is happening.  I get ppl looking down at me and I will fight to maintain my dignity.  Sounds familiar huh?  I have many of such experiences.  For example, I am a woman so must be destined to be looked down upon by some men?  So I should 'prevent' myself from instinctively switching on my defense mode and act like a weak demure lady when kena insulted?  Or should I condemn ALL men as a result?  The list goes on and on......  I believe everyone of us have our own stories to relate wat....      <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  heheheaaa.........the same concept applies lah.       <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Or course, within each 'category' of the human race, there are sub-catogories leh.  We have to recognise the fact that within each category or sub-categories, black sheeps exist.  Or sometimes, some ppl are generally nice but act noti and weirdly at times.  We have to make allowances for that occasional outbursts mah.       <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>So....... some Malaysians are farked up doesn't mean all are farked up.  Some Singaporeans are farked up doesn't mean all are farked up.  But we also cannot stop others from forming their own opinions.  So just voice your own opinions loh but hor, before stereotyping others, we should look at ourselves first.  ARE WE QUALIFIED ENOUGH TO GO CRITICISE OTHERS????  If we can swear that we are pure and 100% free of sins, then we go hantum others.       <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  I am still waiting for this day but errrr.....sorrie....hehea....dun think human-beings can be 100% pure.       :p<br><br>Oh well......good and nasty ppl.  We meet them all the time.  What for just becoz of a few nasty ppl, we go stereotype so many others and deny ourselves of potential good buddies?       <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  "NO MAN IS AN ISLAND"  We need one another to live in this world, whether we like it or not (directly or indirectly).  Why should we reduce our chances of survival by 'hantuming' our own human race?<br><br>Whatever that is good now can turn bad one day and watever that is bad now can turn good one day......      <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  Who knows wat is good and wat is bad for definite?       :p<br><br>IRC and forums are just part of the virtual world.  Teasing and 'suaning' here and there is definitely fine (fun wat??).  We can even take a further step and show our anger or views or even discrimination too.  But personal attacks?  Nah.....better not leh, coz not nice mah.  And also, one is onlie qualified to do personal attacks on a person when one oredi knows that person well and has met and communicate with that person before in real life.  Only then there is a basis to criticise leh.       :p  Ehh.....since when sgforums become flaming ground?<br><br>O.kee ler......I think I have given my two cents worth.  Dun flame me leh, coz I am just a 'Lao Char bo' trying to voice her thoughts loh.       <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Good luck to allzzz....      <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>I aM WhO I aM,<br>ItS iMpOsSiBle To bE aNy MoRe Or LeSs......<br><br>[This message has been edited by TinDonGal (edited 18 August 2000).]</div>

Will a nice person being flamed by so many people after 2 posts? From my point of view, he is definitely not a nice person.<br><br>You yourself better go see carefully who is the person started calling names. Who started using provocative words?<br><br>Yes I keep using the word pig. 1st place I didn't know he is a non-Chinese. Further more flaming a person you still expect me to use nice words? I not a kind buddha! I wouldn't be kind to people who post offensive words.<br><br>Don't talk to me about what human degrading yourself themself etc etc. Just look who is the person who started all this.<br><br>Don't look at the surface what do you expect us to do? E mail him and ask him? Ask him out to talk to him? Wake up! Many things we are unable to go deep into many issue. If he will to post the reply in a proper ways, do you think others will flame him?<br><br>It spark off his patroism. Don't forget his replies also spark off our patroism. Am I wrong to defend our country in this case?<br><br>He cannot counter? You read carefully how he rebute all the post against. He is all alone? You know why he is all alone? That is because he posted something against the majority. Just like many things in the world. You can't expect everything to go your ways. You have to accept it as a fact of life.<br><br>Than how you think it is fair? He can said what he like, so are we. In this case do you mean only he can express his point of view and we can't? We all share common view point and go against him.<br><br>I also wish to settle things peacefully with you. But now I don't see the need. FUCK YOUR MOTHER CHAO CHEE BYE ANGELDARK! This is in return to you. YOU NOT HAPPY TRY CHALLENGE ME!<br><br>Let me tell you small kid, you better wake up. From what I know about you from your post. You are a arrogant fool who keep thinking highly of yourself. You desprise all those kopitiam 1 liners. You post things like "listen up" etc etc. This is a forum and it is open to all. Don't think just because you register earlier means you can be bossy around.<br><br>You are only looking at the point of view of him. You are not looking at things in a general point of view at all. Just like what naivegirl said about you in the other post in chit chat.<br><br>Ask yourself this question:<br>1. Why did he post this 2 posts?<br>2. Why are there so many people against him?<br><br>If you continue to stick to your dreamland, so be it. I can debate with you all the way.<br></div>

Pls kindly go update leh.<br><br>No one is wrong here.  Everyone has a right to assume some online indentity or voice out their thoughts or something.  Its just that we must also make allowances for mistakes at times and not just jump on the wagon with blazing torches.  Comeon ppl.....can chill or not??

But pls note that there are reallie lamers out there who just sieze the opportunity and turn the whole thing into a big mega racist thing.  If we choose to get angry and start bombing again, we are onlie helping these lamers ascend in their quests to 'hyber-rasicm'.  Go check out how many racism posts that have been appearing since this unpleasant incident.  This is how politics work isn't it?  Just some smart-alecs who make use of some chaotic situation in their favour.  Do we wanna be some tools to these ppl?  I would answer a big 'NO'.    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>If we reallie wanna discuss this Singaporean vs Malaysian thingy, we should do it diplomatically.  There should never be any personal attacks or stereotyping.  Dun becoz of a few ppl then go condemn the whole group.  Or.... dun becoz of a person's mistake and go condemn the person forever.<br><br>All these condemning will onlie spark off many other things and the vicious cycle goes on and on.  Wats the point?

If a person do not have this mentality, he wouldn't have posted something like that. A person need to answer for what he posted.<br><br>I am not a forum regular, I never met anyone of you here before. I have nothing to lose out. However I believe most of the regulars here have met each other before. It is also not good to know someone among you all  being flamed.

What will be the impression he gave him?<br><br>I accept your apology and at the same time I am also willing to apologise to you for my ruddness. It is also very wrong for me to scold you in the first place when you didn't do anything wrong and worst of all saying you arrogant.<br><br>Hereby I take it as the problem between us is settled.<br><br>And the problem between me and snafu is more or less settle in chit chat.

            <div class='col-md body'>This is a reply to Watchdog.<br><br>Very intersting writing. Good to see so many points. I will try to answer/refute as many of them as possible. I lived 5 years in Singapore, 7 years in Australia, 18 years in Malaysia so I have some idea of what I am talking about. I agree with some, disagree with many. But in the end, please continue to be civil.<br><br>Jealousy against Singapore by Malaysia. You feel that Malaysia is jealous of Singaporean success in building solid economic status. You feel that Singapore was implicated by Malaysia over CLOB issue. Let me put another spin to it. How about the Ringgit based fd accounts? During the height of the crisis, lots of Malaysians were "attracted" to singapore to park their ringgit in fixed deposit account by Singapore banks offering higher than normal interest rates. The banks then could use the ringgit to short sell it. What then? Jealousy? Friendship? Private business deal? You have to plug the hole. Lucky the Malaysian government did not label the people who sent the ringgit to Singapore as traitors and profiteers.<br><br>Agree that instead of healthy competition that it turned out to detest. Reason, higher level people talk about healthy competiton. Lower ranks and worker bees see it as "breaking their rice bowl"<br><br>In terms of politics, BOTH countries are not a model of human rights etc. Singapore has not helped its opposition in any way. Lots of Singaporeans have NO CHOICE but to vote for PAP as the opposition is not credible. Not only that, PAP has made it their decision to reward estates that are pro-PAP while neglecting those which are not. I live in Marine Parade so I know what it is like to be blessed!<br><br>Agree that Malaysian politicians have lots more to do to improve their act. However, politicians are responsible to the voters who voted them. In Malaysia, not all the voters live in the city. So the city folk are often unable to get the best benefits of policy as some have to help the rural and less educated folk. Price you have to pay if you live in a REAL COUNTRY and not a city.<br><br>In Singapore, there is already lots of friction between HEARTLANDERS and the COSMOPOLITIAN sides. Both are right. But from what I see, the HEARTLANDERS are not getting an equal voice in their needs.<br><br>As for riches, please note that Singapore is rich ONLY because of its neighbours and NOT THE OTHER WAY ROUND. Its purpose is to exist to service the multinational's goods into the region. If the region goes down, so does Singapore. They have food and water. We don't.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This is a reply to Watchdog.<br><br>Very intersting writing. Good to see so many points. I will try to answer/refute as many of them as possible. I lived 5 years in Singapore, 7 years in Australia, 18 years in Malaysia so I have some idea of what I am talking about. I agree with some, disagree with many. But in the end, please continue to be civil. I am writing based on my conscience as I have done some acts against Malaysian interests during the crisis as part of my job.<br><br>Jealousy against Singapore by Malaysia. You feel that Malaysia is jealous of Singaporean success in building solid economic status. You feel that Singapore was implicated by Malaysia over CLOB issue. Let me put another spin to it. How about the Ringgit based fd accounts? During the height of the crisis, lots of Malaysians were "attracted" to singapore to park their ringgit in fixed deposit account by Singapore banks offering higher than normal interest rates. The banks then could use the ringgit to short sell it. What then? Jealousy? Friendship? Private business deal? You have to plug the hole. Lucky the Malaysian government did not label the people who sent the ringgit to Singapore as traitors and profiteers.<br><br>Agree that instead of healthy competition that it turned out to detest. Reason, higher level people talk about healthy competiton. Lower ranks and worker bees see it as "breaking their rice bowl"<br><br>In terms of politics, BOTH countries are not a model of human rights etc. Singapore has not helped its opposition in any way. Lots of Singaporeans have NO CHOICE but to vote for PAP as the opposition is not credible. Not only that, PAP has made it their decision to reward estates that are pro-PAP while neglecting those which are not. I live in Marine Parade so I know what it is like to be blessed!<br><br>Agree that Malaysian politicians have lots more to do to improve their act. However, politicians are responsible to the voters who voted them. In Malaysia, not all the voters live in the city. So the city folk are often unable to get the best benefits of policy as some have to help the rural and less educated folk. Price you have to pay if you live in a REAL COUNTRY and not a city.<br><br>In Singapore, there is already lots of friction between HEARTLANDERS and the COSMOPOLITIAN sides. Both are right. But from what I see, the HEARTLANDERS are not getting an equal voice in their needs.<br><br>As for riches, please note that Singapore is rich ONLY because of its neighbours and NOT THE OTHER WAY ROUND. Its purpose is to exist to service the multinational's goods into the region. If the region goes down, so does Singapore. They have food and water. We don't. A lot of Singapore's policies are predetory. We steal business from Malaysia and Indonesia. What? How about the port? Their telecommunications? The airlines?<br><br>Port .. no surprise that when Malaysia built a port in Johor, singapore expects growth in its shipping business to not grow so much in the coming year? Why? The Malaysian manufacturers now can use the port in Johor instead of Singapore. So expect to lose the malaysian cargo back to Malaysia.<br><br>Airlines? SIA offers cheaper flights for KL-Sin-SF than for Sin-SF. What is this? Stealing. We started it, they followed.<br><br>Telco? Do you know we offer cheaper IDD rates than Telecom Malaysia? SO we sell our ICC cards and prepaid cards QUIETLY in Malaysia EVEN when we do not have a licence to do so and it is ILLEGAL to do so.<br><br>What about raw materials? If Malaysia and Indonesia stop selling food and water to Singapore, there will be no growth here as well as IMPORTED food will cost more (compare Aussie Port to Malaysian pork) and reduce economic growth by at least 2-3%<br><br>Water? If Malaysia bottles the water and sells it to INDIA, it can make more profit, so do you think that we are paying a "fair" price for the water? As for treating the water, they will stop buying treated water by 2003. See. Fed up with us keep on saying that we are fair and they are mistreating us.<br><br>As for Malaysian politics? Donno much so no comment. You are right about all those.<br><br>As for economy, I have to refute all your arguments. In business, there is no friend. That is true. BUT when national interests are at stake, you do things differently. For the sake of friendship. What happens if the country goes bankrupt and people are rioting on the street when your economy collapese? You sit still and still let your neighbouring country short sell your money? No. You should stop providing food to them. Let them starve. Did Malaysia stop all the trucks from bringing food into Singapore? Did Malaysia stop water? Did Singapore help Malaysia during the crisis or did it adopt a business as usual stance EVEN THOUGH BUSINESS WAS NOT USUAL? Some friend we are.<br><br>In terms of military, we may be the best in the region. But how can that help us in a siege? If the population (not government) of Malaysia and Indonesia hates us, we had it. they stop selling food and water. The chinese in Malaysia have as much influence in India, China, HK and Taiwan as us here in Singapore. Anyway, what use to have the best if they do not plan to invade but just make enough trouble in their home country that ships do not dare pass through the region? Flights are canceled? What can we do? Singapore exists if there is peace in the region. If there is trouble, defending Singapore is not enough as the population will still have need for power (fuel imported) food (imported) water (imported)Money (no business no money) so it will collapse.<br><br>As for facts and figures? Please do not kid yourself. I have manipulated lots of statistics to suit our needs. Being open? The Singapore business is not as transparent as we like to think. Its just that we have lots of patriots who love to spew forth facts and figures without bothering to find out who is the source.<br><br>Singapore should be grateful to the PAP. Without it, Singapore will be a very depressing place to live in. No car (can't afford COE) no garden (flat only) No public political voice (that's why we have a forum) etc.<br><br>Just hope that you can think a little about our utopia before you slam Malaysia. In Malaysia, a 25 year old guy can own a HOUSE and a car. By 30, he has fully paid for the car. By 40, the house. He can travel all over his own country.<br><br>For us, to stretch our meagre funds, we go to JB for food. We travel all over the world for holidays (why?) We have to get a COE for a car, we have to buy a HDB flat. Do you know how much pressure working in Singapore compared to Malaysia or Australia?<br><br>For what? Just so that our GDP growth is 10% (Malaysia is 7%) I think that we should enjoy what we have, be less proud and make friends. The average Malaysian Chinese will welcome us if we are more humble. Start with them. Once we can feel that there is no fear, the malays will then be ok with us.</div>

Freedom of speech is being allowed to speak what you want publicly except those of slander and insults. I am sure we are allowed to voice out our opinions in Singapore but, whether the leader accept it is another issue. Accepting or not accepting opinions is not call freedom of speech. When you say about Malaysia have different parties, does Singapore not have them? Of course, it is a fact that Singapore is control by one major party, PAP.<br><br>Don't mind if you state where is your source? Discussion? Where? When? How do you know? That is a little too vague and again, your "story" has of no concern with freedom of speech.<br><br>Thank you and nice day.<br></div>
