              <p>Not many people actually bother to suss out every case there is.
              They're more likely to help whatever comes to their attention
              first, and it's usually because of publicity or proximity. How is
              it possible to say whether that is right or wrong?</p>
              <p>We don't have enough money to help every single person in need
              in our society and in our world, but as long as it's a genuine,
              sincere case, why do you need to justify helping another human
              being over another? Even if you don't divide up your contributions,
              you may not be able to save the one person whom you choose to help,
              but does it matter if you know you tried anyway? But to justify it
              using racial and national lines is just cynical. One could be even
              more cynical, and say that helping any human will only do the
              environment more harm, but I shaln't go there.</p>
              <p>Let's not judge him based on the likelihood that he's a bad
              apple. If someone knows him personally and can vouch that he's been
              anything other than an honest student, fine. However by letting
              this fuss go public and grow out of proportion, I think we've only
              done our collective image more harm than good. I hope the media can
              cover at least once how much he's received thus far.</p>

              <p>yeah, perhaps it's cynicism at work on my part, and you got it exactly right when you said people are most likely to help whoever comes to their attention first, maybe it's an instant dose of do-good-feel-goodism ... and of course, there is nothing wrong with giving money to a genuine case ....</p>
              <p>However, again, I'm saying that since we are all of limited resources, shouldn't we think further about who our money go to, first ? .... maybe it sounds politically incorrect to say it, but I think it's a basic precept to take care of one's own first before casting the net wider ...</p>
              <p>note that I have not once ranted at him for his race or nationality ...... not once in this entire thread, other than the references to him being a foreigner .... (for those who are a bit slow, the blue fonts are from the newspaper article  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif">) But I strongly believe in taking care of Singaporeans first .... because if we don't ... no one else will .... certainly not other foreigners ....</p>
