              <p>as this thread goes on..it goes to see so many singaporeans are so ugly..helping a life now only means if hes from singapore. a coin to help 2 distress people.yet the coin goes to the one that is from the same country yet not to the one more deserving.simply beautiful to how compassion can be nowadays. to those who says they are being leeched dry by these foreigners..aint you already used to being leeched by your leaders day in and out just to fill their already fat wallets?rather than being leeched dry by the not so useful leaders, isnt it better to use the $ to help deserving people?</p>
              <p>80k is not enough.that poor bugger needs more than 300k to continue his miserable life.</p>
              <p>to those that defended his cause,lets hope that you really donated and not just to be a moral hero here.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Given a choice, would singaporeans wanna be leeched dry? Come on, Do I need to spell that out for you? Open your eyes. I seriously wonder who is trying to be the moral hero here.</p>
              <p>By being leeched dried by our leaders, does that mean that we should also be leeched by foreigners as well? Getting leeched by one party is a whole different thing from getting leeched by two parties. If $80k is not enough, just go to any hospital and interview the people there, How many of the people there are debt-ridden because of their illness? Look at the poor people in Singapore, how much allowance do they get per month? Like the government said, They will provide 2 meals per day and poor family has to worked for their last meal. Shouldn't such a concept be used in such a case as well? It is also a matter of life and death. A family can consist up to 4 or 5 members. Would you save 5 lives or just 1?</p>
              <p>So seriously, why don't you put your mouth where your money is and stop trying to being all morally-upright when you're not very smart?</p>

              <p><br>It all started out as a thought, as it is said "A donation is not an obligation". From the point someone singled him out as a Ah Tiong, many self-righteous people started to take it out of context and this further fueled by the local papers</p>

              <p>Then you are assuming the worst.. how valid is that ?</p>
              <p>China is no longer the same old poor and dirty China you believe
                  to be.</p>
              <p>And their healthcare services are not as sub standard as you
                  think.</p>
              <p>In their country..as long as you have money.. you can live like

              <p>And you are assuming he will have no Internet connection in
                  China ? Trust me, they are not as backwards as you think.</p>
              <p>If he can keep up with school work through the internet..he can
                  keep up with schoolwork anywhere in the  world.</p>
              <p>The only problem he will face IF he goes back to China.. is that
                  he will not be able to get any EXIT visa out of that country that
                  easily due to his medical condition.</p>
              <p> Please.. out of 1 billion.. don't tell me he cannot get
                  even 1% to donate $1 to help him out ?</p>
              <p>Since we don't know if he had already tried.. how do we know if
                  he really don't have the money to keep himself alive ? Arn't we

              <p>I'm well aware that they don't have shabby medical facilities in some cities, but we don't know which part of the country he comes from. Even if the regional paper publishes an appeal, we don't know how much that can garner. And if you'd read carefully, I said he CAN stay in touch online. I wasn't assuming the worst of everything, when neither the supporters or detractors know much (see following paragraph). Is our objection to their appeal based on "they choose to be treated here, so they should fork out their own money", or "they choose to be treated here, when the resources could be allocated to another Singaporean", or both? Or is it based on something else?</p>
              <p>The e-mail that was circulated stated that his folks are 'a power plant worker and a housewife', and that his symptoms surfaced 3 months ago. Objectively speaking, it's a tad sensational and it answers too few of the questions that we might have about the background of his case. It doesn't answer the above questions, or why he can't fly back. I concede that much and it's fine by me if one criticises another for not being more discerning. My beef though, is with lumping him too quickly with the sorry examples that we meet, which is what has happened or has been portrayed to have happened.</p>

              <p>Singapore's small population has it's fair share of needy citizens.</p>

              <p>IMO, we need to look at whether the people involved deserved our help or not.</p>
              <p>Look at the recent 2 cases:</p>
              <p>1) Huang Na case.</p>
              <p> I dun understand why Singaporeans need to donate to Huang Na's parents. It is not as if they cannot take care of themselves. In the end, they used the money to build a bloody house in China. They do not deserve our help. However, if it is Huang Na's parents got murdered and she is all alone in the world, I will definitely donate.</p>
              <p>2) The man who committed sucide on MRT tracks.</p>
              <p>In this case, his family(wife and two young sons) are unable to take care of themselves financially and deserved our help. In a report, the wife said " she will use the donation thrifty and will leave the main bulk as her two sons' education expense."</p>
              <p>Of course, I am not adovcating commit sucide as an easy solution to financial/poverty woes.</p>

              <p>Please understand and get into your mind that it was never the duty of the poodles to take care of any needy as it will leech off their million dollar salary. "NO FREE LUNCH !"</p>
              <p>The reason why we have so many scholars in NTU cos they are being sponsored by the poodles using peasants money so that they can later "contribute" to the economy as the peasants have stopped making babies.</p>
              <p>The reason why the people are so disgusted about such a method of fund raising is that it is VERY EFFECTIVE as the people are generally easily influenced and followed blndly after being fanned by the media.</p>
              <p>The charity matters is further polluted by durians and monks that have severely crippled the trust of the people.</p>
              <p>With the media getting into the act, the matter will get further complicated.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>I think its natural Singaporeans feel resentful towards the PRCs. This resentment is built by PRCs getting free scholarship and lodging when a Singaporean of similar capability is saddled with loans. The PRCs do not having to serve NS when local bred Singaporeans have to serve in the army. And if the PRCs have stayed backed and contributed to the country, maybe Singaporeans would not have been so resentful. Most of them just use Singapore as a stepping stone to other countries while a small fraction stay and become a Singapore Citizen. I bet the situation would have been very different if the student was a Malaysian.</p></div>
