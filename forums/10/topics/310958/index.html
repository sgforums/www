              <p>A foreign scholar chap in NTU caught leukaemia and couldn't afford the fees ... some chaps started a donation drive ..... but many says they'll not donate .... would you ?. ...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">A FIRST-YEAR Nanyang Technological University (NTU) student is
                                  suffering from leukaemia and his parents cannot afford his chemotherapy
                                  sessions. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">So someone starts a donation drive to raise money to help the ailing student. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">Instead of rallying to help, several Singaporean netizens pour scorn on the student on a local online forum.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">
              
              The reason: The student is not Singaporean, but a Chinese national.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">One netizen even set up a poll asking fellow users to vote if they should support the donation drive.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">The result: Close to 80 per cent of 120 users who responded so far said they would not donate.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">It began with a mass e-mail by Lim Si Wei, the students' services
                                  executive of the NTU students' union, appealing for donations for Mr Li
                                  Bingbing, 18, who was diagnosed with blood cancer two weeks ago.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">The e-mail made its rounds on the Internet over the past week.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;"><strong>CAN'T AFFORD TREATMENT</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">It stated that his parents, a power plant worker and a housewife,
                                  cannot afford his chemotherapy sessions, which are estimated to cost at
                                  least $150,000.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">The family's monthly household income is said to be about $900.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">The NTU students' union decided to help their fellow student.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">The e-mail found its way onto popular Internet forum
                                  hardwarezone.com, and there was an outpouring of controversial comments
                                  regarding Chinese nationals in Singapore.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">Forum user 'gaul_ads' called such students 'thick-skinned'.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">'They've already used our money for a scholarship. Do they still
                                  want to use our money for an operation? It's ridiculous,' he said.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">Another forum user named 'moonlight' wrote: 'Just order them to book
                                  the first flight out of Singapore. They can just settle their problems
                                  somewhere else.'</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">Some forum users adopted a business-like stance.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">'He just comes here to study and uses Singapore as a 'stepping
                                  stone'. After that, he'll go back,' a forum user called 'shawntyg'
                                  said. 'I won't donate. I admit I'm selfish. But isn't he too?'</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">These forum users, however, said that they would readily donate if the person in need had been a Singaporean.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">'We will help and donate to sick, old and poor Singaporeans.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">'But Ah Tiongs can forget about it. They are good in exploiting and leeching,' a forum user called 'danny' said.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">'Ah Tiong' is a common Hokkien term for Chinese nationals here, not unlike 'ang moh' for Caucasians.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">However, not all the forum posts were negative.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">A forum user with the nickname 'diablo80' provided a more
                                  humanitarian response: 'Be it a Singaporean or foreigner, if someone in
                                  need is in front of us, how can we leave him alone?'</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">Miss Patricia Choy, 18, who also posted on the forum thread, wondered if the student had medical insurance.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">'We should donate to someone in need regardless of his nationality.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">'However, it's hard to make sure foreigners would not take advantage of the kindness and goodwill of Singaporeans,' she said.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">According to the circulated e-mail, Mr Li was diagnosed with leukaemia on 29 Feb.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">It said that 50 per cent of his bone marrow had been infected.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">The e-mail said that he may require another $180,000 for a bone
                                  marrow transplant if his condition did not stabilise after chemotherapy.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">The NTU students' union has organised a campus-wide donation drive,
                                  from yesterday to today, to 'help defray part of his medical costs'.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">'This drive was organised with no incentives whatsoever other than
                                  to help a friend,' a student from the union, who declined to be named,
                                  said.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">Miss Menal Prakash, a fourth-year NTU computer engineering student,
                                  said she had seen students queueing up to donate in the canteen
                                  yesterday afternoon.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">A spokesman for NTU's Student Affairs Office verified that it had
                                  approved the donation drive and said this wasn't the first time one had
                                  been held.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">She said: 'To the school's administration, every student is the same. If someone is in need of help, we'll try our best to help.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">'It's fine if people don't want to donate, because these donation drives are always voluntary.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">'But it's not right if it's solely because the student is not from Singapore.'</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">Undergraduates contacted by The New Paper also had more charitable responses.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">Miss Richa Ahuja said: 'I think I would donate if I could. It doesn't matter to me whether he's a scholar or where he's from.'</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">Mr Ben Teo, 21, agreed: 'It's someone's life we're talking about. Of course, I'll donate if they approached me.'</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">The New Paper could not reach Mr Li for comment.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">But some Singaporeans were indignant about the forum users on his behalf.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">Miss Ahuja said: 'I think they're absolutely heartless.'</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">Miss Prakash, however, thought that donating was a 'very personal thing'.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">'It's up to the individual. I don't think I'd judge them,' she said.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">Miss Su Xiaoting, 18, who suffered from lymphoma in secondary school
                                  but has since made a full recovery, felt the benefits of such donations
                                  went beyond just money.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">'Such help is an indication of moral support from friends and strangers,' she said.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">Personal and family friends had donated money to her. 'It was a
                                  tangible way of showing that they were there for me and wanted to help
                                  me,' she said.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">Mr Eugene Seow, executive director of Touch Community Services, had
                                  this question: 'Is this student not a fellow human being that we would
                                  like to help?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">'Foreigners in our land are a benefit to our nation whether they
                                  come as workers or people with talents and expertise. We should treat
                                  them as people here to contribute.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">'Our treatment or attitude to them reflects our attitude towards society as a whole,' he said.</span></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Would I donate ? ... personally, I won't, not because I'm not a compassionate person, but because I think I should prioritize my very limited charity dollars and think carefully about who I donate to ....</p>
              <p>there are plenty of poor Singaporeans who ran out of Medisave and savings after contracting illnesses just as severe, in Singapore, the land of high costs, the poorer Singaporean cannot afford to fall sick at all ..... I'd save my charity dollars for them ....</p>
              <p>and I don't think Singaporeans are not compassionate, or heartless, but this is simply a reaction and a gauge of the goverment's "wide open doors and take in all and sundry" policy on the ground ... Singaporeans are thinking that if they don't take care of their own, no one else will, certainly not from the goverment, who seems to treat foreigners better than her own.</p>
              <p>the chap's here on a Singapore goverment scholarship ... I find it hard to believe that the goverment didn't arrange insurance for him as well, to "protect" their investment, or their were intending to write him off as a "bad investment" ? .... why did it have to come to the stage where they have to solicit for donations from the singaporean public ? ....</p>
              <p>I feel very sorry for the chap, and I'll pray for him, but I won't do more, for my wallet is limited, and I believe in "taking care one's own and home before venturing outside"... I think certainly though, that if there wasn't such a strong discontent on the ground for the goverment's "foreign talent" policy, things would certainly have been different for this fellow ....</p>
              <p>so before you flip open your wallet, take a walk around the "class C" wards of any public hospital ... I am sure you can find plenty of poorer Singaporeans, who've slogged and slaved here all their lives, equally, if not more, in need of your money ...</p>

              <p>I will not say that donating to a leukaemia-stricken foreign scholar is an act of misplaced charity, because in the end, you're still helping someone in need. Singaporean, PRC, Russian, Martian.... in the end, helping someone in need is still a worthy act.</p>
              <p>Just don't neglect your fellow Singaporeans in doing so. Don't give your money to this fella only to forget all about fellow Singaporeans who suffer just as much (or probably even more) than he does. Help him if you can, but don't forget about your brethren either if you do.</p>
              <p>To me, what construes misplaced charity is all those offers to help that NUS China 'scholar' pay his fine because he hacked into a school system to find out his A Level grades (anyone remember that case?).</p>
              <p>Helping a leukaemia patient is one thing, but to help a crook is another.</p>

              <p>Irregardless of a person's race or nationality, in my opinion, the student came from lower rung of the society and was awarded the scholarship based on his own merit. Unfortunately, he discovered the illness during his stay here. I believed it is only fair if we render aid to him purely based on compassion on individuals and our graciousness as Singaporeans.</p>

              <p>go find out from friends who are social workers, or, like I said, just go troll through the "c" class wards of any public hospital .... sob stories are everywhere ..... and I mean home grown ones ....</p>
              <p>if you'd still donate, I say, good for you ... I hope to be rich enough to one day help the poor and starving in africa too ... but I'd not go on a knee jerk reaction just because the chap got publicized in the media and flip out my wallet right away ..... there are plenty of home grown cases getting the short end of the stick from the system that's more deserving of my currently limited charity dollars ... home grown cases who's not on goverment largesse ....</p>

              <p>I wonder if you have read any of my arguments at all ... but it's alright ... now you can pat yourself on your back and feel good about being an unbiased and compassionate person ....</p>
              <p>am I sowing discord ? ... for saying that there are plenty of Singaporeans in equally dire situation and that Singaporeans' compassion should be focused closer to home first ?. ... </p>
              <p>in anycase ... so how much are you pledging to the chap ? ....</p>

              <p>it doesn't matter if i reveal to you if i pledge or not. when you are incoherant, u digress and make it like i am the problem or what have i done. it really doesn't matter.  </p>
              <p>i am merely replying to your rhetorics about this and that and about 2 equally deserving patients and what not.</p>
              <p>i am biased and compassionate, not unbiased.</p>
              <p>so, what then is your intention of this thread? it is exactly your point, "....before you flip open the wallet...". so even in a room full of class c sinkaporeans, what is your point? be mother theresa? it doesn't even solve the problem. u r just sowing discord.</p>
