              <p>Like I said, I'm glad that the spirit of compassion is alive and well among Singaporeans .... maybe we are not such a basket case after all .....</p>
              <p>but all I ask .... is that you think a bit further and weight in on the case a little further .... think of who would deserve the limited charity dollars in your wallet, before you flip them out to the first case that tugs your heart .....</p>
              <p>would your choice be any different if there were Singaporean patients in equally dire straits ? ... what if I can pull out one ... just one ... example ... would your money go to her instead ? ..... or is it a case of out of sight and out of mind ... because other people in equally wretched straits are out of sight and out of mind ? ....</p>
              <p>so go on and be sanctimonious about is and blast me if you like ... but it's clear cut to me to who my money shall go to ....</p>
              <p>and also ... remember to put your money where your mouth is ....</p>

              <p><br><span style="color: #339966;">I agree with u on this part. It's because in this world i seen alot of despicapble ppl. I can't trust ppl easily and i find it that if u treat ppl nice, they won't b gratitude to u in future. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #339966;">U won;t gain any thing if u are being nice to ppl. </span></p>

              <p>no worries, bro. we are all unique. imagine if we are all the same, same good heart, same this, same that. life here would be so boring. i guess for as long as you are happy wif the way you are even as you try to be better as you grow, i think we can all live and let live.</p>
              <p>i have a lot of shits in me as well, it is just that i have the comfort of the the computer screen to `hide me in'</p>

              i think the main question is not whether to help him regardless of his antionality but rather why help him and not others.
              
              why not help other pple with such illnesses instead actually i don't like to donate to such publicised pple because most of the time they get way too much in excess of what they need.
              
              one interesting question assume we have 2 pple 1 singaporean and 1 china national. both with this same sickness. you have in your possession this extra capability to help 1 of them, if we divide it by 2 it won't help either. and there are no other alternatives or sources. who would you help? assume ceterus paribus

              <p>i dunno why need to justify donating money seriously.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I think the people who truly feel compassionate about humanity will donate regardless of nationality, cos heart before head.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and those who would place nationality BEFORE humanity - won't donate REGARDLESS cos think too much liao, hand havent go into pocket, already analyse</p>
