              <p>I think most folks have the slightest idea what compassion is. You offer assistance in exchange for nothing. It's that simple.</p>
              <p>It is sad, even pathetic, to think that one would consider any form of status of the person in need of help before offering help.</p>
              <p>Wait is this coming from a country that proudly claims first delivery of A380s, best airport  in the world, 1st F1 night race, and what other materialistic acheievements that I might have forgotten?</p>

              <p>For me,i wont mind donatin to him because he is from china or any other counrty, I just look at him as a person who needs help. Whether he deserve it is another question. If he is a person who does bad stuff of course he don deserve our kindness ( Singaporean oso applies).</p>

              <p>Excwees me..if I fall sick in another country..I come back to SG to get my medical treatment.. and if I need donation money I come back and ask my country people donate. I don't ask the people from another country to donate OK ? Please be rational.</p>
              <p>China is a HUGE country with population of 1 billion.. if one China person donate $1 ..he will have more than enough to go for his medical treatment and aftercare, including his retirement no need to come here for Scholarship.</p>
              <p>Before he starts accepting donation from SGreans.. have he ask from his own country men first ?</p>
              <p>It this is not preying on Sgrean's generosity.. I don't know what is.</p>
              <p>If he asked from his China people and they are cold blooded enough to say no.. then yes.. I will willingly donate..</p>
              <p>If you need money.. you go ask from your OWN family first... not a stranger on the streets.</p>

              <p>If you want to know, there was a donation drive on campus and S$80k was collected from staff and students.</p>
              <p>Let's take politics out of this. True generosity and compassion gives without counting the cost, but not enough people believe in it.</p>
              <p>If you knew somebody else who also needed the money for treatment, and helped him or her instead, I applaud that. However I hope that the people who declare that they won't help this Chinese student, because a Singaporean patient deserves it more, actually practise what they preach.</p>
              <p>Can we all agree that it's sad if one looks at a person who comes down with a potentially terminal illness, and not feel sadness but scorn, just because of his nationality and what some of his brethren are doing?</p>

              <p>I don't get the logic at all. What's all these things about 'saving our own people first before saving other people'. In the first place I don't see many Singaporeans helping the local charity scene here.</p>
              <p>Alright then, for the sake of the argument, let's just assume some netizens have been actively helping out the local poor. What then, is so difficult about donating let's say $2 to one PRC guy who is sick alone in a foreign land? Imagine if the entire school's population donate $2 (maybe for the richer kids, a bit more)...what's so difficult about that?</p>
              <p>Perhaps it's true that some PRC people staying in Singapore are creating some displeasure among us. So what? Just because we don't like certain PRC people does that means that we have to discriminate against the whole lot of them? Who are we to decide that who deserves help and who don't? Do the arrogant Singaporeans once against see themselves as superior beings?</p>
              <p>All the bullsh*t about 'he's making use of our country', 'he's a foreigner and don't deserve piriority', bla bla bla. Piangz, at the end of the day we're still fellow human beings living under the same sky right?</p>
              <p>I don't see this as an example of one succumbing to sob stories and blown up news by the media. It's just that whoever we see needs help, we help, that's all. At the end of the day if we see that donation are going in at an excessive rate, we can always divert some of these donations to other causes ourselves.</p>
              <p>Why don't for once imagine that it is YOU who is stuck in another country heavily sick, but nobody bothers to help you because you are an 'arrogant, money-minded, greedy and kia-su Singaporean'.</p>

              <p>Would suggest that the PRC student seek treatment in his own home country, they should have some form of healthcare system available there.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What if every PRC that has an illness comes to Singapore? Are we going to help every single one of them?</p>
              <p>I guess a population of 3.5 million will start donating aid to help a nation of 1.3 billion.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We can't even help outselves, yet we want to help others.</p>

              <p>I think a lot of people hesitate due to his nationality because I think most people start to think if our help is appreciated or Singaporeans are just plain suckers. Just take the Huang Na case for example where the donations whom they said is pledge to charity and all was used to build themselves a house etc.</p>
              <p>I think the other reason is that a lot of students especially are upset that some PRC has this stuck up attitude that they come here on scholarship, leech on the government and go home once they have finished leeching on us. Too many stories you hear that Singaporeans have an aversion towards them. You don't really hear as much aversion towards other foreigners than the PRCs. Of course not all are bad but it seems there are more PRC bad apples than the other foreigners.</p>
              <p>I'm digressing.</p>
              <p>In answer to the question, I will not donate because it is a widely publicized issue and likelihood there will be a lot of people donating. And if I donate to a body to help the poor, I don't care if it is used for Singaporeans or Foreigners because it is another human we are helping.</p>
              <p>But in answer to Fatum's question if I had a dollar and there are 2 patients side by side, and assuming they are both good people, I will donate to the Singaporean first before the Foreigner. </p>

              <p>China is a HUGE country with population of 1 billion.. if one China person donate $1 ..he will have more than enough to go for his medical treatment and aftercare, including his retirement no need to come here for Scholarship.</p>

              <p>Haiz, I don't know why everybody is so obsessed with whether to help or not when donating is up to individual choice. Being publicized is to let everyone knows there is someone who need help, help or not is up to you. For me I would not help, 1st because he is not my friend, 2nd not someone whom i even talk to before, 3rd he can get better help somewhere. But that does not mean i am someone who is heartless, because i think he can get better help from his own relatives or maybe his direct camp mates. I am just too unrelated to him for me to make my donation.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Everyday there are at least thousands of Singaporeans who need money for medical purposes, don't tell me you can afford $1 to every of these patients, you will spend at least few thousands. I can only say most of us will help those who are actually somewhat related to us. Thats human nature. E.g your mother and some stranger need money for medical, of course you will use all your money for mother right?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Well but still there are really good people in this world who will help regardless of nationality, race, language or religion. I only can say i truly respect these kind of people, these people may not even be rich, their mindset is to save a life and thats all they are thinking. At least they are far better than those who are truly rich, yet NEVER make any donation to help the local needy people, and still talk so much crap.</p>

              <p>Not many people actually bother to suss out every case there is.
              They're more likely to help whatever comes to their attention first,
              and it's usually because of publicity or proximity. How is it possible to say whether that is right or wrong?</p>
              <p>We don't have enough money to help every single person in need in our society and in our world, but as long as it's a genuine, sincere case, why do you need to justify helping another human being over another? Even if you don't divide up your contributions, you may not be able to save the one person whom you choose to help, but does it matter if you know you tried anyway? But to justify it using racial and national lines is just cynical. One could be even more cynical, and say that helping any human will only do the environment more harm, but I shaln't go there.</p>
              <p>Let's not judge him based on the likelihood that he's a bad apple. If someone knows him personally and can vouch that he's been anything other than an honest student, fine. However by letting this fuss go public and grow out of proportion, I think we've only done our collective image more harm than good. I hope the media can cover at least once how much he's received thus far.</p>
