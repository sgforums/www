He is expected to deliver his written findings on Oct 6.<br><br>The teenager's father, Mr Tay Chee Kwang, 41, an odd-job labourer, was visibly upset when the verdict was delivered.<br><br>'Even the coroner said no one is at fault, so I suppose it was my son's fault,' he said to reporters in Mandarin before storming off.<br><br>Wei Yi, 13, a student at Pasir Ris Secondary, never regained consciousness after being hit by the lamp post, which was badly corroded at the base, on Feb 28 last year.<br><br>The coroner's inquiry into his death was first heard in April this year, and several witnesses, ranging from experts to those who frequently played at the court, gave testimony.<br><br>Four experts - the principal consultant at PSB Corporation's mechanical testing group, a materials analyst, a mechanical engineer and a corrosion expert - gave differing opinions on whether the most severe corrosion had occurred above or below ground level.<br><br>This was deemed an issue as it would help determine whether the town council officer checking the post could have seen the rusted portion, and was therefore negligent in not calling for its replacement.<br><br>When the officer in question, Mr Kuah Yee Yee, 26, who works for Tampines Town Council's managing agent EM Services, testified in May, he said he did a visual check of the lamp post from a distance of about five to seven metres, but did not touch it.<br><br>He conducted his inspection on Feb 6 last year, a few weeks before the incident.<br><br>Testimony from those who played on the court also differed. Polytechnic student Goh Yong Ching, 20, who frequented it, said the lamp post had been tilting for a few months.<br><br>However, Wei Yi's five friends, who were playing volleyball with him when the incident occurred, did not notice anything wrong with the post.<br><br>There were yet more twists and turns to come in the case, including a twice-postponed verdict, which is a rare occurrence in such an inquiry.<br><br>On Aug 19, in what is a highly unusual move for a coroner's inquiry, the town council's lawyers, Mr Shashi Nathan and Mr Peter Chean, made written submissions to the court, saying that the teen's death could not be conclusively attributed to any known party.<br><br>The lawyers argued that Mr Kuah had 'adhered strictly to the town council's estate inspection system, and had carried out his duties conscientiously and diligently'.<br><br>Mr Kuah did not see any tilting or corrosion before the fateful accident, they said.<br><br>The lawyers also hit out at Mr Goh's testimony - another unusual move - arguing that he was either mistaken or had embellished his evidence, as it was untenable for the lamp post to have remained tilted for so long without falling.<br><br>They added that the Tampines Town Council had gone out of its way to provide Wei Yi's family with support and assistance, and had even helped to arrange for them to be relocated to a new home to 'facilitate the emotional healing process'.<br><br>The town council had also taken steps to ensure that such accidents would not occur again, the lawyers said. These include laying detailed maintenance plans and buying high-tech equipment to check for corrosion in lamp posts.<br><br></div>

The only point of contention is whether visual checking from 5-7 metres is sufficient to be considered as job fulfilled. In any case, they may be forced to changed their work procedure to ensure physical check and not just visual checks. This is the only point which maybe punishable, but I tends to favor not punishing them, although I find punishment for not having physical check as one of work procedure may be fair as well.<br><br>(3) Town council cannot be punished because they did engage someone to inspect the lamp post.

This may be similar to the falling lamp pole situation, where reasonable care has been taken but accident still happens.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by Qitai: <strong><br>Atobe, your points are basically similar - strict responsibility. So I will just use the example of Mr Kuah Yee Yee. </strong></blockquote>The Law should be basically similar, and applicable in an even handed manner to everyone that comes before the Court of Law - there should be no double standards.<br><br>The Law must be exercised with strict responsibility to all those that comes before it, as in the present inquiry into the collapse of the MRT Circle Line.<br><br>In the present thread, why is the Law blind to justice, when the Government can be allowed to conveniently pass a legislation that allow HDB to transfer responsibility to hapless HDB Owners - to replace POORLY DESIGNED windows that are initially accepted by HDB ?<br><br>If the HDB Owner can be made responsible for something that they are not responsible in building, why is it that the Town Council cannot be made responsible for a DIRECT RELATIONSHIP in being responsible for the proper maintenance and upkeep of their property ?<br><blockquote>continuing post by Qitai: <strong><br>Imagine you are Mr Kuah Yee Yee and your job is to inspect the lamp pole. Now, on your routine check, you find no obvious flaut with the lamp pole with whatever procedure and equipment that is given to your and hence conclude the lamp pole safe. </strong></blockquote>Unfortunately, in this case, Mr Kuah actually admitted that he did his job of inspecting the lamp post from a distance of 5 to 7 meters away.<br><br>Can he possibly be doing his job properly ?<br><br>Can he be effective in performing his job to check if the lamp post is corroded, when he inspected those lamp posts from a distance of 5 to 7 meters ?<br><br>Can he be said to have done his job with diligence and in a responsible way ?<br><blockquote>continuing post by Qitai: <strong><br>Despite that, an accident happens and killed somebody. You felt guilty. But would you think you are responsible for his death? And how would you punish yourself if you imagine that you are the judge now. Imprisonment? Fine? How much fine? Canning?<br><br>For once, please don't push it to others. Tell me what is your verdict. </strong></blockquote>Why do you not confine yourself to what I have posted, and make a response to the points made but have instead avoided those points by attempting to go around the issues by putting me into the position of Mr Kuah ?<br><br>Just to amuse you - my reply shall be as follows:<br><br>If I am Mr Kuah, and due to my obvious inability or disinterest in the job - (as seen by my <strong>cursory attitude </strong>of inspecting a lamp post from a distance of 5 to 7 meters away) - I will submit to my conscience that my lack of diligence and improper conduct of my work attitude, and admit that I am probably the principal cause of the death of this innocent boy.<br><br>Even if I am not prosecuted by the Law, and found by the Coroner to be not responsible, I will quit my position from EM Services - as a matter of conscience and principle.<br><br>Seriously, is it not negligence - (or a lack of due diligence) - if an inspection of a lamp post condition is made from a distance of 5 or 7 meters away ?<br><br>Did Mr Kuah have a "Spiderman's" rubber arms that can be telescoped to the lamp post from a distance of 5 to 7 meters away ?<br><br>How can EM Services condone such work method in performing a contracted task ?<br><br>How can the Town Council not have any supervisors to check on the performance of EM Services and the works completed by the workers from EM Services ?<br><br></div>

You keep saying someone needs to be responsible, but refuse to say who and what punishment should be dish out and on what charges. </strong></blockquote>In some of your replies, you have shown a huge propensity to make inferences of posted replies to suit your point of views, yet in this thread you display an opposite capacity to come to a conclusion that your position - in defense of the coroner's decision - cannot be attainable.<br><br>Is it not clear as daylight from my postings of how the Town Council, its Agent - EM Services, and the immediate person responsible Mr Kuah Yee Yee, should all be culpable at different levels of responsibility - as so clearly stated ?<br><blockquote>continuing post by Qitai: <strong><br>(4) With your attitude of strict responsibility, you fail to see that a common folk doing a job just follows procedure of what is required. If my job only requires me to do a visual inspection, then am I responsible? </strong></blockquote>Will you try to convince the Singapore Chief Justice to change from his declared and astute observance to the principle of 'actions and culpable responsibility' ?<br><br>If your job only require you to do a visual inspection, you are responsible for the methods and actions in how your job is done to the given final objective or end result that is expected to be performed by you.<br><br>If Mr Kuah's job is to ensure that lamp posts are to be checked for corrosion to ensure safety to the public using the area which the lamp posts are serving, can he be deemed to have done a proper job at a distance of 5 to 7 meters away from the lamp posts ? Where is due diligence on his part, or the part of his employer (EM Services), or the Owners cum Managers of the facility (the Town Council) to ensure that expected standards of work is made ?<br><br>Are you suggesting that the Law should be applied with a generous degree of flexibility ?<br><blockquote>continuing post by Qitai: <strong><br>So, in that case, maybe I shouldn't even accept the job in the first place if I think the work procedure is wrong? </strong></blockquote>If the work procedure is a "Standard Works Format" approved by your Employer, the ultimate responsibility for such works standard will rest with the Employer.<br><br>However, as a thinking person, should you not be responsible to highlight the weaknesses of the "Standard Works Format" ?<br><blockquote>continuing post by Qitai: <strong><br>Or should I accept the job but do more than what the procedure requires me to do?

            <div class='col-md body'>All that i want to be said has already been covered by atobe.<br><br>Thankfully there are some among the existing population who agree that this verdict is flawed and perhaps our justice system has been made poorer for it.<br><br>If, to illustrate a neutral example, such a verdict has happened before. The case of Expat driver vs Korean father who lost his entire family in a car accident on the road boasts similar circumstances.<br><br>All the facts pointed to a guilty verdict. Yet in an astonishing delivery, the presiding judge ruled that the female driver had driven with 'sufficient due care' and was not to blame since the family had jaywalked in heavy rain.<br><br>In a repeat of the father who lost his son to the falling lampost, the korean father who flew here from overseas to attend every courst session berated our justice system for failing to award even a small degree of responsibility to the defendant. "Where is the justice?" he mentioned, his face teary eyed.<br><br>This incident of the falling lampost, serve to indicate that in rare cases, some ppl who supposedly performed their job 'diligently' from 5-7m away can escape some measure of responsibility. And while the boy's father is left to weep in sorrow, the rest of us should wonder had that child been ours, would the same decision be equally enraging?<br></div>
