              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: large;">Is
                      a general election this year now confirmed?</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;"> Did Mediacorp cock up and let the cat out of the bag? Is a general
                    election this year confirmed?</span> <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Look at this screen shot from 9:36 pm,
                    Thursday, 19 February 2009. When I saw it, I called Choo Zheng Xi of The
                    Online Citizen immediately and he got exactly the same page, so that I have a witness. He
                    took a screen shot too.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="http://www.yawningbread.org/arch_2009/pic-987a.jpg"><img src="http://www.yawningbread.org/arch_2009/pic-987b.jpg" border="0" alt="" width="480" height="360"></a></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">What about it? Look at the page title -–
                    it says "General Election 2009". The contents though are from
                    2006. Ask yourself: Why would a page from 2006 carry a title that
                    references 2009?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The only explanation I can think of is
                    that Mediacorp is preparing all their websites to support an election. The
                    easiest thing to do, as any webmaster knows, is to recycle previously
                    designed pages.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">So that's what's happening -– they are
                    in the process of updating and recycling, but forgot that the pages are
                    still "live". As a result, we can see the work in progress.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">But if there is work in progress, does it
                    mean the election is a sure thing?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span></p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The Straits Times today (19 Feb 2009)
                    carried a front page story headlined "Changes made to polling
                    districts". The gist of it was that the Elections Department has
                    issued as statement saying that changes have been made to boundaries of
                    polling districts. A polling district is a neighbourhood that shares one
                    polling station. The boundary changes are necessary for logistical
                    reasons, so that the numbers of voters are not too many for any particular
                    polling station to handle.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Usually, as the newspaper reported,
                    changes to polling districts are followed by another announcement,
                    concerning changes to boundaries of electoral constituencies, a few weeks
                    or a few months later. The longest lag time in recent memory was six
                    months in 1997. And that is usually the signal for a general election.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">On Tuesday, 17 February, the Elections
                    Department had also announced that the electoral register was being
                    updated, an exercise that should be completed by 30 April. While updating
                    electoral rolls is said to be routine, boundary changes are widely
                    believed to be indicative of an upcoming general election.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">However, there is no need to finish updating the
                    electoral rolls before calling an election. If the government calls for a
                    snap election, they'll just use the old register.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Despite this, the Straits Times found
                    many politicians and political watchers unsure how soon an election would
                    be. The next one isn't due until 2012. Member of Parliament Ong Ah Heng
                    tried to dismiss speculation:</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span></p>
              <blockquote> <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Nee
              Soon Central MP Ong Ah Heng saw yesterday's announcement as a 'normal
              procedure' and thought a snap election highly unlikely.<br> <br> 'The earliest will be next year. But it depends very much on the
              economy and when we can overcome the recession,' he said.<br> <br> 'The Government is now concentrating its energy on helping workers and
              companies. Where is there energy for a general election?'<br> <br> Mr Ong, who has not set up his election committee, added that the
              Government was mindful of the widespread impact of the recession,
              including on many middle- and upper-middle-income Singaporeans.<br> <br> So he felt the Government would 'consider very carefully' and wait for signs of a recovery before calling an election. </span></p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Other political watchers were also
                    guarded:</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span></p>
              <blockquote> <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Agreeing,
              political analyst Eugene Tan said holding the polls now would be a
              distraction. Besides, people had yet to see the impact of measures
              passed in the Budget.<br> <br> Sociologist Terence Chong, like
              Joo Chiat MP Chan Soo Sen, argued that the Government is getting
              processes ready in order to call an election at any time.<br> <br> 'The best you can say is that they are putting the pieces in place so
              that there is an option, and if the (economic) forecast is very gloomy,
              they may call one before things get worse,' Mr Chong said.<br> <br> Preparations began last November when public servants selected to be
              election officers were sent letters informing them of training they
              will receive. Schools have also been designated as polling centres.</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Yawning Bread had revealed in a January
                    article that there is insider talk about a snap election. The article <a href="http://www.yawningbread.org/arch_2009/yax-967.htm"> Why there mustn't be an election this year</a> offered my view that holding an election now can only mean two things:
                    Either the People's Action Party wants to ride a "flight to
                    safety" effect to sweep all opposition away, regaining a monopoly of
                    parliamentary seats -- a most undemocratic motive, if you ask me -- or the
                    government has no confidence at all that the economy will improve by 2011.
                    The latter will mean a very long and painful recession.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Mediacorp, in preparing its website, may
                    also believe that an election is imminent. The unknown is: Are they doing it based on
                    their own gut feel and mere preparedness, or have they
                    been told to get their website ready by a certain date? Either way, it looks like an
                    election this year and not later. <img src="http://www.yawningbread.org/images/bar_red.gif" border="0" alt="" width="4" height="12" align="bottom"></span></p>

              <h1>Parliamentary Elections possible from May to Nov 2009</h1>
              <div class="date">February 20, 2009  by <a title="Posts by admin" href="http://www.sgpolitics.net/?author=1">admin</a><br>Filed under: <a title="View all posts in Current Affairs" rel="category" href="http://www.sgpolitics.net/?cat=6">Current Affairs</a> </div>
              <p><strong>Written by Ng E-Jay<br> 20 Feb 2009</strong></p>
              <p>Snap parliamentary elections are now possible from May to November 2009, and quite likely as early as May to July 2009.</p>
              <p>The Government gazette published the boundaries of altered polling
              districts on Wednesday, just a day after the Elections Department
              announced that the Register of Voters is being revised.</p>
              <p>According to the Elections Department website, online services such
              as checking the Register of Electors or applying for restoration of
              name are suspended temporarily, and are expected to resume around 3
              March 2009. Visitors may check back within 14 days from 3 March 2009,
              to ensure that their particulars in the revised Register of Electors
              are correct.</p>
              <p>Polling district changes are usually published before the Government
              sets up a committee to review and draw up the boundaries of
              constituencies.</p>
              <p>Historical experience reveals that there is a time lag of as much as
              6 months between the publication of the polling district changes and
              the release of the committee’s Electoral Boundaries Report which
              details the number and size of single-member and group representation
              constituencies.</p>
              <p>General elections tend to follow soon after the Electoral Boundaries
              Report, within a 3 month timeframe. This makes elections quite possible
              within the next 9 months.</p>
              <p>Snap elections as early as May - July 2009 are likely as the PAP may
              want to tap into the heightened climate of fear and uncertainty. In
              2001 when elections were held just two months after the 911 terrorist
              attacks and in the midst of a recession, the PAP secured 75.29% of the
              valid vote.</p>

              <p>So...</p>
              <p>Did PAP knew about the 911 attacks before it happened, and planned the snap elections that way to tap into the climate of fear? Or are they super efficient and started planning for the snap elections immediately after the attacks? When would the next scheduled elections for 2001 if there was no snap elections?</p>

              <p>who made headlines and for what reasons? you can say its propaganda, but people still have to take that shit if they want to read/view media in singapore.Your propaganda on the other hand isn't reaching the group you need to reach.</p>
              <p>despite what people think of the pap you still see them doing stuff in the community, they do it all year round. i don't fuckin like them but who do you think woke me up in the morning shook my hand before the whole thing even registered in my brain in an area thats had a walkover for my entire living memory?</p>
              <p>if next 5 years you get people to go to an area to volunteer, help out, get them jobs, do some networking i stll believe you have a chance but now?</p>
              <p>always complain grc stop you, but i don't see anyone getting around the grc during non election times.</p>
              <p>even people you know personally are well disposed to help you only if you've done something to register in their memories. why then do you think someone who don't know who you are are going to leave their lives in your hands just because you preach "liberty and political freedom"&lt;--- something i personally don't fuckin believe a certain party represents with their outrageous behaviour. how can someone who rejects anyone else with a different view represents "liberty"?</p>

              <p>than what do you suggest?</p>
              <p>You can follow the CSJ style which might work in bizarro world... Make baseless accusations to the point of slander, get sued. Do more stupid stuff, go to jail. And drag your party along with it.</p>
              <p>Seriously, suggest something better before putting down any ideas. I put down the CSJ style, but i offered another route... What about you?</p>

              <p>what i am implying is it is too simplistic to describe what you just did and end up a `winner' as you said.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Well, it is believed that everyone goes straight to hell for all the sins committed when they were alive. The ones (or saints)who has never committed a single sin in their lives supposedly becomes deities in heaven. Once the spirits have completed their ’sentence’ in hell, they’ll be reincarnated into the mortal world again (no guarantees that you’ll come back as a human). Nonetheless, the 7th lunar month is a break for the nether world. Not only the tortured spirits get to come back to Earth, the ‘guards’ of hell come out for a ‘vacation’ as well. It is during this time, the chinese burn offerings for their ancestors. The chinese temples would organise activites to give offerings to the ‘guards’ and god of the underworld as well as to those wandering spirits who have no living relatives on Earth. Those ‘dinners’ and ‘getais’ (Chinese operas or mini-concerts) are held for 2 purposes, to entertain the spirits and guards as well as raise money for the needy.</p></div>
