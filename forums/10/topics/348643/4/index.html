              <p> </p>
              <p>The usual case of most aunties, uncles and ah pek like you, they complain so much about PAP and praise the opposition, but i bet most in the end still vote the PAP, and I wouldn't be surprise you vote for PAP too.</p>

              <p>i did vote for opposition last election. I live in hougang, so had the chance to do so. If my job is affected, I will launch an investigation to find out why it is so, because all votes are confidential, and someone will have to answer. Since that is not so, nothing to be afraid of.</p>
              <p>Now, my turn to ask you. Why the hell you want to vote for something as ambigious as opposition? If I want to vote, I want to know who i voting for, Chiam See Tong, Low Thia Khiang, Loo Choo Yong... Not a random face in opposition or PAP, just because someone said so.</p>
              <p>If you ask me vote for Chiam, i say yes, he is a good MP, a good man, vote for him. I don't say yes, he is opposition, vote for him</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now, I don't even know who the hell is going to run, and you want me to vote for opposition just like that? Same thing for PAP, show me some guy first!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Voting blindly is just fucking stupid. Give me a candidate, and reasons, than I will consider.</p>

              <p>My reply is simple. I think you are wrong. any living person is obviously more valueable than a dog. And personally, I would say PAP is better than other government in ASEAN. Tell me if you would like to trade any government in ASEAN for PAP.</p>
              <p>So if you wonder why no one support the opposition, than maybe you will review your dog argument, and come up with something that is more helpful.</p>

              <p>So you give up? And start getting emotional and follow the ways of people who have failed? Why keep clinging to the people who have failed, and refused to change their approach? Why not follow the way of people who has succeded and learn from them?</p>
              <p>Chiam see tong? Low? they are more serious competition than JBJ or CSJ, how come they are not bankrupt? They are prove that there is still a way.</p>
              <p>I will say again... shouting support opposition will not work. Whining about PAP will not work. Come out with concrete plans, a long term plan, show a better way, and you will have a chance.</p>
