              <h1>REVEALED: 'There was no Cabinet debate in run-up to war,' says Short as Government refuses to release minutes</h1>
              <p>By 
              <a class="author" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/search.html?s=y&amp;authornamef=Simon+Walters">Simon Walters</a><br> Last updated at 10:18 AM on 01st March 2009</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1158148/REVEALED-There-Cabinet-debate-run-war-says-Short-Government-refuses-release-minutes.html">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1158148/REVEALED-There-Cabinet-debate-run-war-says-Short-Government-refuses-release-minutes.html</a></p>
              <p>The Government is refusing to release minutes of Cabinet meetings
              before the Iraq War because they would reveal there was no discussion
              on the issue.</p>
              <p>Details surrounding two crucial meetings on the eve
              of the conflict were laid bare for the first time yesterday when former
              Cabinet Minister Clare Short, who was present at both, gave a full
              account of what happened.</p>
              <p>She told The Mail on Sunday  the main
              reason for the ‘scandalous’ decision not to publish the minutes was not
              to protect  confidential discussions about the war, but to cover up the
              fact  there was no such discussion.</p>
              <p>At the last Cabinet meeting, no debate on the legality of the war
              was allowed and Tony Blair, then Prime Minister, said brusquely:
              ‘That’s it.’</p>
              <p>The official records would also put an end to claims
              by Gordon Brown’s supporters that, in private, he had grave doubts
              about the war, said Ms Short. In fact, he led the Cabinet campaign to
              accuse France of sabotaging British and American attempts to win United
              Nations support for the attack on Saddam Hussein.</p>
              <p>‘It is
              extraordinary when you hear people like Jack Straw say that the Cabinet
              minutes cannot be published because you have to preserve Cabinet
              confidentiality and robust decision-making,’ said Ms Short, who
              resigned as International Development Secretary after the war.</p>
              <p>‘The
              bitter irony is that what they are doing is concealing the fact there
              was no robust decision-making. The minutes will reveal there was no
              real Cabinet discussion about the Iraq War. That is the real scandal.’</p>
              <p>Ms
              Short spoke out after the Government blocked an order by the
              Information Commissioner to reveal minutes of Cabinet meetings on March
              13 and March 17, 2003, two days before the war started on March 19.</p>
              <p>She
              said: ‘Gordon had been completely marginalised in the run-up to the
              war. It wasn’t because he didn’t support it but because he and Tony
              were not getting on. Then, John Prescott had a dinner and knocked their
              heads together.’</p>
              <p>The meeting on March 17 was called to discuss Attorney General Lord Goldsmith’s advice on the legality of the war.</p>
              <p>Ms
              Short said: ‘When we arrived, there was a piece of paper in front of
              each of us, a few paragraphs written by the Attorney General saying the
              war was legal, there were no problems etc.</p>
              <p>‘Lord Goldsmith
              started reading it out but we said, “You don’t have to, we can read
              it.” Then Tony said something like, “That’s it.” And that was it.</p>
              <p>‘I wanted to know if the Attorney General had any doubts about the legality of the war.</p>
              <p>‘They all said, “Clare, be quiet, stop.” No one else wanted to talk about it. I was shouted down.’</p>
