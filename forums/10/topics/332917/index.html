              <p>If their so called "forward fuel pricing" policy and methods are "professional enough" then they should have an answered how the Oct to Dec 08 , projected crude oil price to be US$155 base on only July 2008 oil price?

              <p>Can and EMA comes out with regulation to project things without real fact and reflect the present situation? </p>
              <p>I think the both of them is either step out to give a convincing explaination or apologise for their damn mistake.  If the coming 3 months shows crude oil prices arrow southward which is 180° differences from their stupid prediction, and/or out by more then 20%, they should step down and get out.  Let someone more responsible personnel to be incharge instead.</p>

              <p>The person in power believes that the main point is how to improve from a problem, and not finding who is responsible.  In another words, let's move on.</p>
              <p>The only chance that these 2 fellows will be sacked is when their superior made a very serious mistake and cannot hide at all.  He will push the blame to the 2 of them and sacked them so that he himself can continue to enjoy high salary, high bonus, high allowanace, high benefits and most important of all, high pension.</p>
