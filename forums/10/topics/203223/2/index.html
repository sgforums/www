            <div class='col-md body'>My views on the fare hike, extracted from my blog:<br><br>Hooray, transport fares may be increased by 1 to 3 cents come October. In case you don't know, this is in today's news. Already I can hear people whining and cursing at the transport companies for raising fares yet again.<br><br>Let's get some figures first. SBS Transit recorded a profit of $55 million (that's S$55,000,000), while SMRT reported a profit of $27.5 million for the first quarter of the year. With records of these figures, you can already hear some yuppies crying foul.<br><br>"Wah nin na beh la, earn so much money liao still want to ki the fares, really make me damn du lan ar!" complains ah beng, who proceeds to light up his second cigarette*.<br><br>*costs approximately S$0.50 per stick now.<br><br>As I always say, the price of everything is increasing, but the salary is going down. When I say that, I'm referring to the lower starting pay now than compared to years ago. While generally most consumers are against the raising of fares, I will take a neutral stand and present my thoughts on this episode.<br><br>While it's true that the transport companies recorded profits, it is also known that the price of oil is ever-increasing due to the tension in the Middle-East. What has oil got to do with the MRT which runs on electricity? Where does the electricity come from? Burning your crap?<br><br>The cost of fuel increased by 40% for the companies by $10 to $30 million. Money is also spent on upgrades, and purchasing newer vehicles. We probably don't see all the figures, but whenever they upgrade or do a purchase, it involves millions.<br><br>Now let's see how the fare hike will affect us. Considering an increase of 2 cents/trip, an average Singaporean who takes 2 MRT rides and 2 bus rides a day will end up paying 8 cents more. That makes up to 56 cents/week, $2.24/month, or $26.88/year. How much does $27 mean to you?<br><br>I see people around me buying new mobile phones which can easily cost a 4-digit sum ever so frequently. If you can afford that, or even a HDTV that costs close to 5-figures, I seriously don't see how badly $27/year will affect you. You can whine all you want, but even if the fares are upped by a dollar, there isn't much you can do about it if you rely on public transport.<br><br>Now here's a relief for students - Both transport operators said that the proposed fare hikes would not affect children and student fares on concession passes or using ez-link cards.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by aRcTiC_sTaR:</div><div class="quote_body">My views on the fare hike, extracted from my blog:<br><br>Hooray, transport fares may be increased by 1 to 3 cents come October. In case you don't know, this is in today's news. Already I can hear people whining and cursing at the transport companies for raising fares yet again.<br><br>Let's get some figures first. SBS Transit recorded a profit of $55 million (that's S$55,000,000), while SMRT reported a profit of $27.5 million for the first quarter of the year. With records of these figures, you can already hear some yuppies crying foul.<br><br>"Wah nin na beh la, earn so much money liao still want to ki the fares, really make me damn du lan ar!" complains ah beng, who proceeds to light up his second cigarette*.<br><br>*costs approximately S$0.50 per stick now.<br><br>As I always say, the price of everything is increasing, but the salary is going down. When I say that, I'm referring to the lower starting pay now than compared to years ago. While generally most consumers are against the raising of fares, I will take a neutral stand and present my thoughts on this episode.<br><br>While it's true that the transport companies recorded profits, it is also known that the price of oil is ever-increasing due to the tension in the Middle-East. What has oil got to do with the MRT which runs on electricity? Where does the electricity come from? Burning your crap?<br><br>The cost of fuel increased by 40% for the companies by $10 to $30 million. Money is also spent on upgrades, and purchasing newer vehicles. We probably don't see all the figures, but whenever they upgrade or do a purchase, it involves millions.<br><br>Now let's see how the fare hike will affect us. Considering an increase of 2 cents/trip, an average Singaporean who takes 2 MRT rides and 2 bus rides a day will end up paying 8 cents more. That makes up to 56 cents/week, $2.24/month, or $26.88/year. How much does $27 mean to you?<br><br>I see people around me buying new mobile phones which can easily cost a 4-digit sum ever so frequently. If you can afford that, or even a HDTV that costs close to 5-figures, I seriously don't see how badly $27/year will affect you. You can whine all you want, but even if the fares are upped by a dollar, there isn't much you can do about it if you rely on public transport.<br><br>Now here's a relief for students - Both transport operators said that the proposed fare hikes would not affect children and student fares on concession passes or using ez-link cards.</div></blockquote>actuali, the electricity is also generated from natural gas from indo... theres no damn thing anyone here can do.... not hapi, find MP.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
