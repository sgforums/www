For the sake of simplicity, take it as equivalent to PR.  You can therefore be an Australian migrant and a Singaporean citizen at the same time.  Once you have held migrant status for two years, you are eligible to apply for citizenship - the only difference between the two after that point is that you get voting rights as a citizen.<br><br>Why I say "after that point" is that you are not covered by subsidies, concessions or welfare for the first two years, but after that two year period is over, all of these are available to you.  They do this so that they get some commitment from the people who migrate there, and weed out those who just want to live off the system.<br><br>Right now, we've got three people here who have gone overseas and made it, namely fymk, Xprobe and myself.  Lingos has also gone to Australia and made it, and so far Heng@ and Farmer Brown are looking pretty good in the UK and US respectively.  On top of that, my best friend, who is also from Singapore and is now an Australian citizen, is doing very well as a neurologist, and the head of Bristol Meyers Australia is also a Singaporean friend of mine.  Do we have any firsthand accounts here from people who have crashed and burned?  Six successes against zero failures - where's the proof of your "for every success story there are other people who fared even worse " theory?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>I don't see how can people not see the racist attitudes of the elite and how the explanation that the non elite are not the same as them and do not have the talent to do more than just blindly obey or else. How the elite had cowered the common mass into stupid obdience not to rock the boat and let the only and only party run the show. There is already racisism that the elite has against the common person. Its just that we are all conditioned so well we do not see it. I personally feel insulted that I am no better than the low class foreigners they bring in or the stupid lack of EI scholars they supported to live in their ivory towers. But I know, through my talks with people, no one ever gets the underlying meaning of the things said by the elites on TV.. Fact is most people around me are agreeing to them and keep status quo. So the elites up there laught at our stupidity. Anyways, I realised I had a lot of shallow people around me and I rather not discuss these things with them cause like religion, it makes them feel uneasy. They want to have a artificially created semblence of a "happy" existance.<br><br>So I wonder always, how can a "democratic" country have only 1 party and the others choices were eliminated for us. People actually are happy not to have vote so that the same party keeps the country "on course". For a country to only have 1 party and having that party to have a monologue with themselves on policies, regulations, decisions. Like the recent decision to raise the president pay. Hell, what is the fu.ck justification for that!!!! People are still out of jobs and working in jobs that pays them so little they are having issues and the "house" has "approved" the increment!!! Its ridiculous... I forese a raise in the bus/MRT fares soon.<br><br>In Singapore system with one party, there is absolute rule, control and power over the people who dare not even speak up. The common people who by their sheer numbers could have simply made them think twice about taking us for a ride but some how, we all did not see the power in numbers.<br>We are a fearful lot of people. We fear for the backlash, we fear of change, we fear of everything and the party used fear that if we vote against them, we would lose the "peaceful" and "happy" country. Seriously, I'd risk it cause to me, there is nothing to lose in this current state of the country.<br><br>Singapore uni sucks. I refused to go back for futhre studies cause I see the kind of lousy people they churn out and I myslf attended the courses and find them so theorical and useless. The teachers who taught about real things were asked to go or could not stand the stifling system and left. So I don't see how the government has the gall to call our education system world class and be so proud of it.. I tot it was like naive and really they obviously had not seen the world is just getting propaganda to work O.T. I did my further studies with Aus Uni. Its far far far better and I realised I missed out so much.<br><br></div>

Those could also incidentally the same people who cannot adapt to the work culture or those who are sore about not getting permanent residency. Of the two groups, I know a few people who fall within the category - they are the sour grapes.
