            <div class='col-md body'>A Singapore without Singaporeans, A Nation without Nationhood. That's where we are heading to.<br><br>There are people who commented that Singapore is just a "Merchant City and a Hotel" to them. They are in their twenties but they are already planning their exits, migrating to somewhere more comfortable to live in.<br><br>They are not entirely "wrong" to think this way. Look at it this way, when you start to see those in the forties, losing jobs and not able to get employed with a decent wage, would you worry for yourself? Worst of all, the govt is seeking to raise the retirement age when it is obvious that those in their forties find it hard to get a job!<br><br>It is apparent that for those who have been caught by the "Asset Enhancement Scheme", they will not have enough money for retirement! And all PAP thinks about is whether this group of people would burden their coffers! That's how medisave come about.<br><br>Those in their forties and planning for retirement will have no choice but to cash out and retire somewhere. They must face the reality that they have come to the end of their productive life and the state is not going to take care of them. For all the myths they have believed so dearly, democratic socialism or asset enhancement, they have been disillusioned and there isn't going to be enough money for them to retire in Singapore. There will be no farewell party for them when they leave. It would be "good" if they no longer pose a "financial burden" to the govt anymore!<br><br>For the twenties they saw what happen to the forties. They will also plan their exit and realize that they would only be "useful" when they are at their peak of productive life cycle. It is no wonder the PAP is beginning to woo at them nowadays. But there are still many migrated out. So the FT policy is in place to fill up the holes left behind. But these FTs may just remain forever Foreign.<br><br>When a nation is filled with people, both young and middle aged, thinking about migrating out of the country all the time, there isn't an existence of a Nation in essence anymore. Singapore is just a temporary refuge to their being. And there is no doubt what will happen to these people if there is to be an eminent threat to Singapore as Nation.<br><br>Nationhood has not been firmly forged for the past 39 years of nation building. Those national day parades that we have had for the past have lost its appeals when the reality of PAP govt policies  set in.<br><br>Goh Meng Seng</div>

He quoted an article from Lianhe Zhaobao (13/1) entitled "the poor in the paradize" telling how Singapore is quickly becoming a mansion in the air, you can see but cannot reach.  Statistically many Singaporean are drawing middle income but actually they barely make ends meets.<br><br>In Shanghai, commuters are charged a maximum of  2 RMB or 0.60 S$ for taking a trip on MRT.  In Singapore, we pay more for NE lines because they needed to keep the company profitable. They even took out some bus services to force citizens to take the trains. Finally, they couldn't make it and had it merged with SMRT.  Shanghai set a price for the MRT to ensure that all citizens can afford to travel by MRT, that is the safety net MP Low is talking about.<br><br>In France, the price of french loaf is not allowed to be increased because this is the essential food for all french.<br><br>In Shanghai and France, the governments provide essentials goods and services that average citizen can afford. In Singapore, government's preoccupation is profitability for the organisations. the ministers thought their job was to provide training for singaporean to earn higher salaries to afford the high costs, and they hope that a few singapore shares and other handouts will solve the problem.<br><br>This is what MP Seng Han Thong did not see, and it is this kind of MPs we do not need.<br></div>

I wonder who can I trust now.<br><br>We know all the problems are rotting underneath, like the blind pursue of arts by building that ugly costly monstor, mad pursue of biomed when we are hardly ready, setting up a so called "world class" university when we are ill adapt and narrowminded, calling ourselves financial hub when we do not have the smarts and minds behind the finance sector. All that gold plating, might be able to sustain a little while but over long term, will soil the reputation and it already has starting with the education sector.<br><br>Knowing in my old age, I will be treated lik trash. Knowing unless I can become a millionaire or MM. There is no place in Singapore for me expect to pick drink can, sweep floors, wash toilets, sell papers to live in a broken rented unit and hope for left overs from the food stalls. Even if I have a degree and an MBA and a wealth of experience, I will be seen as a burden and maybe given a label like the people who left are called quitters.

            <div class='col-md body'>the 20-30s are disillusioned by the events and things said by our 'leaders'<br><br>that we should make coroperates profitable at the people's expense and to stem that bleeding, increasing charges and all measures is encouraged<br><br>that we should take it that government subsidied hospital medicines cost more than private hospitals cause we are not communist countries<br><br>increase so call compeition between transportation for the sake of "competition" but in advertently created a monopoly of bus and train services<br><br>of being told we have to voice out and yet later told that we complain too much<br><br>And later thought that we are not creative enough and so to inject creativity, FT policies that make locals second class<br><br>to find that we are paying for licenses to own cars, extremely high tax on cigs, alcohol and other so call freedom of choice in the name of protecting the local people so that we do not abuse it. Yet in the same breath wanting to open a casino with such liberal rules.<br><br>Banning chewing gum and not banning other vices<br><br>Of asking the people to bear with the restructuring and lower wages and yet the number of MP. grass root leaders and other public positions did not have to suffer such thing and in fact is increasing in head counts<br><br>when the crunch of the economic down turn came and the people asked for help. the government tell us the funds cannot be touched and we should never think we can rely of govt to save us when we are in need. Yet, in god times, our tax dollars line their pockets. And the government so swiftly can lend out so much $ to m'sia, indonesia and others.<br><br>When it comes election, there is no a single year since I have the chance to exercise the right to vote,  because the GRC is readjusted to make sure it is a a walk over for 99% of the country. That opposition party had suffered losses when enticements was offered. I remember the promises during election and yet none were ever fullfilled but twisted later that whatever promised cannot be done and we have to take it cause we foolishly vote them back<br><br>Voting against the current power will result in backlash, although you will never read about it in the controlled propagadic press<br><br>We live in a rat race where people are stressed from the high costs of living and are suffereing in physical and mental health. Yet there are studies from the govt that says our std of living is the same as the 90s and there is no increase. Then there was that statistic huha about the number of jobs taken by FT. I wonder who can I trust now.<br><br>We know all the problems are rotting underneath, like the blind pursue of arts by building that ugly costly monstor, mad pursue of biomed when we are hardly ready, setting up a so called "world class" university when we are ill adapt and narrowminded, calling ourselves financial hub when we do not have the smarts and minds behind the finance sector. All that gold plating, might be able to sustain a little while but over long term, will soil the reputation and it already has starting with the education sector.<br><br>Knowing in my old age, I will be treated lik trash. Knowing unless I can become a millionaire or MM. There is no place in Singapore for me expect to pick drink can, sweep floors, wash toilets, sell papers to live in a broken rented unit and hope for left overs from the food stalls. Even if I have a degree and an MBA and a wealth of experience, I will be seen as a burden and maybe given a label like the people who left are called quitters. What's a nice label for us, leechers?<br><br>I didn't think the people didn't want to be singaporeans but rather singapore didn't want us.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Pay attention to the Wal-Mart greeters..Almost like our aunties and uncles working their backs off at Macs.<br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Feelin' Fat and Sassy in the Wallet<br>by Luke Stacks<br>University of Virginia<br><br>My uncle, well-meaning but detached from my life, never knows what to get us kids for the holidays. Luckily, some thoughtful soul, doubtless possessing a thorough understanding of bad-gift torment, invented the gift card. They summon us to these meccas of commerce, huge stores where almost anything may be purchased. In a typical year, clueless relatives supply me with cards to bookstores and, every once in a while, one to a Best Buy. I love the gift card concept. While some might argue that it removes the personal touch a present should possess, the intention expressed in a gift card is apparent: this person obviously wants you to be very happy and is willing to empower your happiness by giving you the choice. When you get a gift card on Christmas morning, all you have at that moment is love. That doesn't mean the damn things can't bite you in the ass. Currently my wallet is stuffed with several cards containing about a dollar each left to be spent in these stores.<br><br>This year my uncle gave me a card for Wal-Mart, based on the admittedly bulletproof argument that I would have no trouble finding one. My hometown of Manassas, Virginia has two. In fact, the new one, located a mile from my house, is even listed as being in "East Manassas," which I had no idea even existed! Now my hometown's geography is split and defined by the Wal-Marts it contains. So getting to one would obviously pose no significant problems.<br><br>The store, however, scares me beyond tangible reason. Wal-Mart elicits complicated feelings from me, ones I never even knew existed. While there are certainly a number of reasons to be against the company on principle, namely their diabolical global strategies and notoriously awful treatment of workers, there is another element to my fear, one that doesn't arise from its peers like Target. The source of my worries had never been properly divined; it was something that was simply out there, a phantom I did not want to touch. But there was no way I wasn't going to get my free stuff.<br><br>My new Wal-Mart had dramatically affected the surrounding roads. We had several confusing lights and turn lanes. It rose ahead of my sister and me like a colossus on the horizon. Approaching it in the parking lot, it just loomed ever larger, consuming my field of vision. My mission, however, shone like a beacon against the deep dull blue: I would make my uncle proud. Somewhere in this house of pain, I would find my happiness. The doors slid open and I jumped into the breach.<br><br><strong>Any large store in the holiday season is an ungodly mess. Fortunately we have greeters to lift our spirits! I have major objections to the greeter system in general. When I walk into Best Buy I try to elude them as best I can, doing my part to fit in with Georg Simmel's modern society of the alienated. How dare they try to establish personal contact with me! They utterly fail to put me in a sunny mood, ready to spend. They mask their basic security function in pleasantries, and this is an insult to any shopper. They are judging you as they welcome. Wal-Mart complicates the problem, because their greeters seem to be almost entirely comprised of the aged. This should inspire remarkable pity and sadness. Imagine suffering life's slings and arrows, only to arrive here, wishing thousands a good day and a happy shopping experience. If I were ever to become a Wal-Mart greeter, I would know that my life has been for naught. I've sapped the world of valuable natural resources. Instead of a summit, this is the pits.<br><br>Why are the elderly here? I can think of two possible reasons. First, some may be unable to retire for financial reasons. Second, others may see a job as a welcome time-filler. I would hope for better solutions to either dilemma. Being a greeter requires less than a person. In that lies the truth about Wal-Mart. The company doesn't even try. I have seen customers herded in like cattle, and they bray accordingly. The aforementioned blueness of the store does not flatter it. They peddle in banality. At Target, you receive the sensation that the store might be trying to pull a fast one, stunning customers through its bright, flashy design. Wal-Mart exposes everything, including the pipes on the ceiling. Smoke and mirrors keep the customers from seeing what they really are, but at Wal-Mart this becomes all too clear. It's like seeing the Matrix code: numbers everywhere being shifted around. As long as there is movement, everything is fine. Wal-Mart has risen above the need to cater to the customer. The blandness of color, the smiley face logo, are merely signs that their customers need no convincing; they are resigned to an ordinary life, filled with unstylish, ordinary things and five-dollar Hulk Hogan movies in the bargain bin. The company does not aim for a false exclusivity or hipness. It just exists and forces you to accept it.<br><br>My happiness did lie inside: a copy of Pulp Fiction. A work of flash and brilliance trapped in a box, buying this felt like a prison breakout. I waited in one line, which decided to close. Then I moved to another. At that moment, less patient customers than I revolted, addressing the employees and calling them names. Wal-Mart sat back and laughed. It realized we had no choice.</strong><br><br>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</div>

It is very tough to accept that this is the fate that all of us people will expect when we grow old, that we wil be called burden, we have to sweeping floors, wiping up shit and pee, cleaning tables, serving kids who are screaming at us for being slow and etc. Thinking about it, makes me think even dying early is a blessing since myself and many peers do not have the kind of cash to allow us to migrate.<br><br>I've heard so much lies and so much sweet talking from those ivory tower statemen and women who manage the Singapore Inc from a distance away. My parents are the older generation who experienced British rule and they spoke of the difference and how, even the ang mohs are nasty in some ways, but they are do not force the people to the corner with their evil, blood sucking ideas.  This is what I feel exactly, forced into a corner. I do not know how much I can take.  I know the french didn't take it thus their revolution.<br><br>The amount of wa yang they do, I feel like ghost month has arrive eveytime there is parliment on TV. The most incredible is this guy, who I betcha in his life, had never to squeeze into a pack bus or train during peak hour and he supported the fare hike the last time. A man whose salary is a high end 5 digit figure per month says a 10-20 cents increase does not hurt. Obviously it does not hurt a man like him but the common man who but ears 3 to 4 low end salary and has no other choice but public transport means another thing. But can they empathize, obviously not.<br><br>So many things, so many events, Singaporeans have seen it all, but none dared to say anything. By and by, the system lost the true purpose of serving the people but rather is serving the needs for control and power for these few people. The respect and credibility for these so called "leaders" were lost when they engage in promises they never intended to keep and low hand tactics in getting opposition party GRC to vote for them.  I wonder how much lower can things get. Can the new so call next generation ever really help or they are just fronts for the real power players to distract us while schemes are hatched to collect more blood money from us, sell us more expensive HDB but increasing smaller in sizes, increasing more taxes here and there, raising fares, gst and penalising the people for just being here. For all the idoicracies we have lived with and all that dishonest, unethical system we had to work through, while bearing in mind that there is no perfect governmental system. However, in this place, I feel that people never had freedom.<br><br></div>
