            <div class='col-md body'><br>I thought about it very long. And I really cannot come out with something positive to say about our government, the policies they made, the kind of society and values they have imposed and the kind of people they employ to perpetuate the cycle of power and destructive destruction (ie vs constructive desctruction) of the singapore spirit.  I used to be proud of singapore and the achievements, I am prod of my fellow persons who had been giving in many instances. But I cannot be proud of a system that is but power hungry, robbing me of a better future and taking away my freedom. I cannot go against my conscience.<br><br>I would gladly give away my citizenship and move elsewhere given the opportunity. Many Indians and other races wanted to have singaproe PR which gives them mobility to move to other better countries because they know what kind of a country singapore is. They are not willing to stay but Singapore is useful to gain entry to US, Aus, etc where their indian passport would have created a obstacle.<br><br>To call the statepersons leaders is to soil the word "lead"<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>After cracking my head, I really cannot come up with anything. I think many Singaporeans are sick of the current regime's heavy handed top-down , one size fits all approach towards social engineering. There is a huge disconnect between policy makers and people affected by such policies, akin to a celibrate priest giving advice on sex. However, I forsee a possible break within the party ranks once Harry Lee dies, perhaps then we might have a large, truly viable opposition. Who knows?</div>

I do not think most people go because they love singapore. Its more like they want to soak up the atmosphere, to feel like they are a part of something. So, yes,  i think its a form of mob instinct.<br><br>Of course, there are some performers who truly love singapore. Some of them have been volunteering their services for more than a decade. However, the majority of the performers are forced to turn up by their schools and/or CCA. Further, some may volunteer because they have so many frens within for eg. People's Association or Singapore Soka Assosciation.<br><br></div>
