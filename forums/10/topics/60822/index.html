They pave way to a better training regime that you should be glad about. And you are not doing so by complaining about NS because they have sacrificed. Training is never simple and easy, because if it is, everybody and me myself would have to worry for our safety if there is any sort of emergency.<br>Cuz nobody is well trained enough to protect the country.
