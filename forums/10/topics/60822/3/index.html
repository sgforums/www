if everybody who gone thru it dying??"</strong><br><br>put urself in d org'z shoez when u talk abt peacetime trng. 2 main concernz shld come 2 mind; safety &amp; standardz. d org has been trying itz best 2 strike a very delicate balance between d 2 so as not 2 compromise any1 of 'em. peacetime trng iz oso 2 train an individual 2 his best on d role he playz in war, during d fragile peace tt we enjoy now. yes, CST iz all abt survival but survival from wat? it'z not juz abt finding food &amp; avoid detection etc. it oso includez survival from torture. intel playz a major part in how a war iz fought. 2 gather intel iz hard but 2 guard it when u're being tortured as a POW iz even harder. tt'z where CST comez into play. dun u think those who'd successfully completed CST wld hv a higher chance of survivability in a real war?<br><br><strong>"the point is u can dont tell the trainee that they still pass if they leak out the info...but do we have to kill them?"</strong><br>d instructorz r not out 2 kill d traineez &amp; plz dun make it sound like they r. it was purely an accident &amp; not some kinda pre-planned murder. how'd u think they felt when they knew tt a life was lost in their handz?

do they know its illegal after or before the news? my answer is after...<br><br>do you dare to complain to anyone during your NS time about thing that is "legal"?<br>i guess you must have a good life in NS...<br>accusation onto me..i like it..great..<br>read up again..<br><br>unrealistic opinion??<br>its a fact..im not sure why you pull vocation down into this...its was never about vocation..as a human..tortured cant be train..thats a fact...aint a scouts human?? aint a Cdo human?<br><br>there are no such thing as survive from torture...if they wana kill u slow n easy..u still die anyway...how to survive??<br><br>yes i make it sound that they kill the trainee on purpose..you know why!!!!..cos im wondering y there are 5 more trainee who nearly die with 2nd Sgt Hu??? do you know there are 5 other trainee who nearly die?<br>so izit coincidence or what? simple fact is y the group before them gone thru it without harm? y only 2nd Sgt Hu group?? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>i will take it an offense once someone side with the instructors who cause the death..<br>i wont shaft it into your throat..but i will hit it hard into your brain..<br><br>but i have to agree with you..that anything illegal or legal that endangered life should be reported..<br>but to who?? Mindef Hotline?? if we go thru chain of command..the one who wana complain..do you think their complain are able to reach the O.C??<br>if we go straight to MPs..we are accuse of breaking the chain of command..n get charge..<br>only those who have good backing..or damn lucky are able to do this..or maybe a good PC..blah blah blah..<br><br>but your reason is stil valid..not like some in the other thread..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by dead_clone:</div><div class="quote_body">argh~! there you go again, always assuming... doesn't mean that if things are too much of a coincidence are all pre-planned, right? and what is it exactly that make you feel that way? were you at the scene? well, i'm not so i don't assume everything like you did.<br><br>i'm sure you're very clear of who caused the death. but have you thought about what caused it? why was water treatment still in practice despite its dangers? didn't anyone realise that it could kill?<br><br>does it really matter who created the "tradition"? the main concern is why was it allowed to be in practice for so many batches. and here you assume again that the one who started implementing the 1st water treatment was "some young 23 year old regular in the ranger cadre"...<br><br>i have to make it clear that i do not know any of the parties involved in this tragedy. till now, i still don't have any answers to this incident no matter how i snap my fingers. reason being i don't know everything. all my previous post are only considerations, not conclusion.<br><br>and it appears that you are the naive one. because all your replies so far shows that there is only one thing in your mind.<br>"2SG Hu was drowned to death by the instructors. they are to shoulder all responsibilities and blame of his death. end of story."<br>here i am trying to share with you some of the causes but you decided to get defensive and brush them off as "naive". you already have a mental block and refuse to consider any other logical factors that's not in tune to yours. it's not just about who died &amp; who caused it... not as simple as you think...<br><br>let me explain my views in this simple example:<br><br>in a narrow corridor there was a puddle of water.<br>bro walked into it and slipped. but he regained his balance so he was unhurt.<br>sis walked into it and slipped too. but she regained her balance and was also unhurt.<br>then came nephew and niece. they were playing when they walked into the puddle. coincidentally, niece slipped and broke her wrists when nephew gave her a push.<br>uncle heard the commotion and rushed to see what had happened. he then punished nephew for causing her to slip.<br>the puddle was later cleaned up by uncle.<br><br>my opinion is, why couldn't it be this way:<br><br>in a narrow corridor there was a puddle of water.<br>bro walked into it and slipped. but he regained his balance so he was unhurt. then he realised that someone else could slip too if the puddle was left alone. the puddle was later cleaned up by bro.<br><br>get my point? it doesn't matter who or what caused the puddle. it's about the responsibility of the 1st person who comes across it to clear it up as soon as possible to prevent accidents. did nephew make that puddle? did he intend to cause niece so much pain? why didn't bro or sis clean it up when they knew of the hazards? the puddle or the push alone by itself shouldn't hurt but put them together and disaster strikes.<br><br>and finally, you had to end your reply with yet another assumption. what makes you so sure that i'm not from a tough unit? you mean to tell me that a RP at an airbase had it tougher than i did?<br><br>i'm disgusted to see that you have a bad habit of "selective reading" which distorts my original intentions so that you can get a chance to flame me... you should change your those-not-on-my-side-shall-be-flamed attitude because it is childish...<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> </div></blockquote>ic..you insist that the instructor is not to be blame..<br>n assume the im assuming..you say it yourself..you dunno the instructors or anyone involve...there are some who knows <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>read the sentence on "some young 23 year old regular in the ranger cadre"...if you read carefully enough..you understand what i mean..there you are assuming that im assuming..<br><br>so to you the one with greater sin is those who didnt report the illegal training..n not the instructors?<br>answer me that 1st...<br><br>i dont have a mental block..sorry..i hate it when people come in here n throw in "the instructor is not to be blame..cos they are only doing their job n those who should be blame are those who didnt report the illegal training" theory..n its not logical at all..<br><br>look at your little story again...if the nephew never intentionally push the niece..will the niece have a broken wrist??<br>in your story..the water never affect the little ger..it was the nephew right?<br><br>once again your story blame those previous batches of trainee..<br>n the instructor was never to blame at all..the nephew get away with it..cos u assume its the puddle of water that cause the problem..not the nephew..<br><br>on my comment about you not being in a tough unit..i will sitck with it..<br>so you think RP in a airbase is not as tough as you? fine with it..doesnt bother me anyway..btw..you are assuming too.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>im not disgusted with you dont worry..its ok that you are disgusted with me.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br>i told you before..im pretty straight forward person..if you think its childish..fine with me again..i will stil bash my way thru..<br>n its weird that you treat it as flaming??<br><br>btw..about your story again<br>i assume it shld be like this..<br><br>"then came nephew and niece. they were playing when they walked into the puddle. coincidentally, niece slipped and broke her wrists<br>when she slip on the puddle of water..at the same time the nephew was pushing her.."<br><br>right?<br><br></div>
