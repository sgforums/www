NS is a necessity as a result of security threats. it's not meant for us to like. being adaptable humans, we are able to make the best of our 2 or 2.5 years in NS. not by choice, but because it's the only sensible thing to do. bottomline being this, since i perceive the keyword of this particular question as being 'like', my stand still remains that after taking away the security threats compelling the need for NS, i will very gladly do without. of course, the SAF also provides much needed employment especially during bleak economy. but that's another issue.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ok, I guess most people made the point about protecting the country. I like to offer another perspective.<br><br>I think NS teaches guys(who want to learn) alot of things.<br><br>And it is important you go in immediately with this attitude, because, frankly speaking, you do have to be the supposingly 'Siao Ons' type to appreciate what I'm going to say.<br><br>If you can work youself to sergeants, platoon sergeants, officers, you know that NS is very much like work in the real world. Even some corporals I know who are 'siao ons', get sucked into the operation office to handle quite 'high order' task. When you are there, you appreciate the chance to start training yourself to be a corporate worker, in a much more protected environment.<br><br>Sure, you can kenna extras, crazy punishments for stuff you do wrongly(or didn't do), but this is much kinder than the real world, when the simple straight punishment is a boot out of the company. Ok, in there, perhaps weekends mean everything to the average NSF, but come on, in work we have to do silly recalls and OTs too.<br><br>Of course I also understand people who already have deep commitments outside. To them, perhaps NS is a great disturbance. But then again, how many Singaporean guys start their careers at the age of 18?<br><br>Yes, I'm not gonna hide. I was officer-trained in NS. You can choose to want to accept what I've just said.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>No point wasting your breath, Nathan - if they didn't get the point after all that to-and-fro on the other thread, you're just going to keep going in circles.<br><br>For anyone who wants to know what the other thread is, go here: http://smsinasia.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=59607<br><br>Back to the topic.  I am assuming that dreamykite is somewhat lacking in literacy, and take the question to mean, "After the recently reported incidents in the news, do you still support the implementation of NS in Singapore?".<br><br>First, a caveat.  From the accounts I have heard from friends in other units, my experience was rather unusual; Commandos tend to hold a different mindset to those of other vocations within the military.  When I was called up for my vocational interview, the whole Commando concept did not quite tickle my fancy, so I made an effort to demonstrate the worst attitude possible and get rejected.  When a stern-looking sergeant asked me if I wanted to be in Commandos, I asked him if I had a choice.  When he said no, I said, "What the fu(k are you asking me for, then?".  To my chagrin, I found out over the next two and a half years that it was exactly the attitude they were looking for.<br><br>The turning point came about six months into my service.  There were a few factors involved here.  First, I came to admit that come hell or high water, I was stuck there for the next two years, and that the best thing for me to do was to get as much as I could out of it.  Once that happened, I started taking the job seriously and I would like to think that I made a decent effort of it until my ROD.  Along the way, I was fortunate to come under the command of a few men whom I can respect to this very day.  In particular, my OC and platoon sergeant were professionals in the most true sense of the word Â– they knew exactly what they were doing, and they did it with the minimum of fuss.  I watched them closely and analysed their method of conducting themselves, and it was an enlightening experience that left me with a few characteristics I carry through to the present day.<br><br>First among these is a sense of purpose.  Whatever I do, I make sure that I know exactly why I am doing it, what objectives are to be achieved and, as a result, what the most efficient way of doing it is.<br><br>This leads to the second characteristic: absolutely no bullshit.  I do not promise anything I cannot deliver, but at the same time I do not sell myself short.  Turning that sense upon other people, I have a good sense of when someone at work is trying to pull a fast one on me.  My professional reputation is built upon these two characteristics.<br><br>Case in point: a few years ago, my company contracted a senior psychologist to customize his personality survey for us.  He came up with an initial fee of $250,000.  I asked him for a breakdown of his costs, and ticked off the tasks that I could perform myself.  By the time we were done, his fee was $2000, and I cut the six-month process down to two months.  At that point, I told him (very politely) thanks, but no thanks.<br><br>Along the way, because we were trained to think on an individual level, another thing I took away from NS was confidence in my own judgement.  Rather than following the pack, I reached my own conclusions and took my own path.  Case in point: in one of my undergraduate assignments, I was the only student willing to state that the lecturer had designed the experiment incorrectly.  That assignment still sits in the university library as a reference piece.<br><br>One of the first lessons I learned during NS was that there is no finish line Â– 8-kilometre route marches went to 15 kilometres and exercises went on forever.  I still carry that as an assumption in everything that I do, and more often than not it has served me well.  It allows me to take the quality of my work that one step further and (ahem) in other endeavours, the ladies donÂ’t complain about it either. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>An overarching characteristic that NS has left me with is a sense of personal bearing.  This encompasses a number of operating principles:<br><br>-	do it right the first time<br>-	make an honest assessment of the situation Â– you invariably pay the price if you try to deceive yourself or others<br>-	know and respect the rules of engagement<br>-	keep everything, physical and mental, in serviceable order Â– these will come in handy for unanticipated situations<br>-	a gung-ho attitude doesnÂ’t carry the day Â– professionalism does; donÂ’t go shooting in all directions hoping you will hit something Â– instead, take your time and make all your shots count<br>-	at the same time, I have no time for shenanigans Â– everybody who has worked with me has learned one thing first: fu(k with me and IÂ’ll shit your balls out after IÂ’ve had them for breakfast<br><br>Over the last ten years, the lessons I learned during my NS have held me in good stead.  At university, they took me to the top five percent into Honours, and then to the top one percent of that group into the doctorate.  At work, they have left little, if any, for my employers and colleagues to complain about.  On a personal level, they have earned me friends that I can absolutely count on, because they know it goes both ways.<br><br>So in a word, the answer to the question "after the recently reported incidents in the news, do you still support the implementation of NS in Singapore?" is yes.  If anyone thinks otherwise, I pity you because you have either wasted a few years of your life, or you are about to.<br></div>

He lost his confidence and initiative then and get mixed up with the other Hokien beng there. Well... things aren't the same for him after NS...<br><br>About the title of this discusion... I believe NS is necessary for singapore. However a lot of people don't like it as they destroy part of therir lifestyles... Everyone have different experiences in NS. One very common bad experience is when one girlfriend break up wth a guy because he can't accompany him during NS.<br><br>Frankly... I thought most guys in SIngapore hate NS  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused">  From tis thread it seems otherwise...</div>
