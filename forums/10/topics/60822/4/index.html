            <div class='col-md body'>dead_clone, not only was I from Commandos, the instructor who is currently under scrutiny is a good friend of mine.  Despite that, I cannot in all honesty attempt to argue the case in his favour.  It comes down to a simple point: TSR stated exactly what kind of treatment was to be carried out, and dunking obviously involved the risk of drowning.  In light of this obvious violation of regulations, not to mention common sense, there is no conclusion to be reached other than that the instructor was responsible.<br><br>I would not go so far as to call you a naif, but while you do have a point about reporting, I think you have underestimated the effect of conformity imposed within the military.  Certainly some trainees would have seen the treatment as being wrong, but having survived it, and having had to spend their remaining time in that environment, could you really expect them to report something like that, even though it would be ideal?  If there was anyone in a position to bring such a matter up, it would have been the course safety officer.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>For security, Singapore inc (non-welfare state) should employ professional to do the jobs instead of getting the pple to do it. Where got company forcing its own employee to do security cheaply and somemore worse causing so much mishap ,lost of life and yet can shred all responsibilities by pushing the blame around. The management should take all the blame. But as usual, being pro-management, heads stay put. So who are the foolish lot? Don't give lame arguement stating not enuff soldiers and hence the need to conscript. Security in the company is the management's problem not the employee's. With a yearly bonus of only a few hundred dollars (ERS, NSS), they expect to earn the loyalty of its employee to die for the company? It is no wonder that more and more of its employee are quitting</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I seriously will like to know the real cause behind the death of the NS personnel.<br>It seem that the army is holding onto some information even after the investigations.<br><br>During my ns time, 2 NS personnel died in my camp. One committed suicide during guard duty...cos the next day he going to be charge. (i dont understand why would they allow someone whose going to be charge on the following day still perform guard duty).<br>The other pass away when he was in Brunei during a exercise. This soldier did told his officer he was having a fever, but still the officier make him go outfield.......which later he foamed...and collasped and pass away....<br><br>No explanation was given to why was he forced to go for execrise by his officier.<br><br>All NSF during my time were concern abt thse 2 issues....The coy of the soldier who pass away in brunei...even went on a strike until the CO pacify them....but still up to ORD, we never get an answer from them....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by MYPR:</div><div class="quote_body">For security, Singapore inc (non-welfare state) should employ professional to do the jobs instead of getting the pple to do it. Where got company forcing its own employee to do security cheaply and somemore worse causing so much mishap ,lost of life and yet can shred all responsibilities by pushing the blame around. The management should take all the blame. But as usual, being pro-management, heads stay put. So who are the foolish lot? Don't give lame arguement stating not enuff soldiers and hence the need to conscript. Security in the company is the management's problem not the employee's. With a yearly bonus of only a few hundred dollars (ERS, NSS), they expect to earn the loyalty of its employee to die for the company? It is no wonder that more and more of its employee are quitting</div></blockquote>i see..you are back..tot u ran away or something..<br>if its a lame excuse for conscripting..i wonder y u stop replyin that time? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br>you post the same thing again n again..i question you again n again..n you cant give me an answer...<br>btw i dun use "lame excuse"...infact none of the poster here use "lame excuse" ...who is the one using lame excuse?? do a facial dude.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br></div>
