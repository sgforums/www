            <div class='col-md body'>What if after studying a subject for a year, then when exam came and u found out none of the question ask is been taught b4 or none of the solution can be found in the note given by the lecturer? What would most s'porean react to this kind of examination? That is the kind of education that is been taught oversea.... They teach u the fundamental, teach u how and where to source for your solution and reading material, they teach u how to analyse, etc. Such way of education force u to be more independent, learn to read beyond and think outside the box. That's why ppl oversea are more creative and tend to ask why!! Here, most dun even ask why.... they only ask, will it come out in the exam?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

GOD ! u cant disagree ... and there is not point fighting back .. for my mid years, they talked about how not corrupted singapore is ... and its ranked the third or forth least corrupted in the world .. i challenged by saying that singapore's government IS corrupt and that if they werent, we would be the no 1 on that list ...<br>needless to say i failed my mid years -.- </div></blockquote>Praise the Lord for failing your mid term exam for you have learned an important lesson....on how to differentiate fact from fiction.<br><br>May I add that now you know the facts from fiction, you shall pass your final SS exam by giving the answers they want you to remember.</div>
