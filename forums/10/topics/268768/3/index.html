As an elected representative she has the higher duty than ruling party's need to save face to ask questions conscientiously without being subjected to such threats or admonishing for resurrecting the past conspiracy theory raised by former MP Jeyaretnam.<br><br>Does MP Sylvia Lim not having the right to speak on relevant issues like independence of the judiciary free from any influence by the ruling party especially in a country widely known and even admitted to be practising autocracy or top-down system.<br><br>Has MP Sylvia Lim not the duty to ask questions in parliament so as to get facts from ministers. If Jayakumar is so sure that the judiciary is fully free from influence by the executive directly or indirectly, he is the one who should produce full facts to address issues of concern expressed in the past or now.<br><br>For example Jayakumar should clear the air himself to many unanswered issues from the past as well as to whether the decision to transfer judges like Michael Khoo was made independently without influence by the executive since such transfer seemed to happen to judges after favorable verdict was given to opposition leader being sued for speaking in the course of electioneering process.<br><br>All that Jayakumar needs to do is to understand that in an age of globalisation, ministers should globalize and not continue to work like ostriches with faces buried under the sand and refusing to answer question of MP with objective facts by countering her with convening commission of inquiry to put her down for truly speaking up on people's utmost issues.<br></div></blockquote>haha, too bad MP Sylvia Lim isnt a duly <strong>elected</strong> MP eh. and hello, so what if she's a MP.

            <div class='col-md body'>Problem is not with Sylvia who would probably want to comply with all necessary procedures like checking up on facts etc before she speaks but problem may be the ministers are not willing to let MPs speak freely reserving their half-conceived right of reply by throwing mud back at the MP whenever any criticisms are not to their liking.<br><br>Everyone will start respecting all procedures of parliaments when leaders like tghe ministers are willing to be accountable and answer to criticisms without treating the MPs as adversarial. There is a larger perspective and larger duty expected of our ministers as leaders which they probably up to now still do not understand.<br><br>Problem is that although MPs are elected or presumed elected due to no contest under the GRC gerrymandering, and are given the right to speak on any issues and problems brought up by citizens even if rightly or wrongly believed, ministers who have a higher duty to investigate and answer queries are not being accountable believing that they could find fault with MPs instead with their other half-conceived right which they really do not have in the larger perspective.<br><br>If ministers refuse to discharge the higher duty and respect such rights of MPs when speaking in parliament then the whole system will break down with parliament becoming a facade for ruling party to do whatever they like as the ministers could easily find a fault with MPs instead of conscientiously carrying out their higher duty to citizens and country as ministers.<br><br>Ministers could then easily avoid accountability by threatening MPs with such intimidations of holding commissions of inquiry whenever they cannot defend certain actions or unable to stand up to scrutiny.<br><br>Are ministers willing to make the first move by setting good example of themselves and showing willingness to uphold the whole parliamentary system including allowing MPs to speak freely with immunity without any such threats.<br><br>If our ministers want to build a more cosmopolitan and inclusive society, they ought to change their mindset by leading by examples. If ministers instead of following the decorum of parliamentary proceeding insists that they too have the equal right to sling mud at MPs then this is not what Ministers are employed for according to codes of conduct for ministers.<br><br>So the constant reliance on issuing threats and intimidation of MPs for many years even for speaking on issues of great public concern with commissions of inquiry when MPs are merely raising issues and feedbacks rightly or wrongly believed should stop.<br><br>Ministers are not perfect as seen in the ministers' salary benchmarking and NKF issues and should be made accountable going forward. Being not perfect they should not be allowed to exert such undue authority as if they are perfect.<br><br>They should listen intently to all areas of shortcomings and should lead the MPs being being accountable before they could ask MPs to comply with every parliamentary rules or conventions.<br><br>If ministers want to uphold law and order there must not be two sets of laws one for minister and another for MPs. The law and order advice to citizens will not be respected if ministers refuse or are unwilling to take a lead to show their own accountability to the whole parliamentary system in this light.<br><br>Ministers have been ignoring MPs' role to question and ask for accountability of the ministers in many matter.<br><br>That is why under our system we have many problems left unsolved like the NKF despite years of feedbacks because ministers could shut the whole issue by telling less, not telling or issuing threats to the MPs to hold commissions of inquiry.</div>
