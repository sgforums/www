            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>I read with interest concerning this recent hoohaa in Singapore's political scene.<br><br>While I can't judge what is right or wrong with certainty, I do feel there are some points that one can glean from both the exchange in Parliament as well as the transcript of Sylvia Lim's speech.<br><br>1. From the transcript, my read is that she is debating the need to "finetune" the system as Prof Jayakumar refers to this new amendment given the perceived risk that this move may undermine the integrity of the court. Of course, this point can be taken both ways. One way is that external parties e.g. investment companies, foreign governments can take this move as a signal of tighter control over the judiciary by the government and in that context might now bode well for the integrity of the judicial system (whose ranking Prof Jayakumar reminds us is high and should not be "besmirched"). The other way to look at it would be Prof Jayakumar's point in that it attacks the integrity of the PM in that his role in appointing these members is towards the advancement of his/her goal.<br><br>2. In this case, the argument in this thread about whether Sylvia Lim has stepped over the bounds of her right to speech under the protection of the Parliamentary proceedings depends on how you interpret her speech. My own read is towards the former -- that such a move might not be in the interest of the perceived integrity of our system and that in line with Prof Jayakumar's point, we should not do anything to "spoil" that. Ironically, her intentions are similar to Prof Jayakumar's intention but he act is to criticize her for bringing out the danger of such of move and call into doubt her intentions for proposing such a debate.<br><br>3. As for evidence for Sylvia's point, I think as one other forumer has already pointed out -- the analog would be the role of company leadership in appointing their own people to external bodies to audit and monitor their own governance. Regardless of the integrity of these leadership, most observers would not look kindly to such moves. Moveover, when we look at the US system, we note that the choice of appointee for the Supreme Court Judges by the President is always met with huge suspicion and in some cases outright hostility by members of the Senate who are NOT from the President's own party. The recent appointment of the Supreme Court judges by Bush are clear cut cases -- where Democrat Senators took a very hard stance and seriously grilled both candidates. IN fact, one of the first nominee was excused after the first round. The gravity and manner in which such proceedings take place are evidence that most (not naive) astute observers realize that political appointees are in one form or another, explicit or implicit beholden to the person who appointed them. To make a statement as recorded below:<br><br>Added Prof Jayakumar: "Once (the Prime Minister) has nominated two members and they're appointed, his role ends there. Neither he or the other nominating members can direct the nominees to act or decide in any particular manner.<br><br>does make one wonder (as in any layman) how big a pinch of salt does the government expect us and other observers to take! He is of course correct technically that the PM do NOT direct how nominees act or decide in any particular manner. Yet because of the PM's ability and role to appoint them, it is highly plausible for the position of the PM to to influence indirectly along various guidelines and not in specifics; just as the President of the US have the indirect ability to influence policies of the Supreme Court by having that power to put their appointees.<br><br>Prof Jayakumar's following statement that these appointees would act in concert with other members of the committee is also equally problematic as Sylvia Lim has pointed out i.e. AG is also part of the government etc.<br><br>The government therefore either should reconsider this move or in a more transparent manner acknowledge the plausibility of such situation (even a hypothetical one) and create the checks and balances to ensure that such hypothetical do not get abused.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Professor Jayakumar has just ticked off Nominated MP Sylvia Lim in Parliament last week for resurrecting the past conspiracy theory of ex-MP Jeyeratnam in raising issue over the proposal to authorize PM to appoint key members of the judicial commissioners.<br><br>He interpreted SylviaÂ’s query as allegation against the executive with for independence of the judiciary.<br><br>He has threatened to convene a commission of inquiry to investigate SylviaÂ’s presumed allegation.<br><br>He forgot that Sylvia was protected by the Parliamentary Privilege of the MP which specifically enacted that MPs in speaking up in parliament was free from any prosecution, investigation by any commission of inquiry or tribunal.<br><br>Citizens are concerned with such frequent threats by ministers against MPs to convene commissions of inquiry just because such issues brought up by MPs are too embarrassing or sensitive to the executive.<br><br>It is suggested that if government ministers should be more objective and accountable to the people. They should not be too sensitive to criticism rightly or wrongly held and instead perform their duties to the worldÂ’s best standards since they are paid the worldÂ’s best salaries plus lifelong pensions plus exceptional bonuses unheard of any part of the world which the highest paid CEOs in the private sector are not usually getting. So ministers need to change their confrontational style and instead try to answer to issues raised by Sylvia instead of using political power to block her from such questions to avoid accountability to the concern raised.<br><br>If Prof Jayakumar cannot take such criticism in the proper perspective preferring to interpret what Sylvia raised as aspersions against him or his government then he should step down from office and let other potential ministers who could be more patient or objective handle such issue.<br><br>Ministers should concentrate on running their respective portfolio without any legalistic wrangling with any laws or regulations or the civil libel to fix the MPs over difficult questions asked in parliament. They have the higher duty to answer to any queries or issues raised by MPs or citizens and they should be more broadminded instead of seeking legalistically to obstruct MPsÂ’ performance of their duties.<br><br>If Prof Jayakumar insists on convening a commission of inquiry he should first convene such commissions to investigate whether ministers and senior civil servants are negligent in causing the many losses or irregularities of public funds as reported here by the Auditor General.</div>
