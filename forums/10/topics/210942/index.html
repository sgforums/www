We will never know.<br><br>there are also so many fallacies that we sometimes are led to believe as truth:<br>1. I can't help but think the majority of us are brainwashed to think that `opposition' = trouble = riot = instability. I dun even know where to start on this one.....<br><br>2. having an opposition meant less time for the gahmen to do `real' work for its people. history has proven that countries that operate in a dictatorship, in whatever form, are the ones that's mired in chaos and stunted development.<br><br>3. if you are not a white supporter, you're the enemy. again, nothing is all white or black. it's not as stark as one tries to make it out to be. in the end, the interest lies in singapore, protecting this motherland that is home.<br><br></div>
