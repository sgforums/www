                   23  as it is Jesus's repeat explanation of the '<strong>Parable of the Sower</strong>'
                    . <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%204:2-8&amp;version=NIV">(Mark4:2-8</a> is another version of 'Parable of the  
                  Sower').Matthew13 in all established versions/ languages may be accessed
                    from <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2013&amp;version=NIV">here</a>. Like any exegesis, the Holy Bible should be 
                  taken in its totality however due to space constraint, only <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2013:18-23&amp;version=NIV">Verses 18- 23</a> from the New International Version 
                  are appended as follows:</p>

              <td class="alt2" style="border: 1px inset;">18"Listen then to what the parable of the sower means: 19When 
                  anyone hears the message about the kingdom and does not understand it, 
                  the evil one comes and snatches away what was sown in his heart. This is
                   the seed sown along the path. 20The one who received the seed that fell
                   on rocky places is the man who hears the word and at once receives it 
                  with joy. 21But since he has no root, he lasts only a short time. When 
                  trouble or persecution comes because of the word, he quickly falls away.
                   22The one who received the seed that fell among the thorns is the man 
                  who hears the word, but the worries of this life and the deceitfulness 
                  of wealth choke it, making it unfruitful. 23But the one who received the
                   seed that fell on good soil is the man who hears the word and 
                  understands it. He produces a crop, yielding a hundred, sixty or thirty 
                  times what was sown."</td>

              <p>This paragraph, and several internal equivalents can with little 
                  effort but careful reading lead to the necessary exegesis of the 
                  passage. 'Sower' being the equivalent of the Church, or anyone 
                  understanding the "message about the kingdom" and speaking about it; 
                  'seed'/ 'the word' being 'message about the kingdom';  'ground'/ 'soil' 
                  understood as the 'heart' of the person being informed (and in 
                  accordance- its corresponding state, as described by surfaces such as 
                  'path'/ 'rocky places'/ 'thorns'/ 'good soil'); 'fruitful'/ 'crop' (and 
                  its corresponding quantities- 30, 60, 100) being the degree of response 
                  of individual's 'heart'; or, from the perspective of the 'sower' the 
                  degree to which the individual  from receiving the 'message about the 
                  kingdom' understands and continues spreading the 'message about the 
                  kingdom'. <br> The multiples of "hundred, sixty or thirty times" in these verses thus 
                  clearly refers specifically and only to the ability of an individual who
                   'understands the message' to 'sow' the 'message about the kingdom'- it 
                  does NOT reflect any particular return or reward for such 
                  'understanding'. <br> It is not to my knowledge anywhere else in the Holy Bible that there 
                  exist any reference of term '30, 60, 100x' as a measure of 'reward' from
                   God. <br> <br> By way of logic, anyone not anyone not adequately "learned in the 
                  'message about the kingdom'" ought to have no business spreading it. The
                   office bears of the Church, whose qualities are defined <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Timothy%203:%201-13&amp;version=NIV">here </a>also ought ensure that.<br> <br> Pastor Kong Hee's inappropriate application of the terms 'thirty, sixty,
                   a hundred' are thus an inappropriate misrepresentation of ; an audience
                   adduced to believing in promises of up to 100x returns, aggravated by 
                  inappropriate physical example portrayed during sermons- of an 
                  individual being presented on stage with cash amounting to 100x of what 
                  he gave, are ought to be misled into pledging large sums of money in the
                   misplaced faith of subsequent  significant gain. [pls see bottom for 
                  real life analogy]<br> <br> This undesirable situation has in effect a similar outcome as that of <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><span style="font-size: medium;">a '<a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/netdict/Ponzi%20scheme">Ponzi scheme</a>', defined by the Merriam-Webster Online
                   dictionary as: "an investment swindle in which some early investors are
                   paid off with  money put up by later ones in order to encourage more 
                  and bigger risks- Etymology: Charles Ponzi â€ 1949 American (Ital.-born) 
                  swindler"</span></span><br> <br> Given to the fact the multiples of "30, 60, 100x" specifically refer to 
                  none other then one's  ability to spread the 'message about the 
                  kingdom', the problem of having to keep up the semblance of prosperity 
                  amongst the congregation is ought become increasingly difficult and 
                  costly. The ultimate collapse of such a 'church', not to mention the 
                  fallout effects upon society, are then expected to be as great as the 
                  very blasphemy it was so concocted to be.<br> <br> <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Timothy+3&amp;version=NIV">1 Timothy 3:1-13 (New International Version)</a> refers

                   would be:<br> 'P' starts a 'Charity' 'tuition agency (TA)' [church] proclaiming to 
                  provide free tuition for needy kids [Charity]. For which the TA is 
                  granted 'Charity status/ tax exemption' by the relevant agencies [COC]. <br> 'P' hires 10 teachers and each is able to teach for 100hrs/ month 
                  (25hrs/week). <br> To the donors to his 'charity', 'P' makes 2 unfounded claims:<br> 1) His is the best TA/ charity in Singapore since his teachers yield 
                  100times return: i.e. 1 teacher teaching 100hrs/ month equals 100x 
                  return according to 'P'; to aggravate that, 'P' also makes unfounded 
                  claims such as that MOE would give the 10 highest parent donors a free 
                  Pr1 placing in ANY school of their choice.<br> Mean while, the TA invest much of its monies in other 'investments' 
                  purported to enhance the 'productivity' of the said 'TA'.<br> <br> If 'P' isn't a criminal, then what is?</p>
