              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Which doctored index are you using that do not tell the number of people living well in Singapore at this time when there are those in the age 45 to 58 group that still have not found employment since the last retrenchment exercise in 2004-2005 ?</span></p>
              <p>What index are you referring to that has left out those living at the poverty line in Singapore, and are eking their lives in their old age collecting paper cartons, and cleaning tables at food centers ?</p>
              <p>Does it help your Singapore any better by deriding another country - Philippines or or any other countries ?</p>

              <p> Yes, the Government under LKY had all the bravado to go against more experienced voices and pushed Singapore into a dubious merger with Malaysia that left us with a huge historical baggage of political problems that will last for generations.</p>
              <p>Yes, the Government of LKY had the bravado to push for a Two-Child Family Planning Program, and continued with the policy despite the strong advise from experts to the pitfalls that such a prolonged policy can produce. The shrinking population that we have today, is a result of the Two-Child Family.</p>
              <p>Yes, the Government of LKY had pushed aside all advise - even from within his own Elite Cadre Group - that a strong handed approach will only stifle the political interest in the young, which will affect the Soul of the Country; limiting the number of those who will respond with vigor and enthusiastic loyalty into the political world. Now the need for the talented to join Politics has to be attracted by the Million Dollar salary.</p>
              <p>Yes, the Government of LHL declared that 'THERE WILL BE NO SACRED COWS' - and yet will meekly turn over the worn out stones, glancing it, prefering not to disturb these stones but to replace it in its position - leaving a stone-hearted policy to be continued despite Singaporeans calling for its change.</p>
              <p>So much for the wherewithall to implement wrong policies in a willful way despite sound and reasonable voices calling for reviews.</p>
