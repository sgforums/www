            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Abstracted from The Straits Time 1st July 2007</strong><br><br>Steps taken to ensure it won't happen again. Govt rejects family's demand for $3m compensation<br><br>THE Government said it regrets an error which led to a prisoner being caned three more strokes than he was sentenced to and has taken steps to ensure that the mistake will not happen again.<br>A joint statement by the Ministry of Law and the Ministry of Home Affairs last night also revealed that the prisoner's family has asked for $3 million in compensation, which the Government has rejected.<br><br>This was how the mistake came about: On Feb 28, Dickson Tan Yong Wen, 20, was sentenced to a total of nine months in jail and five strokes of the cane for two offences involving abetting an illegal moneylender to harass a debtor.<br><br>But a court clerk added three more strokes to the punishment when he was preparing the paperwork for Tan's commitment to prison. The clerk has since resigned.<br><br>The caning was carried out on March 29 and the authorities said prisons officers observed all procedures relating to the administration of the caning, including verifying with Tan that the number of strokes of caning was correct.<br><br>The statement said that Tan did not object to the number of strokes he would be receiving on three separate occasions: on March 1 when he was being interviewed by a prison officer during admission to Admiralty West Prison; on March 29 when he acknowledged on an official document that the eight strokes to be meted out to him was correct; and shortly before his caning, when he confirmed to prison officers and a medical officer that the number of strokes was correct.<br><br>When contacted yesterday, Tan's mother, Madam Ho Gee Lin, 52, contradicted the statement and said that her son had alerted two prison officers to the error prior to the caning.<br><br>'My son is prepared to go for a lie detector test,' she said.<br><br>The housewife said the officers had dismissed her son's protests and he decided to drop the matter because he was afraid of being punished for insubordination.<br><br>To ensure there is no repeat of such an incident, court officers now have to follow checklists when doing the paperwork for commitment to prison.<br><br>Madam Ho said she had initially asked for $150,000 in compensation but raised it to $300,000 because she felt that the authorities were not taking her complaint seriously.<br><br>She said her lawyer, Mr Joseph Chen, then advised her to seek $3 million in compensation based on legal principles in the United States and Britain where the courts award punitive damages.<br><br>Tan is now on home detention until next month.<br><br>By Tan Dawn Wei &amp; K.C. Vijayan<br><br></div>

But you all call it democracy.<br><br>God dont create some man to have more rights than the others. We make ourselves above others to have more rights then the rest.

            <div class='col-md body'><br>you know ... my first instinct was to say no ... to not support the family in their lawsuit, cos it smacks of ambulance chasing to me, I wouldn't like to see Singapore turn into a litigious society like the states, where the crims seem have more rights that the law abiding citizens, and the people trying to enforce them ........<br><br>but then again ... I think it's ironic and hypocritical that on one hand, the powers-that-be talks of paying big money to attract the best talent for civil servants, and on the other, imply that they are not infallible ...<br><br>it simply doesn't work that way ... yes, a CEO or some other major executive may be paid a big bucks in the corporate world, but if he screws up, he'll be on the streets too .... why should civil servants (and "elected" representatives of the people for that matter), be any different, to get the best of both worlds ? to get pay on par with the private sector, and yet be insulated from the mistakes they make ? ....<br><br>it's hard for me to feel sympathetic towards a vandal and a loanshark runner, but a simple "it's too late" simply doesn't cut it ... it reminds me of other assorted screw-ups in recent years ... remember that blood transfusion HIV case ? ... I wondered if heads rolled at the health ministry, but i believe the victims got nothing much out of it (heck, the lawyer handling this case should go talk to those chaps too), and the blood donors got jailed instead ...<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The government's apology sounds rather insincere. Rather than issuing a rather impersonal statement through the press, it would be better if a high-level official or even the minister came out and apologised publicly.<br><br>Also, the haggling over compensation seems rather sordid and the figures should never have been revealed.</div>
