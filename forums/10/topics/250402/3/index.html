Rather, that issue indirectly forms the basis of their argument - regardless of its merits, that forms the basis, doesn't it? So how do you suggest seperating that issue?<br><br>Just like precedences are an essential process in any court of law in conducting trials and judicial proceedings, you need a basis for anything you want to make a case of. At the end of the day, Alpha-S' line of reasoning isn't far off from what some self-assuming criminals would use to justify their payrise - the only difference is Alpha-S, unlike organised crime backed by the constitution, does not have the authority to review their wages and increase them on their own accord, which explains the need for them to take their case to the IAC.</div>

I agree with you, we should not call it a pay hike, but a pay that was previously theirs and is only fair they retain their pay.<br><br>And I also agree with you, that in the fight for talent, singapore companies, ESPECIALLY government-linked companies, usually lose. This is coz our GLCs are stuck with the govt's mentality of 'CHEAP AND GOOD', which often results in them losing out to many other companies from other countries. Yet they continue to behave as if losing talent is a normal thing, and usually replace the positions with new people whom are cheaper.<br><br>The reason why we cannot compete with others, as in the case of SIA, may be that we may be focusing too much on cutting costs, and not on how to expand and reach out to a larger market.<br><br>Just look at what happened to our local companies, HDB and the govt authority LTA. When a project is up for tender, the 1st and foremost thing they consider is costs. The company that tenders the lowest project cost wins. And then what happens next are the following:<br>1) Delay in schedule due to limited manpower (low project cost), resulting in additional costs<br>2) Bankruptcy of contractors, coz they tender too low, and go out of business, resulting in delay of projects. Just look at some of the upgrade flat projects<br>3) Accidents happen, people die, just look at the Circle Line case<br>4) Higher maintenance costs. Things break easily coz the initial low project costs results in the contractor usually cutting corners, and getting inferior stuff to use in the project.<br><br>While the initial project cost looks good coz they squeezed it low, the long term implications are for all to see. That's why I think we CANNOT compete on the international arena, if we continue to remain myopic and focus only on 'CHEAP and GOOD' (In that order, and usually you can't get GOOD)<br><br>Just ask me, I just left a local MNC, and I am really peeved with the way they treat people. To them, no one is indispensable, and they lead you to believe that your low pay is already a good pay, coz no one will pay high pay to Singaporeans. That is untrue, coz I moved to a foreign MNC and they value me substantially higher than what the local MNC valued me.<br><br></div>

For the record, the average CEO's pay in the US is 827:1 of that of an average minimum wage worker's.<br><br>While such issues invariably spark debates of social justice and responsibility, I suppose, while recognising it being virtually impossible to reduce the rich-poor divide by directly adjusting the income of people on either end of the spectrum, it at least makes things more palatable if the income of the respective groups are pegged to some tangible factors.<br><br>It's one thing using market rate as an argument to justify a payrise, but a completely different kettle of fish if you were to use some nonsensical reasons to justify a paycheck that's many-fold that of other top players playing the same role in the same industry.<br><br>In this instance, it clearly is no exagerration that ALPHA-S has a very strong case simply because the pilots whose interests they represent are not even drawing renumerations on par with its competitors whose employers enjoy a similar standing to that of SIA's.</div>

There's just no way to manage such industries effectively if you invest with monetary incentive being the primary motivation and having unrealistic projected returns in mind.

            <div class='col-md body'>I would like to bring another point to everyone here on the retail market in Singapore.<br><br>Do you guys know that many branded companies view Singapore market as behind Hong Kong, Japan, Korea, and sometimes even Thailand? Most of the best products are pushed out to those markets, before they even consider Singapore.<br><br>And do you guys know why?<br><br>Its coz us Singaporeans in general, have also been tainted by the govt's 'CHEAP and GOOD' policy. We also like to look for cheap deals, and cheap bargains, and overlook quality.<br><br>My wife is in the marketing segment of a retail firm, and what is generally said of Singapore, is that it is a very tough market, where branding isn't what matters, nor is the quality, but COST.<br><br>COST, COST, COST. That's what we care about. I think we have more sales than most other countries. Its sale sale sale all year round.<br><br>That's why the retail is still in the slumps, coz our market is a CHEAPO market.<br><br>Note I am not blaming Singaporeans, I am just presenting this info to you guys on how we are corrupted as well.</div>

In their recent self-reocmmednations to parliament and people to give their own ministers yet further lottery style million-dollar increments, the basis was clearly not market forces.
