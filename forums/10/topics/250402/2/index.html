Its operating margin was 5.6 per cent, versus the benchmark average of 7.7 per cent. And net ROE was 8.9 per cent versus 12.7 per cent for the group.<br><br>The airline had the lowest return on equity among its peers and its wage costs account for 50 to 60 per cent of controllable costs, the report said.<br><br>Singapore Air chalked up a 50 percent rise in net earnings to S$1.458 billion ($963.6 million) for the nine months to Dec. 31, 2006.

Again, the pilots' counterargument (ie you should pay surgeons less since their operations also rely more now on technology) is valid.<br><br>So is my argument on why ministers' pay should be cut is valid (coz its easier for them to do their jobs now with IT)</div>

This is accountability. The moral burden is now heavier on them. If you have done a job where you are on 24 hours standby, you would understand the mental burden on them. Its like you having the burden in your head, though things may not happen, and you end up being really drained.<br><br>(3) This issue IS ABOUT the pay hike. After the entire fiasco that the govt went thru to insist on increasing their pay and ignoring the needs of the people, it would be interesting to see how theyhave the moral authority to tell the pilots to shut up.<br><br>Moreover, point (3) further strengthens point (2). since ministers say I must be paid more even though their position is to serve the people with their hearts (hence it means if you don't pay me well, I don't serve the people well even though its my responsibility), why can't the pilots say, pay me more since I am responsible for more lives?<br><br>(4) end of the day, which one would you prefer? Pay rise according to market conditions, and keep the good pilots. Or risk losing the pilots to other airlines, and hence increasing the risks of accidents due to having fewer experienced/good pilots and more new pilots being rushed to fill the gaps?<br><br>Notice that I am using the same argument as the govt. (Pay me more, or I will leave the public service, and you guys will get a dud minister that will bring the economy of Singapore down)<br><br>So at the end of the day, yes, these 2 issues are linked (thus this topic is in Politics forum)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ok. I shall just address one point here then, which is that of NOT linking the government pay hike issue to this issue. They are two separate issues. Unless people can see them as two different issues, they will continue to use their emotions (based on their unhappiness over the minister's pay hike) to state their support for the pilots.<br><br>FYI, I do support the pilots in asking for a pay hike. Anyone can ask for a pay hike. It's just that I do not like some of the arguments they are using as their justification for a pay hike.</div>
