            <div class='col-md body'>SINGAPORE: Air Line Pilots Association-Singapore (Alpa-S) is seeking to justify a pay rise for pilots of superjumbo A380 by saying that the larger aircraft is more difficult to manoeuvre.<br><br>Singapore Airlines, however, argued that due to technological advances, flying the A380 is not very different from flying other planes.<br><br>This salary dispute has been brought to the Industrial Arbitration Court and day two of the hearing was conducted on Tuesday.<br><br>In a retort to SIA's point, Alpa-S said "the advancement of technology in any field has never been used as a basis to quantify a person's salary".<br><br>The union added it is akin to saying that because a cardiologist can now depend on a CT scan, his consultation fees should be reduced.<br><br>SIA wants to scrap the multiple salary range system altogether.<br><br>Currently, under this system, pilots of different fleet types get paid differently Â– a repatriation model used by a few other international airlines.<br><br>SIA said "multiple salary ranges create differentiation which may inhibit teamwork".<br><br>Furthermore, SIA said it aims to continually upgrade its fleet, and if it does not settle the issue of salary range, there may be more problems to settle in the future.<br><br>SIA said as the average resignation rate for pilots in the last six years was a low 1 percent, the company could be deemed to be paying competitive salaries.<br><br>Furthermore, SIA produced a chart showing that in a comparison with ten international airlines, SIA ranks among the top three paymasters when it comes to the annual net income of its pilots.<br><br>Since 2001, pilots' pay has also gone up by at least 15 percent.<br><br>But the company, as a whole, is not seeing such healthy growth.<br><br>SIA may be profitable, but in the last five years, its return on equity is an average of 8.9 percent.<br><br>That is well below a 12.7 percent average of seven other international airlines which SIA uses as a benchmark.<br><br>SIA's average unit yield in the last five years was also 46.9 cents, while the average unit yield of the seven international airlines was 70.6 cents.<br><br>And with increasing competition, the company is unwilling to entertain the pilot's demands, for fear of further eroding its cost competitiveness.<br><br>Pilots' pay forms 34 percent of the company's total wage costs, and SIA assured its pilots that their current salary would not be reduced, and they can expect a bonus this year of at least 3.1 months.<br><br>The pilots are expected to counter these points when the hearing continues on Wednesday.<br><br>- CNA/so<br></div>
