Great eh? Reason? Oh its good to freeze pay now in good times than to do it in bad times.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Also, one of their excuses of cutting staff/cutting pay, is that "Wages form 40% of the total expenses in the company. So we need to reduce wages to lower the percentage of wage cost against the total expenses". Its the SAME excuse they are using now in SIA, "Pilots wages form 39% of the total expenses in the company". Now you see it...<br><br>In fact, to lower wages as a percentage to total cost, the other option is to... INCREASE expenses aside from wage expense. Buy more computers, more chairs, more golf clubs for those in the ivory towers. Expenses go up, and there you have it, Wages are now a lower percentage of total cost.<br><br>Its all a fiasco, and they only present numbers so alarming that suit their needs.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I don't know the entire story but I think that the pilots salary were frozen for a long time during the recessionary period and with their last CA, most of them got their backpay, increments and owed bonuses paid back. Thus it's really not very fair to say that they had pay rise of at least 15% since 2001, I should think.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The ex-Chief Minister David Marshall has clearly pointed the danger of rewarding our ministers with more and more monies in 1994.<br><br>Was David's Marshall wrong in calling our ministers worshippers of the golden calf in 1994 ?<br><br>If our ministers have been less self-centred and heeded his advice would we have lost so many talents?<br><br>Now due to the same self-centredness this loss of talents was blamed insufficient pays to our ministers. Is this true or is this only reflecting the same problem David Marshall was referring to - greed or worshipping of the golden calf?<br><br>Let us look at our loss of talented people to other countries since 1994. Despite our ministers being paid higher and higher salaries more than what they could possible receive in the private sector through free market competition based on actual interviews and fair assessments of skill, aptitude and experiences and capabilities known to private sector employers, we have during the period lost our best computer graduates to USA Aeronautics and others while our own computer industries like CSM was in a doldrum unable to make good their constant setbacks and having to complain about lack of talents and having to rely on lesser or less desirable talents who came only to learn and understudy with the ulterior motive to take over our citizens' jobs due to cheaper labour in those countries.<br><br>So now many years later our government who practised worshipping the golden calf is in despairs over our loss of talents which affected our making headway to compete with the world?<br><br>Who was actually responsible and who is the culprit for our brain drain?<br><br>But today the same leaders would rather put the blame of insufficient pays for their own ministers and their own elite connections.<br><br>Is David Marshall right or wrong on the ministers' pay issue ? If we pay more and more monies to our ministers will we build a fairer and more vibrant society to retain our talents? What is the experience we have learned since 1994?<br><br><blockquote>"I've got nothing against money. I'd like to have money myself! I'd like to have a house and a garden and dogs and a car and a chauffeur but, look, I've got a flat. I've got a swimming pool attached to the flat. I've not even got a car but I use taxis. I have a dignified way of life without being wealthy.<br><br>I don't see the necessity of owning a Mercedes-Benz and a swimming pool and a couple of mistresses. I think we've got our values all wrong.<br><br>You know $96,000 a month for a Prime Minister and $60,000 a month for a minister. What the hell do you do with all that money? You can't eat it! What do you do with it? Your children don't need all that money.<br><br>My children have had the best of education. In fact, I'm very proud of them. One of them is a senior registrar to two major hospitals in Oxford. Another of them is a consultant in European law to the Securities and Investment Board in the United Kingdom. They've had their education. There are no complaints.<br><br>I never earned $60,000 a month or $90,000 a month. When I was Chief Minister, I earned $8,000 a month. Look, what is happening today is we are encouraged to and are becoming worshippers of the Golden Calf.<br><br>We have lost sight of the joy and excitement of public service, helping our fellow men. The joy and excitement of seeking and understanding of the joy of the miracle of the living the duty and the grandeur. We have lost taste for heroic action in the service of our people.<br><br>We have become good bourgeois seeking comfort, security. It's like seeking a crystal coffin and being fed by intravenous injections through pipes in the crystal coffin; crystal coffins stuck with certificates of your pragmatic abilities."<br><br>- the late former Chief Minister of Singapore, David Marshall in 1994 -</blockquote></div>
