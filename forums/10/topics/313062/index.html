              <p>Singapore's cost of living higher than Europe's<br>Singapore Democrats<br>28 Mar 08<br><br>A newspaper in the UK, the Daily Mail, ran a story about how much more British expatriates earned in the countries they worked than if they remained in Britain.<br><br>The countries cited were Canada, France, Italy, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Singapore, Spain, Sweden and the United Arab Emirates.<br><br>What does this have to do with Singaporeans?<br><br>At the very end of the piece (see below) the reported read: "most of those (British expats) living in eight of the ten countries said the cost of living was lower than in the UK."<br><br>And get this: "Singapore and the United Arab Emirates were the exceptions."<br><br>Hands up those of you who've been to Europe and complained how expensive things there are.<br><br>Well, now you have Britons saying that the cost of living in places like Sweden, France, Italy, Norway, Spain and the UK are lower than in Singapore.<br><br>And yet the income disparity in Singapore continues to widen with the wages of workers here remaining stagnant and even plummeting.<br><br>Can anyone find elderly French or Canadians or Swedes working for the equivalent of S$400 a month as cleaners or road sweepers?<br><br>Can anyone find the British or Italian prime minister paying himself more than S$300,000 a month and his father another $250,000?<br><br>Can everyone now understand why the police had to stop the march and quickly seize all the placards at the protest last Saturday?<br><br>It is clear that we need to continue to shout, and shout loudly: "TAK BOLEH TAHAN!"<br><br>And there's no better time to do it than this coming May Day.</p>
              <p>How professionals can get 43 per cent pay bonus by working abroad<br>Becky Barrow<br>Daily Mail<br>28 Mar 08<br>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/worldnews.html...<br><br>Workers who leave Britain for a job overseas can get a 43 per cent pay rise.<br><br>A professional gets an average wage of £47,000 in this country but overseas they can earn £67,000, a report says today.<br><br>But it is not just a higher salary that lures record numbers of Britons to a life abroad.<br><br>The survey of more than 1,100 expats found they are "wealthier, healthier and happier" than they were in the UK.<br><br>Those interviewed included engineers, teachers, economists, accountants, IT professionals and those working in financial services and marketing.<br><br>When asked about their new life, they spoke in glowing terms about their decision to quit this country.<br><br>More than 90 per cent said they were happier. More than 80 per cent had "a greater sense of well-being" and "feeling better all round for moving abroad".<br><br>And 99 per cent said they had made "a good decision" to live abroad, with around 80 per cent saying their decision to move was "excellent".<br><br>The majority - more than 60 per cent - said they had "no reason" to return to Britain, according to the study by NatWest International.<br><br>David Isley, head of NatWest International Personal Banking, said: "Expats who have moved abroad appear to be wealthier, healthier and happier.<br><br>"All these factors have contributed to a better quality of life."<br><br>There are many reasons for the salary premium, said to Dr Frank Shaw, a director of the Centre for Future Studies think-tank.<br><br>Many worked for multi-national companies in the UK and were offered a salary increase to go and work in a foreign country.<br><br>Other countries are so short of certain skills such as IT professionals that they offer generous salaries to lure workers from the UK.<br><br>Dr Shaw, who was involved in the research, said about 20 per cent of the expats who took part in the research were self-employed.<br><br>Although many workers are moving abroad, they are still employed by UK-based companies.<br><br>"An increasing number of professional people are choosing to take their skills and expertise abroad," he said.<br><br>"In some instances, we found that there is an emerging generation of professionals who are choosing to work outside the UK for companies in the UK. Work is no longer a place that we go to but a thing that we do."<br><br>Official figures show record numbers of Britons are joining the exodus.<br><br>For the first time, more than 200,000 left in 2006, according to the Office for National Statistics.<br><br>Dr Shaw predicts the number of expats will continue to soar.<br><br>Around 5.5million Britons live overseas and a further one million will leave over the next five years, according to the Centre for Future Studies.<br><br>Researchers spoke to expats living in ten countries - Canada, France, Italy, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Singapore, Spain, Sweden and the United Arab Emirates.<br><br>The biggest winners were those moving to the United Arab Emirates, who earned an average of £79,000, tax-free.<br><br>Even in Portugal, which came at the bottom of the top ten, British workers were paid an average of £58,000.<br><br>As well as earning a better salary, most of those living in eight of the ten countries said the cost of living was lower than in the UK.<br><br>Singapore and the United Arab Emirates were the exceptions.</p>
