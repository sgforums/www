              <p>I would not be as harsh on the PAP ruling clique.</p>
              <p>There is actually only one ruler of Singapore and that is Lee Kuan Yew.</p>
              <p>There are good things to say about Lee Kuan Yew and there are bad things to say about Lee Kuan Yew.</p>
              <p>That is a topic for historians.</p>
              <p>But one thing is for sure.</p>
              <p>Lee Kuan Yew's era must end now or Singapore will never improve, never progress, the people will never mature and will never develop their talents to the full potential under Lee Kuan Yew's ruling style.</p>
              <p>So I say, thank you Lee Kuan Yew, but please fuck off now Lee Kuan Yew.</p>
              <p>50 years is enough.</p>
              <p>Fidel Castro also stepped down. He came to power in 1959, same as you.</p>
              <p>It is time Lee Kuan Yew.</p>
              <p>There is a chinese saying, if one picks something up, one must also be wise enough to know when to let go.</p>
              <p>Lee Kuan Yew clearly have no idea when to let go.</p>

              <p>I hate to admit it, but there are some truth in what you say. There are indeed very few good governance of countries out there that you can point to, especially in relatively young nation like Singapore.</p>
              <p>There are definitely areas the PAP can improve. I for one do not subscribe to all that PAP presribed. I think they hoard too much money for a start, and do not subscribe to their rationale of pay to the government. They also could have done more to the lower strata of the society here.</p>
              <p>However, you cannot deny the fact that today, your living conditions is not worse off than any of the countries that has gotten their independance post WWII.</p>

              <p>Oh,now u act like those PAP ministers,blame the worldwide oil price and food price surge for the culprit of cost of living rises.No doubt oil price n food supply does cause an impact to our living,but,our government can help reduce the impact by imposing some of the controllable factors to reduce the cost.</p>
              <p>Take Taxi fares for instance,the government increase taxi fare saying they are helping taxi drivers to increase their income n reduce the impact of the global oil price surge on them.</p>
              <p>But,if the government want to reduce the impact of oil price surge n increase taxi driver's income,they could have just reduce their "Rental fees".Let say,from 90 dollars per day to 60 dollars per day.In that way,it will relieve taxi driver's financial burden and also,wont cause taxi passengers to pay unreasonable fares when they take taxi to work when emergency.(Cost of taxi fares from Ang Mo Kio to Orchard during peak hours=$18++,Non peak hours=9.00+)[</p>
              <p>But did our Communist PAP government do that?No,instead,they raise taxi fees n make taxi drivers more difficult to find passengers to take their cabs n commuters to pay for ridiculous high price for taking a cabs.Our Communist PAP government just sit down there n let the cost of living surging.Now,who's fault is it?</p>

              <p>I would not be as harsh on the PAP ruling clique.</p>
              <p>There is actually only one ruler of Singapore and that is Lee Kuan Yew.</p>
              <p>There are good things to say about Lee Kuan Yew and there are bad things to say about Lee Kuan Yew.</p>
              <p>That is a topic for historians.</p>
              <p>But one thing is for sure.</p>
              <p>Lee Kuan Yew's era must end now or Singapore will never improve, never progress, the people will never mature and will never develop their talents to the full potential under Lee Kuan Yew's ruling style.</p>
              <p>So I say, thank you Lee Kuan Yew, but please fuck off now Lee Kuan Yew.</p>
              <p>50 years is enough.</p>
              <p>Fidel Castro also stepped down. He came to power in 1959, same as you.</p>
              <p>It is time Lee Kuan Yew.</p>
              <p>There is a chinese saying, if one picks something up, one must also be wise enough to know when to let go.</p>
              <p>Lee Kuan Yew clearly have no idea when to let go.</p>

              <p>True,this Lee Kuan Yew really need to go.He proves to be a terrible politician during his old age,just like Mao Ze Dong,who dont know when to let go.Sad isnt it?.....</p>

              <p>Although by right,Communist policy is to create a "classless" society.But,due to the fact that there is no general election,only one party,communist party is running the country.Therefore,only privilege ppl enjoy privilege treatment,while the majorities suffers.Look a Soviet Union,u will know why it falls.</p>
              <p>Singapore,on the other hand,although got general election.But,only 2 opposition seats hanging in the parliament like Ding Dong Bell.And similar to Communist state,only privilege ppl enjoy privilege treatment,the majorities suffers.So to me,our country is no difference to a Communist country.</p>

              <p>But i believe,whats more important is his "action".I believe Ma also know our PAP style of ruling is not suitable for Taiwan,as they have been through this one party ruling stage before as well.</p>
