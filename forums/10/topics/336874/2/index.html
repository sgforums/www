              <p>to run for election, you need to put in some deposit. or else any tom dick or harry will run for election. the money will be return if you secure a certain percentage of the votes (5% ?). running election is expensive, so unless have a serious conetender who is sure he has a fighting chance, might as well have no election for that area.</p>

              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissistic_Personality_Disorderdf">“A narcissist personality is one who is controlling, blaming, self-absorbed, intolerant of others’ views, unaware of others’ needs and of the effects of their behaviors on others, and insistent that others see them as they wish to be seen – susceptible to angry outbursts, blame, attempts to instill guilt, emotional withdrawal, and criticism. Such behavior originates from the self-perceived inadequacy in dealing with the real world due to perceived own defective nature, and will insist that others’ should behave in the standards that they cannot attain by controlling others’ perception and behavior towards them.” </a></p>
