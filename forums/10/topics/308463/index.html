              <p>I got something to say here.PAP lickers, supporters, lackey, fans, all sorts of name you can name them on... they like to put this words in their mouth to shut our mouth...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Look at Indonesia, Vietam, Philiphines...,they are so backward compare to our country.We should be fortune to live in a PAP controlled Singapore.We got jobs, tight secrurity and enough to eat and sleep.We should thanks the PAP for bring our country from the third world country to the first world country."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ok, all of you out there please debate here, if you agree to what the above statement is..., lan lan!</p>
              <p>If you don't agree, please kindly tell us why?Or please use your brain and think of a damn solid answer to counter them back</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My answer to these lackeys ---&gt;&gt;&gt; </p>
              <p>There was a PAP lackey whose son is taking examination.One day his son came back telling him that he scored 50% instead of 80% marks in his exam.His son was happy but not him.The father scolded him, heh you... why you score so little?You should score higher or better! Why not aim for the 80%!The son try to think of a way to answer back and finally he said:</p>
              <p>"Father, why should i aim for the 80% if most of my classmates scored less then mine!You should be grateful to me because at least i am the only one who score the passing grade that is 50%!</p>
              <p>Father, you always tell me must be grateful to the government that we are not those third world country.At least we got to work and eat.So, why complain?Father, so why complain if i did more better than my classmate???"</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To all of you out there, this is the story i going to share with you.The kind of government who always like to compare us with those Philipines, Indonesia... Vietam...ect!So as to shut our mouth out on their policies!!!</p>

              <p> A lot of people's minds are slowly opening up.</p>
              <p>Their level of political knowledge is slowly rising.</p>
              <p>They are now aware of how they are controlled by propaganda.</p>
              <p>They can see how Singapore is such a regimental and restricted society.</p>
              <p>They see how creativity, innovation cannot prosper under such conditions.</p>
              <p>Some people blindly support PAP because they are uninformed, it cannot be blamed.</p>

              <p>I got something to say here.PAP lickers, supporters, lackey,
              fans, all sorts of name you can name them on... they like to put
              this words in their mouth to shut our mouth...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Look at Indonesia, Vietam, Philiphines...,they are so backward
              compare to our country.We should be fortune to live in a PAP
              controlled Singapore.We got jobs, tight secrurity and enough to eat
              and sleep.We should thanks the PAP for bring our country from the
              third world country to the first world country."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ok, all of you out there please debate here, if you agree to
              what the above statement is..., lan lan!</p>
              <p>If you don't agree, please kindly tell us why?Or please use your
              brain and think of a damn solid answer to counter them back</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My answer to these lackeys ---&gt;&gt;&gt; </p>
              <p>There was a PAP lackey whose son is taking
              examination.One day his son came back
              telling him that he scored 50% instead of 80% marks in
              his exam.His son was happy but not him.The father scolded him,
              heh you... why you score so little?You should score higher or
              better! Why not aim for the 80%!The son try to think of a way
              to answer back and finally he said:</p>
              <p>"Father, why should i aim for the 80% if most of my classmates
              scored less then mine!You should be grateful to me because at least
              i am the only one who score the passing grade that is 50%!</p>
              <p>Father, you always tell me must be grateful to the government
              that we are not those third world country.At least we got to work
              and eat.So, why complain?Father, so why complain if i did more
              better than my classmate???"</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To all of you out there, this is the story i going to share with
              you.The kind of government who always like to compare us with those
              Philipines, Indonesia... Vietam...ect!So as to shut our mouth out
              on their policies!!!</p>

              <p>I would indeed be happy if I was the only person in the class who scored a passing grade. That's your analogy isn't it?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you constantly score better than your peers, the numerical value of your grade is pretty meaningless.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As for the massive pap-haters on these forums, I really want to say something to you all. Think about problems in their original forms, and not allow the views of your favourite political party to sway your own.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Especially telling was the thread awhile ago where everyone was claiming the government was to blame for a freak accident involving a falling branch. If the branch came from the tree planted on the grounds of, say, ren ci hospital, the tune would not be the same.</p>
              <p>Yet, logically it should be. Blame is blame. Innocence is innocence. The target should not influence your judgement. There's a reason justice is blindfolded.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Just because on some level we agree with what the PAP says does not make us sellouts. It does not mean we don't want improvement. Sometimes, that's all it is...that PAP is actually making sense.</p>
              <p>The cliche that everyone makes mistakes holds true in reverse. Even the blind squirrel will occasionally find the nuts. Is it that hard to believe that SOMETIMES, PAP might be right? Do you have to automatically condemn everything that party says? If so, how are you different from PAP in silencing the competition?</p>

              <p>And, yes Sir i agree with you too that not every things the PAP said is bad.I am a PAP supporter last time.I vote for PAP until last year i stopped.I changed my mind to stop voting for them.Why?Because my mind is more open now.Unlike last time... my mind was like like a frog in the well.I still think Lee Kuan Yew is a great man with great vision.But, that's about it dude!I think, we should not really be so stupid as to vote for someone just because we think he is great last time.If only he stepped down and let someone do the job, and also pass the PM position to someone not within his family, i will still continue my support for him.But, what did he do?He made his son LHL the prime minister.He made Nathan the president.He made everything and as if just because he did something great in the past for Singapore, we had to obey him forever?Vote for him even if he did things against the wishes of Singaporeans?And, did thing not according to our constitution?</p>
              <p>Deathbait, really... my fellow Singaporean brother, do listen to your heart.Not listen to mine.We need someone more better then LKY and LHL.We need to have more check and balance in our government to protect our constituion.We are found by the British, not found by Lee Kuan Yew family.Our national song was not written by him.Rememer this Deathbait, we are one people one nation one Singapore.We are not Lee Kuan Yew family citizens.If we are, there won't be any poor citizens around because he will take good care of them!!!</p>

              <p>I really don't see what all the complaining is about. Every government in EVERY country has its faults. And everyone can say that they can do better in another person's shoes. Singapore has done better than most and can still do better. Can the PAP do better? Of course. Have they done a good job? Probably.</p>
              <p>The bottom line is how one chooses to see the situation. There are positives and negatives in all. You choose whether you see the glass as half full or half empty. Just be grateful that you did not have to go through the hard times when Singapore was being built up.</p>
              <p>People are very good at criticising when they are not doing the job. Walk a mile in another person's shoes before deciding to make a lot more noise?</p>

I think that Singaporeans now are well versed and educated enough to know when the better person shows up. Until then, we have got to work with what we've got. I for one would love to see what would happen if the opposition (whoever that might be) were voted in for a change... don't go on complaining if you get your wish and these other people stuff things up even more...</p>
