              <p>QUOTE:<br> “Greenspan says U.S. “on the edge” of recession<br> By Anna Driver and Eileen O’Grady Reuters<br> Published: February 15, 2008</p>
              <p>HOUSTON: Former U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan on
              Thursday said the U.S. economy is “clearly on the edge” of a recession.</p>
              <p>Greenspan said the economy will continue to erode until there is a stabilization of U.S. housing prices.</p>
              <p>“We have a long way to go” before housing prices hit a bottom, Greenspan told energy executives at the CERA conference.</p>
              <p>High oil prices are dragging on the economy, but the fact that they haven’t done more damage shows its resiliency.</p>
              <p>“It’s a burden now,” Greenspan said. He added that it’s “quite
              remarkable” that the U.S. economy is “able to do reasonably well” with
              oil prices near historic highs.</p>
              <p>Crude oil futures hit above $95 a barrel on Thursday and went above $100 in early January.</p>
              <p>Greenspan again — as he had last month — said that the likelihood of
              the U.S. economy going into recession was “50 percent or better.”</p>
              <p>He said the U.S. economy was growing at “stall speed.”</p>
              <p>“Stagflation is too strong a term for what we are on the edge of,” Greenspan said.</p>
              <p>The subprime mortgage crisis would already have put the United
              States into recession if U.S. businesses weren’t healthy in part as the
              result of years of low interest rates, Greenspan said.</p>
              <p>“If businesses weren’t in extraordinarily good shape, I have no
              doubt we wouldn’t be asking if we’re in a recession, but how long and
              how deep,” Greenspan said.</p>
              <p>“Obviously, they (businesses) are not pushed for credit,” said Greenspan.</p>
              <p>Banks have cut back lending and will continue tight controls on
              borrowing until housing prices backed by subprime mortgages stabilize,
              said Greenspan.</p>
              <p>Greenspan made his comments in response to questions by Daniel Yergin, chairman of CERA.</p>
              <p>Greenspan said he would like to see additional use of electric cars.</p>
              <p>Nuclear power makes the “most sense” to increase U.S. power
              generation when all trade-offs are weighed, he said. “We have to use
              nuclear,” Greenspan said.</p>
              <p>He said more discussion is needed before any “cap” is created as part of a U.S. cap-and-trade carbon program.</p>
              <p>A carbon cap would likely lead to lower economic activity and higher
              unemployment if one were set before emissions-cutting technology is
              widespread, Greenspan said.</p>
              <p>Greenspan said he doubted that technological advances will solve the problem of growing carbon dioxide emissions.</p>
              <p>“If you don’t have a significant amount to trade, a lot of people
              won’t be able to trade and won’t have the energy they need,” Greenspan
              said.</p>
              <p>(Additional reporting by Erwin Seba in Houston; writing by Bernie Woodall; Editing by Gary Hill)”<br> UNQUOTE</p>
              <p>Study how Greenspan will resolve the many economic and social problems as compared with our own Finance Minister’s perspective.</p>
              <p>For years we have seen our Finance Minister’s speeches in parliament
              during presentation of annual budget. It is a partial budget based on
              Incomes &amp; Expenditure concept without revealing huge capital gains
              and extraordinary profits made by all corporatized basic services which
              stayed concealed year after year giving a distorted view of our surplus
              or deficit.</p>
              <p>Now let us look at the annual incomes and expenditures for 2007
              audited account again. Has it contained the Billions chalked up by
              state land sales, HDB flat sales, JTC land/property sales, URA and LTA
              sales and all the proceeds from transfer of people’s assets of lands
              and infrastructures taken over by GLCs upon corporations or
              privatizations to withhold or cut down government tax spending on basic
              services to the people?</p>
              <p>The extraordinary capital gains made by SLA, HDB, URA have amounted to some $6 billions as reported sometime in 2007.</p>
              <p>Has this figure been included in the bottom line of the annual budget?</p>
              <p>Singapore government’s traditional annual budget is so far at best a
              white-wash or window dressing or creative accounting like NKF has done
              and is not something really creative or strategic enough to drive the
              economy.</p>
              <p>It is reactionary responding to criticisms and trying to patch up unhappiness a bit here and a bit there with a bit of goodies.</p>
              <p>To solve the perennial rising costs of living and the stagnated
              median wages for prolonged periods now since the 1997 financial crisis
              it is time for our new Finance Minister to present his annual budget
              reflecting the full incomes with information showing cuts in spending
              on essential government services due to corporatisation so as to make
              the tax burdens less onerous and more sustainable (since basic services
              are progressively passed to GLCs charging full market fees) for the
              longer term.</p>
              <p>The whole Annual Budget should be transparent and not hide any
              hidden profits or extraordinary gains made by SLA or HDB due to
              double-charging on lands and infrastructures already paid for by
              citizens with past tax monies.</p>
              <p>Try to eliminate all the hidden profiteering schemes through GLCs
              put in place by previous government under LKY which so far GCT nor LHL
              has failed to solve.</p>
              <p>Government is elected to serve the people and solve their problems of living, working and competing for a job in this world.</p>
              <p>Establish a people-centred annual budget to address root causes of our problems.</p>
              <p>Do not hide profits made by SLA, HDB or URA from lands and infrastructures and assets already owned by them and funded by taxes.</p>
              <p>Do not double-charge on lands and assets in respect of basic
              services like medical care, transportation, utility, telecommunication,
              public and welfare institutions.</p>
              <p>Adopt a master economic planning strategy as recommended by
              Greenspan to save on energy bills and maximise our surpluses to benefit
              our job creations rather than giving away jobs to UBS or Citibank or
              Shin Corp.</p>
              <p>existing resources to help save costs of operations and off rising inflation and energy costs.</p>
              <p>Pass back all such savings including returns from surplus
              investments and plow back such profits in the form of endowment funds
              to prevent any further over-taxing and back-charging and under-spending
              thereby stalling our economic competitiveness.</p>
              <p>Since ministers are being paid fullest market salaries (for bill
              collector jobs) the government should do away with their life pensions
              which will be a great burden to the people.</p>
              <p>As long as the median income is stagnated at around $2000.00 pm,
              ministers and civil servants should not rely on artificial arbitrary
              devices like NWC or their own parliamentary votes to increase their
              salaries by 7-14% as clearly people are being left behind as against
              the PAP election manifesto or our national pledge.</p>

              <p>Repealing the Estate Duty Act favours the super-rich, because current exemptions are already up to $9 million for property and $600,000 for CPF. It is not beneficial for serfs like us.</p>

              <p>on your point about Govt hiding the revenue from land sales somewhere, suggest you read the response given in the 2007 budget wrap-up, esp. pages 5 and 6.</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.mof.gov.sg/budget_2007/budget_speech/downloads/FY2007_Budget_Debate_Roundup_Speech.pdf">http://www.mof.gov.sg/budget_2007/budget_speech/downloads/FY2007_Budget_Debate_Roundup_Speech.pdf</a></p>
              <p>Issue of revenue from land sales was brought up by Opposition politicians. </p>
              <p>In gist, the Govt is not hiding revenue from land sales.  Rather, revenue from land sales are channelled directly into the Presidential reserves.  Govt cannot touch these reserves unless President gives consent. As a result, revenue from all the land sales last year does not go straight into the operating income of the budget.</p>
              <p>Opposition politicians have disagreed with this conservative approach.  The argument is that revenue from land sales, or at least some of it, should go into annual operating income for Government. </p>
