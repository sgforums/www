See how many flats remain dark.. With many unemployed, bankruptcy is at a record high..<br><br>All is definately not well with singaporeans.. But NO.. many still live in self denial mode and put on blinkers of cosmetic to show...<br><br>With only a small minority who flash their high lifestyle, it is often depicted as the lifestyle of the general singaporean population as a whole...</div>

In a dictatorship, they control the public media and silence your voices..<br><br>In a dictatorship, the circus parliament will ignore your problems.. In a dictatorship, the leaders get to keep their job even if they cannot deliver or perform poorly.. They will continue to get millions of salary even if economy declines..<br><br>This authoritarian system in SG must not remain any longer.. SG was a thriving port even before LKY became PM, and that was even after the British shipped the profits back to their queen..

A truly innovative but GREEDY politician can circumvent that easily by legimitising 'undertable corruption'(illegal) in more ways than one when absolutely power is gained ie a grossly overpaid income (legal)..<br><br>Being the highest paid politicians in the world that is NOT proportionate to the size of the country (be it geographically or demographically) governed or the GDP it produces in comparison to others in the world, I proclaimed PAP style is legalised corruption..<br><br>In democracy, people can hold their govt accountable for their actions, but the moment you do that in singapore, you will be identify, arrest without a trial, make a bankrupt or worse, sent you to IMH for observation..<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I guess you can appreciate all the PAP has done, I do. However, that is the past, we are not voting for histroy, but for the future.<br><br>U said my friend that, I quote 'The opposition is no better.' Fact is, you have tacitly agreed that the government does present some flaws right?<br><br>That said, I believe we are all Singaporeans, we have our own views and it is our perogative to do so. Let us respect the views of one and all, be it different, and work towards building a better home for all of us to live in irregardless of the outcome later.
