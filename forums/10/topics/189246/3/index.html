They pushed property prices through the roof and then crashed! Now many are indebted and working everyday simple to make them and their GLCs richer.<br><br>3. They in the name of "upgrading" the hospitals, privatise them so that medical care in Singapore is exorbitant. Nobody ask to be sick and they use sickness as an opportunity to scalp the citizens. The ministers then come out and say that the opposition is exaggerating about health care costs.<br><br>4. for making life miserable in Singapore... just look at people in our neigboring countries...

            <div class='col-md body'>Think about it this way. Look at the bigger picture:<br><br>- Give your opposition party a chance to grow themselves. Don't kill them off now because they don't appeal to you. If they're gone, they can't recruit better future candidates.<br><br>- If the polls show a strong support for the opposition party, then in future, other opposition parties might go there and contest too.<br><br>- If the polls show a strong support for the opposition party, PAP will try to "buy" you back, and will give out better benefits to gain support. They will have to refrain from pissing you off with sudden increase in GST, bus and MRT fares etc.<br><br>- We need more opposition in parliament to question new policies. Then, only the good policies will stand up against criticism. Even a crazy mad dog will make the biggest man back off and think twice before trying to do anything funny.<br><br>- Maybe we won't get to see any big changes now, but think of the future, and think of our next generation.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Lets not forget, when LKY was just a lawyer at the 1955, he also go abt making speeches wad, u dun see the british charging at him carrying riot shields, tear gas and sub-machine guns, attempting to drag him down the stage rite. Put it this way, had Singapore been a more open and liberal society in which no one fears voicing his views, or their views are seriously regarded........do u thing CSJ would have resorted to all those. If Singapore govt choose to listen to Singaporeans do u think TT DURAI can have the chance of going scott free for sooo...... long?  Do u think there will be mis-adventures in China-investment, population control, things like that? The funny and irony thing is dat the DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC, ppls have to resort to use "white elephants" to hint the govt to open Buangkok? And our first world polices needs to act so speedly to clam down on the white elephant putter and the RGS girls. The worst thing is....... our men in white still can take pride in the white elephant saga and claim that they are always listening to the Buangkok ppls..... Our health minister also can have the cheek to claim ingnorance of the NKF saga.... in other countries, the minister would have volunteer to solve the issue and step down.</div>
