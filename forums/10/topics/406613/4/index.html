              <p>if they can/want to, a retirement age won't stop them. They can always quit and there's nothing holding them back too.</p>
              <p>Seriously the concept of a retirement age (for working) only makes sense if there's a pension. The re-employment thing is nonsense considering that if you base the pay system on performance, they should only get paid what they are worth and employed if they are worth it</p>

              <p><br>I think what Papa Smurf meant is that companies should not have the power to fire/sack/terminate employees using the excuse of retirement.</p>
              <p>Of course employees have the right to leave the job if they do not wish to work for the company anymore on their own freedom of choice and decision.</p>
              <p>Just imagined if you're receiving a generous sum of salary package from the company that you are working for and have been working for a long time ... DO YOU WISH THE COMPANY TO TERMINATE YOUR EMPLOYMENT USING THE EXCUSE OF RETIREMENT??</p>
              <p>Please...Singaporeans, please think more positively and exit your shallow-mindset. The Government aren't out to make your life difficult!</p>

              <p><br>1. The only reason that you have this fear of losing out to new citizens is because you and I and everyone else KNOW THIS TRUTH that Singaporeans are simply not united together as compared to citizens in other countries. Be it the excuse of Singaporeans do not have an identity and we're not loyal to the country and dislikes the government for no valid reason, with exception that we expects the government and the country to pamper us like Kings and Queens. And this is the childish attitude and behaviour that most if not all Singaporeans is adopting as their mindset at the present.</p>
              <p>If Singaporeans were united with one another and take cares of one another as fellow citizens, do you think there is really any room for new citizens to contest any jobs with Singapore-born Singaporeans? Your Singaporean boss and superiors don't even want to take care of their fellow Singaporeans like yourself, and you DARE to come and tell bullshits in here and complained that new citizens are going to take away your jobs because of government policies???</p>
              <p>How low and silly do you wish to sink further? Please wake up, because soon you are going to run out of people to BLAME! The root of the problem lies within yourself and the impoverished mindset of your own fellow Singaporeans!!!</p>
              <p>Stop blaming the government because you are stupid ok?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. So new citizens are not allowed to have dreams of their own? They need YOU to approve of their dreams? Who do you think you are to judge them anyway? Everybody also have their own dreams for their future, be it practical or not, it's just plain rude and insensible of you to judge people based on their dreams. How would you feel if I were to judge and ridicule your dreams? Why did people like you even exists in Singapore and I know ridiculous people like yourself are superbly common nowadays, but that doesn't means many wrong people like yourself are makes up for one right. You would rather they go to Canada than stay in Singapore if you really know the situation in Canada. Did you think that Canada is better than Singapore? If you did, then you are wrong and you should go to Canada and find out for yourself or talk to any Canadians.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3. Did the Government of LKY mentioned anything about not able to retrieve your precious CPF when he mentioned about not having retirement? Please open up your mind and read properly. Don't you know that you can continue to work and still continue to withdraw money out of your CPF when you have reached the age to withdraw money from your CPF?</p>
              <p>The young cannot progress if the old doesn't move on?? I really don't know what kind of stupid world you have been exposed to. The young will still have jobs even if the old remains in the workforce. This means that the younger workers in the workforce will be able to learn and gain better skills in the workforce under the apprenticeship of the older workers. Then again, this brings up one of your common dilemma isn't it? Did you think that the older Singaporean workers will be unwilling to show the younger workers the ropes? Just how many older workers have you worked with and how many older workers have you actually spoken with and formed a genuine bond at your workplace? Do all the above first before you come and tell me you are qualified to comment about it. The simple fact is that younger workers are so full of bullshit dreams that they are the ones who are full of contempt for the older workers, thinking that they are outdated. If you are a young worker, and you have a good attitude towards your older and more experienced workers at work, you will do better and learn more than any of your high and mighty peers. It's all about the ATTITUDE of the younger workers!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Rest your case ah? Then make sure you really rest your case ok? That doesn't means that it is useless for me to reply back and it doesn't stop me for replying back, unlike your other fellow shallow peers.</p>
              <p>But will my reply caused you to Unrest your case? That would be interesting to find out wouldn't it? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>The fact is there are many Singaporean guys out there that will pretend to be ignorance and deny all accusations in order to put themselves in a good light.

In this sense, the forumer I-love-flings (I think that's what he's called) is a more honest person and better person than many self-conscious act holy and superior guys in here. </p>
              <p>You sure you have no problem with your fellow Singaporean girls in here? Not displaying it doesn't means you don't have a problem with us ok? People will never overcome and improve if all they are concerned about is how other people are going to judge them and unsure if other people are going to accept them for who they are. I'm fine with how you want to live your life because I don't need to care about people who are only concern and busy with their own self-preservation behaviour.</p>
              <p>How is it equal or impartial when you are your buddies defender? Looking at your replies, how often do you really bothered to make any comment when girls in sgforums are having difficult times? In Aunt Agony, I don't see the frequency balance in your posts other than blindly following-up and pursuing most of my posts which are very irritating for me to reply and response.</p>
              <p>People grow and learn from experiences and their mindsets evolved based on the people they have associated with and the different cultures they were exposed to.</p>
              <p>In this sense, Singaporean guys have absolutely zero to little exposure to non-Singaporeans. So how do you want me to think better of them when this is how they are and have became? I don't need to babysit and specially accomodate anyone of them because I don't like their attitudes and their shallow mindsets and their greed and their expectations and their arrogances and their immaturities and many many more irritating characteristics.</p>
              <p>They should learn from people in other countries and change to accept them as much as they can before they ended up killing themselves and their own kind with their own foolish mindsets.</p>
              <p>And it really doesn't matters who is the government of Singapore if the government are being supported by foolish citizens.</p>
