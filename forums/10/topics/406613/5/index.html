              <div class="quote_body">
              <p> People should work regardless of their family background, and I'm poor because I'm not working and my family background is also not rich.</p>
              <p>Only you will know what you can gain from blackmailing, pretending or denying is the same as lying to yourself and I don't really care if you do so.</p>
              <p>The fact is there are many Singaporean guys out there that will pretend to be ignorance and deny all accusations in order to put themselves in a good light. So if everybody want to be good people, then where are all the bad people? If that is so, then I do not wish to hear any complaints or stories about bad Singaporeans. And I won't wait for "good" people to get caught before I judge them as bad people, I do not judge people using my eyes and ears without using my heart and mind.</p>
              <p>Ya..I shouldn't have exposed all your intentions. You guys are all holy beings and your cocks are just accessories and for show only because none of you are sexually deprived creatures. In this sense, the forumer I-love-flings (I think that's what he's called) is a more honest person and better person than many self-conscious act holy and superior guys in here. </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">You sure you have no problem with your fellow Singaporean girls in here? Not displaying it doesn't means you don't have a problem with us ok? People will never overcome and improve if all they are concerned about is how other people are going to judge them and unsure if other people are going to accept them for who they are. I'm fine with how you want to live your life because I don't need to care about people who are only concern and busy with their own self-preservation behaviour.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Why do i need to care now u think of me at this juncture. I am more concerned with YOU treating those who serve NS with garbage and dirt, when they have sacrifised their two years, so that u will have a luxury of flaming people here. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">How is it equal or impartial when you are your buddies defender? Looking at your replies, how often do you really bothered to make any comment when girls in sgforums are having difficult times? In Aunt Agony, I don't see the frequency balance in your posts other than blindly following-up and pursuing most of my posts which are very irritating for me to reply and response.<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">check yaself first before u say me, how often do you really bothered to make any comment when guys in sgforums are having difficult times?In Aunt Agony, I don't see the frequency balance in your posts other than flaming your fellow country<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>men,</strong></span> labelling them as sex animals.</span></p>
              <p>People grow and learn from experiences and their mindsets evolved based on the people they have associated with and the different cultures they were exposed to.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">In this sense, Singaporean guys have absolutely zero to little exposure to non-Singaporeans. So how do you want me to think better of them when this is how they are and have became? I don't need to babysit and specially accomodate anyone of them because I don't like their attitudes and their shallow mindsets and their greed and their expectations and their arrogances and their immaturities and many many more irritating characteristics.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">I dun need you to think highly of us, just that i dun want you to look down on us like a garbage and went off happliy to embarce ang moh FTs.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">They should learn from people in other countries and change to accept them as much as they can before they ended up killing themselves and their own kind with their own foolish mindsets.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">We are not against FTs, we are against the one who do even bother to control the inflow of FTs, now bo zheng hu liao.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">And it really doesn't matters who is the government of Singapore if the government are being supported by foolish citizens.</span></p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p><br>The silly NS talk again. When did Singaporean guys like yourself became such bitter and sore losers to find the need to bring out the need of serving NS? Did you all not serve your NS willingly and for the patriotic love of your motherland?</p>
              <p>Bear in mind, you did not serve NS for the government but you served NS for the sake of your family and loved ones. Since I'm neither your family nor your loved ones, your NS trump card doesn't really apply to me. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
              <p>But you may continue to bring up your NS in futile attempt so oppress and enslave your family and loved ones as much as you wish to do so MORALLY.</p>
              <p>I did not bring up the NS thingy, you did. And you can tell us why you brought it up other than being a desperate sore loser because you were losing in this argument.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Feel free to check my posts, isn't that what you have been doing? I am sure that I have blamed both guys and girls and I have also helped both guys and girls. Have you??</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Read and re-read my post about not having financial security and job security which is causing the fear in Singaporeans regarding the FTs and new citizens.</p>
              <p>Read until you understand, and UNITY isn't about ME pampering, accomodating and agreeing with dumb and stupid people.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Did I not tell you that I will stop forcing myself to do things that I do not wish to do?</p>
              <p>That's one of those unpleasant things that I will not do in the future.</p>

              <p>so what if you win this argument? only you yourself thought to be the case. But did others declare u a winner? y the need to brought up winning/losing this argument, in order for others to choose u as a winner and i as a loser?</p>
              <p>i thought u say u dun need the approval of sgf peeps as your posting and flaming policy plan?</p>
              <p>winners and losers are for others to decide, not you alone lonely. it's decided by others, so let's say even if fifi declare u the winner for this argument, what about the rest. it's all about æœ�ã€‚u can win a war but can u win the hearts of the conquered people?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Since you say "I will stop forcing myself to do things that I do not wish to do?", then y must you force people to agree with you and declare u a winner? Not complying to it meant tio flamed. This kinda thing is two sided not one.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>I did not bring up about winning or losing, you did and I don't know how ridiculous this argument is heading.</p>

              <p>I only replied because you quoted my post and tried to argue against it. And you expect me to back off from my post?? Funny Singaporean guy~ <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But don't worry, soon your buddies will come and rescue and support you as a winner. Unlike you, I have no need for any supporters and I have none.</p>

When singapore population increase to say 6mil through mass migration, they earn more through tax and additional income ( electricity bills...phone bills...bus etc) as compared to when singapore native population is only 3mil<br><br>As you can see , it's a win-win-win-win-win situation for singapore govt as a whole , i have a better chance of winnning election , i have a better economy report card , i can earn more $$$<br>never forget the PAPs are a bunch of selfish people who only think of making more and more money , who cares about YOUR feeling? , how much per kg is your feeling worth compared to $$$$ and benefit i stand to reap if i mass import robots from PRC. &lt;!--IBF.ATTACHMENT_2472755--&gt;</div>

              <p>Do you think easier to attract PRCs than Indians, Bangadesh, Mynamars and philipinos? If you look at China economy, I think most will now think twice before coming here, and the mass of foreigners coming here consist not only PRC, be more prudent in your posting</p>

              <p>oz is not knwn for its crabs ....and seafood even though they advertised those guge crabs,,but me thinks its all propaganda...only thing big here are the crocodil;es and great white sharks that eat seals.need to hyave my own boat to catch fish.</p>
              <p>kangeroo meat...i cant eat something thats so gentle and with sparkling baby eyes.....</p>
              <p>eats only fish fingers and lamb.lamb is more evil lookin as compared to cow or other meats....swears i would end up becoming a vegetarian...me having heart beattin too fast due to red meat only in oz.fish comes only in cans or deep frozen.would love fish n seafood but unhealthy red meat is all they have over here.</p>
