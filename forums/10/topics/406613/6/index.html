              <div class="quote_from">Originally posted by parn:</div>
              <div class="quote_body">
              <p><br> 1. The only reason that you have this fear of losing out to new
              citizens is because you and I and everyone else KNOW THIS TRUTH
              that Singaporeans are simply not united together as compared to
              citizens in other countries. Be it the excuse of Singaporeans do
              not have an identity and we're not loyal to the country and
              dislikes the government for no valid reason, with exception that we
              expects the government and the country to pamper us like Kings
              and Queens. And this is the childish attitude and behaviour that
              most if not all Singaporeans is adopting as their mindset at the
              present.</p>
              <p>If Singaporeans were united with one another and take cares of
              one another as fellow citizens, do you think there is really any
              room for new citizens to contest any jobs with Singapore-born
              Singaporeans? Your Singaporean boss and superiors don't even want
              to take care of their fellow Singaporeans like yourself, and you
              DARE to come and tell bullshits in here and complained that new
              citizens are going to take away your jobs because of government
              policies???</p>
              <p>How low and silly do you wish to sink further? Please wake up,
              because soon you are going to run out of people to BLAME! The root
              of the problem lies within yourself and the impoverished mindset of
              your own fellow Singaporeans!!!</p>
              <p>Stop blaming the government because you are stupid ok?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. So new citizens are not allowed to have dreams of their own?
              They need YOU to approve of their dreams? Who do you think you are
              to judge them anyway? Everybody also have their own dreams for
              their future, be it practical or not, it's just plain rude and
              insensible of you to judge people based on their dreams. How would
              you feel if I were to judge and ridicule your dreams? Why did
              people like you even exists in Singapore and I know ridiculous
              people like yourself are superbly common nowadays, but that doesn't
              means many wrong people like yourself are makes up for one right.
              You would rather they go to Canada than stay in Singapore if you
              really know the situation in Canada. Did you think that Canada is
              better than Singapore? If you did, then you are wrong and you
              should go to Canada and find out for yourself or talk to any
              Canadians.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3. Did the Government of LKY mentioned anything about not able
              to retrieve your precious CPF when he mentioned about not having
              retirement? Please open up your mind and read properly. Don't you
              know that you can continue to work and still continue to withdraw
              money out of your CPF when you have reached the age to withdraw
              money from your CPF?</p>
              <p>The young cannot progress if the old doesn't move on?? I really
              don't know what kind of stupid world you have been exposed to. The
              young will still have jobs even if the old remains in the
              workforce. This means that the younger workers in
              the workforce will be able to learn and gain better
              skills in the workforce under the apprenticeship of the older
              workers. Then again, this brings up one of your common dilemma
              isn't it? Did you think that the older Singaporean workers will be
              unwilling to show the younger workers the ropes? Just how many
              older workers have you worked with and how many older workers have
              you actually spoken with and formed a genuine bond at your
              workplace? Do all the above first before you come and tell me you
              are qualified to comment about it. The simple fact is that younger
              workers are so full of bullshit dreams that they are the ones who
              are full of contempt for the older workers, thinking that they are
              outdated. If you are a young worker, and you have a good attitude
              towards your older and more experienced workers at work, you will
              do better and learn more than any of your high and mighty peers.
              It's all about the ATTITUDE of the younger workers!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Rest your case ah? Then make sure you really rest your case ok?
              That doesn't means that it is useless for me to reply back and it
              doesn't stop me for replying back, unlike your other fellow shallow
              peers.</p>
              <p>But will my reply caused you to Unrest your case? That
              would be interesting to find out wouldn't it? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>already the signs are clear, we are united in this screwup of policies that is making things worst there rather than better, that simple enough for you to comprehend?</p>
              <p>2)it is unfortunate that you missed the point: they are NOT loyal to the country, so why is the govt still giving them PR/citizenships?? in short they can run back to their countries at the first sign of trouble, but we can't, worst of it all , we have to grind our teeth and bear with it if we can , therefore i ask you in earnest : how much suffering and misery can a person take?? theres bound to be a breaking point, the longer it takes to happen, the worst the onslaught will be.</p>
              <p>3) again you mised the point : in the past a person at age 55 could redraw half his savings and use what ever he can, for now it is NOT possible since you can only take a small amount around that age but it is unlikey to do that as the retirement age has been raised to 65.</p>
              <p>4)as i point out in a simple reason or perhaps i point the loophole to this system:</p>
              <p>do you want to be stuck in the lower rungs in your job till your life?? for example a technician has a pay of max 1.6 or maybe 1.8k, so is 20 to 30 years down the road earing that pay ok to you , add that to get married, raise kids, do you think that is enough? for kids on that scale maybe 1 is ok, but the country needs now is more than 2 or 3, add in the cost of living here, do you seriously think that with that pay you can managed without some rebates?</p>
              <p>or say you are working as a clerk or admin assistant in say stat board or other place, if you expect that you can go up over your supervisors or manager if this was implemented, you are dreaming, your only shot at this chance is when they resign or go 6ft under by old age, which would be a very long wait, going by a assumed payroll of 1.2k a month , and wanting to lead a normal lofe, have a family, that would really pose a big problem to handling it.</p>
              <p>please note that these are taken on a normal basis, not when you partner is earing 3-4k or more that 5k a month, not many singaporeans earn pay that high mostly are earing in the few hundreds to a max of 3k range</p>
              <p>my suggest to you parn: go humble yourself, go out to kopitiams or anyplace and see it for yourself, go work temp is necessary, hear and observe in the background, then judge if what i am saying is right or wrong.</p>

              <p><br>1. LOL...united in NS with a group of guys that you are familiar with. How about united with a group of Singaporeans guys and girls that you are not familiar with? It's better for you to shut up and suck your thumb if you don't know what I meant. Don't make a fool of yourself when you're already a fool.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. How do you know people are not loyal to their countries? Do you believe what you hear or you believe only what you want to hear? Would you have preferred them to say they are loyal to Singapore instead? Would you have believe them even though they had proclaimed that kind of loyalty? The fact is that you have already made up your mind to distrust and condemn these people, that you would find all sort of excuses to condem them regardless of what they do or say.</p>
              <p>If you really need to hear them talk about their loyalty to Singapore, you can always visit the immigration place where they new citizens are swear in everyday.</p>
              <p>Else, stop finding excuses for your own incompletence.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3. What has this issue got to do with the topic? If this is an existing issue before the comments were made, then it is certainly not going to be affected or related to the topic we are discussing.</p>
              <p>Please don't bring up your old Grandmother stories and come here and pour out your grievances, because I don't care about your whiny tales.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>4. The biggest loophole here is obviously the one inside your brain. If you have already chosen and decided to look so low upon yourself and your future, then no matter what happened in the future would only seems to make things worse in your own pathetic life.</p>
              <p>Why not do some soul-searching and find some positive aspects of your life and strive to find even more positive aspects in your life in the future?</p>
              <p>Looking at your current attitude and mindset towards your own future and life, I can tell you that I am not surprised you are so BITTER against every single policies that the government is adopting.</p>
              <p>It's easy to whine and complain about other people behind their backs, in this case...it's the government. Do you ever use your brain to think of solutions to help yourself?? Keep relying on the government or any other people is not going to make you do any better than them, in fact it is only going to ensure that you are always worse off than them. Do you not understand my points at all?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Seriously I pitied those people who agreed with you and those who mixed with you. No positive energies could be read from your posts, and I can tell you if you don't change your mindset and start looking for solutions to help yourself, you are still going to be stuck in the same shit even when you're 55 years old.</p>
              <p>By then, take a look back and see what you have changed in your lives to improve your situations in your past, present and future.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Instead of hanging out with kopitiam uncles and listen to the voices of the LOSERS, why not change a location and go listen to the voices of the WINNERS?</p>
              <p>Since you are so guilable and easily influenced and superbly lazy and incredibly gifted in whining, why don't you change into someone that is NOT YOU? That would makes a vast improvement in your life and I can guarantee you that you will see the difference!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Continue to humble yourself if you are lacking alot in the self-confidence department. I don't need a person with low self-esteem to advise me anything because I am certainly not heading towards the same kind of path or sharing the same kind of future as that person. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Try to suggest some constructive solutions in your post, it will not only help you but also benefits others.</p>

              <p>You cannot change the PAST, You cannot do anything about the PRESENT, You don't know what is in the FUTURE. And whatever things you have decided to do, regardless of the PAST and PRESENT, will definitely change YOUR OWN FUTURE.</p>

              <p>If right and wrong is so important to you that you are willing to wait for it, then I can say that you're just a terribly immature and childish person and I hope you're not stubborn, because if you chose to stick by what you have wrote like a person of your own words, then I can tell you that you are just plain wasting your lives away and the time wasted will only become regrets which will definitely haunt you in your own future. By all means, go ahead and kill your own future because I really don't care about you. I doubt there is even anyone around you that actually cares for you. Looking at the way you have expressed your opinions, you do not know what is true friendship and definitely you do not look forward to your own future because you have been blaming everyone for your own predicament. Yes, this very predicament and frustrations that you are facing in your real life at the very moment.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>People don't get betray by their own dreams, they only get disappointed by their own expectations and many fools like yourself, think too highly of your demands and expectations that you imagined that is really your dream? Dreams aren't real before they were realised. You cannot be betrayed by something that DOES NOT EXIST!</p>
              <p>If you insisted that you can be betrayed by your dreams, then I will ask you to stop dreaming and faster wake up to reality. Because it's more worthwhile for you to admit that you have tried your best chasing after an impossible dream than to admit failure and surrender even before you have even tried chasing after any dreams you have bragged so much to so many people.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I don't blame you if you believed that I cannot see beyond the future, because nobody can see beyond the future. It's more fun not knowing about the future and it's more meaningful to find someone you loved to find out about the future together with.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But to make fun and poke at your naive and fragile mind, I can tell you that you will die in the future. I think that's really more than enough for you to admit that I can not only see beyond the future, but I can also see YOUR FUTURE. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p><br>Nobody is perfect, including yourself. And if you chose to pick on the mistake that will help you in your rebellious clause, then you are nothing more than just a trouble-maker, rebel, traitor of your own country, disturber of public peace, terrorist. So many names out there that shares the similar traits which you have protrayed in here.</p>
              <p>The fact is clear, you have no real reason nor valid grievances but you chose to imagine and cook up false reasons to fuel your irresponsible hatred or clause which is out to affect the minds of many and to create a complicated future for everyone.</p>
              <p>Really, INCOMPETENT rebels like yourself should be locked up and taken away for eternity. Really INCOMPETENT rebel trash, truly INCOMPETENT bragging rebel. Did I focused on some words that you are unable to accept in particular? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Don't be naive and believe that other people would risk their stable future in exchange with your INCOMPETENT future..if you even had any future to begin with.</p>
              <p>But as usual, you may create more clones like this particular account you have created just to argue with me. Do you think that I am not aware which is your real account? It's so easy to see from this topic alone. Now do you understand why I said you are an INCOMPETENT rebel? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Using my own words against myself doesn't really affects me because it's my original comments and you are just an INCOMPETENT piece of trash who can only try this much to throw my own words back at me because you have a terribly limited and INCOMPETENT vocabulary. I really pity and still amused when that's the best comeback you can return back at me. And why are you so stupid to really go and read what I have wrote to you and be so affected by my words? Did your INCOMPETENT imaginations also tell you that I might be affected by my own words? Is that also from one of your betraying dreams? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Contempt is only use for opportunitist who thinks that they can do me some harm by being patient and lying low for a good opportunity to earn my trust. In this sense, I have more information from people warning me against you than you have imagined.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Why bring up our ex-President to fuel your clause and use a respectable dead person as your shield? Truly, only rebels are specialised in such low behaviour. Did you do anything to love and protect and warn our ex-President? Did you do anything to save him? What good did you do after his death? You are simply an INCOMPETENT person who constantly needs to dwell and dig on the past mistakes to assure and console yourself that you are doing the right thing. People who knows they are doing the right things, do not need questioned or seeked out any reasons to prove that they are doing the right things. And the more reasons you tried to cough out for me, the more obvious and clear it is for other people to see just how INCOMPETENT you are as a person if you need to use a dead person as a reason to fight for your own bragging rights. Fight for your own reasons, nobody will believe you even if you chose to fight for some dead person. Because the fact is clear, HE DOES NOT KNOW YOU AND YOU ARE NOT RELATED TO HIM. You are just using a dead person as an excuse to cause trouble. If that's not low and INCOMPETENT, then it must be childish and immature. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I don't believe what you say and I don't think you have any reasons for your clause.</p>
              <p>But one thing is true, people who are INCOMPETENT of standing up for what they believed it, definitely do not earn the rights to label other people's post as EPIC FAIL.</p>
              <p>However if that does happens, then the INCOMPETENT person is usually the one who has failed terribly and requires the utmost need to console himself and cheer himself up by labelling the post of the winning person as EPIC FAIL.</p>
              <p>This is really a perfect example of true self-denial. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p><br> I think what Papa Smurf meant is that companies should not have the

              retirement.</p>
              <p>Of course employees have the right to leave the job if they do
              not wish to work for the company anymore on their own freedom of
              choice and decision.</p>
              <p>Just imagined if you're receiving a generous sum of salary
              package from the company that you are working for and have been
              working for a long time ... DO YOU WISH THE COMPANY TO TERMINATE
              YOUR EMPLOYMENT USING THE EXCUSE OF RETIREMENT??</p>
              <p>Please...Singaporeans, please think more positively and exit

              <p><br>Challenge you? Why would I want to challenge an INCOMPETENT trash? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
              <p>Take a look at page 4 and you will see which INCOMPETENT trash tried to challenge my post by quoting and replying it. And my post wasn't even meant for you.</p>
              <p>Why do you want to make a fool out of yourself by saying I did not offer an alternative perspective to the topic? Go and read my first reply in this topic and I believe it shouldn't be too difficult for an INCOMPETENT piece of trash to do it. But if you're just lazy, I can understand your INCOMPETENCY. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
              <p>Are you really afraid to admit that you started this argument by replying to my post which wasn't even meant for you in the first place? If you are not able to admit what you have done, then it is just a perfect example of self-denial.</p>
              <p>I am right and you are wrong. If you don't agree, then you may continue to set many examples of self-denial.</p>
              <p>If you chose to listen and believe in what the losers in the kopitiam are saying, then you are just another loser like them. Did you think you are going to be wiser by believing in a bunch of losers?</p>
              <p>There are losers and winners and neutral people everywhere, and that also includes people in kopitiam. Looking at your mindset and the dim future that you have decided to believe and endeavour in, it was super obvious that you have chosen to believe in the wrong group of people in the kopitiam.</p>
              <p>Really, so what if people related or whom I have known had one of those loser mindset? People are supposed to have an opinion of their own. But compared to you, at least they know what they are after and their opinion came originally from themselves. You only try to listen and adopt and then come here and make some noise because you believe you really know what other people know and believed in?</p>
              <p>Bottomline, nobody wish for a bad future and that's why everyone is working hard and trying their best to make a better live for themselves and their loved ones.</p>
              <p>People like yourself only desires some form of sick recognition from anonymous people in this forum by talking your unwisely nonsense. What is your real agenda actually? What do you stand to gain by throwing people's future off the balance? If you are not a trouble-maker, then you are just a society failure who is just trying his luck to assure himself that he may be a society failure but at least he is not an online failure?</p>
              <p>I don't care what you want. But if you want to post nonsense, you are free to do so. But IF you want to quote and reply to my post and opinion, then you must make sure that you know what I am talking about first and you are prepared to see it till the end.</p>
              <p>Regardlessly, this will NOT END until you stop your nonsense. Afterall, you tried to challenge my post with your nonsense, and I don't have a reason to give in, especially when I am having fun telling you off and pointing out all your INCOMPETENCIES. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              When is your retirement is not LKY to say, is how much cash in hand what assets you have (not the flat you own) that can produce income. Most of us don't have assets you have that can produce income, most we can do is rent out a room to earn extra income.
              Are we able to work after 65? Lots of people reach late 30s early 40s start to have long term illness, they may be able to live long not because to good health but today's technology. With such a health condition, are they be able to work? Even they are able to who wants to hire them? where their MC can reach more than 14days a year?! Most people having this kind of problem.
              Even old people with good health, can they work for hours?
              To me it is sad to say LKY live in his own world.
