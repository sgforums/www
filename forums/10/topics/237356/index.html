'I hope I'll never have any major illness because I can't afford treatment.'<br><br>Whatever is left of his pay is spent on transport and on his son's school expenses.<br><br>Most months, Mr Heng said, he's not able to save anything.<br><br>Which is why he hopes the Government will take up the National Trades Union Congress' (NTUC) suggestion to cut low-income earners' CPF contribution when the Budget is announced on Thursday.<br><br>Currently, workers below age 50 contribute 20 per cent. Those earning between $500 and $750 a month pay between 5 and 20 per cent. The rate is lower for workers aged 50 and above.<br><br>'Now, those who earn less than $500 don't have to contribute to CPF. I hope this ceiling can be pushed to $1,000, so that more low-income earners can have higher take-home pay.' - Mr Lau Lye Hock, president, National Transport Workers' Union<br>Mr Heng, who is currently saving $150 with the CPF, said: 'For low-income earners like me, higher take-home pay is a bonus. Perhaps then, I'll be able to save a bit more every month or spend a little more on my son.<br><br>'And with the upcoming GST (goods and services tax) hike, having more cash in my hands will become an even more urgent need.'<br><br>NTUC has proposed that with lower employees' CPF contribution for low-wage earners, their CPF accounts can be topped up with Workfare Bonus.<br><br>Workfare was introduced last May to reward older and low-wage workers earning below $1,500 for staying employed. And to coax businesses to employ these workers, NTUC also wants employers to pay them less CPF.<br><br>Again, Workfare Bonus can make up for the shortfall.<br><br>Former labour chief Lim Boon Heng has also suggested that the income ceiling be raised from $750 to $1,000.<br><br>This would exempt those earning below $1,000 from paying the full CPF rate, freeing up more cash.<br><br>But the labour movement has not forgotten about the middle- and high-income earners. It wants employers' CPF contributions to be raised by 1 to 2 per cent for workers below 50.<br><br>Employers now pay 13 per cent of monthly wages into CPF. This rate was cut from 16 per cent in 2003.<br><br>The CPF system was also changed to become more flexible, where the total contributions for workers below 50 can be tweaked to fall in the range of 30 to 36 per cent, depending on economic conditions.<br><br>'Employers have to take into consideration that workers made a lot of sacrifices (when the employer's CPF contribution was cut from 16 to 13 per cent in 2003) when the economy wasn't doing so well. Now that the economy is bolstering up and business is doing well, it's the employers' turn...to restor partial or full CPF contribution.' - Mr Terry Lee, president, Singapore Insurance Employees' Union<br>But now that the economy has bounced back, NTUC wants the employers' CPF contribution to be restored.<br><br>The economy grew by a stronger-than-expected 7.7 per cent last year. A record 173,300 jobs were created and the unemployment rate fell to 2.7 per cent, from 3.1 per cent in 2005.<br><br>NTUC's proposal is music to Mr Jeff Tay's ears. The 25-year-old operations executive recently bought a $400,000 condominium unit with his girlfriend.<br><br>The couple, who have a combined income of about $6,000, will pay off their housing loan of $320,000 partly through their CPF savings and partly through cash instalments.<br><br>Mr Tay said: 'If the employers' CPF contribution goes up, then we can use less cash. Even if we don't use more of our CPF savings to pay for the house, it would still mean we have more money in our CPF accounts.'<br><br>Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said in his New Year message that a CPF restoration would 'complement Workfare, which covers the lower-income groups'.<br><br>He added: 'Then all Singaporeans will be able to save more for their housing, retirement and healthcare needs. Our economy is doing well. The labour market is tight and wages are rising. A CPF increase makes sense.'<br><br>'The Government has been focusing a lot on the low-income group, but they also need to address the concerns of the sandwiched (middle-income) class.' - Mr Michael Lim, president, Singapore Bank Employees' Union<br>But employers, in particular small and medium enterprises, have raised concerns about a CPF restoration. They say it will add to their costs.<br><br>If the proposed CPF hike goes through, employers may deduct the increase from increments and bonuses.<br><br>They may also turn to hiring more foreigners as a high employers' CPF contribution rate may make Singaporeans and permanent residents more expensive to hire.<br><br>But Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew has said that businesses can expect lower corporate taxes to keep them competitive and to offset the increase in GST and employers' CPF contribution.<br><br>NTUC also wants to get on board workers' who are not in the CPF system, who are mainly low-wage contract workers and those from the informal jobs sector such as odd-job labourers and hawker assistants.<br><br>Currently, those who earn less than $500 a month need not pay CPF.<br><br></div>
