              <p>There's no takeover - SGX offered a couple of billion to try and buy a share of the Oz market.  Given how Singtel has gotten nowhere with Optus after spending god knows how much money, this SGX bullshit is simply a case of "buay jai see" - Australia's just done them a huge favour.</p>

              <p>not sure if any political indication. But when the news came up, ASX shares down 3.3% and SGX shares went up 6% before closing at 4% higher.  <img src="http://www.sgforums.com/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"> </p>

              <p>So the proposed "consolidation" is more of a defensive move by SGX rather than tried to takeover.  I think SGX maybe a subject of being bought over or diminishing role in Asia in rising financial Cap.   </p>
              <p> Money attract more monies.....Banks across the world are reporting profit from Asia. i would not be surprised proposed merger betweeen SGX and another exchange would surface this year.  Particular those who are interested in getting pie of the Asia funds.</p>
              <p> Australia is huge enough to be on his own world no doubt about it. but very soon if SGX is taken over by regime that does not served Australia trade policies it will find that there are no more supportive market available in the regions. It will find itself on its own again facing an Economics Giant at its door steps.</p>

              <p>Its is a business transaction, not a issue of small eat the big, but because of the raise in Aust $, the initial agreed upon amount by principle might had changed, and this led to the deal falling out.</p>
              <p>The objective of SGX is to be come a big global player, with Nikkie falling and weakening, a buy over of ASX could topple nikkie our of it blue, very soon SGX will operate in a full day (no lunchbreak) exchange board, this show the aggressiveness of it approach.</p>
              <p>As for ASX, the demanding for higher pay out can also be a way of getting out of the deal, after all, they dun wish to see an indian or chinese controlling controlling the melbourne stock exchange white peoples. On the other hands, the political aspect can also influence the decision to call off the deal, cos aust peoples will not like to see their national financial insitute to fall back on someone control, especially so from a once small fishing village of different races.</p>

              boardrooms, or if you’re just fantasising.<span> 
              You've made your </span>answer pretty clear by refusing to admit the embarrassing truth.</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal">Let’s see.<span>  </span>Do you
              want just recently or a career total?<span>  </span>Frankly I’ve lost count but let me do my best from memory.<span>  </span>I’ve been in boardrooms in Australia,
              the UK and the US, including:</p>
              <ul>
              <li><span><span>I</span></span>nsurance companies 
              (I was building an industry-standard competency model for all major
              insurance roles in conjunction with the federal regulatory body) - if 
              memory serves, the smallest of these companies had annual sales of about
               A$20 billion in 2001 dollars (it might have been more but it's been a long time)<br> </li>
              <li>Diageo (parent company of Johnny Walker,
              Smirnoff and Guiness amongst other labels) – that was an easy market-research
              gig</li>
              <li>Research institutions and universities (you'll be amazed at the amount of research money floating about in the US)<br></li>
              <li>Heathrow, LAX, JFK and about ten other airports across the world<br> </li>
              </ul>
              <p><span></span>These days, as a partner in a management
              consultancy, I’ve really lost count of the number of boardrooms I’ve seen; I’d
              say somewhere between 30 and 50 clients on multi-year contracts, covering public and private sector fields such
              as:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <ul>
              <li>Finance</li>
              <li>Aerospace engineering</li>
              <li>Nuclear research</li>
              <li>Utilities (water and electricity)</li>
              <li>Taxation</li>
              <li>Public prosecution</li>
              <li>Insurance</li>
              <li>Health</li>
              <li>Automotive engineering</li>
              </ul>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Frankly, I’m getting too bored to list the rest, but you get
              the idea.<span>  </span>Fact is that I’m in a position
              to tell you that your little boardroom fantasies are little more than
              conspiracy theories.<span>  </span>Boardrooms are not
              places for such petty bullshit, not when writing off a few million today is a
              no-brainer when you’re preventing a strategic fuckup that’ll cost you a few
              billion in a year’s time.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> Yes, yes, predictably you think I'm bullshitting. 
               There are enough people in Club 30 and Singaporeans Overseas who know 
              me in person, so if I was making shit up, I'd be going out of my way to 
              look pretty stupid. </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> Yes, yes, predictably you'd be asking why I'd be posting here in my circumstances.  Well, I keep in touch with the members I knew when I stayed in Singapore a few years ago, and it's the end of the day here, and passive income from partnership does generate a nice tidy amount.</p>
              <p>Any other violent objections, or would you, in an astounding flash of common sense, like to stop demonstrating how small-time you are now?</p>
