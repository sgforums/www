            <div class='col-md body'><p>Are the posts here an honest reflection of how Singaporeans in general view Australians?<br><br>When the treasurer initially announced that he would block the proposed SGX-ASX merger, he said it was a decision made in "the national interest." It was later reported that the main concerns about the proposed merger were around regulatory control and oversight of the clearing and settlement functions currently performed by the ASX. I don't believe that a reasonable regulatory arrangement between Singapore and Australia could not be entered into to address these issues.<br><br>Within a political context, the Greens made it clear well before the treasurer announced his decision that they would not support the proposed SGX-ASX merger (n.b., the merger would have also required legislative approval to lift the 15% foreign ownership cap on ASX).<br><br>In the current political climate, the Government is reliant on support from Greens and independent MPs in both the lower and upper house. From 1 July (when the newly elected senators take their seats in the upper house), the Greens will exclusively hold balance of power in the upper house and the Government will be reliant on the Greens to ensure passage of their legislative agenda through the upper house.<br><br>I don't believe the Greens would have ever supported the SGX-ASG merger, which would have meant the Government would need the support of the Coalition for the proposal to receive legislative approval (and this would have left the Government having run afoul with the Greens, leaving the Greens less included to support the Government's legislative agenda).</p></div>

              <p>Oh, I didn't forget.  You're just wishing I did because you still haven't provided an answer, and since you can't list any, logic dictates that your amount of knowledge about what happens at high levels the nice round number I specified in the first place - zero, just like you.</p>
              <p>You're apparently too challenged to understand the blatently obvious, so once again I'll have to educate you.  Whatever I asked does not change the fact that you asked how many boardrooms I have been in.  If you want to bitch about not keeping to the topic, why don't you start by hammering yourself on the head for that transgression?</p>
              <p>Funny how you keep talking about talking about ASX/SGX, but you haven't actually been saying anything about it in the first place.  All you've been doing is crapping on about Chinese supremacy and football teams, both of which have bugger-all to do with the ASX/SGX topic that you repeatedly and hypocritically claim to want to talk about.  My nagging suspicion is that you don't actually have anything to say about it, and you're just making noise to get attention.  The irony, of course, is that when you do get attention, you bleat about it.</p>
              <p>Yes, I'm rude, and I'm also bloody arrogant - I know I am and it's irrelevant because I'm also bloody good at what I do.  What is relevant is that you crap on about unrelated rubbish while claiming that you want to stay focussed on the topic at hand, which makes you a moron, a hypocrite and a flaming arsehole.</p>

              <p>How is China less corrupted than Singapore? Didn't you see the news of a family of 7 being forced to evacute when they just started their business in one area. The compensation was swallowed by the officials and the Seven knelt at the road to tell their tragic story.</p>
              <p>There is corruption everywhere but i don't think China can be less corrupted than Singapore.  They have no regard for human rights.</p>

              <p>Gee, are you really that stupid?  No, I mean really?</p>
              <p>I've already stated that I'm a partner in a consulting firm, but despite my describing the client list, you're obviously too dim to put two and two together and work out that the firm is either in Australia, the UK or the US.  Well the fact is that it's in Australia, and not only did I make partnership, it was offered to me without my having to ask for it. </p>
              <p>On top of that, four times a year my firm hires one out of typically 70 graduate applicants, and the minimum standard considered for applicants is an Honours degree.  The new hires are put through a probationary period, and typically only one passes probation each year.  Over more than a decade, I'm the only one to have been offered partnership. </p>
              <p>You're probably too dull to do the math so I'll have to spoonfeed you once again. The partnership, offered by an Australian owner, puts me in over the top 0.002% (that's a conservative figure, by the way) of my game against a whole lot of Australians. </p>
              <p>So you just keep playing with your little expectations, fool - I'll just sit here laughing at you while enjoying how the reality of my position easily keeps me in Wagyu and Bollinger.</p>
              <p>Yes, I'm that fucking good and I have the cash flow to go with it.  You, on the other hand, are content to waste all this time making up excuses and conspiracy theories - you really must have some significant inadequacies to compensate for.  I won't embarrass you by asking what pittance you make a month (you'd be too much of a coward to answer that anyway), but it certainly would be less than (and I'm being charitable here) five grand a month.</p>
              <p>And if you really must know, my arrogance is in fact one of my greatest assets.  Every Friday evening, just before I wind up the week, my team and I pop open a nice bottle of red and have a laugh at go-nowhere losers like you who choose to spend their time and energy producing excuses instead of results.  It's a helluva way to start the weekend.</p>

              <p>Frankly, I don't think corruption is the key issue here.  Autocracy, on the other hand, is a major concern - let's face it, would you want to make your organisation available to somewone who demonstrates absolutely no accountability?</p>

              gedankan is ............depending heavily on aussies for his bread n butter.u cant blame him as spore never provided or gave him much of a chance.in fact spore almost killed him in the process.dun blame him.
              
              for aussie degree.....if they are white i noticed even a forest gump or retard can even get into a university.u can see it by the these undergrads killing their own kids locked up in their cars on a hot day while he/she does university assignments.
              
              as australia is a primitive place with more low end industries as compared to spore.to them a singaporean shipyard with rusty towing chains and rusty broken down pumps is considered as state of the art already.
              
              u must forgive ged.in fact he should be pitied.
