              <p> </p>
              <p>PAP did not performed that well, makes mistakes, is not = evil... strange why people keep creating the image of a dracula govt..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>citizens themselves who blamed the govt also has failed themselves.. they failed to improve their own lives and those in community.. they constantly see themselves as victim of govt failure..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Although i point out and claim that some of govt failure... what i am saying is not failure of singapore in totality.. there are good work as well by PAP. At the end of the day.. my life, my freedom, is my self responsibility. i am never going wait for whichever party to rule singapore before i feel my life will be better... its too slow liao...</p>

              <p>1. Govt sets the rules (unless u want to form a party to challenge it)</p>
              <p>2. If these rules are relevant to your values and goals, then stay in the game</p>
              <p>3. If not, choose another game, just like me, but i dont hold the govt in distaste, it's a matter of realizing that you have a choice, not choosing to have a choice means you voluntarily give up your freedom</p>
              <p>conclusion - it is just a matter of relevance, there is no good or bad govt</p>

              <p>Say if the unemployment rate is projected to be 6%, everybody in Singapore works hard to improve, means unemployment rate will drop to 0% (or it's natural rate). <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p><br>i think that any body or govt who advice people to find niche market is giving sound reasons often taught in marketing and business subjects. Therefore , i dun think the govt make any mistakes by saying that.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Also, singapore has make our country very pro business and pro entrepreneur place already. There are still much room for improvement but you cannot complain too much.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Besides, I dun really understand your point. In what ways do you think the govt is not feeding the horse?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Personally, i think that govt has failed to groom most of singaporeans into independent people who has many spare change. The poor, alittle poor and/or powerless and complaining class is still considerably large.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>From my own example, i graduated from NUS but never got a job for 2 years in professional industry. I work in temporary jobs with thousands plus salary. However, while I blame the govt, NUS and employers partly, I do not dweel on it all the time. I just simply focus on what I can do most of the time. Minimize complains and maximize my own effort is my motto.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now, I still have little savings compared to if I earned a job with overall 3 thouands dollars inclduing CPF, but I am still able to save a certain amount after about 2 years of low salary. I still think that the govt system cannot save people like me from earning so low so it shows that govt cannot only help so much only to his citizens.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In a sense, this is their failure because they cannot make use of their large resources the have those who can only earn a little. In the end, I still am depending on myself mostly and continue to look out for any govt assistances or jobs fairs or any other income methods to increase my salary.</p>

              <p>From my own example, i graduated from NUS but never got a job for 2 years in professional industry. I work in temporary jobs with thousands plus salary. However, while I blame the govt, NUS and employers partly, I do not dweel on it all the time. I just simply focus on what I can do most of the time. Minimize complains and maximize my own effort is my motto.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now, I still have little savings compared to if I earned a job with overall 3 thouands dollars inclduing CPF, but I am still able to save a certain amount after about 2 years of low salary. I still think that the govt system cannot save people like me from earning so low so it shows that govt cannot only help so much only to his citizens.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In a sense, this is their failure because they cannot make use of their large resources the have those who can only earn a little. In the end, I still am depending on myself mostly and continue to look out for any govt assistances or jobs fairs or any other income methods to increase my salary.</p>

              <p>Wrong sense of direction, I am making some noise about the government wanting more entrepreneurs but not removing the red tape. I know that there are a lot of people doing what they can out there but the government is acting dumb again by dumping out even more red tape.</p>
