              <p>The problem in singapore is that there are too many people managing and getting too much money to manage the people who work to produce something. In the business you can divide up the cake and see how much goes to the people working and the people managing. There needs to be research into this. That is why the companies here are all moving off shore because they can not afford there own management. . Someone has to produce something, not just everyone sitting around crying that the people on the shop floor or factory floor are too expensive.</p>
              <p>The CEO pay is in millions and this drags down the profits of companies. This is because the money could be spent else where to make the company better. That is the BIG PROBLEM. The efficient use of resources to maximize profit. How can this be efficient that a few people in the business get millions when they do not even own it. STUPIDITY. Also? How would you feel if you see that some bum getting millions while you work like a dog? You are working in the company for years and this CEO or director gets paid millions or even hundreds of thousands on your labor and knowledge and they can't even tie there shoe laces.</p>
              <p>This is unjust. This CEO person didn't start the company , just came along and it was handed to him or her. Its a disgrace. Not only that they praise the CEO and directors with things that are common sense. The difficulty in management is an illusion.</p>
              <p>The difficulty in managment is the time spent on finding ways to rip off the company and not looking after the interests of the company. That is so stupid. Who is this person the CEO to get millions on the hard work off others. . Its wrong and everyone needs to step in and make it right. You may be tricked into thinking that is the market rate.</p>
              <p>The CEO is some special person. NO if the product is no good the CEO can dance all he wants. No this person would never get a pay like that anywhere else and they know it. They fear it and they lie about everything to keep it. ITs there TATTSLOTTO . CEO PAY IS TATTOSLOTTO FOR few for the rest us to pay with hard work and lost hours with family and friends. THats right for you to die poor and broken while these other people dance on your grave. If you have grave that is. You work hard or fight hard to get a job. Its not enough. If you do not have a job and are not rich your worse then S&amp;HZ&amp;IT. Thats the world we are in. ITs constantly pushed on and on.</p>

              my same opinions, managers really do not deserve that much respect that the actual people doing the ground work like practising engineers.
              
              Most managers use eye power, just talk, give instructions, etc. In the same view, look at SAF. There are eye power people and people dong the real work. SO....which group of people gives rise to real productivity?
              
              Too many managers are just sucking up money from the organization which is unwanted, hence normally the FIRST people to go during economic downturn are always them....heheh....after the operators ofcourse.
              
              However, you need to hand it to them for having the ability to control people, their interpersonal skills, managing and ensuring projects are on schedules etc.. Cuz these are in fact their KPIs...nothing else. :)
