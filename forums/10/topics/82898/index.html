            <div class='col-md body'>SAF policy dictates that all NS men must undergo FFI (fit-for-fitness) examination by SAF medical doctors from age of 35 years onwards. This examination is done every 2 years (from the age of 35). If this examination is not carried out, the NS man is not allowed to take his yearly IPPT (which must be completed before the NS manÂ’s next date of birth for that year).<br><br>I got my first FFI examination at age 35. However, last year (when I was 37 years old), I did not get any call-up letter to go for FFI. After making many unsuccessful calls to the camp unit (between August 2003 and March 2004), I managed to get through to three clerical staff on three occasions. On these occasions, I was prompted to leave my handphone number and the staff promised to get back to me. But they never did.<br><br>Subsequently, I booked with SAFRA Toa Payoh to take my IPPT on May 4th 2004 (my birth date was May 7th). However, one week before the IPPT, SAFRA staff was nice enough to call, pointing out that there was no need for me to appear for IPPT; as without FFI examination, I will not be allowed to take my IPPT.<br><br>Somehow, miraculously, my SAF unit then sent a letter, requesting I report back to camp for my FFI (this was done in mid-May 2004).<br><br>I went for the FFI and reported to the admin staff about the missed IPPT test. Despite all explanations, the unit staff said I would still be sent a letter stating that I had gone AWOL (from IPPT) and that I will be charged. I was told to sign up for RT (remedial training) in mid-June.<br><br>The letter came early June 2004, stating I was to report back to camp in full uniform on June 16th 2004.<br><br>On the day itself, I was made to take orders (get charged). I then explained the whole situation. The admin clerk then admitted that my medical docket was lost during transfer between units (I transitted from active NS battalion to PDF). As a result, I was not called up for FFI last year. They also mentioned such things had happened before. They also stated that the unit had encountered power blackouts before. So phones and faxes breakdowns had happened before.<br>The unit also goes to field exercises. When this happens, admin staff are kept at a minimal. So it becomes very difficult to reach people over the phone.<br><br>I also requested that I be allowed to take my IPPT before having to go for RT (after all, all this happened through no fault of mine). But I was told that I cannot cancel my RT training. RT training comprises of two session peer week for four consecutive weeks.<br><br>The officer apologized and removed my charges. I sent an email to MINDEF feedback, complaining about this whole matter. All I got was a standard, pre-canned letter about MINDEF putting up more measures in place that will facilitate better communications between NS men and their units, etc. (see attached email).<br><br>I asked for an email address from the unit and was given an officerÂ’s email address. I raised objections, saying that if the officer quits the Army (or ORD), his emails will not be read. The answer given was the officer is a regular and will be around for a long time. ALL MINDEF personnel at some point in time will have to retire or quit of their accord. Such a nonchalant answer smacks of attitudes that betray their laziness, ingrained mindset of the typical public servant that nothing should be changed. Take it or leave it attitude.<br><br>I have several questions over this whole episode :<br><br>a)	It seems that there are no system / process linkage between SAFRA (or units that carry out IPPT tests) and the actual SAF units (where NS man reports to). Once an NS man misses his IPPT, some backend system automatically prints out letters, charging NS men with AWOL. When I reported back to the unit to answer my charges, it was plain clear the officer was different from the one who sent out the AWOL letter. This officer taking the charged orders also did not seemed aware of the situation at all.<br><br>What it means is NS men are inconvenienced. They have to appear in person (in FULL uniform) to explain their case. This means re-scheduling important meetings, jobs in their civilian jobs, just to answer a charge to young, NSF officers who does not seem to have done any investigation homework. The SAF seems to operate on the mode that it is always right and that NS men must be skiving when they missed IPPT. The onus is on NS man to explain their case.<br><br>b)	If an NS man did not take his IPPT (with valid reasons), why must he still be made to report for RT, especially through no fault of his. RT training (for Phase I) involves appearing for 3 hour sessions twice a week for four consecutive weeks. This inconveniences NS man who are working longer hours at work. If we are not working late hours, we are trying to spend quality time with families and children.<br><br>The SAF is still practicing outmoded, high-handed and unreasonable policies. NSF officers and clerical staff do not bend General Orders that are set in the 70Â’s.<br><br>The onus is on NS man to try ways and means to notify their units of exceptional circumstances. Units do not provide any asynchronous means to allow NS men to contact them more appropriately (eg. through emails). Emails will allow officers to track that requests has been submitted to their units even when their staff are not around to handle these requests. MINDEFÂ’s standard response to my feedback was that they are in the midst of implementing the email mechanism. I have heard of this so-called Â“implementationÂ” 2 years ago when I was doing In-camp training.<br><br>With all these IT outsourcing trends happening, MINDEF is still taking a long time implementing systems.<br><br>MINDEF has provided a lot of automation and conveniences for IPPT, conducting mass mobilization exercises, etc. But when it comes to providing feedback and facilitating communications between NS men and their units, this is sorely lacking. After all, the most frequent communications happening is between the NS man and his unit and less between MINDEF and the NS man. Are MINDEF policy makers focusing on the wrong thing?<br><br>c)	On the few occasions I went back to the unit, I could see NSF clerks reading the newspaper, playing Solitaire on Windows PC. Are our NSF boys being taught responsibly to take their jobs seriously? Do they realize that their mistakes can create havoc for NS men and disrupt their lives, schedules?<br><br>Is MINDEF and the SAF educating their staff over mindset changes? The Government is always exhorting Singaporeans to think critically, think out of the box. I think its better to focus these attempts on public servants first.<br><br>d)	Are units really prone to frequent power outages? My previous NS unit and MINDEF (I still have the email from the Warrant Officer explaining this to me) also gave similar reasons that their phones and faxes were not working at the time when I tried to notify them that I had to travel overseas and could not perform mobilization duties. My guess is this has been a frequent overused excuse used by units to explain their lapses in carrying our their duties. What is MINDEF doing about all these unplanned Â“outagesÂ”? WouldnÂ’t it be a golden opportunity for terrorists if they learn about these frequent power outages at SAF units?<br><br>e)	All Army combat units participate in yearly review of operational readiness. The annual best combat unit competition is judged on several parameters, one of which is IPPT scores. Units with high IPPT passing rates stand better chances of selection. Are young, aspirant Unit Commanding Officers (who are looking for promotion) Â“pushingÂ” for near-perfect IPPT scores at all expenses (even if they had to inconvenience NS men, mete out unreasonable punishments)? I think MINDEF should review the negative implications that these competitions and their policies have on our lives.<br><br>NS men play the roles of husbands and fathers (who soldier family responsibilities), economic producers (struggling with the increasing competition), tax payers (supporting MINDEF), citizens (who support the country). Yet, it is such injustice, inconveniences, unnecessary penalties that sometimes makes me wonder : why does a PR strive to be a citizen? Are citizens really better off than PRs?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think all Singaporean men have already been penalize the moment they step into NS.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> After NS, the bad thing is you usually forget everything that you have studied! Makes clinching a job hard for us young guys nowadays. Unless of course your family is rich and can afford you a full time university course. Frankly speaking, maybe men of Singapore should switch roles with women. So many managers and high flyers in the news and papers are all women!</div>
