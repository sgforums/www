One would have thought that the constitution should have provided some other provisions that spell out the functions of a judge of the supreme court including its being an independent branch of government and its right to exercise their judicial duties without influence from any one or the executive.<br><br>It will be a deficient constitution if there is no such provision. Then citizens must stand up to fight for such a provision to be included in the constitution.<br><br>Assuming that judges are appointed by the president on advice of the PM, it is still customary that constitution would still clearly spell out the judicial functions of supreme court judges (not necessarily the same for judicial commissioners) as an independent branch of government with specific function for good corporate governance of the country.<br><br>If there has been such a provision in the constitution then article 2 should not be superseded or supplanted by article 4.<br><br>Then article 4 should be interpreted in another way that PM may have the power to advise the president to appoint a judicial commissioner but such appointments should be for the purpose of facilitating the performance of duties of a judge of the supreme court but not to replace or abolish the judge of the supreme court.<br><br>I guess article 2 is for the purpose of ensuring judicial independence but that has been misinterpreted to suit political purpose of control of judges.</div>
