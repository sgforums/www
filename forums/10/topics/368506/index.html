              <p>There was this report of MOE awarding cleaning contract to a high bidder and was uncovered by the AG, resulting in spending more millions and was blasted by AG for the wastage</p>
              <p>However I salute the MOE officer who make the brave, correct and wise decision who award the contract to higher bidder , this guy or girl actually know his stuff unlike  ..the AG officer simply do not understand the real situation on the ground .. those who has worked in the cleaning line will know, yes you can squeeze the cleaning contractor but they in term will squeeze the poor cleaner , this has happen to one of the project i have managed , the contractor practically make a loss every month in order to build up their track record with the government body . their poor old age cleaner are in term paid $600 for their  8 hours of hard work everyday 7 days a week. you may say if these old cleaner are underpaid they should resign , but i can tell you they will not and many old and weak pple can bullied in this world. my heart bleed and go to them. i feel really sorry for them</p>
              <p>Hope in futuere gov scholar who sit in his air con arm chair in his office do not make such apathetic analysis and conclusion and please find out what is happeing on the ground.  anyone who can make such simplistic cost benefit analysis without much forethought, you are not worth what you are paid</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think there should be more to it than meets the eyes.  I dun think they award based on price alone..maybe the cleaning firm socre the most point in a number of specifications so they get the contract.</div>

              <p>I agree with the TS.</p>
              <p>Bear in mind that the whole point of tender exercises is to look out for the quotation that offers the best value. And remember that 'best value' is not always the same as 'lowest price'.</p>
              <p>For all you know those lower bidders may be cutting corners and providing low wages to its workers. They might be forcing the poor cleaning aunties to work longer hours for lower pay, for instance.</p>
              <p>I don't have a problem with MOE not choosing the low-end bidders, so long as they can show that the firm whom they awarded the contract to is providing good value for money.</p>

              We should look for value rather than just mere price.  A 10% increase in price with 50% increase in service is worth it.
