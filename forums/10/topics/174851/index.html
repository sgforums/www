            <div class='col-md body'>Frankly I really have had enough of the rules and regulations. From littlespeck:<br><br>Singapore<br>Toughening the laws<br>If you think opening up means less regulation, think again. By Seah Chiang Nee.<br>Jan 18, 2006<br><br>In recent weeks, the government has announced a series of new laws that has got people asking, "What has happened to the promise of a grater opening up of Singapore?"<br><br>Well, apparently both issues need not contradict each other, judging by the official action. Surely, you can be more open and at the same time have tougher legislation, can't you?<br><br>Remember more than a decade ago, (the then) Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong announced a serious effort to review all regulations to see what, if any, could be eradicated.<br><br>After a while, the exercise was abandoned without much being cancelled on the argument that people preferred to have it that way.<br><br>Post-British Singapore has always had the reputation of being over-regulated, a 'fine' city. Even Minister Mentor Mr. Lee Kuan Yew recently talked of the disadvantageous restraints here, "This cannot, that cannot".<br><br>So what happens? We have been having these toughter announcements within the past week or two: -<br><br>1. Violent protesters at the annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in Singapore could face caning and imprisonment, a minister said.<br><br>2. The government has said that legislation to protect whistle-blowers is not necessary at present.<br><br>3. Draft dodgers to face tougher penalties. Defence Minister Teo Chee Hean told parliament that the fine would be doubled to S$10,000. The maximum jail sentence of 3 years will not go up, but the Defence Ministry will now push for a jail term for defaulters in serious cases.<br><br>4. Bus, taxi fare cheats could end up in jail. Commuters who cheat on bus and taxi fares could end up behind bars under proposed legislation to stamp out a problem that has dogged Singaporean transport operators for years.<br><br>5. Teenage schoolgirls were told by police that they might break the law if 'white elephant T-shirts (used last year to protest non-opening of the Buangkok MRTstation) that they wanted to sell to raise funds were worn 'en masse'.<br><br>6. A new law to punish Singaporeans who have sex with under-aged girls abroad.<br><br>7. A Straits Times headline 'Getting tough on workplace safety'. Those who flout safety rules and cause accidents in the workplace will be punished severely under a new law just passed in Parliament. Fines for errant companies will more than double to $500,000 from $200,000.<br><br>Any first time visitor here would have gained the impression that Singapore is full of law-breakers, not a good sign for an aspirant world-class city.<br><br>Has it become a belief with our scholar bureaucrats that any trouble can be resolved only by the cane? Is this a good sign for the Republic's future when only punishment can make people behave?<br><br>Those who draft policy papers must have an easy time, if that is the case.<br><br>One explanation could be the government feels threatened by the hotting up of the pre-election political temperature.<br><br>It has been apparent for some time now that the 21st Century Singapore has become more divisive and less compliant to the government.<br><br>The preparations for the coming election and the little controlled Internet are not helping to bring harmony. People are devising new ways to protest or to make their unhappiness known.<br><br>Mr. Chee Soon Juan, head of the opposition Singapore Democratic party, has called for non-violent civil disobedience activities against the 'authoritarian' government.<br><br>Is this a sign that the government is cracking down on dissent? If so, will the Internet be the next target?<br></div>

Before this provision, offenders were able to defend themselves by claiming that they had consumed the drugs overseas. With the amendment, a Singapore Citizen or PR whose urine is tested positive for controlled drugs cannot claim consumption overseas as a defence.</blockquote></div>
