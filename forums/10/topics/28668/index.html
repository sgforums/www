            <div class='col-md body'>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Army used a high-energy laser to shoot down an artillery shell in mid-flight on Tuesday in a defense industry breakthrough, the Army and the manufacturer said.<br><br>The Army and TRW Inc, which developed the weapon, said in a joint statement that the laser tracked, locked onto and fired a burst of concentrated light energy photons at the speeding shell over the White Sands test range in New Mexico.<br><br>"Seconds later, at a point well short of its intended destination, the projectile was destroyed," the Army's Space and Missile Defense Command said.<br><br>The Mobile Tactical High Energy Laser (MTHEL) is being developed by TRW for the Army and the Israeli Defense Ministry. Lasers have been used in past tests at the range to shoot down slower Katyusha Rockets similar to those fired at Israel by militant guerrilla groups in neighboring Lebanon.<br><br>"This shootdown shifts the paradigm for defensive capabilities. We've shown that even an artillery projectile hurtling through the air at supersonic speed is no match for a laser," said Army Lt. Gen. Joseph Cosumano, head of the missile defense command.<br><br>"Tactical high energy lasers have the capacity to change the face of the battlefield," he added.<br><br>The laser was fired from a static testbed in a carefully controlled test, but TRW officials said they looked forward to producing a truly mobile version as the program progressed.<br><br>Tuesday's test -- the first time a laser had shot down an artillery shell -- was part of a new series to determine MTHEL requirements and demonstrate the system's capabilities against a wide range of airborne targets.<br><br>In earlier tests in 2000 and 2001 the testbed focused on the threat of artillery rockets and shot down 25 Katyushas fired singly and in salvos.<br><br>The U.S. military has shot down dummy intercontinental missile warheads in tests both inside and outside the atmosphere using projectile weapons and is also examining the possible use of long-range lasers to burn up such warheads in flight.<br><br><a href="http://www.reuters.com/news_article.jhtml?type=technologynews&amp;StoryID=1683768#" rel="nofollow">http://www.reuters.com/news_article.jhtml?type=technologynews&amp;StoryID=1683768#</a></div>

I think the most viable options right now are UCAV like Hellfire-armed Predators UCAVs plus Apaches. Furthermore, the TPQ-37 radars are going to pick up where the MRLS are fired from and the arty can then quickly return fire. As for the use of submunitions, there are also 155mm arty rounds that carry submunitions such as anti-personal bomblets or anti-tank munitions. Don't know if SAF has already invested in those. Furthermore, there are also the swedish BONUS 155mm round that are self-guided using either millimeter wave or IR  (forgot which one). Last but not least, laser guided 155mm rounds are also available from both the US (Copperhead) and the Russians.<br><br>The idea of using laser to hit rockets and arty rounds are in advanced prototype stage but how viable they are to defend Singapore (cost vs effectiveness) is still a big ?<br></div>

No way can light be focused in such way, to cut or damage anything.  Time and technology has proven them wrong.  Prism defense array, highly possible.  The thing is, NOT to give up.</div>
