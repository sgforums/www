            <div class='col-md body'>http://news-service.stanford.edu/news/2005/june15/jobs-061505.html<br><br>This is what his parent would say<br><br><blockquote> You've got to find what you love,' Jobs says </blockquote>Singaporeans are lucky to even have a job compared to third world asian neighbours, stop being picky<br><br><blockquote>So I decided to drop out and trust that it would all work out OK. It was pretty scary at the time, but looking back it was one of the best decisions I ever made. The minute I dropped out I could stop taking the required classes that didn't interest me, and begin dropping in on the ones that looked interesting.</blockquote>Looking at how Sim Wong Woo is treated by the govt when he has only a diploma, if you dont even have a diploma, you would be selling tissues paper in the streets.<br><br><blockquote>Reed College at that time offered perhaps the best calligraphy instruction in the country. Throughout the campus every poster, every label on every drawer, was beautifully hand calligraphed. Because I had dropped out and didn't have to take the normal classes, I decided to take a calligraphy class to learn how to do this. I learned about serif and san serif typefaces, about varying the amount of space between different letter combinations, about what makes great typography great. It was beautiful, historical, artistically subtle in a way that science can't capture, and I found it fascinating.<br><br>None of this had even a hope of any practical application in my life. But ten years later, when we were designing the first Macintosh computer, it all came back to me. And we designed it all into the Mac. It was the first computer with beautiful typography. If I had never dropped in on that single course in college, the Mac would have never had multiple typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts. And since Windows just copied the Mac, its likely that no personal computer would have them. If I had never dropped out, I would have never dropped in on this calligraphy class, and personal computers might not have the wonderful typography that they do. Of course it was impossible to connect the dots looking forward when I was in college. But it was very, very clear looking backwards ten years later.</blockquote>Dont be stupid on learning Calligraphy. Its not practical. You think you can make money from it?? If you cannot find a job how?<br><br><blockquote>Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma Â— which is living with the results of other people's thinking. Don't let the noise of others' opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary.</blockquote>The govt needs lots of researchers in bio-medical research. What study what you like? Must be crazy. Make sure you get all As,take only those modules that are easy to get As so that you dont get kicked out of the scholarship by Philip Yeo<br><br></div>
