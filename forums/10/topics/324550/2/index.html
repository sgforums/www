              <p>Funny thing about some Singaporeans nowadays, they tend to ignore the world trends on development and flat out lie that Singapore would've been stuck in the '50s without the oh-so-mighty leadership of the PAP.</p>
              <p>It's like they are willingly ENSLAVING themselves to the whims and fancies of the PAP.</p>
              <p>HEY WAKE UP FUCKERS, YOU'VE BEEN HAD. Continue prostrating yourselves before the PAP, and don't blame us when you get liquidated to make more space for FTs.</p>

              <p><br>Ya...fuckers.....sometimes people just need to get their argument right. You won't be replaced by FTs if you haven't been slacking off in your studies right? Well, if you didn't study hard enough during your studying days, shouldn't you make way for FTs who couldn't afford to have fun like you and have to study harder than you when they were a student just like you?</p>
              <p>Are you upset because PAP deprived you of learning an additional language?</p>
              <p>Cos if Singapore didn't have Lee Kuan Yew, you could be learning Bahasa Melayu as your first language other than your native tongue(mandarin), and elective language(english).</p>
              <p>Well, you're in luck cos do you know you can still go ahead and learn your Bahasa Melayu. You just need to pay for it but you can learn it at your own pace.</p>
