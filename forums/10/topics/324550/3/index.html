              <p>Prosperity has different meaning to different people. To you, prosperity probably means have lots of money.</p>
              <p>You are indeed confused if you think prosperity is related to kiasi and kiasu. Not all people who are kiasu and kiasi will prosper you know? But if you do not have a prosperity of wisdom up in your brain, you won't prosper even if you are the most kiasu and kiasi person on Earth. So if you applied kiasi attitude in all your exams, and kiasu attitude in all your learning and studies, you might have already accumulated enough prosperity of knowledge to get you to start your own business or inventions. Whether you will prosper or not, nobody knows right? But you will be most likely to prosper among your peers.</p>
              <p>I don't understand why people can become ungrateful and bitter when they are obviously living a safe and prosperous country. Are they supposed to be happier if they were living in a third-world country?</p>
              <p>People do tons of silly things when they are restless...and this is one very good example.</p>
              <p>People tends to forget there is always a higher power up there above the skies, and if they don't treasure their time when they're alive, they will have to live with eternal regret for the rest of their lives. Sometimes, when people has done well for them, they should practise GRACE and give the old man Lee Kuan Yew a pat in the back for providing them with a safe childhood when they were not smart enough to be ungrateful yet. </p>

              <p>You are indeed confused if you think prosperity is related to kiasi and kiasu. Not all people who are kiasu and kiasi will prosper you know? But if you do not have a prosperity of wisdom up in your brain, you won't prosper even if you are the most kiasu and kiasi person on Earth. So if you applied kiasi attitude in all your exams, and kiasu attitude in all your learning and studies, you might have already accumulated enough prosperity of knowledge to get you to start your own business or inventions. Whether you will prosper or not, nobody knows right? But you will be most likely to prosper among your peers.</p>
              <p>I don't understand why people can become ungrateful and bitter when they are obviously living a safe and prosperous country. Are they supposed to be happier if they were living in a third-world country?</p>
              <p>People do tons of silly things when they are restless...and this is one very good example.</p>
              <p>People tends to forget there is always a higher power up there above the skies, and if they don't treasure their time when they're alive, they will have to live with eternal regret for the rest of their lives. Sometimes, when people has done well for them, they should practise GRACE and give the old man Lee Kuan Yew a pat in the back for providing them with a safe childhood when they were not smart enough to be ungrateful yet. </p>

              <p>Trolls are the ones who bark at all times.     They love misinterpreting, slamming, humiliates, adopt condescending attitudes when what they read which are based on facts and reality are not pleasing to them.  They behave spoilt brats.  Very immature, shallow.    Of late, Speakers' Corner has a number of such trolls coming to create scene here to disturb discussions.    Some of whom claim to be Christians but behave very badly.   This is a disgrace to God.  </p>

              <p>Some stupid forumite just destined to live their lives hopping from one nick to another because they got banned repeatedly. Forumite as such certainly have zero credibility to their nick and often abused the grace granted by moderators for them to change over a new leaf.</p>

              <p>Let's save all this crap then, and allow all ungrateful children of Singapore leave Singapore if they really feel disgusted from the governing by the PAP government and the founding father, Mr. Lee Kuan Yew.</p>
              <p>Oh, by the way...I forgot to mention the reality of awakening, those ungrateful children of Singapore have no ABILITY to leave Singapore. Therefore they are stuck here permanently and in order for them to feel like a Hero, they kpkb here to prove and feel that they are indeed the future voice of Singapore.</p>
              <p>Kudos to them!! They had no choice but to be the silent Heroes of the future generation of Singaporeans.</p>

              <p><br>SEriously I really don't know -   even if he wants to sue, he has to do some "homework" before going ahead.   I have read forumers saying that the senior Lee is only excellent in bullying Singaporeans and dare not bully foreigners.    Yeah, he even threatens to sue any online forumers for questioning his integrity.     This is really evil over the extreme, never have I come across such an evil person.    Then I think he should just shut down the internet in Singapore and nobody should use the net to discuss politics.     IBA is different from the publication companies, IBA represents law and justice, so I guess he may not want to go ahead to sue.   He will be suing the law if he goes ahead.</p>

              <h1>Raising the bar</h1>
              <p>Jul 17th 2008<br> From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>
              <h2>A rare slip-up in court by Singapore’s elder statesman, Lee
              Kuan Yew</h2>
              <p>MEMBERS of Singapore’s government are notorious sticklers for
              legal exactitude. So it has been interesting to watch the reaction
              after the country’s elder statesman, Lee Kuan Yew—a British-trained
              lawyer before he became a politician—gave inaccurate testimony in
              the trial of two opposition leaders.</p>
              <p>In May Mr Lee testified in a hearing to decide damages against
              Chee Soon Juan, the leader of the Singapore Democratic Party (SDP),
              and his sister, Chee Siok Chin, for defaming the former prime
              minister and his son, Lee Hsien Loong, who is now prime minister
              himself. Mr Lee senior claimed that after the London-based
              International Bar Association (IBA) held its annual conference in
              Singapore last October, its president sent a letter to the Law
              Society of Singapore praising the country’s justice system. It has
              since emerged that there was no such laudatory letter.</p>
              <p>Mr Chee (who along with his sister was briefly jailed for
              contempt for accusing the judge in his case of bias) tried
              unsuccessfully to have the hearing reconvened in the light of Mr
              Lee’s incorrect testimony. Mr Lee’s counsel, Davinder Singh, wrote
              to the court on July 9th admitting that his client was wrong about
              the letter but noting that the IBA’s president, Fernando Pombo, had
              praised Singapore’s “outstanding judiciary” in a speech at the
              start of the conference. Mr Singh argues that what matters is that
              the IBA did praise Singaporean justice, not whether it did so in a
              speech or a letter. Mr Chee says there is a difference: the speech
              was made before the conference, where criticisms of the justice
              system were aired. Mr Lee was claiming, in effect, that the IBA was
              still impressed after this.</p>
              <p>By coincidence, on July 9th the IBA’s Human Rights Institute
              issued a report criticising the use of defamation suits by the
              ruling People’s Action Party (PAP) to silence the opposition and
              the press, and expressing concerns about the independence and
              impartiality of Singapore’s judges. The law ministry has rejected
              the IBA’s report, pointing out that Singapore’s legal system has
              won excellent ratings in other international surveys. Indeed, in
              cases not involving the country’s leaders, there is no dispute
              about its quality. As for the IBA’s worries about cases involving
              PAP figures, the law ministry claims that the IBA failed to
              substantiate its “grave” allegations with evidence, though its
              report does discuss several worrying cases.</p>
              <p>America’s State Department, which is in rather less danger of
              being sued by the PAP than are the opposition or newspapers, has
              expressed concern about judicial independence in political cases in
              Singapore. In its latest human-rights report, in March, the
              department noted that the PAP’s consistent success in defamation
              suits against critics “led to a perception that the judiciary
              reflected the views of the ruling party in politically sensitive
              cases.”</p>
              <p>According to the <em>Straits Times</em> newspaper, Mr Lee on
              July 11th accused human-rights organisations of “a conspiracy to do
              us in”. He said that they saw that Russia and China had been
              studying Singapore’s success, and hence regarded it as a threat. Mr
              Lee and the government argue that doing things their way has made
              Singapore prosperous, orderly and corruption-free, and has earned
              international respect. The threat of defamation proceedings may
              make opposition politicians weigh their words more carefully than
              they do elsewhere. But Singaporean voters continue to buy the PAP’s
              argument that such constraints are a price worth paying—so far.</p>
