              <h1>Raising the bar</h1>
              <p class="info">Jul 17th 2008<br>From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>
              <h2>A rare slip-up in court by Singapore’s elder statesman, Lee Kuan Yew</h2>
              <p>MEMBERS of Singapore’s government are notorious sticklers for legal exactitude. So it has been interesting to watch the reaction after the country’s elder statesman, Lee Kuan Yew—a British-trained lawyer before he became a politician—gave inaccurate testimony in the trial of two opposition leaders.</p>
              <p>In May Mr Lee testified in a hearing to decide damages against Chee Soon Juan, the leader of the Singapore Democratic Party (SDP), and his sister, Chee Siok Chin, for defaming the former prime minister and his son, Lee Hsien Loong, who is now prime minister himself. Mr Lee senior claimed that after the London-based International Bar Association (IBA) held its annual conference in Singapore last October, its president sent a letter to the Law Society of Singapore praising the country’s justice system. It has since emerged that there was no such laudatory letter.</p>
              <p>Mr Chee (who along with his sister was briefly jailed for contempt for accusing the judge in his case of bias) tried unsuccessfully to have the hearing reconvened in the light of Mr Lee’s incorrect testimony. Mr Lee’s counsel, Davinder Singh, wrote to the court on July 9th admitting that his client was wrong about the letter but noting that the IBA’s president, Fernando Pombo, had praised Singapore’s “outstanding judiciary” in a speech at the start of the conference. Mr Singh argues that what matters is that the IBA did praise Singaporean justice, not whether it did so in a speech or a letter. Mr Chee says there is a difference: the speech was made before the conference, where criticisms of the justice system were aired. Mr Lee was claiming, in effect, that the IBA was still impressed after this.</p>
              <p>By coincidence, on July 9th the IBA’s Human Rights Institute issued a report criticising the use of defamation suits by the ruling People’s Action Party (PAP) to silence the opposition and the press, and expressing concerns about the independence and impartiality of Singapore’s judges. The law ministry has rejected the IBA’s report, pointing out that Singapore’s legal system has won excellent ratings in other international surveys. Indeed, in cases not involving the country’s leaders, there is no dispute about its quality. As for the IBA’s worries about cases involving PAP figures, the law ministry claims that the IBA failed to substantiate its “grave” allegations with evidence, though its report does discuss several worrying cases.</p>
              <p>America’s State Department, which is in rather less danger of being sued by the PAP than are the opposition or newspapers, has expressed concern about judicial independence in political cases in Singapore. In its latest human-rights report, in March, the department noted that the PAP’s consistent success in defamation suits against critics “led to a perception that the judiciary reflected the views of the ruling party in politically sensitive cases.”</p>
              <p>According to the <em>Straits Times</em> newspaper, Mr Lee on July 11th accused human-rights organisations of “a conspiracy to do us in”. He said that they saw that Russia and China had been studying Singapore’s success, and hence regarded it as a threat. Mr Lee and the government argue that doing things their way has made Singapore prosperous, orderly and corruption-free, and has earned international respect. The threat of defamation proceedings may make opposition politicians weigh their words more carefully than they do elsewhere. But Singaporean voters continue to buy the PAP’s argument that such constraints are a price worth paying—so far.</p>

              <p><br>I am not sure if he is paranoid that entire Singapore public wants him dead, but I am very sure that he thinks that the whole Singapore owe him their living.    With all these unproductive thoughts, untrue reality/facts in his mind, it is no wonder he makes life more and more difficult for the public.    Such a man should not be made a leader of the country serving the nation.   </p>

              <p>Case study of someone similar to LKY</p>
              <p>Yuan Shao</p>
              <p><strong>Yuan Shao</strong> (? - <a title="202" href="/wiki/202"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">202</span></span></a>) was a powerful warlord during the late <a class="mw-redirect" title="Eastern Han Dynasty" href="/wiki/Eastern_Han_Dynasty"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Eastern Han Dynasty</span></span></a> and <a title="Three Kingdoms" href="/wiki/Three_Kingdoms"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Three Kingdoms</span></span></a> era of <a title="China" href="/wiki/China"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">China</span></span></a>. He occupied the northern territories of ancient China during the massive civil war towards the end of the Eastern Han Dynasty and the beginning of the Three Kingdoms era.</p>
              <p>One of the most powerful warlords of his time, Yuan Shao spearheaded a coalition of warlords against the tyrannical <a title="Dong Zhuo" href="/wiki/Dong_Zhuo"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Dong Zhuo</span></span></a>, who held <a class="mw-redirect" title="Emperor Xian of Han China" href="/wiki/Emperor_Xian_of_Han_China"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Emperor Xian</span></span></a> hostage in the capital <a title="Luoyang" href="/wiki/Luoyang"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Luoyang</span></span></a>, but failed due to internal disunity. In <a title="200" href="/wiki/200"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">200</span></span></a>, he launched a campaign against rival warlord <a title="Cao Cao" href="/wiki/Cao_Cao"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Cao Cao</span></span></a> but was defeated utterly at the decisive <a title="Battle of Guandu" href="/wiki/Battle_of_Guandu"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Battle of Guandu</span></span></a>. He died of sickness two years later in <a title="Ye, China" href="/wiki/Ye%2C_China"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Ye</span></span></a>. His eventual failure despite his <span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>powerful family background and geographical advantages</strong></span> was commonly blamed on his <span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>indecisiveness and inability to heed the advice of his advisors</strong></span>.</p>
              <p>Some believe Yuan Shao's defeat was caused by <strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">senility<span style="text-decoration: underline;">.</span></span></strong> They argue that it would explain how a <span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>man who managed to become for a good period of time</strong></span> the dominant force in China could <span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>suddenly fail so completely</strong></span>. It is highly likely that it was a combination of <span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>senility</strong></span>, <span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>inability to listen to advice</strong></span> and his unfortunate luck in finding such a <strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">cunning foe</span></strong> that was Yuan Shao's downfall.</p>
              <p>Cao Cao had once analysed Yuan Shao before the Battle of Guandu. Cao Cao said: Yuan Shao will be defeated during the war.</p>
              <ol>
              <li><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>He is arrogant, self-centred, and senile</strong></span>; </li>
              <li>His advisers fight against each other; </li>
              <li><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>His generals have brawn but no brain</strong></span>, (to put it literally) <a title="Yan Liang" href="http://www.sgforums.com/wiki/Yan_Liang"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Yan Liang</span></span></a> and <a title="Wen Chou" href="http://www.sgforums.com/wiki/Wen_Chou"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Wen Chou</span></span></a>, valiant but stupid in terms of using tactics; </li>
              <li>His sons' rivalry: All 3 brothers can't seem to unite </li>
              <li>he did not respect his officers or troops </li>

              Based on the article released yesterday by the world renowned The Economist, I have 2 questions :
              
              1. Can I safely assume there is absolute proof of the doing us in?
              
              2. Why is IBA not sued for that incident?
              
              very tough and difficult questions I have.
              
              regards

              <p>I think he is just doing himself in.</p>
              <p>I think the success for the 1st thirty years of sin city have got stuck in his head.</p>
              <p>He is still living in the past.</p>
              <p>It is time to face the music and let go.</p>
              <p>He have himself to blame for nepotism that he is practising within his clan.</p>
              <p>Human will still have selfish mind, no matter how wise he is .</p>
              <p>He wun live to see his long reign of fifty years.</p>

              <p>Apparently alot of people have shallow definition of heroes. In life itself, there is always alot of titles/positions/ranks, and they all have an invisible title before them. The invisible title is smart or dumb.</p>
              <p>You can be in any trade, any relationship, any status, whatever...but it's up to you to decide if you want to be a smart one or a dumb one. Even Heroes also have smart and dumb Heroes. Smart Heroes lived long enough to see themselves honoured in the histories, and dumb Heroes don't even get mentioned much cos they died stupidly. </p>
              <p>I can see there are alot of Zhao Yun wannabes here, but they don't realised they are just the Yan Liang and Wen Chou in this 21st century.</p>
