            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm, there is somewhat of external market intervention right?<br><br>I mean the mechanics of the market operates when the businesses realize that their cost of production is too high relative to their revenue. Hence, they would give up their shops and the landlord will feel the pinch of losing tenants? Unless of course, the landlord made them sign on to some long term contract and now the tenants deem it unsustainable in the long run.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's really quite a matter of poor planning and location on SMRT's part.

There was also no real effort to direct commuters towards the shops . By the time SMRT realised that, it was already too late for the shopkeepers.</div>
