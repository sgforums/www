              <p>If not, I find it very hard for any opposition party to take over the PAP. Just like a human veins...it was too complex to dislodge the party.</p>

              <p>I think you have underestimate the nature of society evolution,  in history, when we are under the British, no one would think that LKY will take over, everyone also think when british was gone, how?, when british pulled out their forces, how? when malaysia dun want us, how? but we still survive, and in fact, much better.</p>
              <p>Until you managed to kick PAP out of Singapore, someone will definitely be able to take over and lead, the main challenge now is not about who will take over, or who will be the next govt, the critical part now for those oppositions is, how to kick PAP out, not who or what will happen after PAP is out. It is kind of like you cannot even open the door, how to go in and clean it up. Step by step.</p>
              <p>Even if no one want to take over, my Uncle Atobe will be more than willing to do the job for a million per year, less than LHL</p>

              <p>Actually I am convinced that the party, PAP, can remain a predominant party, as long as it changes the way it recruit its MPs.</p>
              <p>MPs should represent the people, the demographics.</p>
              <p>Frankly, there is an over-representation by a group of similarly highly educated, highly paid professionals, such as , lawyers, doctors,</p>
              <p>They are high achievers and people with calibre, Im sure, but they do not represent the cleaners, the cashiers, the deliveryman, and so on......</p>
              <p>If a certain organization, any organization, is sucked in into an incestuous practice, where they just kiss and promote their own kind, their own people, people with similar backgrounds, thoughts, ideas, similar lingo, what happens is that they will get disconnected from the ground.</p>
              <p>I think they have realized it already by appointing NMPs, and by appointing people such as Eunice Olsen (charity sector).</p>
              <p>But that is not enough.</p>
              <p>It should happen not at the margins, but at the core.</p>

              <p style="margin: 17px 0px; padding: 0px;"><strong style="margin: 0px; font-weight: bold; padding: 0px;">Written by: Gilbert Goh</strong></p>
              <p style="margin: 17px 0px; padding: 0px;">As this year  draws to an end soon, I wondered if there is any other  year that is filled more with drama.</p>
              <p style="margin: 17px 0px; padding: 0px;">From awfully regular flooding in downtown Orchard Road to the recent demise of Mrs Lee Kuan Yew, Singaporeans must be asking themselves if something dramatic is about to happen soon.</p>
              <p style="margin: 17px 0px; padding: 0px;">It all started off  in July this year when there was  much ground displeasure at how the government could easily pushed its way through  the much-inflated Youth Olympics (YOG)  $350 million budget mismanagement.</p>
              <p style="margin: 17px 0px; padding: 0px;">Many also believed that a single-party dominated governance may not be  ideal for the country as of late, the government seems lost and lacking in direction.</p>
              <p style="margin: 17px 0px; padding: 0px;">Moreover,  its growth-at-all-cost direction means that many people suffer from the consequences of its’ open-door policy as the effects of globalisation took its toll on the low and middle income earners. Many struggle to make ends meet and some have succumb to life’s pressures with adverse consequences.</p>
              <p style="margin: 17px 0px; padding: 0px;"><strong style="margin: 0px; font-weight: bold; padding: 0px;">Increasing Frustration Among Voters</strong></p>
              <p style="margin: 17px 0px; padding: 0px;">There is also the  general belief that there is lack of transparency among the policy makers and a PAP-dominated Parliament has ensured that accountability can remain minimal with no apparent consequences.</p>
              <p style="margin: 17px 0px; padding: 0px;">The general population is increasingly  frustrated that nothing can be done when they feel  that something is amiss.  Many vented their frustration anonymously on online socio-political platforms knowing well that nothing can be done to change anything in real-life.</p>
              <p style="margin: 17px 0px; padding: 0px;">For example, the people could not really bring the government to task when there is regular flooding in the country whenever there is a heavy downpour.  The usual rhetoria issued by the PUB agency does not really appease the frustration faced by most Singaporeans.</p>
              <p style="margin: 17px 0px; padding: 0px;">More importantly, many have questioned: “Is there any other way that matters can be  resolved than constantly threatening the government with an alternative vote?”</p>
              <p style="margin: 17px 0px; padding: 0px;">Worse of all, most elections are won by the ruling party and many have took to emigrating to escape the stifling political climate here.</p>
              <p style="margin: 17px 0px; padding: 0px;">In other countries, strong interest groups have rose up and they have spoken out on behalf of the people affected by certain policies in place. Many interest groups were even invited by the government to present their research papers so that they are always in consultation before a legislation is being drafted out.</p>
              <p style="margin: 17px 0px; padding: 0px;">In fact, there is a fund available for some interest groups to draw on so that their activities can be properly financed.</p>
              <p style="margin: 17px 0px; padding: 0px;">Our  government’s ill-conceived fear that any  interest group or society that meddles  into politics is harmful to the country has deterred many from risking themselves too much in pursuing after their cause.  </p>
              <p style="margin: 17px 0px; padding: 0px;">After all, most social causes have a political linkage and trying to draw a line between the two is simply too naive.</p>
              <p style="margin: 17px 0px; padding: 0px;">There is no perfect government in the world and those that function well  has  learn to listen humbly and try to implement policies that best meet the needs of the general  population.</p>
              <p style="margin: 17px 0px; padding: 0px;">There will always be some that will loathe whatever policies that are being put up by the government but at least it must  be seen to have shown enough care and  concern before  a legislation is being implemented that will affect the general population.</p>
              <p style="margin: 17px 0px; padding: 0px;">This is one reason why our government is often being labelled as autocratic and uncaring as the country is run like a corporation derived of any compassion and emotion. </p>
              <p style="margin: 17px 0px; padding: 0px;">Its main aim is to generate as much GDP as possible so that it is seen as doing well when in actual fact, much of the population is living in poverty due to a long period of depressed wages.</p>
              <p style="margin: 17px 0px; padding: 0px;"><strong style="margin: 0px; font-weight: bold; padding: 0px;">Predominant Party System To End Soon?</strong></p>
              <p style="margin: 17px 0px; padding: 0px;">Though our government is trying to consult the population through mass meet-the-people sessions, there is little   to convince the people that their ideas are being implemented.  Some have even lamented that such sessions are organised to show that the government has done something to consult with the people even though the legislation is already cooking in the pot unchanged.</p>
              <p style="margin: 17px 0px; padding: 0px;">Many also ponder  if there is going to be a general election coming this year end.  The million-dollar question to ask of course is: “Will the opposition make any headway in our  PAP-dominated government?”</p>
              <p style="margin: 17px 0px; padding: 0px;">Some have optimistically  predicted that one or even more GRCs may fall to the opposition in the next election due to the very bitter ground that the government is now treading on.  </p>
              <p style="margin: 17px 0px; padding: 0px;">To it’s  credit, the government  has  caught wind of the changing tide and implemented a series of changes to appease the population:</p>
              <p style="margin: 17px 0px; padding: 0px;">1.The ever-rising property prices were knocked back last month when the government imposed a series of measures to intervene in the property market. Many citizens have complained that they could not buy  any resale HDB flats as permanent residents compete aggressively for such housing forcing them to retreat to a corner.</p>
              <p style="margin: 17px 0px; padding: 0px;">2. Slowing down the influx of foreigners into our country. The government has promised to slow down the intake of foreigners into the country as citizens complained of  crowded trains and lack of space at the shopping malls.  More importantly, the huge inflow of foreigners mean that local citizens face intense competition for jobs. Some have predicted that the reduction in intake of foreigners may be seen  as too-little-too-late as the ramifications of the foreign-talent policy have taken root and many citizens  felt very displaced and disenchanted.</p>
              <p style="margin: 17px 0px; padding: 0px;">3. Knowing that ordinary Singaporeans are very pragmatic people, the government has promised to credit  $9,000 to any male citizen who has completed national service into their CPF account. Many netizens believed that this is a desperate vote-snatching gesture which may not work this time round as the money could not be immediately realised as its placed  directly into the CPF account for retirement purposes.</p>
              <p style="margin: 17px 0px; padding: 0px;"><strong style="margin: 0px; font-weight: bold; padding: 0px;">Escalating Political Interest Among Voters</strong></p>
              <p style="margin: 17px 0px; padding: 0px;">Not since Singapore was kicked out of Malaysia in 1965 did political interest reached such a feverish pitch among the populace. Socio-political internet site’ readership gained new highs as Singaporeans tried to stay plugged into the latest happenings. There was also heightened interest among the young voters as they joined opposition parties in droves. However, is this enough to drive political reform in our country?</p>
              <p style="margin: 17px 0px; padding: 0px;">History has shown that most democratic societies will face changes in governance after a party has dominated for more than fifty years. We all have seen how the powerful Malaysian UNMO party was miraculously deposed of its majority rule by a resurgent PAS in the recent election.  PAS now controlled at least half of the states in West Malaysia ensuring that a two-party majority system prevails there.</p>
              <p style="margin: 17px 0px; padding: 0px;">Mismanagement, talks of  widespread corruption in governance and racial politics have all contributed to the political demise of UMNO.</p>
              <p style="margin: 17px 0px; padding: 0px;">In Japan, the same thing happened when the Liberal Democratic party (LDP), holding office as the governing party for the very long period from 1955 to 1993, was knocked off its perch (source: insideasia.typepad.com).</p>
              <p style="margin: 17px 0px; padding: 0px;">The party splitted into two factions during a turbulent period and  political reform came about when one reformed party managed to break free and formed a coalition government with the opposition.</p>
              <p style="margin: 17px 0px; padding: 0px;">Political infighting, corruption and a a strong opposition are all factors that led to the downfall of the predominant party system in Japan in 1994.</p>
              <p style="margin: 17px 0px; padding: 0px;">Many have also predicted that in Singapore, real political reform will only come about when the PAP is splitted into two political factions  competing  with each other at the polls.  </p>
              <p style="margin: 17px 0px; padding: 0px;">Our weak divided opposition has ensured that the government will remain in power even though there are enough opposition voters out there. Many simply do not have the chance to vote due to the walk-over effect.</p>
              <p style="margin: 17px 0px; padding: 0px;">It is estimated that at least one out of three voters will cast their vote for the opposition in any contested constituency.</p>
              <p style="margin: 17px 0px; padding: 0px;">MM Lee Kuan Yew has mentioned this political dynamics before when he commented that there was a split within Parliament as  a consensus could not be reached on the issue of voting for  two integrated resorts  to be placed in Singapore.</p>
              <p style="margin: 17px 0px; padding: 0px;">Nevertheless, such political reforming looks a tall order here  as  our Members of Parliament (MP) are tightly controlled and many do not survive more than two elections.  The short tenure means that most MPs and even ministers do not have a strong political foothold to do anything out of the ordinary. Our squeaky-clean political environment  also does not allow any dissent to generate  from the party chambers.</p>
              <p style="margin: 17px 0px; padding: 0px;">Most could not even vote according to their conscience as the party whip is hardly lifted.</p>
              <p style="margin: 17px 0px; padding: 0px;">Moreover,  it is clear that absolute power is held by a few strongmen in governance. Besides the PM, the current crop of senior ministers such as Minister for National Development, Mr Mah Bow Tan, the two deputy PMs – Mr Teo Chee Yean and Mr Wong Kan Seng, still pull the power strings behind close doors and remain very much in control.</p>
              <p style="margin: 17px 0px; padding: 0px;">Strongman MM Lee is also a influential figure that could still hold the balance of power if there is a possible  conflict within the government.</p>
              <p style="margin: 17px 0px; padding: 0px;">Singaporeans will perhaps need to wait for at least another generation to pass before real political reform can take place.  After all, history has shown that no political power can remain in power for more than 50 years and this must have  provide clear relief for those who are young enough to see through the political changes in our country.</p>

              <p>Indeed opposition party is weak. They should in fact work as a team and come up 1 name. To form together and fight against pap. Look around us, we have at least a few opposition parties..and the members are very limited. Shouldnt they combined together to be formiable?</p>
