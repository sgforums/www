The opinions of the general populace are oftened shaped by print media more so than other types. Let us list the hypothetical situations that are possibly occuring. For argument's sake, lets take your suggestion to be true; that there is a tussle going on in the 'ruling elite'. Let us put them into groups A (for the ruling party) and B (for the ones that have fallen out of favour).<br><br>What good will it amount to for SPH to alert the public of a possible tussle between camps A and B? Such information can only be interpreted as signs of weakness within our government. It isn't a blatant call to arms for the rest of us, neither is it a warning signal to the rest of us to prepare for an all out political war. In which both outcomes do not benefit either party or the rest of us.<br><br>Could it then be a signal by A for B to step aside?<br>With elections coming up within the next few years, it could be a possibility. However, consider that both A and B are well supported for their contributions to the nation. While this tactic to oust B could be initiated by A, I feel that the risks A is taking to oust B through such methods are too great for A to have considered.<br><br>But putting political agenda aside, I think the reasons for SPH's detailed expose of NKFs problems is merely a defensive tactic in response to being sued. SPH was merely taking all measures to ensure its good name was maintained. (When i say good name, I mean in its ability to report accurate facts and not hearsay).<br><br>On the topic of Mrs Goh, if her comments went unreported or received only a small amount of attention, I'm sure you would be saying that SPH was only covering for the Ruling Elite.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The billions invested in foreign countries are most vulnerable to NKF kind of abuses and cover-ups.<br><br>All the CEOs and managers of investment companies have even more powerful insider information that might be used privately to benefit individuals and private companies.<br><br>Up till now apart from claims about leadership and talents have they really put in accountable or transparent performances. How do the ministers and senior offices ensure there will be no abuses as in the NKF case when serious wrongs were committed right under the nose of government patrons.<br><br>I am sure there can be greater respect for people's request for greater transparency. The issue is : are the ministers and leaders prepared to set themselves as good examples to be accountable and transparent.<br><br>People have been kept in the dark for the past 13 years over the complaints about abuses within NKF. Why should NKF want to admit more transparency if Many ministers openly refuse to answer to complaints about unjustifiable fare increases evening telling people off not to expect free lunch. It is this kind of arrogance that NKF CEO must have copied leading to his downfall.<br><br>Finally "paper cannot cover fire" as a Chinese saying puts it and something will happen like this NKF case.<br><br>This case only shows that the wrong doings would not have happened so boldly if our leaders and ministers are more humble and willing to set themselves as good examples. It is not good enough that after wrongs were committed that they then punish contractors like in the Nicol Highway case. Today despite so many talents can't they do a better job of overseeing work site safety to prevent accdients. They have not fulfilled their responsibilities and have not been transparent refusing to be open and accountable as in the case of NKF.<br><br>NKF is simply a time bomb that finally exploded due to past persistent refusal to be transparent or solve real problems. Finally the problems become too great causing extreme unhappiness. Further acquiescence by government patrons would only make matters worse.<br><br>Nothing short of changing the whole system of arrogant government practices will save the country from deteriorations and wrongs persisting under all kinds with nothing accomplished.<br><br>This state of the running of all ministries is the saddest thing to be learned from this case.<br><br>Without substantial transparency it is doubtful CEOs and managers in charge of departments and GLCs will ever change their current look-good denials and justifications like the NKF until more scandals and malpractices.<br><br>After so many years of talking about growth triangles, economic restructuring or entrepreneurship promotion, what have been achieved? We are becoming a poorer country. Arrogance is the greatest seed of self-destruction. It is countries that go about quietly apply knowledge through broad-based education that overtake the arrogant Singapore over the past years. We are also misled by all the empty talks like reaching for the Swiss standard of living or the world bests in everything when none of the above-stated promises have been fulfulled.<br><br>Unless the whole government stops all the hot airs and start to care for people like Finland, Switzerland, Korea or Taiwan I do not see how the ministers can continue to window dress all the NKF shortcomings claiming it to be talents or leadeship excellence.<br><br>Financial Times recently published an article which called all the corporate governance bull&amp;@#&amp;s. I have observed the corporate governance presentation over CNA and have to agree that aparf from look-good independent directors etc there is nothing excellent in truly accountable work practices at the work level. All the compliance standards would end up as window dressing just to give appearance of being complaint with codes and standards but behind all the problems and wrong doings will continue to persist as in the NKF case despite all the self-acclaims about its achievements.<br><br>The real solutions is pro-people and substantive management with ministers committed to results and solving problems not talking bulls or looking good on their presumed leadership or forms.<br><br>I would advise them to be less arrogant and try to be humble looking out for comments and opinions to reduce the high costs affecting the people who are struggling for survival.<br><br>NKF is just a tip of the iceberg. There may be many cans of worms in many more departments. The wastages caused by NLB and Changi air terminal demolitions can feed thousands of people and provide safety nets to relieve the unemployed.<br><br>Don't say these millions of losses are peanuts when the peanut dusts can feed many people more than three meals. Come down to earth and serve the people like servants once again as elites do not seem to have any interest now in understanding or solving problems.<br>_________________</div>

Unfortunately, it was not the style when her remarks were probably picked up by reporters from the foreign press.<br><br>At the end of this entire exercise, the CEO and his Board of Directors were finally removed from office, and the Government could lay their hands to appoint "trusted" persons to manage the huge PEANUT Reserves, and implement controls to this Charity - which had over the years, glaringly expose the weak or non-existent Government's effort to help kidney patients.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The power of the press comes not only from the ability to withhold/disseminate information, but from its ability to make viewers see a story from any angle of their choosing.<br><br>That was how I felt when I read the reports on AcidFlask. If I had no other source of information to compare with, and relied solely on information given out by CNA and ST, I would have assumed that AcidFlask was guilty. And I had no idea what the original contents of his article were!<br><br>I have no doubt that if SPH wanted to, they could tell their stories in such a way as to make Durai the 'reluctant scapegoat', by giving interviews about how he slept very little, giving 18hours a day for 13 years of his life into a charity. Follow this up with annecdotal accounts from patients and staff about how he cared for them despite his busy schedule etc etc, I'm sure more people will empathise with him.<br><br>Most people feel that SPH has finally taken the small steps towards being a free and open press. But until I see their reports coincide with reports given by other entities with no vested interest, or present quotes 'as is' without being taken out of context, or avoid sensationalizing issues so that other equally noteworthy matters do not go below the radar, I remain very sceptical of this 'free and open press' of ours.</div>
