            <div class='col-md body'>Yesterday, when I passed by a job centre I noticed several advertisements for workers in various administrative jobs. A typical advert is for a full-time administrative assistant in a commercial firm. They were looking for a fresh graduate or someone from a secretarial school with some working experience. The starting pay was between 10-12k GBP per annum (S$29,592-35,510 per annum or about S$2466-2959 per month).

Shearman &amp; Stirling, a global law firm, is offering 36,500 GBP in the first year, 39,500 GBP in the second year and 72,000 GBP (S$213k per year or S$17,750 per month) for newly qualified lawyers after their Bar exams.<br><br>It illustrates the big pay difference between graduates from an 'average' university and those from Oxbridge colleges.

I would suggest that you read the questions I have raised in my post, decide for yourself if mushy's conclusions make sense in light of the issues I have raised and see if what he says actually adds up.</div>

Singapore has never had such a system, and any and all questioning of the government's policies is squashed by a legal system that effectively supports and helps create an autocracy.  In light of a lack of questioning, how can concepts such as truth and justice exist?</div>
