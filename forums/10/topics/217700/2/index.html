Graduates can be pigeon-holed, says another recruiter: Â“Organisations are quite rank-based Â– you are officer grade or not officer grade. <strong>If you went to Oxbridge, that opens a lot of doors, so does a good degree from one of the top ten universities</strong>.Â”<br><br>Graduates who get stuck can always leave after a year or two. The grads who get into front office roles are likely to stay, while ambitious staff who wind up in back office jobs are apt to leave.<br><br>Â“Some of these programmes are so large a junior person can get lost,Â” warns Heise. Â“The person coming in should constantly be looking for their managers and making suggested so they donÂ’t get stuck. Take on responsibility and donÂ’t be content with what you are doing.Â”<br><br>Pay and potential<br><br>Anna Symons at IT recruiter McGregor Boyall says a new grad in a bank should have three or four rotations in the first year. Starting salaries should run Â£25,000-30,000 depending on the quality of the degree. Within two years a top grad with skills such as object-oriented programming could be earning Â£50,000-Â£55,000.<br><br>Heise at Project Partners says, Â“It goes without saying that if you have a first class degree from a strong university and you come across well you should not have too much of a problem securing a role in a graduate programme. They are looking for people who can think outside the box and can demonstrate they can suggest solutions or enhance the way existing solutions work.Â”<br><br>One danger for new graduates is coming across as arrogant, Heise says. Â“I have seen a number who are extremely confident of getting a new role and they have a real problem because they think they are better than they are.Â”<br><br>Symons says grads can help their careers by learning to get along with others in the workplace. Â“Someone with a First from Oxbridge in science can probably do what they want, if they have the soft skills.Â” Smart grads learn how to get along, from managing expectations to knowing what to say and what not to say."<br><br>http://news.bankingtech.efinancialcareers.com/GRADUATE_ITEM/newsItemId-4577<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Woah, quite a bit of gunpowder smell in here. Seems like we've got the few big forumites of Sgforums in here debating topics related to Elitism.<br><br>Question: Lets get to the basic, what is Elitism? Or who do we classify as an elite. Sure there are sterotype, if you go from RI to RJC, you are an elite. If you are a President Scholar, SAF Scholar and so on, you are an elite. But what are the exact criteria and definition of an elite?<br><br>The dictionary defines Elite: the most powerful, rich, or talented people within a particular group<br><br>Elitism: the belief that a society or country should be ruled by a small group of people who are superior to everyone else.<br><br>In Singapore's context, I would believe that elite refers to the most talented people rather than the rich. For all of MM Lee's might and power, if our current PM Lee had been born an idiot or chose not to study hard, he would not be deemed an elite, no? We also often associate elite to top notch schools such as RI, RJC, HCJC. Despite all your critics against PAP, would you not agree with me that generally one's progress within the education system still depends on one's own talent and hardwork. If one's father is a serial killer or earns about $800 per month, you will not be rejected by RJC as long as your results are up to it. On the otherhand, even if your dad or mum is the MP of such and such, if you flunk your O level, you either take a trip oversea or go ITE no?<br><br>So an elite in Singapore's term would be one that had displayed their academic talents consistantly from a young age. Elitism in Singapore's context would therefore be to form a government by choosing those that had performed well in school since a young age, irregardless of family background (generally, unless you share my family background)<br><br>So.....what's wrong with a society that trains its best students to become the next generation of leaders? I mean the alternative sounds strange, would you rather deliberately not choose the best students to be a state's next generation's leaders?<br><br>But I think most people's issue is not with choosing these students as potential leaders, but rather the trend that these leaders do not listen to opinions or at least perceived to be not listening to others, namely the vast majority of the population. I said perceived, because at times it is really hard to actually show that you "listen" to the population. The population is often divided and thus its opinion differs, take the casino as an example, there are people who wants it and those who doesn't want it, poor or rich, the views are diverse. Either decision, the government will appear to be not listening as there are always a part of the population holding opposite view.<br><br>Having said so, the transperancy of Singapore government and the lack of independent checks such as Ombudsmen does give rise to suspicious of "how many skelatons are there in the closest?" However, a rise of suspicious cannot amount to a conviction and it would be rather irrationale to equate lack of transperancy to bad governance. China (our partial cultural ancestor), has had Emperors who did very well despite the lack of transperancy. Western thinkers such as Isben in his play "Enemy of the Public" also suggest that the vast majority of a population may not always or rather tend to not, come up with both morally and rationally correct decisions.<br><br>The western liberal democracy is really the dominant political theory only in very recent times and it is hardly a panacea. But suffice it to say that Singapore is hardly the only state in the world that has not had all the necessary checks. But even if these checks are in place, there is no guarantee that the government will be better than one without these checks. Checks are artificial and as the Chinese saying goes, Dao Gao Yi Chi, Mo Gao Yi Zhang, people will always find ways to get round the checks. The US for example, is hardly a popular one, but Bush did win both elections, despite the conspirarcy theories out there, the fact remains that a much disliked person currently seats in the Whitehouse.<br><br>*its currently late here, and I shall stop here for now but will continue it on another day. And people, with regards to the name callings, try to ease on it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sorry, I really dont agree that high pay for ministers and civil servants is a bad thing.<br><br>I think it is one of the main tenets of Singapore's progress.<br><br>Singapore has efficient civil service, and people working there are relatively intelligent just like another sector in a private company.<br><br>I dont understand really, why is high pay considered bad?<br><br>If you want to establish an organization......or a company......you will want to run it with the best people, correct?<br><br>Seems to me a little weird why it's considered bad.<br><br>I often read about passion, wanting to help others, etc as being mentioned as reasons why people should work in politics with less motivation for money. I just simply dont trust this kind of argument.<br><br>I mean, people work. If people work, salary should be given. Serious job with serious salary. I think being a minister is a serious job, technical, intellectual, being in a leadership position in a big organization, dealing with many people.<br><br>Really, why is it keep being mentioned as a bad thing?<br><br>I keep thinking that this is actually a big strategic advantage for Singapore to have this kind of system.</div>

The founding basics, the foundation of the house is already laid out. The house is already built up, and there is only a certain way to continue to build the house.<br><br>If you change the house building process, you must first destroy the existing house and the foundations.<br><br>It will be very disorientating.

            <div class='col-md body'>If I may continue with the previous idea.....<br><br>Let's take a look at the world around us. Let's take a look at other societies and their political systems.<br><br>There are several countries where the government was strong and a party was strong for a long time.<br><br>Japan LDP, last time they had a bit problem, but look what happen, now LDP is still in power.<br><br>Indonesia Golkar, last time they had also abit problem, but now Golkar is still in power.<br><br>Russian experience, after the Soviet Union collapse, look at what happen now, Vladimir Putin is the president. He is former KGB, he is not shy to revoke some things like governor autonomy.<br><br>Taiwan KMT, currently having problem in recent time. Possibly return to power with Ma Ying Jeow.<br><br>Why.....?????<br><br>Because simply in all these cases, the house has already been built for a long time by a certain contractor who laid the basics and work on the house for a long time.<br><br>If you change contractor then the house will take new shapes and you will get disoriented with the disruptions and finally you prefer to return to your old contractor.<br><br>I really dont think PAP can be unseated, nor will it be good. Nor should.<br><br>PAP is Singapore's builders. They are the same people.<br><br>The thing of the 'problem' with Singapore is, how should I say, these PAP contractors copy a masterplan from some other contractor instead of using its own masterplan. Singapore is trying to copy a form of democracy, but dont really implement it. Singapore just take UK legal system, UK political system, even UK interior layout of the parliament seats. Have you all noticed?<br><br>This is the problem because there will always be people who notice and complain. They notice the masterplan idea is different with the house which got built.<br><br>A real pity. Because they are actually pretty good house builders.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ah sorry, looks like I digress from the topic title 'Elitism or Meritocracy'.<br><br>Firstly this thingy about Elitism......and meritocracy...is just a bit vague to me.<br><br>What is this term elitism?<br><br>I understand meritocracy, it means based on your ability, isnt it?<br><br>If meritocracy is competence, then elitism is a form of meritocracy, is it not?<br><br>I sometimes read these sorts of threads on elitism, scholarships, top schools like RJ, etc etc, but I really dont understand the gist of the idea that people are talking about when they say elitism, and how it is supposed to be changed.<br><br>Scholarships is a form of meritocracy, correct?<br><br>It seems maybe, to me, the bad thing of elitism is, in the meritocracy system some people are so competent that they are ahead, like rich people poor people, and therefore some people think there is a division, there is a gap. Therefore some people say there is elitism.<br><br>Ok.....maybe.<br><br>But this is like....in capitalist system there is rich and poor, and in meritocracy there is elitism and commonism. Simply something which exists, a by-product. Cannot really be rid of without changing the bigger picture.</div>
