              <p>HK's govt meets banks accused of mis-selling Lehman bonds (2 October 2008)<br> <br> AFP - Hong Kong's financial services chief on Thursday weighed in on
              the dispute over the possible mis-selling of investment products backed
              by failed US bank Lehman Brothers.<br> <br> Chan Ka-cheung, secretary for financial services, met representatives
              of 21 banks, who are accused by disgruntled investors of mis-selling
              "mini-bonds" that could now be worthless.<br> <br> "I hope the banks can be more pro-active in getting in touch with their
              clients so that they can provide them with relevant information," he
              told broadcaster Cable News after the meeting.<br> <br> "The banks must ensure that their clients know the method they are using to deal with the mini-bonds."<br> <br> Chan added that the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the
              Securities and Futures Commission had also agreed to increase manpower
              to look into complaints filed by individual investors.<br> <br> Until Thursday noon, the HKMA said they had received more than 3,500 complaints on Lehman bonds.<br> <br> Some of the banks, including DBS and DahSing, had agreed to settle
              through mediation and have been negotiating with individual investors
              on compensation deals, according to a report in the Apple Daily.<br> <br> The move has put pressure on other banks to find a solution, prompting Chan to hold the meeting, the report said.<br> <br> The investors, who bought 12.7 billion Hong Kong US dollars (1.63
              billion US) of the complex financial products, had earlier threatened
              to sue the banks for not explaining the risks involved before selling
              them the bonds.<br> <br> Many of the investors are retired and had put all their savings into the investment because they trusted their banks.<br> <br> The Securities and Futures Commission said previously it has launched
              an investigation into some of the institutions on alleged mis-selling.<br> <br> Lehman Brothers, one of Wall Street's most established banks, collapsed
              last month, sparking turmoil on financial markets across the world.<br> <br> © 2008 AFP</p>

              <p>If HK DBS is compensating to the investor, which means they are in the wrong.  Then why SG DBS is not compensating? They are not in the wrong when in SG?</p>
              <p>HKMA is giving them pressure so they have to compensate, yet MAS here is not doing much when compared to HKMA.</p>
              <p>When they allow the marketing of structured products, there are already alot of complains.  Nothing much was done and these structured products continue to find more victims.  Very often when i was inside the bank, i was approached by the managers who try to persuade me to buy their products, and i am not the only one being preyed.</p>
              <p>The relationship managers only want to sell these products to earn the commissions, just like a salesman keep telling you to buy a TV set yet he cant tell you the different between a $4000 TV and a $2000 TV other then the size.</p>
              <p>Most victims never understand what they were buying except believing the words of the managers, escpecially they are from Big Banks and linked with the "top".  Technical terms like protected funds will give the impression to most people that it is safe, yet now they said protected is not guaranteed, which there is still risk.  Did they even explain these?</p>
              <p>The authority should be monitoring and controlling all these, yet nothing much was done despite alot of complains during 2006-2007 when alot of people realise the return of these products are not really what they claim when sold by the managers.</p>
              <p>It is obvious who are the ones should bear the responsibilties, but most of the time i guess in this land, the ones that suffer will always be the people.</p>

              <p>1. Transparency means 100% truely Transparent. anything less is NOT, I say NOT real Transparency.   Another term should be used to describe this. The word is used loosely for convenience and as means to an end.</p>
              <p>2. You can believe but let me advise you that believing is form of assumption. You assume your understanding is true or correct. that is unwise and uneducated thinking. Not good for you.</p>
              <p>No one is saying money in bank is safe or not. It is the fact that the existing systems have LOOPHoles for talents to explore. Even a non-accountant knows this. No accountant can deny this.</p>

              <p><br>Your kind of pragmatism is exactly the cause for any inaction in Singapore. Does government listen when citizens complain about price hike for public transport, electricity and health services? The ruling party does not have to act on our pleas because there is an obvious Opposition vaccum in Singapore. PAP is re-elected as government every GE because very few people run for political office under the Opposition flag and the Opposition is forever squabbling among themselves.</p>
              <p>Given PAP's complacency in securing parliamentary majority, we need a substantially strong voice to keep the ruling party in check. I am only advocating for social justice for all Singaporeans. To leave the government no choice but to intervene favourably for Singaporeans, I advocate strong action to remind the ruling party that Singaporeans matter. We can't vote PAP out because of walkover, but we have the power to move our own money individually. Collective action must reaffirm accountability to the people. I urge the public to come together to pressure PAP to undergo reform and re-establish their socialist roots. PAP in 1969 and PAP in 2008 no longer carry the same set of principles and priorities. Socialist values preached by PAP in the 60s and 70s have been replaced with authoratorian Asian values today.</p>
              <p>Many financial regulators all over the world realised how banks and hedge funds have been acting unethically. The Singapore banking sector is not much different. Short-selling has been banned worldwide, except Singapore.ST Forum and Today Online recently published a letter by a personal banker that blew whistle on her employer for unethical marketing practices, which tie the sale of risky investment products to retail investors (aka your ah-gong and ah-ma) to their salary. These salesman are under the jurisidiction of the Financial Advisor Act, of which Section 27 states clearly these salesman are liable for their recommendation. I am not advocating chaos. I am advocating the government and MAS to uphold the very same law they create. Nobody is above the law, including the PAP.</p>
              <p>Many people complain of unjust laws and policies made by the PAP, but almost nobody wants to take their case straight to PAP. It is never too late to start. Better late than never.</p>
