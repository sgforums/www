              <p><br> Your kind of pragmatism is exactly the cause for any inaction in
              Singapore. Does government listen when citizens complain about
              price hike for public transport, electricity and health services?
              The ruling party does not have to act on our pleas
              because there is an obvious Opposition vaccum in
              Singapore. PAP is re-elected as government every GE because
              very few people run for political office under the Opposition flag
              and the Opposition is forever squabbling among themselves.</p>
              <p>Given PAP's complacency in securing parliamentary majority,
              we need a substantially strong voice to keep the ruling party in
              check. I am only advocating for social justice for all
              Singaporeans. To leave the government no choice but to intervene
              favourably for Singaporeans, I advocate strong action to remind the
              ruling party that Singaporeans matter. We can't vote PAP out
              because of walkover, but we have the power to move our own money
              individually. Collective action must reaffirm accountability to the
              people. I urge the public to come together to pressure PAP to
              undergo reform and re-establish their socialist roots. PAP in 1969
              and PAP in 2008 no longer carry the same set of principles and
              priorities. Socialist values preached by PAP in the 60s and 70s
              have been replaced with authoratorian Asian values today.</p>
              <p>Many financial regulators all over the world realised how banks
              and hedge funds have been acting unethically. The Singapore banking
              sector is not much different. Short-selling has been banned
              worldwide, except Singapore.ST Forum and Today Online recently
              published a letter by a personal banker that blew whistle
              on her employer for unethical marketing practices, which tie the
              sale of risky investment products to retail investors (aka your
              ah-gong and ah-ma) to their salary. These salesman are under the
              jurisidiction of the Financial Advisor Act, of which Section 27
              states clearly these salesman are liable for their recommendation.
              I am not advocating chaos. I am advocating the government and MAS
              to uphold the very same law they create. Nobody is above the law,
              including the PAP.</p>
              <p>Many people complain of unjust laws and policies made by the
              PAP, but almost nobody wants to take their case straight to PAP. It
              is never too late to start. Better late than never.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>If people are comfortable with how things are, why should they be inclined to not vote for PAP?</p>
              <p>At the end of the day, you have to hold your representative responsible for not representing your views, if you so choose to. So, let your fingers do the talking and vote for someone else.</p>
              <p>IMO, we should have elections once every two years so that people won't forget how under-represented they have been.</p>

              <p>The masses have spoken today when over 1000 people have turned up at
                  Hong Lim Park to protest against MAS inaction. Further inaction from MAS warrants action from you.  Close
                  down your DBS/POSB accounts and move your money to another local bank.
                  If MAS does not want to conduct an independent inquiry, it is only
                  fair to protect your assets from very same bank that you felt that had

              <p>Calculation of the credit event redemption amount is expected to be completed on or about October 24.</p>
              <p>Managing director Linda Wong said the bank will not buy back the
                  structured retail notes, which have the failed US investment bank among

              <p>Now you understand why DBS take POSB, on the other hand, HK can do it doesn't mean we can do it here. There is nothing to loose for the HK peoples and their govt, so their govt supported them to their advantage, that is getting more popular, if DBS dun refund, it will make the matter worse in term of our relationship with China. But in here, SG, DBS is part of MAS, and MAS is part of PAP, and you as a citizen who buy investment with open eyes hoping for a gain but turn out to be a lost, what do you complain for, cos in the first place, nobody put a damn Gun on your head and force you to buy, it is because of your own greedyness to take the risk for high return, so isn't it fair.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you look at the terms and conditons of both HK and SG investment products sold under DBS, it is totally different.</p>

              <p><br>Oh my gosh, People United???? Only got party and free dinner, people here will get united, but when there is problem, each take care of themselves, United??? u must be joking, if people are united here, long long PAP gone liao. Individuality is key success of PAP strategy in controlling SG, I really admired them that they really split each one of us into kiasee, kiasee and care for oneself mentality, that make them easier to control and implement unpopular policy like the electrical increases</p>

              I understand very well what you are talking about. That´s why I advocate
              Singaporeans to transfer their funds out from DBS and/or close their
              DBS bank accounts. I also know very well what the effects of mass withdrawal of funds can do to a bank. I don´t need you to tell me the obvious. Ultimately, Singaporeans still hold the mandate to this country.</p>

              <p>I know, we both aren't protestor, protestor will not post here, they will rally with banner in head and shouting somewhere fighting for their rites..those posting here calling themselves protestor and rally for support are mostly chicken heads that can cockerel coooocckkk here only.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have already said, you cannot get all singaporeans to withdraw from DBS, cos we are individualistic, professional people who work on our own, you can call that selfish, but that is how it works, and further more we are loyal and listen to the govt, look at recent AIA problem, of the millions of policies, only 1200 withdrew at A LOST. Because why?? because the govt (MAS) said dun worry, so the people never worry.</p>
              <p>If DBS who is under MAS said dun worry, do you think the people are going to worry. LKY once said, One nation, One singapore. IF the nation goes down, we go togther, BUT believe me, I build this nation, and even at my deathbed, i will rise to keep us together, One nation, One Singapore.</p>

              <p>Hi Katherine,</p>
              <p>would it be unfair to say that Majority Singaporeans do not Voice Up? And do not usually Voice Up for the those facing hardship like hikes?</p>
              <p>If not unfair to say that, then do these investors now complaining deserve someone to Voice Up for them?</p>
              <p>I like the whole country to think about Community Spirit and not just only for yourself like when you lose your money then only you voice up. We need a national level education to wake up all singaporeans to teach them that there should be a Mature Culture of Speaking Up on ALL Social issues affecting not just one person but ALL the middleclass and lower class singaporeans.</p>
              <p>When they need someone to Voice Up for them, were they not grateful that Mr Tan was there FREE of Charge for them?</p>
              <p>Singaporeans, Please wake up for your own salvation.</p>

              <p>Hi. For some reason, I was unable to login to my account and I somehow managed to re-activate it. Be_my_lady, check your inbox!</p>
              <p>For me,it is <strong>extremely stupid</strong> to continue to
                                          keep your money in the very same bank that you had perceived to
                                          cheat you, your friends and/or your family.</p>
              <p>Withdrawing your funds
                                          from DBS/POSB may even get you a better deal elsewhere in
                                          Singapore. For example, Maybank charges 0.5% interest higher for
                                          their current accounts.</p>
              <p>So why not turn go to DBS Shenton Way tomorrow 10am to withdraw
                                          your money and close down your DBS/POSB bank account?</p>
              <p>Because your
                                          relationship with the bank is creditor-debtor, it is not illegal at
                                          all to withdraw your money. We don´t have to protest against DBS
                                          and MAS in the form of sit-in.We can protest in spirit by taking
                                          back our monies which have not been lost!</p>
              <p>Withdrawing your money and closing down your DBS bank account is
                                          not illegal. Yet at the same time, this act can exert as much as pressure (<strong>if not more</strong>) on DBS than the Sit-In. Conversely, a Sit-In is illegal. So have any of you made up your mind what the smartest thing to do is?</p>
