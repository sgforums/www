              <h1 id="story_title">Justice Ian Chin tells of threats and indoctrination attempt</h1>
              <div id="story_content"><br>
              <p>PETALING JAYA: A High Court judge here revealed that a former prime minister had threatened judges. Justice Datuk Ian H. C. Chin also said he and selected judges were sent to a boot camp to ensure they got the message.</p>
              <p>Justice Chin said this before hearing an election petition challenging the results of the Sarikei parliamentary seat which was won by a Barisan Nasional candidate by just 51 votes.</p>
              <p>In a report in the <em>Borneo Post</em> yesterday, that comes hot on the heels of the findings of the Royal Commission on the V.K. Lingam video clip, Justice Chin said the threat from the former prime minister came after he handed down two judgments in 1997.</p>
              <p>One was a judgment on a libel case involving MGG Pillai and Tan Sri Vincent Tan where he refused to give what he considered to be an astronomical award.</p>
              </div>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Justice Chin said the other judgment was in an election petition on Bukit Bangunan in the Sri Aman Division that he ruled in favour of Independent candidate Donald Lawan against Barisan Nasional candidate Mong Dagang.</p>
              <p>“Shortly after the two judgments, the Judges Conference was held from April 24, 1997 where the then prime minister issued a thinly veiled threat to remove judges by referring them to a tribunal and stating that, though it may be difficult to do so, it was still done.”</p>
              <p>Justice Chin said the former prime minister expressed unhappiness with what he termed ‘the Borneo Case’.</p>
              <p>“Everyone knew which case he was referring to,” he added.</p>
              <p>Justice Chin said after the threat, the former Prime Minister said people should pay heavily for libel and he only got a single response from a Court of Appeal judge who asked if he would be happy with a sum of RM1mil as damages for libel.</p>
              <p>“He approved of it and later made known his satisfaction by promoting this judge (since deceased) to the Federal Court over many others who were senior to him.”</p>
              <p>A month later, Justice Chin said he and select judges and judicial officers were packed off to a boot camp from May 26-30, 1997 where there was an attempt to indoctrinate them with the view “that the government interest was more important than all else.”</p>
              <p>“Stating this devilish notion was no less a person than the President of the Court of Appeal. Everyone was quiet during the question sessions.”</p>
              <p>Justice Chin added “the perversion of justice” continued and recounted an episode when a fellow judge Muhammad Kamil Awang told him he had received a telephone call from the then Chief Justice asking him to dismiss the election petition that he was going to hear in Kota Kinabalu.</p>
              <p>“We went into the possibility of making a police report or of writing to the Chief Justice a letter to record what he had said over the telephone but in the end he decided against it since it would be his word against that of the Chief Justice,” he said.</p>
              <p>Justice Chin said he was happy to later on learn that Kamil did not bow to the pressure and went on to hear the petition, thereafter making a decision based on law and evidence.</p>
              <p>Justice Chin said he wanted the parties involved in the current petition and their counsel to hear his disclosure in case they wanted him to recuse himself.</p>
              <p>The High Court judge said he had twice stood unsuccessfully as a Barisan Nasional candidate for a parliamentary and later for a state seat in Sabah in the 1980s and in one of those elections he was defeated by a DAP candidate.</p>
              <p>“Now, though he is no longer the prime minister and so no longer able to carry out his threat to remove judges, the coalition party that he led is still around” and the second respondent was a Barisan candidate and “it may cross someone’s mind that I may have an axe to grind against the party concerned or any party thereof.”</p>
              <p>To this, he said: “No amount of words from me would assuage you of your worry. You will have to read my judgments as to whether they are according to the evidence and the law or were influenced by threat.”</p>
              <p>Chin then adjourned for half an hour to let the parties consider whether they wished to make any application for his recusal.</p>
              <p>However, the parties – DAP’s Dr Wong Hua Seh and Barisan’s Ding Kuong Hiing – expressed their full confidence in him in presiding over the hearing of the case.</p>
              <p>Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad was prime minister at the relevant time. He was not available for comment yesterday.</p>

              <p>This reminds me of  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.ipsofactoj.com/archive/1988/Part6/arc1988(6)-007.htm">‘J.B.Jeyaratnam’s appeal to Privy Council vindicate District Court Judge Michael Khoo’s decsion’  </a>- in which J.B.J acquittal from the initial charges by District Court Judge Michael Khoo was overturned by the Chief Justice Wee Chong Jin on appeal by AG Chambers.</p>
              <p>Then PM LKY had challenged JBJ to make his appeal to the UK Privy Council - which was retained by LKY to review the standards of the Singapore Judiciary - and declared in Parliament that if the Privy Council should find the Singapore Appeal Court judgement to be wrong, he will recommend a Presidential Pardon for JBJ.</p>
              <p>As matters stand, the Privy Council did find the decisions - of the Singapore Appeal Court presided by the Chief Justice - to be wrong in overturning the District Court Judge acquittal of JBJ</p>
              <p>Following the Privy Council review, LKY repealed his own decision to have the Privy Council to review the performance standards of the Singapore Judiciary, claiming that the Privy Council is "out-of-touch" with Singapore, and that it was a symbol of a Colonial past.</p>
              <p>A single party dominate Parliament quickly passed a Bill to make the Singapore Appeals Court as the final court of appeal, and the Privy Council no longer a factor in the Singapore judicial system.</p>
              <p>District Court Judge was removed from the bench, and transferred to the Attorney-General's Chambers in his new position as a Solicitor-General.</p>
              <p>LKY never saw it fit to recommend J.B.J for a Presidential pardon - despite his highly publicised statement made.</p>

              <p>I have to agree with you on that point Gazelle.</p>
              <p>After Lee Kuan Yew saw that the Privy Council could be used by his opponents to their advantage, he abolished the powers of that body in Singapore.</p>

              <p>This is typical of Lee Kuan Yew.</p>
              <p>But since I despise the british interference in Singapore affairs just as much as Lee Kuan Yew, I do not object to this move.</p>

              <p>Or should the truth be said that you had intended to give up your toy gun as a result of continuously being embarrassed for your 'blank points' fired, and treated like a fool ?</p>
              <p>Still, you simply cannot resist to engage yourself to face the truth of your "intellectually challenged" status by returning in a wild charge hoping to hit a target with more "point blank" shots that will continue to hit ''blank points''.</p>

              <p>If sovereignty prevent us from being taught, or learn by bench-marking ourselves with the 'Best of the Best' - then you should continue to hold LKY and his Government in contempt for the continued dependence in aligning best practices for Singapore - in the various fields of education, trade, and  defence - to a variety of neo-colonialists and imperialists in the various regional and bi-lateral agreements with UK, USA, Australia, France, Germany, Sweden, Indonesia, Malaysia and any other Western or Asian Countries that has a history of imperialism or colonialism.</p>

              <p>With a free hand, has it not allowed LKY to ''design an Election System'' that allowed his political party to dominate Parliament, enabling the expeditious passing of bills into narrow laws to regulate the citizens and prevent politiccal parties from growing to challenge his dominance; and leaving a judiciary little options to execute the crafted laws tailored for the narrow interests of a single political agenda ?</p>
              <p>If sovereign pride prevent us from any interference - looking at it from a micro-view - why has Singapore surrendered the sanctity in the political sovereignty of each Singaporean to LKY - and allow his political agenda to dominate and strip everyone's sovereign rights to political independence within Singapore ?</p>

              <p>Welcome back, DeerHunter - I was under the impression that you had given up your hunting license ,as you claimed that you do not wish to be embarassed to be seen arguing with someone you consider to be a fool.</p>
              <p>Or should the truth be said that you had intended to give up your toy gun as a result of continuously being embarrassed for your 'blank points' fired, and treated like a fool ?</p>
              <p>Still, you simply cannot resist to engage yourself to face the truth of your "intellectually challenged" status by returning in a wild charge hoping to hit a target with more "point blank" shots that will continue to hit ''blank points''.</p>
              <p> Were you a citizen when LKY made his decision in 1965 to retain the Privy Council ?</p>
              <p>Where were you then - if you did not even exist and probably not even a flotsam in the genetic stream of your family tree ?</p>
              <p>Why should you be shocked ?</p>
              <p>Are you not over-reaching your own status to even be in any position to pass judgment on LKY's intellectual strategic thinking</p>
              <p>Your displayed intellectual capacity can hardly place you even near the waist-line height of LKY's trousers.</p>
              <p>Can we trust you to even reach any appreciation, or come to any conclusion that LKY's political step-by-step agenda is in bidding his time in his use of any person or institution that will advance his own plans and time lines ?</p>

              <p>Another confirmation of political interference on the Malaysian Judiciary exposed by a retired judge, who is brave enough to speak his mind;</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>The Star, Friday June 13, 2008<br><strong></strong>
              <p><strong>Ex-judges: CJs call the shots<br></strong>by SHAILA KOSHY</p>
              <p>KUALA LUMPUR: How effectively judges can raise issues without fear during the Conference of Judges depends on who the Chief Justice is, several retired judges said.</p>
              <p>They said the conference was an effective forum for issues to be brought up until the removal of Tun Salleh Abas as Lord President in 1988.</p>
              <p>They said this in response to the question why several judges have, over the years, resorted to making shocking revelations or disturbing statements either in open court, in written judgments or public speeches.</p>
              <p>The latest was that of High Court judge Datuk Ian Chin who said he felt threatened by a former prime minister after making two judgments.</p>
              <p>He also claimed he was sent to a “boot camp” in 1997 designed to indoctrinate judges and judicial officers to put Government interest above anything else when considering a judgment.</p>
              <p>“In the years of former lord presidents Tun Suffian (Hashim), Raja Azlan Shah (as he then was), Tun Salleh and even to a lesser extent Tun Hamid (Omar), nobody would have talked down to us,” said Court of Appeal judge Datuk V.C. George who retired in December 1995.</p>
              <p>“They certainly would never have told us how to decide a case. We were able to raise issues without fear and even debate them vociferously at times.</p>
              <p>“During and after the Tun Salleh debacle, we were never given the opportunity to talk about that.”</p>
              <p>Datuk Visu Sinnadurai, who served as a High Court judge from 1992-1997, said that whoever held the post of CJ set the tenor, standards or behaviour for the rest of the judiciary.</p>
              <p>“The CJ’s role is important because it is his responsibility to ensure the independence of the judiciary and that the rule of law is upheld at all times.”</p>
              <p>Datuk Shaik Daud Ismail, who retired as Court of Appeal judge in June 2001, said: “Judges should be more open and should not be afraid to speak out even though it may hurt (another judge) because it is for the good of the judiciary,” he said.</p>
              <p>Asked where judges should take their complaints, he said the Conference of Judges was the only place to go.</p>
              <p>Another former judge expressed the hope that Justice Chin would not be asked to resign over his disclosures or if that were to happen, he would not lose his pension or medical benefits as experienced by former High Court judge Datuk Syed Ahmad Idid who had written an anonymous letter alleging improprieties in the judiciary in 1996.</p>

              <p>Hello DeerHunter, have you been peering into the gun-sights for so long without even seeing a single Gazelle, and feeling bored will suppress your feeling of being "embarrassed to become a fool" by arguing with me ?</p>
              <p>You should be embarrassed to argue like a foolish juvenile with your infantile 'blank points' rebuttals that make such a weak attempt at imitating my style ?</p>

              <p>Yes, fools are surely destined to remain as fools - especially those who feel embarrass not to be seen to look like fools arguing with no way of extricating from his fixed position - but will continue to argue to salvage what little is left of a foolish look.</p>
              <p>Did you return by choice to embarrass yourself to look like a fool in the way you argue your position, or were you simply unable to walk away feeling sore in getting rubbed like an ass ?</p>
              <p>Those are very expensive straws that you claimed I am grabbing - they cost $27 Billion in total and was a result of your imaginery trade between China and Singapore in some mysterious account that is by your fantasy said to be ''BOTH WAYS''.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, like the less industrious of the 3 little pigs, you decide to build your house from straws, and you just got yourself blown away with the straws.</p>
              <p>Why feel so sore on a beautiful Sunday ? </p>
              <p>It just your false economic analogy that got exposed - and you just have to return to take more blows for the juvenile tantrums that you are left with.</p>

              <p><br>Unlike some judges in the "First World Countries", there are some in the Malaysian Judiciary who do not need ''million $$$ crutch'' to help keep them from being corrupt.</p>
              <p>With nothing substantial in material or financial amounts to lose, and a more independent judiciary to gain nfrom such revelations - surely this is incentive enough for the Judges to clean up the political rot that is affecting their conscience.</p>
              <p>There are still honorable Judges in Third World Countries that possess a sense of simple honest pride in getting the job done to serve the community - that has placed their trust and confidence in these Judges to protect their interests when the politicians have abandoned this basic value for the sake of pursuing $$$$.</p>
