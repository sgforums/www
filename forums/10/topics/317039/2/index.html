              <p>and if u are going to "look at the circumstances" from the myanmar govt perspective just because they are targeted by the US and that its justifiable for them to refuse help from "enemies" for the ppl, what makes u so different from a PAP which "refuses help" from opposition to help the people?</p>

              <p>Wow. The latest news suggest that about 200 000 people have died
                  in the disaster and more will die. But lets have a referendum.</p>
              <p>Personally, I do not care because I am a cold, callous
                  individual. What I cannot tolerate (because I am a bit of a snob)
                  is a lack of critical thinking and logical thought. That has been
                  demonstrated in spades.</p>
              <p>Unless the govt of burma backs down, I cannot see how this can
                  be resolved.</p>
              <p>The west could simply invade sovereign territory and distribute
                  aid but that is very messy from am international relations pov.
                  They could donate helicopters temporairily to a country burma
                  trusts and let taht country run things but then I am not sure if
                  the burmese govt allows any government to help directly.</p>
              <p>The only way to compel cooperation will be if concerned
                  countries got together and told Burma that they will be treated as
                  pariahs, and forced relevant countries to freeze the assests of the
                  burmese govt. (A point of interest: one of these relevant countries
                  will definitely be singapore. The Son of one of Burmas richest man
                  is living a lovely life in Singapore and some Burmese general had a
                  nice trip to singapore not long ago. Therefore Singaproe must hold
                  alot of their assets)</p>
              <p>As
              I said, from a humanitarian pov, refusal to accept help to distribute
              aid is wrong. It is almost akin to genocide. That at least, is clear.</p>

              <p>KYI BUI KHAW, Myanmar - The saffron-robed monks who spearheaded a bloody uprising last fall against <span id="lw_1210616736_0" class="yshortcuts" style="border-bottom: medium none; background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 50%; cursor: pointer;   -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial;">Myanmar</span>'s military rulers are back on the front lines, this time providing food, shelter and spiritual solace to cyclone victims.</p>
              <p>The military regime has moved to curb the Buddhist clerics' efforts,
              even as it fails to deliver adequate aid itself. Authorities have given
              some monasteries deadlines to clear out refugees, many of whom have no
              homes to return to, monks and survivors say.</p>
              <p>"There is no aid. We haven't seen anyone from the government," said
              U Pinyatale, the 45-year-old abbot of the Kyi Bui Kha monastery sharing
              almost depleted rice stocks and precious rainwater with some 100
              homeless villagers huddled within its battered compound.</p>
              <p>Similar scenes are being repeated in other areas of the Irrawaddy delta and <span id="lw_1210616736_1" class="yshortcuts" style="border-bottom: medium none; background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 50%; cursor: pointer;   -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial;">Yangon</span>,
              the country's largest city, where monasteries became safe havens after
              Cyclone Nargis struck May 3 — and the regime did little.</p>
              <p>"In the past I used to give donations to the monks. But now it's the
              other way around. It's the monks helping us," said Aung Khaw, a
              38-year-old construction worker who took his wife and young daughter to
              a monastery in the Yangon suburb of Hlaingtharyar after the roof of his
              flimsy house was blown away and its bamboo walls collapsed.</p>
              <p>One of the monastery's senior monks said he tried to argue with
              military officials who ordered the more than 100 refugees to leave.</p>
              <p>"I don't know where they will go. But that was the order," he said, asking for anonymity for fear of reprisals.</p>
              <p>The government has not announced such an order, which appeared to be
              applied selectively. Other monasteries in Yangon have been told to
              clear out cyclone victims in coming days, the monk said, but in the
              delta, refugees were being allowed to remain or told they could come to
              monasteries for supplies but not shelter.</p>
              <p>"They don't want too many people gathering in small towns," said Hla
              Khay, a delta boat operator. The regime "is concerned about security.
              With lots of frustrated people together, there may be another uprising."</p>
              <p>Larger monasteries were being closely watched by troops and
              plainclothes security men — "invisible spies" as one monk called them.</p>
              <p>Such diversion of manpower at a time when some 1.5 million people
              are at risk from disease and starvation reflects the regime's fear of a
              replay of last September, when monks led pro-democracy demonstrations
              that were brutally suppressed.</p>
              <p>Monks were shot, beaten and imprisoned, igniting anger among
              ordinary citizens in this devoutly Buddhist country. An unknown number
              remain behind bars, and others have yet to return to their monasteries
              after fleeing for fear of arrest.</p>
              <p>"I think after the September protests, the government is afraid that
              if people live with the monks in the monasteries, the monks might
              persuade them to participate in demonstrations again," said a dentist
              in Yangon, who also asked that his name not be used for fear of
              reprisals.</p>
              <p>Newspapers have been ordered not to publish stories about monks
              aiding the people, and at least one monastery and one nunnery in Yangon
              were prohibited from accepting any supplies from relief organizations.</p>
              <p>"The government is very controlling," said U Pinyatale, the abbot at
              the Kyi Bui Kha monastery. "Those who want to give directly to the
              victims get into trouble. They have to give to the government or do it
              secretly. (The military) follows international aid trucks everywhere.
              They don't want others to take credit."</p>
              <p>It appears unlikely that foreign aid organizations seeking to enter <span id="lw_1210616736_2" class="yshortcuts" style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #0066cc; cursor: pointer;">Myanmar</span> will be allowed to use monks as conduits for relief supplies as many had hoped.</p>
              <p>"One of the best networks already in place in the country are the
              monks," said Gary Walker of PLAN, a British-based international
              children's group, speaking from <span id="lw_1210616736_3" class="yshortcuts">Bangkok</span>. "So we'll be exploring ways in which we can see whether the monks can start distributing supplies throughout the country."</p>
              <p>At the Kyi Bui Kha monastery, located on the banks of the Pyapon
              River deep in the delta, U Pinyatale glanced anxiously at the remaining
              10 bags of rice.</p>
              <p>"At most, we have enough for the week. We will have to find a
              way to get more food," he said as monks and villagers worked together
              to try to dry the sodden rice, even as rain clouds gathered above the
              largely roofless monastery.</p>
              <p>In Yangon, monks have been able to go out on their traditional
              morning rounds to accept food donations from the faithful and then
              share these with refugees at their monasteries. But in devastated areas
              of the delta that is not an option.</p>
              <p>About 90 of the 120 houses in Kyi Bui Kha have been totally
              destroyed. Gaps in the monastery's storm-riddled wooden walls revealed
              a 360-degree view of ravaged rice fields.</p>
              <p>U Pinyatale said the sanctuary's two dozen monks and nuns were
              also trying to offer spiritual comfort to the traumatized villagers.</p>
              <p>"We pray with them. We pray for the dead to go to the peaceful
              land of the dead and for the living to rebuild their lives," he said.</p>
              <p>"When the cyclone came, all of us hid in the rice warehouse. I
              saw one person holding tightly onto a tree but he did not make it," the
              abbot added. "After the storm, there were dead bodies floating
              everywhere. Some people get nightmares. Some hear voices at night that
              their dead children are calling for help. Some haven't spoken since."</p>
