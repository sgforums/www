              <p>Considering that there hasn't been a major terrorist incident (mostly carbombs targeting small targets rather than national symbols) since September 11, 2001.  Majority of the violence is contained in Afghanistan, Gaza and Iraq, and while the rest of the middle eastern states condemn US presence, they are benefiting if not flourishing from the unprecedented level of stability and economic growth.</p>

              <p>SOUTH East Asian nations will take the
              lead in an international aid effort for cyclone-hit Burma, but the
              ruling military junta will not allow unfettered access for relief
              teams, the Association of South East Asian Nations said today.</p>
              </div>
              <p>"We will establish a mechanism so that aid from all
              over the world can flow into Myanmar (Burma),'' Singapore's Foreign
              Minister George Yeo said.<br><br>Burma - which is a part of ASEAN - repeated its willingness to accept foreign help, Mr Yeo said. <br><br>"For
              a start, the Myanmar Government has agreed to accept the immediate
              dispatch of medical teams from all the ASEAN countries,'' Mr Yeo said.<br><br>However, the entry of aid workers from outside ASEAN would be on a case-by-case basis. <br><br>"We have to look at specific needs - there will not be uncontrolled access,'' he said.<br><br>ASEAN
              will work with the United Nations to hold an "international pledging
              conference'' in Burma's main city, Rangoon, on May 25 to pool together
              aid for the victims, Mr Yeo said. <br><br>UN Secretary-General Ban
              Ki-moon has said the world body and ASEAN should together co-ordinate a
              ramped-up relief effort for the 2.5 million people left destitute by
              Cyclone Nargis, which struck Burma two weeks ago. <br><br>Ban was due
              to fly to Rangoon this week to tour the hardest-hit Irrawaddy Delta and
              is expected to meet with junta supremo Than Shwe, who refused to take a
              call from the United Nations' boss on the cyclone, which has left
              134,000 dead or missing. <br><br>Humanitarian agencies say the death
              toll from Nargis, already one of the most devastating cyclones to hit
              Asia, could soar without a massive increase of emergency food, water,
              shelter and medicine to the Irrawaddy Delta. <br><br>Burma's military
              government has so far refused to admit large-scale foreign aid for fear
              it will loosen its 46-year grip on power. <br><br>However, Britain's
              Asia Minister, Mark Malloch-Brown, said yesterday diplomats may have
              turned the corner in brokering an aid deal that accommodated the
              generals' deep distrust of the outside world, in particular the West. <br><br>"Like all turning points in Burma, the corner will have a few 'S' bends in it,'' he said.<br><br>While
              aid has been trickling into the delta, the UN's World Food Program
              (WFP) says it has managed to get rice and beans to just 250,000 of the
              750,000 people it thinks are most in need. <br><br>While apparently
              convincing Burma to drop its resistance to large-scale foreign aid, the
              regional bloc also warned donors that "international assistance given
              to Myanmar, given through ASEAN, should not be politicised''. <br><br>"On that basis, Myanmar will accept international assistance,'' Yeo said. <br><br>Asked
              about Burma's estimate of cyclone damage, Yeo said the Burmese foreign
              minister told the meeting it was "well over $10.48 billion''.</p>
              <p>=========================================</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am happy ASEAN has moved and put itself as a broker/ go-between. I am also happy Myanmar has accepted ASEAN teams and ASEAN has successfully persuaded Myanmar to do so.</p>
              <p>Very good outcome, ASEAN has done all that it is supposed to do, be an intermediary, help alleviate human suffering, send its teams into Myanmar, and at the same time, throw its body to protect Myanmar from being bullied again, and the West from claiming moral superiority endlessly.</p>
              <p>I am very happy with this ASEAN intervention and decision, including Myanmar's cooperation with ASEAN.</p>
              <p>But one thing I find abit puzzling, and I cannot read, why does it take ASEAN quite some time to launch this meeting and this intervention. This is quite a question mark for me. Maybe behind the scenes something happened or there was internal disagreement. I really hope in future ASEAN can move abit faster, in a blitz manner.</p>

              <p>I dun think Myammar is really sincere in asking help from ASEAN. It's more like ASEAN offering it's help to Myammar, so maybe that's why we see the slow reaction from ASEAN. If Myammar is really sincere in getting help, they will take the initiative to ASK, rather than ASEAN go beg them to open their doors for help.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But the good thing is that Myammar is finally opening it's doors for foreign aids.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ya, I'm against invading Myammar as well. But I appreciate the French effort in UN to knock the Myammar's door open.</p>

              <p>this whole thing is an PR excerise by Myanmar govt so that the world would stop getting at the generals.</p>

              <p>Ever since the failure to sign the Asean Human Right charter last</p>

              <p>At the UN level it would not escalate to the level of security council as it is block by China and Russia since it is view as a domestics crisis.  </p>

              <p>why? cos the individual countries have never been able to reach a common understanding... there is too much mistrust and jockeying for positions within ASEAN itself for it to be truly effective....</p>
              <p>For those who ask why aid has to be sent in military vessel, let it be known that almost the whole world does it this way...</p>
              <p>why?? chartering civilian vessels have a cost... using military vessels is free plus it provides training for the crew... so why do it the other way...</p>

              <p>Mynmar govt is one corked up country. Well, bascially, the best solution is to charge into mynar without permission to save directly to offer aid to dying.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Such effort is unprecendented because UN itself has also have many experiences of conflict in many countries that is unresolved and slow in progress.</p>

              <p>IF you read about international affairs, sufferings of people due to conflicts, civil wars and poor governace is quite common and on going. Therefore, there is nothing much the world can do. We , as a human being, are not able to reach out to the poor when govt insist on doing things their own ways. SUch is the state of our world.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Stories of suffering of poor people will continue to happen in other countries now in the future too.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Basically, UN, Asean, EU and mostly importantly, individuals like you and me all has to contribute. You realize that individuals tend to be critical of those large bodies and govt but they themselves are just watching fire also... Come on.....</p>
