These bunch of freaks are just trying to make some quick buck. They objected to the normal way of DNA testing to verify that the new born is indeed a clone and instead propose their own way of testing. Thousands of scientist all over the world ca'nt even clone a sheep properly, there's no way a madman like the clonaid can do it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Raelians  are a pathetic group of people anyway who believes the bible is written by aliens and that aliens created humans. So now since they believe in the aliens, they believe they also can create humans.<br><br>As for cloning, I would agree with all the merits of cloning. It is all so nice. I only have one question to ask. Despite having the possibility of having 10 more Ghandis or 10 more Mother Theresa, can mankind deal with possibility of having just 1 more Hiltler?</div>
