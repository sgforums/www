I am not a smoker, but I have seen many students smoking even in their school uniforms !!  Today, I was at the SGH.  There were sign saying " This is Hopistal area, no smoking please" or something like this...  But there were two men and 1 woman smoking next to the sign and the securitys there do nothing about it !!  If I don't have to take care of my mother, I would had walk up and asked them what the f@#$ use of putting sign there and don't enforce it.  I bring this up because this is exactly how the government behave ... put sign and expect people to follow the rules and no one is there to enforce it ....  What a let down .....!!!</div>

Wonder if they try.  My dad was a chain smoker. 17 years ago, diagnosed with throat cancer.  He was 71 years old.  Doctor said difficult for old man to give up, just asked him to cut down.  When doctor told him to cut down, he knew something was wrong but we never tell him cancer.  All he did was on that day throw the balance cigerattes away and never touch a single stick since.  He died of old age last year at 88 years old.  Giving up smoking was like so simple.  He did it... I am very sure many younger people here should able to do better....   Like Gerry say, better to give up smoking ... don't be a nusiance to the society and more importantly to your family and loves one ......</div>

Especially since smokers make up 10% (i think) of our population.<br><br>Maybe the smokers themselves should also write in and petition to the government to consider a total ban on cigarette smoking.. especially since many smokers actually wish to quit smoking but are constantly tempted by the cigarettes that are on sale.<br><br></div>
