              <p style="font-weight: bold;">Singapore may legalise the trade in human kidneys for transplants, its health minister said.</p>
              <p>The Health Ministry is considering paying unrelated donors to boost the supply of organs, Khaw Boon Wan said.</p>
              <p>"We
              should not reject any idea just because it is radical or
              controversial," Khaw said. "We may be able to find an acceptable way to
              allow a meaningful compensation for some living, unrelated kidney
              donors, without breaching ethical principles or hurting the
              sensitivities of others."</p>
              <p>Khaw said the
              ministry would review possible changes to current legislation to allow
              payments for donations from third parties such as those from the
              charity and religious sectors. Under the proposal, which would need to
              be approved by Parliament to become law, patients would also get help
              in finding donors.</p>
              <p>"There are desperate
              patients out there wishing to live and desperately poor people willing
              to exchange a kidney for a hopefully improved life," he said.
              "Criminalising organ trading does not eliminate it...it merely breeds a
              black market."</p>
              <p>Khaw also said the Health
              Ministry would push to amend existing laws on organ transplants to
              remove an age limit on deceased donors, currently set at 60 years,
              because "the suitability of the organ depends on its condition rather
              than the age of the donor."</p>
              <p>The two
              initiatives should enable Singapore to carry out 70% of the kidney
              transplants needed every year - up from 50% currently, the minister
              said.</p>
              <p>Khaw's comments follow the cases of
              two Indonesian men who were jailed and fined by a Singapore court
              earlier this month after being convicted of agreeing to sell their
              kidneys to two patients.</p>
              <p>Selling or
              buying organs or blood is illegal in Singapore, as in many other
              countries, and carries a penalty of up to 12 months' jail.</p>

              <p>This is really sickening.</p>
              <p>All the more reason why the rich should ensure the poor stays

              <p>As long as the poor remains poor.. the rich will have a pool of
              human "spare parts" to draw from.</p>
              <p>So only the poor needs to sell their body parts.. will the rich

              <p>Well, Tang Wee Sung exploited an Indonesian to sell his kidney for a pittance.</p>
              <p>His siblings or parents or children, who are more likely to have blood group compatibility and tissue match, didn't offer to help.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>i think at the end of the day its a win win situation. rich guy gets his organs, poor guy gets money and lives happily ever after only with a slight chance that his only kidney might fail. Both parties benefit and to not restrict this trade is to allow the poor guy to make a decision, to sell or not to sell. so in a sense this change will open up the availability of the organs and at the same time prevent "breeding of a black market"</p></div>

              actually it ok but some safe guard will need to be put in. Informed consent will have to be done rigorously and verified; cutting out the middleman or at least limiting the amount they receive; ensure the donor is healthy; etc.

              Yes taking advantage of the poor by the rich in a sense, but then thats how things are unfortunately. Anyway if you are poor, you can't afford the bills for other illnesses as well anyway. If you are middle class, if you try hard enough it might be possible to get the money to get that kidney and if you are rich, well you are lucky.</p>

              <p>... all these beating around the bush about Morality and all that crap, is just basically that they want to monopolize this 'grey area' in the health sector...</p>
              <p>... because if people can freely trade organs, how are they as a money-centric government to make from it? Obviously, we can also think up such things as Organ Trade Tax...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>... tell me, if you donate blood FREELY, why are the government run blood banks charging by the hundreds &amp; thousands per unit of blood when patients needs blood in hositals during or after a surgery??? They called it Admin Charges (bull to me) ... what do you call it/that?</p>

              <p>After reading so much from forumers here, i've actually looked at a further sight.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Its not more of selling organs, religion issues etc.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>How much will a kidney cost? Those who really want to have new kidneys replacement, do you think they can afford it? So, does money transaction only comes between the seller and buyer? Or there is a middle man in between the seller and buyer that draws commission from the trade? Is the govt thinking of becoming the middle man? Earn money from the buyer as well as the seller?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Secondly, i remembered LHL once said in last yr National day rally. He claimed that life expectancy for our people is getting longer and longer. We can live more than 80yrs old. With his words, he deemed annualities compulsory and you can only get back your money after you're 82 while you started paying at 62! And when you die before maturity, the premiums you've spent on annualities will go into the pool of annualities for others that are still living. You cannot even take back the money nor pass it on to your younger generations.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And one forumer said that in India, kidney donors / seller experienced health deteroration after removing their kidney. So, if the country legalised the kidney / organ trading, that means kidneys seller will not live long. So, does it means that donors will keep on paying the annualities but will not get to take it back since they cannot live more than 80yrs old?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Govt again earning money from this?</p>
              <p> </p>
