              <p>The title to this thread is Does this post offend you?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Stupidissmart, seems like our posts had a lot of "offensive" statements. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>Really,<br>does my post about saying that you have limited views offend you? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyway, if you are so flustered and bothered about the little statement that your views are limited, take it as I'm talking rubbish ok? I will still keep that view of you anyway <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>

              <p>Anything lor. It's so obvious you are extending and deriving extras to see all statements as insulting you. Poor you. So self-absorbed and self-demeaning. Every comment must be about you, and truthful opinions about you that hurt must definitely be insults and challenges <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>All the more this says about you: you have no credibility at all. Can you even believe someone whom you do not know the qualifications at all, and merely hide behind an online nick to talk rubbish here?  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"> I'm not afraid at all to release my name and contact simply because I know I'm objective with my posts. You want, you can continue to live in your own world. Truth is, there are pple who find me for tuition from sgf. Believe it or not is up to you, but seeing how insecure you are that you definitely have to 'defend your honour' for an online nickname, you will most likely not believe it. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p><strong>And because you are caught again and again, you have to put words into my mouth, then tell me I'm wrong and illogical. Wow!</strong> <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>And this post really shows a lot about you. You have zero fear in
                          talking rubbish and stupid logics, then telling others that their logic
                          is stupid, simply because you are under the cover of an online nick.
                          What difference does that have with internet trolls like Gazelle? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>

Xoxohth), a popular law student discussion site. Experts are watching to see if the suit will unmask the posters, who are <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2007/06/12/students-file-suit-against-autoadmit-director-others/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #663300;">identified in the complaint only by their pseudonyms</span></span></a>. Since AutoAdmit's administrators have previously said that <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/06/AR2007030602705_pf.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #663300;">they do not retain IP logs of posters</span></span></a>, identifying the defendants may test the limits of the legal system and anonymity on the Internet. So far, one method tried was to <a href="http://www.xoxohth.com/thread.php?thread_id=643868&amp;mc=526&amp;forum_id=2#8243886"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #663300;">post the summons on the message board itself</span></span></a> and ask the defendants to step forward.</p>
              <p><em></em> </p>
              <p><em>The nub of defamation is that it "lowers the reputation of the victim among right thinking members of society". It is of course arguable in defence that the target was an assumed name and that nobody can connect the abuse with the real victim. If a number of people know the victim, and are aware of their assumed name, and see the offending comment, then the defence would not work. <br></em></p>

              <p>Wow. If you think I do not know you at all, let me tell
                          you I have your IP address since you have accessed my website. You are
                          dumb because traffic is not that high for my site yet, so it's quite
                          clear that it belongs to you. Why else do you think I asked you to go
                          visit. So far, the people I offended here are people like you, liking
                          to act stupid and illogical in the forums. The other one being Gazelle.
                          Perhaps you want to be in the same league as him; he has put out a
                          similar threatening post as you. You are already not the first person
                          to put out my handphone number; Gazelle has done it. Also, a number of
                          sgforum members already have my number for at least a year ago; I gave it to them.</p>
              <p>And
                          after being proven to talk rubbish and being illogical, and also
                          twisting and putting words into my mouth, you have to resort to
                          threatening. This really says a lot about you. Not surprised, since it
                          has already been proven that you need to coerce me to say things that I hv not said just to make it look like you are correct. And when you realised you failed in coercing, you just have to twist and put words and conclusions from you into my mouth.
                          Anyone who bothers to read everything will easily see the idiotic ways
                          you are behaving, twisting words here and there, distorting meanings,
                          just so that you look correct when you are wrong.</p>
              <p>Phone harassment? I'm pretty sure I can go to the police for
                          that. Really. If you do not know how I function in tuition, how do you
                          know you will succeed in asking me to travel to any place? FYI, if you
                          have never taught tuition before, I will always confirm on the day
                          itself. That means I will have to have the other person's contact
                          number. Without the contact number, or if it is too far, I wouldn't go.
                          And with your contact number, do you think you cannot be traced for
                          harassment? This is the basics for most sales done online; your contact
                          have to be there. Duh...</p>

              <p>And you have been extremely stupid to put out
                          a threatening post, because if anyone does harass, and I do go to the
                          police, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the first suspect will be you</span>, whether you have done it a not. I have quoted you for proof. So remember, if anyone does harass, you will be the first suspect I will get the police to check upon. SgForums will definitely have your IP address.</p>
              <p>And
                          you must be stupid (again) to think you can call and wake me up in the
                          middle of the night. I value my sleep much more than you think.
                          Everything will only be replied in the morning since I have callerID.
                          And if you try to hide your number, then sorry, you have wasted your
                          time (especially if you have to wake up at the wee hours to do
                          something which will not succeed). I do not need extra students; I have
                          more than enough to get by. Any extra is just someone extra I can help,
                          and if a potential student decides to stop contacting, I really
                          wouldn't bother as well; it's not my livelihood.</p>
              <p>Finally, if you want my picture, it's on my tuition website. I will be taking pictures with my group tuition students soon and put it online. Do waste your time if you want to take secret pictures and put online. Doesn't matter to me. No problem one.</p>
              <p>All in all, this is the dumbest post you have made so far. That I just have to quote it for proof.</p>

Thirdly, even if u manage to find me, u have no concrete evidence tat I do the nuisance and all u can do is make me record a statement. There is nothing u can do to me.

                                                      your case. First, it is likely to be just a civil suit, so it is
                                                      likely u have to find a lawyer to act on your behalf. And tat means

                                                      find out who I am. I may not even be in singapore and it become out

Any extra is just someone extra I can help, and if a potential student decides to stop contacting, I really wouldn't bother as well; it's not my livelihood.</p>

The main thing for you is, if ever there's a need, even if it is not you, you are still implicated. If there's such a need, I will still need to do it, even though it might not be linked to here. It's the risk I have to take, no matter what happened here, when I sell online. Maybe you want to tell me that you are dumb enough not to expect and be prepared for such scenarios if you want to sell online. But unfortunately, you will be unnecessarily drawn into it even though you might be totally unrelated to it. Understand? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"> That's where I worry for you. Serious. What's worse than being dragged down to make a statement just because of 1 post? What's more, if it happens to be serious, your comp might even be brought down for inspection (again, happened before for the same case in hwz forums). All just because some crazy person might do something serious (and who might even impersonate you because of your post), and hence implicating you just because of your 1 post. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"> Understand now?</p>
              <p>In short, it may not even need to be you for you to be unnecessarily dragged down to make a statement. For me, the risk has always been there since I sell online.

The main thing for you is, if ever there's a need, even if it is not you, you are still implicated. If there's such a need, I will still need to do it, even though it might not be linked to here. It's the risk I have to take, no matter what happened here, when I sell online. Maybe you want to tell me that you are dumb enough not to expect and be prepared for such scenarios if you want to sell online. But unfortunately, you will be unnecessarily drawn into it even though you might be totally unrelated to it. Understand? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"> That's where I worry for you. Serious. What's worse than being dragged down to make a statement just because of 1 post? What's more, if it happens to be serious, your comp might even be brought down for inspection (again, happened before for the same case in hwz forums). All just because some crazy person might do something serious (and who might even impersonate you because of your post), and hence implicating you just because of your 1 post. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"> Understand now?</p>
              <p>In short, it may not even need to be you for you to be unnecessarily dragged down to make a statement. For me, the risk has always been there since I sell online.

                                                  into trouble. In my line u get the same 2 ingredients as well. I
                                                  have put an open and inverted commas on the word "threat" and use
                                                  the word "tat". How do u interprete these two words ?</p>
              <p>Now since u view it as a "threathening" letter, may I enquire
                                                  which part of it is threathening ? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> Is a warning a threat ?</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Glad you realised your folly and noticed the word 'if'</p>
              <p>Yes, a warning is a threat. And it doesn't matter if you think your words don't sound like. If a person feels threatened, he feels threatened. It doesn't matter even if you used normal words. The police wouldn't bother too. Who knows if you weren't being sarcastic in your threat?</p>

              <p>What?! My entertainer/slave/clown wants to call it quits?! After being proven idiotic, now u want to make your exit (after putting words into my mouth again)? And with your bolded statement, it seems that you are starting to get flustered about your dumb post of putting an unnecessary risk on yourself? I give you a possible scenario that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">can happen</span>, and you can misunderstand and tell me it is asking opinions or permissions from you (yet again).<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>And after you twist and put words into my mouth (countless times), now you tell me my points are broken when you have contradicted yourself heavily right after that? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"> Think of this, you tell me engineers are concerned with developing economical and safe solutions to practical problems, by applying mathematics and <span class="mw-redirect">scientific knowledge</span> while considering technical constraints, and thus education is not an important part of their job scope. Yet after that, you tell me A is B means A contains characteristics that B does not have. Clearly, you shoot yourself in the foot. And thus, till now, you still cannot thus explain why engineers must be concerned with developing economical and safe solutions to practical problems, by applying mathematics and <span class="mw-redirect">scientific knowledge</span> while considering technical constraints, yet definitely not be concerned with education just because wiki did not state so. Instead, you evade and twist away. Duh. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>Really, you had demonstrated stupidity of the greatest order, and also one of very limited mindsets. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>As for you many "arguments", the forumer below has put it well into one sentence.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>It is frustratingly hard to make them see the truth,
                                              when they believe that the truth is nothing more than what the
                                              professionals say it is and that we should just take it and leave
                                              it to them.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Really, what you have done throughout this whole thread is to prove the first poster right. Village graduate. NTU? Still don't understand the whole joke on you, especially when you keep repeating it is because wiki and NSPE who state so? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>And ya, you are really some *fill in a word* to call others asshole when you lose your arguments. But maybe you still think you are damn right, after having twisted and put words into my mouth <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The 2nd joke has also long been on you when I stated before this that you are my entertainer because you appear when I call you. It's interesting that you took so many pages to finally realise it. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"> Not sure if you realised how dumb you were to make a challenge to see who becomes speechless first and stick to it (when I didn't even tell you I'm going to accept your childish challenge), and then tell me that the discussion won't end if I don't retract my statement. I'm not retracting my statements. So it seems like from your post, you are now eating back your words before I started making you. If I ignore you immediately, you will really be eating your own words because you stated that the discussion won't end. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png" width="20" height="20"> And not defending your so called honour anymore? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png" width="20" height="20"> It was really dumb of you to make such childish statements (and thus restrictions and rules on yourself) when I didn't even bother to reciprocrate. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"> You definitely make it very very easy for others to taunt, provocate and control you. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png" width="20" height="20"> Doesn't make you seems very much smarter than Gazelle in that area, because the best way to play and control him is not to let him get the final and last post; he had always wanted it.</p>
              <p>Not only that, you can silently slunk away after claiming the need to wait for MOM's reply on your question. What happened to it? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png" width="20" height="20"> Stupid? Definitely <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png" width="20" height="20"></p>
              <p>Glad like you realised finally how you could be unnecessarily dragged in if someone decides to impersonate you and do some stupid things. At least you are smart enough to stop before putting yourself even more at risks. Since you have realised your folly, don't worry. If someone really call and tell me he's stupidissmart, and that he has planted a bomb somewhere, I will tell him to try again and tell me he is Gazelle or any other forumer. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>It seems like all you are capable of is twisting and putting words into others' mouths. Do continue to live in the delusion that you are very right (because you twist words to suit yourself). <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"> It really matters little to be called a fool by some person of unknown origins proven to be  illogical and of low credibility. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png" width="20" height="20"> If it was really that important as you are making it to sound, LKY would have had a field day prosecuting many of the anonymous forumers here. So would GCT and LHL. Fortunately, our leaders are not as childish and immature as you. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png" width="20" height="20"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And lastly, I'm exiting this thread totally. As I have said, it is an impossible task to drive logic into an illogical mind like yours. I can expect you to attempt to call for me to return. After having set an example for you (and Gazelle) that name calling or insults online doesn't matter to me at all, I shall set an example for you again: there's absolutely no necessity to be as stupid as you to appear when others ask you to or when they capture your attention because of a post; to appear like you did and without realising the joke on you was really an immature act. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png" width="20" height="20"> I guess I will still have plenty of opportunities to play you around like what I did with Gazelle's clones. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png" width="20" height="20"></p>

              <p>These people have read the right books, memorised the right key words and phrases, but have no real understanding of the issues. Worse, they lack to intellect to analyse these topics properly. In these cases, what happens is that you get verbal diarrhoea spewed at you and you don't even know where to begin to argue back, because even though all the paragraphs are correctly stringed together, the sentences are grammatical, the spelling is almost always right, the right names and phrases are dropped, BUT the person does not make any sense. This leaves you intellectually frustrated because unlike uneducated people, you have to unteach before you teach. It's like a gadfly, albeit without the intelligence of Socrates, which you have to swat away, because this person talks your language ostensibly, and you feel a compulsion to correct her.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>I have absolutely got to agree with this paragraph. The writer has expressed my exact sentiments in better phrasing than I could have ever expressed myself. I have always struggled with the words to express the full, undiluted version of this experience! It is incredibly frustrating both to experience and to describe. Often they simple spew out a string of quotes, albeit from a first-person point of view, without understanding the full depth of the situation. It is frustratingly hard to make them see the truth, when they believe that the truth is nothing more than what the professionals say it is and that we should just take it and leave it to them.</p>
              <p>As for the arts thing, I have no comment because I have had no personal experience with such matters. Although I would like to point out that this could possibly be one of those ugly truths...</p>
              <p>As for medicine and law... Yes, I would agree that those two courses are some of the most highly competitive in Singapore and as a result they do indeed manage to attract the best of Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>I must say this was a well-written piece indeed, albeit somewhat controversial because it exposes our ugly side.</p>
