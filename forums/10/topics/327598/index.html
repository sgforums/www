Singaporeans are hardworking people, they aren't smartworking people, so hardwork will enable them to memorise very well but they cant think with their brains and its kinda sad to see every smart singaporean bark, sit, roll over and play dead at the command of a figure of authority.</p></div>

              <p>but personal experience: I could have scored a slightly higher CAP and save quite a bit of time if the admin had answered my questions more properly last time; instead, they only directed me to a website which did not even answer my question.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But also, sad to say, actual quality of students are not really determined in university rankings too. There's greater focus on the number of patents, researchers, facilities, etc, than the actual quality of students, not to mention that the method of examiniation is very uniquely Singapore. In Germany, you are not only tested in written papers, there's also oral examinations in which the lecturers will make very very sure that you really understand the subject, else you will score rather badly. You have to experience the differences to know that education at NUS is not really as good.</p>

              <p>You would think it is subjective because you have not experienced it. Go enroll in a German university to find out. It's way too long to explain to you how it works. You will be grilled even more intensely in a particular portion if the lecturer manage to find out which portion of the module you are unclear of.</p>
              <p>Written examinations are way too easy to score; they are no brainers. I'm sure many had experienced being able to score As for some modules even though they do not fully understand it.</p>
