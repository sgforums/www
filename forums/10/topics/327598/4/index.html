              <p>Tat is the solution to the cause of the problem. The job of the
                          engineer is to find out wat went wrong first. He found out it is
                          some defect on the chip. So he come out with the solution to wat is
                          the cause of the problem. Tat is already the solution</p>
              <p>U r talking rubbish again. Wiki had explicitly stated the
                          definition of engineers as a problem solver. However u want to deny
                          the defintion and say tat is not the main job. Do u know wat is the
                          use of definition ? It tells u wat it is about. In tis case it
                          tells wat engineer is about. If u look at professor, from wiki</p>

              <p>Well there r some points which i felt have been concluded wrongly. I felt I have the right to continue since earlier, u refuse to settle amicably and conclude I have limiting views, which is something u refuse to correct up till now. Remember previously</p>

              <p>Now u see, u tell me how great tis oral exam is and tat why universities in the world should follow their system. I pointed out some flaws to tis system as well as proving tat it is not commonly found in the academic field. I also prove from one of the university that u had chosen stating tat oral exams is supposed to be easier compared with standard exams. When faced with such facts, your argument only dwell on the fact tat I did not experience the exams myself and not on countering the facts which i had brought up. I did not experience oral exams, but I am sure TUM and his staff know more about oral exams than u.</p>

              <p>The fact remains tat tis is about my life and u cannot prove I did not get an increment of 150 in the last month. U can only claim I am "slithering away" only when u can proved I lied about my increment. Otherwise, it is just ignorance on your part on certain facts of my life</p>
              <p>About tax avoidance and tax evasion, I find M13 is at peace with the clarifications I had made. If u felt it is not conclusive, u r free to join in the discussion</p>
              <p>Now comes to the part on u claiming I had limited view</p>
              <p><em>Base on you saying things like</em></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><em>written examination cannot skip questions too</em></p>

              </blockquote>
              <p> Now on the first part, I already stated tat u cannot skip question in a written exams unless u want to be penalised. I have also stated tat tis is no different from oral examination since u can straight away tell your examiner u do not know the answer which is akin to leaving blank on the answer script. U have also stated tat oral examination has the benefit of examiners prompting and hinting u on the answer which a written exam do not. So why do u claim tat I had limited views on "written exams cannot skip questions" ?</p>
              <p>On the "important skill for an engineer or a research is to come out with solution or write a world class paper", I have shown u the textbook definition of "engineer" which do follow my interpretation of coming out with solution. Sad to say, u begin to pull in the word professor and training officer into the whole picture which is mutually independent from "engineer". U even provide an example tat proves my point tat an engineer's primary job is to come out with solution. So how is my view limited ?</p>

Your professor had chosen to be a professor and he is no longer working as an engineer. We r talking about engineer here. Why don't u bring in Hu Jintao who is an engineer in training and chosen to become a politican now. U might as well say an engineer is about managing the country because Hu is an engineer. Why don't u bring in policemen or nurses into the picture while u r at it ?</p>

              <p>Seems that you still cannot understand what's an engineering professor. An engineering professor is an engineer, but an engineer is not necessarily a professor. A professor can be doing the job of a Professional Engineer part time, and he's a professor full time. Technically, he's still an engineer, but his main job is education. This has already been pointed out to you. No idea why you want to bring in Hu Jintao into this discussion.</p>

              <p>Tis is again rubbish. He is a professor. If u look at his name
                                              card, it writes "professor" NOT "engineer". When he is doing his
                                              "part time" jon, u already stated he is an engineer then. When he
                                              teaches his "full time job", u already stated he is a professor. U
                                              already clearly distinguish the 2 jobs as different. Then suddenly
                                              u come out with the wrong logical flow by linking his "part time
                                              job" to his "full time job". Tat is really stupid</p>
              <p>An engineer can be a part time volunteer police (VSC). He works
                                              full time as an engineer and then after work go for part time
                                              police. So does tat means technically he is an engineer and his job
                                              is to catch robbers ? U r mixing 2 occupations at the same
                                              time.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">For a professor, the part time job entails the same knowledge required as the full time job.</span> How the hell did you even come up with a comparison of a policeman, whose knowledge required is entirely different from what an engineer should know.
