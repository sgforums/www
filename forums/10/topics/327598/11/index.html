              <p>Hehe... Another post with nothing but claims and rubbish and your one person point of view again. If u want to conclude the thread, I can do my conclusion as well. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>The point which is argued tremendously in tis thread dwells on 2 issues.</p>
              <p>1) on oral exams</p>
              <p>2) about a statement which I said tat the more important skill of an engineer is to solve practical problem.</p>
              <p>On (1), wat do u really discussed on ? Your only side of the story is your claims. U did not show anything tat support your argument at all. Wat did I do ? I show u websites from schools which u handpicked yourself and also comments made by people who had gone through the system. And wat do u do is try to discredit the website of TUM, a well known german university. U even claim tat message posted on all official website cannot be treated seriously</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>on (2), the arguments is even more ridiculous. I have claimed the rationale for saying tat the more important skill of an engineer is really to solve practical problem (which is really engineering) and tat is defined by wiki, board of professional engineers and dictionary. Wat he do is make tons of stupid claims on tis. He claim software engineer just do software, he claims finding the problem of a chip is not a solution, he claims a professor is not an occupation and make tons of stupid logic errors to confuse people. I can post the evidence of wat he claimed in the subsequent post and if u r interested, u can read back the replies he made and do your own judging.</p>
              <p>Finally he claims tat education is AS IMPORTANT as engineering for an engineer. I have given him the answer MULTIPLE times and he refused to comment on it. He even acknowledge tat wat I said is true and tat "engineering" is still more important than "education" for an engineer. I will repeat for u again</p>
              <p>If your education is passing information to your junior or presenting research paper, it is clear tat u need to have some result before u can "educate". <strong>Without results obtained from engineering, there is no content to educate</strong>. On the other hand, engineering can survive withut educating. They can repair a broken machine and the company go back into production and he has performed an important service even without educating</p>
              <p>And u do acknowledged.  post on 19 aug 420 by me</p>
              <p><em>I am telling u the <strong>MORE IMPORTANT</strong> skill is still to come out with the SOLUTION to the practical problem. And if u look at my statement on research, it is to write paper too.  If u do not come out with any results, r u even doing research ?? And if u consider "writing paper" as education, then my previous statement is still correct.</em></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Your post on 19 aug 444</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>I didn't deny what you said is wrong</strong>.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">
              </span></p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>I have been telling you all the while that is only part of the scope</strong></span></p>
              <p></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">So wat has he done is really just ignoring logic and twisting and turning in his own stand. When his argument is broken, he just abandon the whole argument and talk in a different tangent. He has repeatedly shown tis bahavior throughout the exchange. He has never substantiate the statement "The more important skills for an engineer or a research is to come out with the solution or write a world class research paper" is wrong in the end</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">The only skill he has is really good in is just hurling personal insults over. I have tried to hurl insults over however sad to say, I am not as cunning as him in writing one sided propaganda and claims. Effectively, tis is wat he has been doing for the last few replies to whitewash his logical flaws. </span></p>
              <p>The next reply I will just paste some of his ridiculous points which hightlight his flawed logic and insincere arguments (which i have done before and he refused to comment) Instead of one sided claims, I give out evidence. If free to verify by going through the arguments tat had been done</p>
