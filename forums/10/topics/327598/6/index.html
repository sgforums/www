              <p>ya la, you quote me, and you use "that" to imply things from another thread. Call yourself logical. When I quote your message and I mentioned the word "you", it wasn't talking about stupidissmart. My "you" is referring to some other forumer in another thread.</p>
              <p>That's your logic, isn't it? Stupidissmart is not eagle, how would stupidissmart know which "you" eagle is referring to? Did I state that the NTU engineer earning $2.5k refers to a forumer nicknamed stupidissmart? Why did stupidissmart get so worked up over something not referring to him?

              <p>Let us recap what was said in the first page</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>Of which there's no mention at all that the engineer in question must definitely be working in the engineering field. Yet time and again, you are trying to direct the discussion merely to the engineering field (because of your limited vision).</p>
              <p>If you can say that the "more important skills for an engineer or a research is to
                                                                                                                                      come out with the solution or <span style="text-decoration: underline;">write a world class research paper</span>", then tell me to adhere strictly to</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Engineers are concerned with developing economical and safe solutions to practical problems, by applying <a title="Mathematics" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics">mathematics</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" title="Scientific knowledge" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_knowledge">scientific knowledge</a> while considering technical constraints.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>you are already contradicting yourself. Writing a world class research paper, is that developing solutions? <span style="text-decoration: underline;">That is more in tune with <strong>educating</strong> the world on his research!</span></p>
              <p>In addition, the job scope of a research engineer is to do research, probably come out with solutions, and then <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>educate</strong></span> the world by writing his world class research paper.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You know what's limiting you in your wiki definition of an engineer? That's because they took their primary source of definition from a Professional Engineers Board. Research engineers and engineers as educators do not need certifications from  Professional Engineers to start any project, nor are they really bound at all by any restrictions (or definitions) from any Professional Engineers Board; you don't get PE for research engineers or engineering educators.</p>
              <p>What's the use of an engineer (like you) limiting yourself strictly to the definition of an engineer in wiki and telling me that engineers are all about developing solutions, when <strong>education</strong> is not even (to you) a main job? Without <strong>educating</strong> others, pray tell me, how will you be able to spread your solutions to others, and hence serve and contribute to the society (as what you have said, they serve and contribute by coming up with solutions).</p>
              <p>In short, you are still one with limited vision, that an engineer must be "concerned with developing economical and safe solutions to practical problems, by applying mathematics and <span class="mw-redirect">scientific knowledge</span> while considering technical constraints" just because wiki states it, and <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">education, to you, is not the main job of an engineer, even though it is the primary tool to spread your solutions to everyone else every time you come up with one.</span></strong></p>
              <p> A quick recap for you</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Educating people is not the main job of an engineer and more like a

              <p>Tis is rich. I say tat the important job for an engineer is to come out with solution. Engineer is obviously refering to the work doing engineering which is on providing solutions to practical problems. Tis is obviously in tune with definition on engineer.</p>
              <p>Now u r saying engineer do not have to do "engineering". They can go to fiance or watsoever etc. If a trained engineer go to fiance, his job is not on engineering anymore. It is "fiance advisor/watsoever". If he go to become a police, he is not an engineer. He is a policeman. Just because he is trained before as an engineer doesn't mean his job has to be engineer.

              <p>What's the use of an engineer (like you) limiting yourself strictly to the definition of an engineer in wiki and telling me that engineers are all about developing solutions, when <strong>education</strong> is not even (to you) a main job? Without <strong>educating</strong> others, pray tell me, how will you be able to spread your solutions to others, and hence serve and contribute to the society (as what you have said, they serve and contribute by coming up with solutions).</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>U still have not come out with anything to support your stand why the wiki definition is wrong. U say tat they have to educate other people ? U mean like a professor ? Professor is not strictly engineering. If u say they must educate other people about the solution they found, obviously <strong>they still have to find out the solution first</strong> then can they tell others. It is still the most basic and primary job they have.</p>

              <p>U can try. I still have not seen anything yet. Even ifu manage

                              anything. Go on lor... try to redefine the word of engineer</p>
              <p>Ok la. U wanna include math into the whoel definition, it is
                              fine. Maths according to wikipedia is</p>
              <p><strong>Mathematics</strong> is the body of <a title="Knowledge" rel="nofollow" href="/wiki/Knowledge"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">knowledge</span></span></a> centered on such

                              discipline that studies them.</p>
              <p>Nothing is wrong isn't it ?</p>
              <p>Looking at die is already about "shape" and "change" and
                              "structure" and "quantity". Looking at circuitry on the fridge is
                              already studying the "shape", "change", "structue" and "quantity".
                              SO wat is wrong ? Seems u do not have an understanding of english
                              words</p>
              <p>I already ask u to state out LOUD and CLEAR. "Professor is not
                              an occupation". State it out. Once u stated it out then I will
                              start my attack on it. Tis is one of the most incredulous claim u
                              ever made considering u come from a university. As said before if
                              professor is a form of address and not an occupation, then doctors
                              r just nurses but addressed as doctors.</p>
              <p>Tis is rich. I say tat the important job for an engineer is to
                              come out with solution. Engineer is obviously refering to the work
                              doing engineering which is on providing solutions to practical
                              problems. Tis is obviously in tune with definition on engineer.</p>
              <p>Now u r saying engineer do not have to do "engineering". They
                              can go to fiance or watsoever etc. If a trained engineer go to
                              fiance, his job is not on engineering anymore. It is "fiance
                              advisor/watsoever". If he go to become a police, he is not an
                              engineer. He is a policeman. Just because he is trained before as
                              an engineer doesn't mean his job has to be engineer. However tat
                              doesn't mean engineer can be is working as fiance or police
                              etc.</p>
              <p>Why don't u read the previous statement I made</p>
              <p><em>The more important skills for an engineer <strong>or a
                              research</strong> is to come out with the solution <strong>or write
                              a world class research paper</strong>. </em></p>
              <p>Now obviously I stated on research paper for research.</p>
              <p>Now if u talk about research engineer, wat do they do ?
                              <strong>MOST IMPORTANTLY, they have to find out the solution to a
                              practical problem. THEN can they write a paper on it.</strong> So
                              it is still not wrong to say the basic job of an engineer is still
                              to find solution to practical problems</p>
              <p>U r claiming something really tall here. Since u claim it, then
                              u have to prove it. Prove tat they r ignoring the definition of
                              other areas etc and only on professional engineering</p>
              <p>U still have not come out with anything to support your stand
                              why the wiki definition is wrong. U say tat they have to educate
                              other people ? U mean like a professor ? Professor is not strictly
                              engineering. If u say they must educate other people about the

                              the most basic and primary job they have.</p>
              <p>Now if u find sales engineer on wiki, which is directed to field
                              applications engineer</p>

                      another thread.</em></p>
              <p>U know why I can say "tat" as refering to my original thread ?
                      it is because all the figures should be refered to tis other
                      thread. Tat is the first time the &gt;3000 is shown. The only
                      problem is u quote the figure wrongly. U quote it as 3000 instead
                      of &gt;3000 and tat starts the whole mistake. Being a forgiving
                      person, I do not nitpick tis detail but still refer tat to my
                      original quote of &gt;3000. However u start to pick details and
                      claim I make a calculation mistake when u r the one who do the
                      reference error. And tat is why I can say "tat" as the figure I
                      quote originally.</p>
              <p>Therefore logic does not flow since there is a reason for why
                      "tat" refers to my originally quoted figure. And obviously the
                      golden question is, did I make any error here ? Or r u in denial
                      mode since all your arguments r spent ?</p>
              <p>Then let me ask u, wat r u doing then ? Since I had already
                      given u the definiton from wiki, and u implied u r at peace with
                      with the definition from wiki, then wat r u arguing about ?</p>
              <p>I said "textbook". I said the work tat engineers r associated
                      with. Why must it be "all" and not "generally" ? Did I state "ALL"
                      ? And u still cannot come out with any example tat prove
                      otherwise.</p>
              <p>U don't get it do u. He is a professor tat is why he teaches. He
                      is an engineer because he is involved in research. U r pushing his
                      professor job into his engineer job. They r different</p>
              <p>Well clearly u do not know wat the national society of
                      professional engineers r doing</p>
              <p><em>The National Society of Professional Engineers (NSPE) is the

              <p>Melissa has pretty low EQ...</p>
              <p>The post doesn't offend me, but it does touch on a very important issue.  Are our local graduates of a decent calibre?</p>
              <p>Honestly, its hard to set a benchmark for every faculty and discipline.  Engineers and Philosophers would probably rank each other pretty lowly.</p>
              <p>Coming from an Arts and Social Sciences faculty, I do see a lot of "spewing of facts."  Sometimes, its just paraphrasing what is printed in the textbooks and readings.  Nothing wrong with that.  Some people will learn these as facts and unbreakable truths... Yet some will go beyond and critically analyse the purported facts.  And I guess, thats what really seperates the classes of honors these graduates get.</p>

              <p>5) I quoted official webpage of TUM to say tat oral exams r easier than written exams</p>
              <p>6) I also pointed to u the flaws of oral exams which u never answer</p>
              <p>7) Then u only claim "TUM webpage is not official statement of school" "do i know who is the webmaster of the webpage" etc. These r views from an IDIOT.

              <p>U r just beating around the bush. I told u the explanation many times but u chose not to read it. U just chose to persist. Let me again put in perspective for u</p>
              <p>1) U claim I made an error by the following statements</p>
              <p><em>3000 a month is still on the lower end. Which means going back to my earlier statement, it means many are earning $500 more.</em></p>
              <p>I replied with</p>
              <p><em>Now tat is my take home pay. </em></p>
              <p>2) u claim i made en error in the later sentence because 2880 then can give the result of 3600 full salary</p>
              <p>3) Now the first error made is your statement</p>
              <p><em>3000 a month is still on the lower end. Which means going back to my earlier statement, it means many are earning $500 more.</em></p>
              <p>because it is clearly stated in my previous thread tat it is &gt;3000. U derived a completely wrong conclusion to the previous thread and u lie</p>
              <p>4) I try to told u tat is the &gt;3000 amount I stated previously. Since the previous "tat" is unclear, i clarify, much like wat u did previousuly</p>
              <p><em>Try again when you earn more. Someone not limited in views wouldn't have told me he's satisfied with $2.5k monthly. You are incapable because society has already told you so.</em></p>
              <p>When i stated old folks r not earnign tat much either, u <em>clarify</em> by adding in more lins</p>
              <p><em>As a NTU engineer, you must really be damn lousy to be earning $2.5k monthly when many others are earning near to $1k more =&gt; society's way of showing how incapable you are.</em></p>
              <p>U added additional information to <em>clarify</em> your stand</p>
              <p>Since "tat" is unclear and tat is why I clarify it to be the &gt;3000 in the previous thread. Surprisingly, u refuse to let me clarify my stand here. Why can't i clarify the things I said ? Why can I let u clarify your stand before and now u refuse to let me clarify ? U got something to hide or u have nothing to say ?</p>
              <p>5) then u go crazy, jump and then talk about incredibly crazy logic which made no sense. And u force your stupid logic on me sand say tat I derive it. If clarifying is illogical, then u started off tis trend as well</p>
              <p>6) And then u just dwell on nothing but talking rubbish here. Wat is the main question u wanna ask ? Is there an error made ? U made the error here, u cannot properly even quote correctly and u do not know the difference between 3000 to &gt;3000. Tat is really stupid of u</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Since when is the word "wrong" the same as the word "inadequate"</strong></span></p>

              <p>Now tis is on another stupid topic u had raised before</p>
              <p>1) I stated the below</p>
              <p><em>The <strong>more important skills</strong> for an <strong>engineer or a research</strong> is to <strong>come out with the solution or write a world class research paper</strong></em></p>
              <p>2) Tis is in line with the definition of wiki and dictionary.com and professional engineer society</p>
              <p><em>An <strong>engineer</strong> is a person who is professionally engaged in a field of </em><a title="Engineering" href="/wiki/Engineering"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>engineering</em></span></span></a><em>.

              <p>3) Now u find the definition of the real expert (professional engineer) in tis field "inadequate" and want to correct the definition of wat define them to tis experts. U r really thinking they, the professional engineer soceity, do not know wat they r doing</p>
              <p>4) Then wat do u do, u come out with stupid examples which u had ceased using (die examination), u talk about software engineer then product engineering then sales engineer then graphic designer then try to claim professor is engineer and a lot of sh!t</p>
              <p>5) then u claim if u come out with one example u can prove the definition wrong. I stated why should tat be the case. Tis is generally (generally means more than 95%) true and tat is correct alredy isn't it ? Why does freak examples matter</p>
              <p>6) Then u claim research writing paper is education and therefore the definition is wrong.</p>
              <p>7) Research is indeed about writing paper, which i have claimed before, but the main job and the most important skill is to come out with the necessary solution. Without tis solution, wat r u writing about ? U r just a clerk or a story teller and not an engineer. The whole content of the paper is ON the solution. Just the process of writing is not critical. Solving solution is the critical skill.  It is their main job</p>
              <p>8) then u just keep spurting out more nonsense and say tat writing is educating and educating is not solving solution. I have repeatedly told u without solution u cannot write. And the solution is more important than the process of writing. People see the solution in your paper to find a better solution for other process</p>
              <p>9) U can keep trying to prove the professional engineer do not know wat their job is about. But the more u try to prove, the moe silly u become</p>

                                      Based on wat can u doubt the authencity of the webpage of the

              <p>U r just beating around the bush. I told u the explanation many
                                      times but u chose not to read it. U just chose to persist. Let me
                                      again put in perspective for u</p>
              <p>1) U claim I made an error by the following statements</p>
              <p><em>3000 a month is still on the lower end. Which means going
                                      back to my earlier statement, it means many are earning $500

              <p><em>Now tat is my take home pay.</em></p>
              <p>2) u claim i made en error in the later sentence because 2880
                                      then can give the result of 3600 full salary</p>
              <p>3) Now the first error made is your statement</p>
              <p><em>3000 a month is still on the lower end. Which means going
                                      back to my earlier statement, it means many are earning $500
                                      more.</em></p>
              <p>because it is clearly stated in my previous thread tat it is
                                      &gt;3000. U derived a completely wrong conclusion to the previous
                                      thread and u lie</p>
              <p>4) I try to told u tat is the &gt;3000 amount I stated
                                      previously. Since the previous "tat" is unclear, i clarify, much
                                      like wat u did previousuly</p>
              <p><em>Try again when you earn more. Someone not limited in views
                                      wouldn't have told me he's satisfied with $2.5k monthly. You are
                                      incapable because society has already told you so.</em></p>
              <p>When i stated old folks r not earnign tat much either, u
                                      <em>clarify</em> by adding in more lins</p>
              <p><em>As a NTU engineer, you must really be damn lousy to be
                                      earning $2.5k monthly when many others are earning near to $1k more

              <p>U added additional information to <em>clarify</em> your
                                      stand</p>
              <p>Since "tat" is unclear and tat is why I clarify it to
                                      be the &gt;3000 in the previous thread. Surprisingly, u refuse to
                                      let me clarify my stand here. Why can't i clarify the things I said
                                      ? Why can I let u clarify your stand before and now u refuse to let
                                      me clarify ? U got something to hide or u have nothing to say ?</p>
              <p>5) then u go crazy, jump and then talk about incredibly crazy
                                      logic which made no sense. And u force your stupid logic on me sand
                                      say tat I derive it. If clarifying is illogical, then u started off
                                      tis trend as well</p>
              <p>6) And then u just dwell on nothing but talking rubbish here.
                                      Wat is the main question u wanna ask ? Is there an error made ? U
                                      made the error here, u cannot properly even quote correctly and u
                                      do not know the difference between 3000 to &gt;3000. Tat is really
                                      stupid of u</p>

              <blockquote>
              <p>Now tis is on another stupid topic u had raised before</p>
              <p>1) I stated the below</p>
              <p><em>The <strong>more important skills</strong> for an
                                      <strong>engineer or a research</strong> is to <strong>come out with
                                      the solution or write a world class research
                                      paper</strong></em></p>
              <p>2) Tis is in line with the definition of wiki and dictionary.com
                                      and professional engineer society</p>
              <p><em>An <strong>engineer</strong> is a person who is
                                      professionally engaged in a field of</em> <a title="Engineering" rel="nofollow" href="/wiki/Engineering"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>engineering</em></span></span></a><em>.
                                      Engineers are concerned with <strong>developing economical and safe
                                      solutions</strong> to practical problems, by applying</em> <a title="Mathematics" rel="nofollow" href="/wiki/Mathematics"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>mathematics</em></span></span></a> <em>and</em> <a title="Scientific knowledge" rel="nofollow" href="/wiki/Scientific_knowledge"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>scientific knowledge</em></span></span></a> <em>while considering technical constraints</em></p>
              <p>3) Now u find the definition of the real expert (professional
                                      engineer) in tis field "inadequate" and want to correct the
                                      definition of wat define them to tis experts. U r really thinking
                                      they, the professional engineer soceity, do not know wat they
                                      r doing</p>
              <p>4) Then wat do u do, u come out with stupid examples which u had
                                      ceased using (die examination), u talk about software engineer then
                                      product engineering then sales engineer then graphic designer
                                      then try to claim professor is engineer and a lot of sh!t</p>
              <p>5) then u claim if u come out with one example u can prove the
                                      definition wrong. I stated why should tat be the case. Tis is
                                      generally (generally means more than 95%) true and tat is correct
                                      alredy isn't it ? Why does freak examples matter</p>
              <p>6) Then u claim research writing paper is education and
                                      therefore the definition is wrong.</p>
              <p>7) Research is indeed about writing paper, which i have claimed
                                      before, but the main job and the most important skill is to come
                                      out with the necessary solution. Without tis solution, wat r u
                                      writing about ? U r just a clerk or a story teller and not an
                                      engineer. The whole content of the paper is ON the solution. Just
                                      the process of writing is not critical. Solving solution is
                                      the critical skill.  It is their main job</p>
              <p>8) then u just keep spurting out more nonsense and say tat
                                      writing is educating and educating is not solving solution. I have
                                      repeatedly told u without solution u cannot write. And the solution
                                      is more important than the process of writing. People see the
                                      solution in your paper to find a better solution for other
                                      process</p>
              <p>9) U can keep trying to prove the professional engineer do not
                                      know wat their job is about. But the more u try to prove, the
                                      moe silly u become</p>

              <p>Firstly, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>PROVE THAT I WAS DEFINING OR HAD DEFINED WHAT SOFTWARE ENGINEERS OR WHAT PRODUCT ENGINEERS SHOULD DO</strong></span></span>.</p>
              <p>I told you the job scope. And why do the job scopes differ from those listed in wiki or dictionary???? This, why don't you go and ask all the different companies in Singapore, and see if <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>all</strong></span> their engineers do what wiki has said? <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>You want to talk about the main jobs of engineers, so I gave you examples of engineers who have a different main job from what you said. Anything wrong with that????</strong></span></span> <strong>Obviously yes to you when you stated with conviction that the main job of an engineer is to come out with solutions.</strong></p>
              <p>In addition, this is what you have said:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>And since I used the definition of wiki, u cannot default me for

              </blockquote>
              <p>All the while, I didn't default you for using wiki's definition, but rather, told you that wiki's definition is inadequate because of the examples I listed. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Then suddenly after 6 pages, you tell me what you said is generally correct????????? Are you running dry?</strong></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>You mean you don't understand what is meant by the word "examples"??? Must it be numerous? </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>You are really still embarrassing yourself by telling me what I said was correct all along only after 6 pages.</strong></span></p>
              <p>I guess you are the one who needs to go back to PSLE for not being able to comprehend what is meant by examples.</p>
