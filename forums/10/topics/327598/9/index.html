              <p>Realise that you are twisting words yet again. In no way did the logic I stated used the word similar. <strong>A is similar to B is different from A is B.</strong></p>

              <p>And you are yet again taking a different logic again. Sure, A&amp;B and C&amp;D are mutually exclusive; you don't conclude the relationship between C &amp; D because of A &amp; B. But that's not what was done here at all.</p>
              <p>Let me state to you in a way that your stupid brain can analyse:</p>
              <p>An engineer is concerned with blah blah blah means that an engineer can do other things that does not concern with blah blah blah as well.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Let see wat is the statement u wrote</p>
              <p><em>a professor is a qualified expert" is an inadequate explanation of what a professor is. </em></p>
              <p><em>With your same logic, you will have nailed yourself a 2nd time on the statement that "an engineer is concerned with blah blah blah" because clearly, an engineer will also contain characteristics (or in other words, do other things) that is not included in the subset of pple concerned with blah blah blah</em></p>
              <p>There r 2 group of people here, professor and engineer. Now a professor is not <strong>totally identical</strong> to an enginner ? NO. They r mutually exclusive group of people. And wat do u do ? U used the argument on professor for engineer. R they the same ? NO. So wat is your point ? The definition of a professor is more than "qualified expert", u refuse to add in more meaning to it and play with twisted logic and then conclude the same thing to an engineer which is completely different to to its definition etc.</p>
              <p>Talking about twisting, u r the one tat twist logic and other people's word</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>What rubbish again. Your logic is already wrong, as pointed out when you said that from A is B doesn't mean B is A means A contains characteristics, it merely means that the statement that "an engineer is concerned with blah blah blah" because clearly, an engineer will also contain characteristics (or in other words, do other things) that is not included in the subset of pple concerned with blah blah blah.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Wat r u really writing here ? Utterly confusing. I told u before</p>
              <p>A belongs to a group labeled as B. Tat doesn't mean A must not have extra characteristics more than B. So wat is your answer to tat ? Nothing. Wat is wrong with it ? Nothing.</p>
              <p>The wrong thing is u claim "professor is a qualified expert, then qualified expert is not an occupation and professor is not an occupation" This is a logical error and it shows how stupid u r</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And wat happened to your process engineer, software engineer etc ? Wat examples have u shown ? NONE.</p>

              <p>From there, all your previous logics are gone. Poof! Vanished. There's already no need to reply you all those because it is clear that your logic is haywired. You have truly nailed yourself to the wall.</p>
              <p>And ya, if a company states that they want to employ a software engineer as a sweeper, then yes, the sweeper is a software engineer.</p>
              <p>And one more thing, you have not yet explained how teachers are excluded from your definitions. They do face technical constraints in delivering their presentations you know?</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>I asked u before, wat happened to the rest of the answer and u pop up utter rubbish tat has no connection with the original statement ? Wat has your above chunk of rubbish got to do with me asking u to reply the reply on 16 Sep 926 ? Why u cannot answer to them ? Speechless already ?</p>
              <p>Again u have shown yourself to be stupid in tis logic</p>
              <p><em> if a company states that they want to employ a software engineer as a sweeper, then yes, the sweeper is a software engineer</em></p>
              <p>Is tat your idea of wat an occupation is ? So I employ a student union president to drive a taxi, he is a president and not a taxi driver ? Tat is why your logic is nonsensical. If I employ a software engineer to be a sweeper, he is a sweeper. Full stop.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>All you can manage still is to explain your 'evidences' and 'tons of evidence' as describing the job scopes of an occupation, hence still using the above logic. Do try again.</p>

              <p>U fail to read the full paragraph ba ! A professor can be a form of address. I do not deny it. However a professor is an occupation too. Why don't u answer the point of</p>
              <p>1) University give the <strong>job title</strong> of professor to many individuals. So they r not occupation ?</p>
              <p>2) The name card of professor write "professor" as their job title. They do nto know wat they r doing ?</p>
              <p>3) wiki has mentioned people employed as lecturer in university as the job "professor". u give a rubbish statement saying they employ the man and not the job which is again another nonsense from u</p>
              <p>4) They say the professor can do things like teaches at school etc which u clearly ignore and claim these r not job</p>
              <p>5) I told u have to read and understand the paragraph in totality and absence of the word occupation odesn't mean it is not. Otherwise the whole definition will be stupid by including common sense like the professor must be a thinking sentinent etc</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><strong>Using your exact same logic</strong>, when NSPE gives the definition, they never explicitly state that the skill of education is not equally important for an engineer as well. In fact, NSPE itself is heavily involved in the education of engineers, and even in it's ethics, it encourages engineers to impart knowledge.</p>
              <p><strong>So who are you again to say the skill of education is not equally important?</strong> <strong>Just because it was not stated explicitly?????</strong></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Wat same logic. U see u r linking 2 completely different things together again. U r claiming simple and stupid things like professor is not an occupation which is already mentioned in the page. Now u r claiming for something different. U claim education is having the same importance as solving practical problems. WRONG. U can say education is important BUT not conclude it is <strong>more</strong> <strong>important</strong> than solving practical problems for an engineer. I have repeated the argument below repeatedly which u refuse to answer.</p>
              <p>Solving the problem is more important than educating. Without the thing to educate, how r u gonna educate ? Even u acknowledge the above before and now flip flop and say it is wrong</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Till now, you are still telling me: A is B, so how can A be C?<br>Compare this to A is B doesn't mean B is A.</p>
              <p>Do note that I'm talking about only 2 variables. Is there any reason why you fail to understand, and consistently go out of point to use 3 variables?</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>U just refuse to answer the main point of the argument</p>
              <p><em>a professor is a qualified expert, how can a professor thus be an occupation</em></p>
              <p>I change the word "professor" to be a "teacher" here and "qualified expert" to be "man".</p>
              <p>Then the statement becomes</p>
              <p><em>a teacher is a man, how can a teacher thus be an occupation ?</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So is shows how stupid your argument is. However u refuse to comment on the example and talk about something completely different to confuse the people. Wat have u got to say for the above ?</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Again, an engineer is concerned with blah blah blah. However, someone concerned with blah blah blah can mean many other things, such as teachers, etc. <strong>All the characteristics of an engineer need not be reflected in your statement of being concerned with blah blah blah, except that one.</strong></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Wat blah blah blah r u talking about ? Why don't u practise to write normally before u make a comment ?</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Notice how you missed all the key words I bolded for you? Let me repeat to you the words:</p>
              <p>1) Concrete solutions, not opinions with the word 'probably'<br>2) Easily verified and checked by the surfer on the spot (the only way to verify first-hand in your case is to go enrol into it yourself)</p>
              <p>Btw, one should always doubt it too, because that is how a inquisitive and smart brain works. Don't remain spoonfed and think everything must definitely be right, be it from books written by professors or websites. My NUS class have cases in which a textbook published by a well-known overseas professor was a little wrong, and we emailed to confirm with him.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>1) Probably is already a very strong word used. It already is an evidence tat show oral exams r more easier than written exams. However u just play with the word instead of understanding the whole statement</p>
              <p>2) The statement made by the school is already the verification. U think everybody is so free to experience everything themselves ? Wat do u have on the other hand ? NOTHING.</p>
              <p>Sure, it is wise not to believe people but looking at the claims u made and the claims the school made, which is more valid ? U think u have more credibility than the school ?</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>You only need 2 clicks to access the certs. Sure, it might be fake, but you can easily call and check it out, both the webmaster and NUS. At least it's a much simpler and better comparison</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Why don't u put your website here and let people take a look at your so called beneficial to society webpage ?</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Suits you, if you think that Google is that dumb to allow you to put a virus into their blogger server.</p>
              <p>Using your logic, if Warren Buffett donates a large portion of his wealth to charity, it is to be doubted as well because he definitely has some secret motives we do not know about?????</p>
              <p>And using your logic, when PAP gives Growth dividends to help the poor, it is to be doubted as well! Who knows if they are really buying votes?</p>
              <p>And finally, I have already mentioned that I do not need pple to trust my website. Any reason why you can still be so spastic to ask me "why should people trust yours"?</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Well, u doubted the words of a university but believe warren buffett donate a large portion of wealth to charity. Did u call the charity and verify ? Did u know he has no ulterior moltives such as gaining fame ? And why do u trust singapore when they say they give out growth dividend to evry singaporean ? U got call up every singaporean and asked ? I thought u proposed people to experience it firsthand than can u conclude it is true. Why don't u go and conclude the growth dividend by asking all the singaporean ? Tis is according to your nonsense logic of denying information provided by the university. I think the spastic people is u.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>It's up to them to do so. Whether the content is rubbish is for everyone else to judge. As I have already said, the surfer can easily check and verify everything, all by himself.</p>
              <p>And well, since it is in Singapore for Singapore, I have already said that the contacts are there. 2 clicks, that's all you need.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Wat clicks do u mean ? According to u, the websites cannot be trusted. Any click on the internet will not result in a confirmed answer. U can only verify by experiencing first hand according to your nonsensical claims. So did everybody experience u going to NUS and study ? No right ? Since since they did not experienced it how to verify ?</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Till now, you still cannot tell me what gives the webmaster the qualifications to assure you that it is definitely true?</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Because tis is the official webpage of the school. Based on your idiotic logic, nothing on the web can be trusted </p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>As I have already said in point 4, I do not need them to trust. They have the right to judge from the full content. And again, they can do that easily because it is concrete solutions in which they can easily check and verify all by themselves, <strong>first-hand</strong>.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>So how to verify u study NUS, they follow u to study ? How to judge u wrote the webpage ? They see u personally code it in ? How do we know the person is actually u ? See u log into sgforums and write ? Come on man... there is no way to first hand verify all in the internet and asking people to do tat is just plain spastic</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Note that you still cannot tell me engineering is definitely fun because NUS website states so.</p>
              <p>Now you are telling me I'm wrong because TUD website states that it is probably so.</p>
              <p>Either you are confused with words, or you are still practicing double standards.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>U r making a mistake here. I told u engineering can be fun and tat is already enough. Why do u have to force me to say it is definitely fun ? The fact engineering can be fun is already good for the statement "Engineering is fun". U have a problem with tat ? And TUD website says u r wrong is already more substantial than your lousy claims. If u talk about practising double standard, u r practising no standard at all</p>

              <p>The examiners are well trained to do so, and for Singaporeans
                                          like us, our education system make it all the harder for us to
                                          properly prepare for oral exams. We are so used to having 'TYS'
                                          questions ready for us to do. For Germans, it might be easier
                                          though, since they will most likely be used to their own

              <p>Then again, because of 10-year series, for Singaporeans, there
                                          are many ways to score. Once you know a system, it's always easy to
                                          score. :D Just keep doing and doing and doing questions, of course,

                                          students right now. It's effective till the point where even if you
                                          are slightly clueless about the question, you could still answer
                                          well.</p>
              <p>Anyway, this is where I try to help students by providing
                                          questions and solutions for them. Do help spread to those who need
                                          the help :D<a rel="nofollow" href="http://examworld.blogspot.com/"><br> http://examworld.blogspot.com</a> =&gt; Sort of like building an

              <p><strong>And hence you have to resort to coercing me to state it.</strong></p>
              <p>The evidence is there that you asked me to state it because you cannot find the sentence which I said it, not just once.</p>

              <p>So you want to play with words?</p>
              <p>Fine. Let me ask you.</p>

              <p>If it can be an occupational title, then what is wrong in saying they are legal titles? Or you want to tell me a legal title cannot be an occupational title?</p>

              <p>It is linked to the first point of tis reply and clearly u have
                                      stated such an absurb conclusion. If u do not implied tat, then u r
                                      clearly having delusions. I wonder how can your students stand such
                                      a lousy tuition teacher like u. U said something wrong and when the
                                      student point it out, u can ask him to quote it out. When they
                                      quote it out u can twist and turn and interprete the statement
                                      totally different from how people understand it.</p>

              <p>In law, <strong>defamation</strong> (also called
                                      <strong>calumny</strong>, <strong>libel</strong>,
                                      <strong>slander</strong>, and <strong>vilification</strong>) is the
                                      communication of a statement that makes a false claim, expressly
                                      stated or implied to be factual, that may give an individual,
                                      business, product, group, government or nation a negative
                                      image.</p>
              <p>Look at the word "<em>implied"</em>. Your statement had already
                                      implied tat I am selfish without giving any justification. So u
                                      have committed libel. If u claim tat "it seems very clear" is not
                                      implying anything, than u have to prove to me</p>

              <p>Ya what, you are definitely very free. What other reasons can it be given that you have to state you are playing games of patience and tolerance?</p>
              <p>You are still escaping:</p>
              <p>How? Escaped yet again in finding a case of libel when someone
                                      says "it seems very clear" ?</p>
              <p>Just like how you escaped in contacting MOM if it's illegal to
                                      employ someone to do nothing?</p>
