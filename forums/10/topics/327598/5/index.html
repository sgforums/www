              <p>Still trying to deny. Either way I see it, by replying to "Tat is my takehome pay" to  "3000 a month is still on the lower end. ", you are still saying that 3000 is your takehome pay.</p>
              <p>It's either your error in calculations, or your error in quotation.</p>

              <p>Are you very very sure that is what I have described? I've already told you that the professor will provide certain hints if the student really do not know, and attempt to ask again, on the expense of the student's oral exam time. The reason for it? You are supposed to have been attending all lectures throughout the semester, and you should definitely remember something about it. If the exams were as simple as you have made it, the professors wouldn't even have bothered attempting to give some hints at times.</p>
              <p>I have not even gone into the format of testing yet, and you are already telling me so many things as if you know everything. Wow.</p>

              <p>1) So finding out the defect on a semi-conductor die requires maths? An engineer coming out with a software code requires science and maths?</p>
              <p>2) Why not? The road sweeper needs to use his scientific knowledge (physics) to come out with more efficient ways to clean up the streets so as to do his job faster. You don't flip the broom hard such that it breaks, you don't exert excessive strength to sweep leaves, etc.</p>

              <p>Are you very very sure that is what I have described? I've already told you that the professor will provide certain hints if the student really do not know, and attempt to ask again, on the expense of the student's oral exam time. The reason for it? You are supposed to have been attending all lectures throughout the semester, and you should definitely remember something about it. If the exams were as simple as you have made it, the professors wouldn't even have bothered attempting to give some hints at times.</p>

              <p>Then I have already told u the professor is helping the student by giving hints to him. He gets SOME here rather than ZERO if he skip and leave a question blank in the written exam.

                                                      defining wat is an engineer or not</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>I have already shown you that the definition does not encompass software engineers. You should look at where the source of wiki's definition came from before you start shooting around aimlessly again.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>U see the flaw in your argument</p>
              <p>U claim the professor is an engineer. And his job deals with
                                                      lecturing. Then u link his professor job and his profession
                                                      together by claiming engineer lectures. Take note lecturing is due
                                                      to him being a professor, not because he is an engineer.</p>
              <p>1) He is a professor whose trained in engineering</p>
              <p>2) he is considered as an engineer</p>
              <p>3) he lecture because he is a professor</p>
              <p>4) u conclude engineer lectures</p>
              <p>If u use tis twisted example of linking a profession to the
                                                      occupation, then i can say Hu Jintao is trained as an engineer. He
                                                      is now a politician and manage a country. Using your twisted
                                                      thinking, then i can say engineer manage the country.</p>
              <p>1) he is a politican trained in engineering</p>
              <p>2) he is considered as an engineer</p>
              <p>3) he manage the country because he is a politician</p>
              <p>4) u can conclude engineer runs the country</p>
              <p>I can also say an engineer do part time policing. He is an
                                                      engineer by occupation and he really do catch bandits and
                                                      criminals. By your twisted thinking u say engineer do policing.</p>
              <p>1) he is an engineer</p>
              <p>2) he do part time policing</p>
              <p>3) u conclude engineer do policing</p>
              <p>See how absurb your argument is about</p>
              <p>U know wat is your problem. NOT all engineer r professors. U do
                                                      not use professor's job scope and and rope into engineer</p>

              <p>You know your problem? Your logic is missing. I mentioned earlier that <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>part of the equation</strong></span> includes education.

              <p>In your logic, a professor can only be a professor. He cannot be a researcher, and thus cannot be a engineer????</p>
              <p>No matter how I read it, I don't see myself having said at all that "all engineer r professors". Perhaps your selective reading disorder again.</p>

              <p>I think u need to know wat is software engineer. They do programming, not use photoshop to beautify things here and there. Beautifying a graphic is the role of a graphic designer. Look at the job scope of a software engineer first before u make a comment</p>
