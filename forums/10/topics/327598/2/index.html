              <p>The questions asked in oral examinations pinpoint heavily on your uncertain portions. When the lecturer sense that you are unclear, he will ask more heavily on that portion. Can you tell me that any written examinations that do that?</p>
              <p>And tell me, what exam strategies do you think that can apply to oral examinations? You can't skip questions; and you have to understand on the spot.</p>
              <p>And are you still telling me that you prefer a graduate who come out not knowing fully everything as compared to one who knows more because he has been more rigourously tested?</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p> As said, it becomes a subjective test. The lecturer always see tis guy attending his lectures and he will be more lenient towards him. The lecturer being tired and want to end the test quickly also will end up asking lesser questions. Tat is why most universities do not rely on oral examinations. Rigously tested ? So u r saying US university students r not rigously tested ? The idea of the oral examination is already an unfair test. As said before, written examination cannot skip questions too</p>

              <p>They skip and they lose the marks. If losing marks is an option, then u can just admit u do not know the question to the oral examination and also skip questions</p>

              <p>And I have already told you there's no need to understand fully the modules in NUS to score As for it.</p>

              <p>You stated it. You should prove it. This is your style.</p>
              <p>For Germany, I know for a fact that TUD and TUM have oral examinations; that's 2 out of their 5 technical universities. And Germany has a rather high ranking for engineering.</p>

              <p>Some examples can include doing analysis and giving conclusions, and educating other engineers/people.</p>
              <p>Not to mention the fact that you seemed to think that someone graduating with an engineering degree must be an engineer since you appear to be very concerned with the education of engineers in the uni being able to satisfy the "main job" requirements of an engineer.</p>
