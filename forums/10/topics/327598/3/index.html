              <p>Anyway, this thread already shows your limited views. What's more with the statement "written examinations cannot skip questions" -.-"</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Seems u want me to carry on. Fine lets play tis game</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>And I have already told you there's no need to understand fully the modules in NUS to score As for it.</p>
              <p>So back to the question you have been avoiding by directing me to your question on the problem being on NUS professors:</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Then tat seems to beg the question whether does one need to fully understand the modules in TUD. Furthermore, not all modules in TUD uses oral examination</p>
              <p>If u look at TUM</p>
              <p><em>Many examinations are held during the weeks at the end of a semester after lectures have ended. If a test conflicts with your plans to return home, you should request an oral exam from the professor teaching the course. <strong>Professors are not obligated to offer an oral test, but if they do it will most probably be to your advantage</strong>. </em></p>
              <p><a href="http://portal.mytum.de/studium/bewerbung/incomings/Austauschstudenten/faq/">http://portal.mytum.de/studium/bewerbung/incomings/Austauschstudenten/faq/</a></p>
              <p>Wat message r they driving ? Written examination is still the most important part of the curriculum. If they give oral exam, it is because of humane reason like going back home early and it is easier than the written exam. U r lucky TUD website is all german</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>You stated it. You should prove it. This is your style.</p>
              <p>For Germany, I know for a fact that TUD and TUM have oral examinations; that's 2 out of their 5 technical universities. And Germany has a rather high ranking for engineering.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Fact is tat, other than your germany university who do uses oral examination for the some subjects, most university does not. If u ask me for evidence, it will be the absence of information on oral examination from US university and emphasis on oral examination on TUD. MIT only have oral examination for PhD student and so does NTU and NUS. They call tis "defence" of your thesis and not on studying modules</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Still acting dumb or what. Haven't I already told you it is for testing of theories and facts?</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Maybe because u r limiting in your view and tat is why u fail to realise math can have an oral examination if they want. Furthermore, Maths do have theories involved</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Again, I have told you that you will likely get penalised heavily for that. Still missing the point is it?</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Why do u think u will not be penalised for leaving a question empty in a written exam ?</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Some examples can include doing analysis and giving conclusions, and educating other engineers/people.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>U see, u r skipping wat is the main job of an engineering. Doing analysis and giving conclusion is = to providing physical solution. Educating people is not the main job of an engineer and more like a training officer.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Not to mention the fact that you seemed to think that someone graduating with an engineering degree must be an engineer since you appear to be very concerned with the education of engineers in the uni being able to satisfy the "main job" requirements of an engineer.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>No, I did not say tat a person with an engineering degree must be an engineer. I am saying an ENGINEER has to provide answer on physical problems.</p>
              <p>Lets see the wiki definition of engineer</p>

              always astounds me .<br> <br> The worse people to debate with are the badly educated. The
              uneducated are easy to dismiss. The well-educated are a joy to
              debate with, even if sometimes disagreements can get quite heated -
              you nevertheless go away mentally stimulated and satisfied. The
              badly educated on the other hand (like this person who more or less
              admitted to be an NUS Arts and Social Science graduate) are painful
              to debate with.<br> <br> These people have read the right books, memorised the right key
              words and phrases, but have no real understanding of the issues.
              Worse, they lack to intellect to analyse these topics properly. In
              these cases, what happens is that you get verbal diarrhoea spewed
              at you and you don't even know where to begin to argue back,
              because even though all the paragraphs are correctly stringed
              together, the sentences are grammatical, the spelling is almost
              always right, the right names and phrases are dropped, BUT the
              person does not make any sense. This leaves you intellectually
              frustrated because unlike uneducated people, you have to unteach
              before you teach. It's like a gadfly, albeit without the
              intelligence of Socrates, which you have to swat away, because this
              person talks your language ostensibly, and you feel a compulsion to
              correct her.<br> <br> The local universities cannot be good until the government stops
              sending the brightest overseas on scholarships; however, the local
              universities will fail to attract them until they can draw the best
              thinkers and dons on all levels, rather than second-rate teachers
              from India and China. It is a vicious cycle and until this cycle is
              broken, local university undergraduates (with the exception of Law
              and Medicine) will always be second-rate, so much so that some
              foreign (mainland Chinese) undergraduates have said that
              Singaporeans are stupid. If their experience is only at the local
              universities, it is no wonder they say that, since our most
              brilliant have all gone overseas to Oxbridge and the Ivies,
              Stanford or MIT. What these mainland Chinese have not experienced
              are these students who have not only gone to the best universities
              in the world, but consistently top these universities. I honestly
              think that the mainland Chinese and Indians who top NUS/NTU/SMU
              would be easily trounced if they came up against our true best and
              brightest.<br> <br> Singapore needs to put more resources into universities if it wants
              to be taken seriously as a First World Nation. The vicious cycle
              needs to be broken somewhere - they need to hire the best
              professors and get some of the brightest to stay at home. These may
              lead to fewer places at the local universities so some people will
              not qualify. But some people don't belong at universities - they
              would probably serve society better by getting technical
              proficiency at a polytechnic, then joining the workforce.<br> <br> Afterall, it's better to be a non-graduate than a half-educated
              village graduate</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Com'on... I did not change the figure to become 3000. It is all along 3000 and your memory had failed u. Even in your own reply u have quoted it as 3000. So now since u realised tat my take home pay is 3000 and u deemed me to be an NTU engineer graduate, then r u gonna claim I am incapable ? If I am incapable, then tons of people out there r incapable as well. So wat is your stand on "incapable" and "lousy" ? U wanna eat back all those words now ?</p></div>

              <p>Well, there's no proof if you have changed it before, because there's clearly an edited post message 11 mins after you posted.</p>
              <p>3000 a month is still on the lower end. Which means going back to my earlier statement, it means many are earning $500 more.</p>
              <p>You are still incapable and lousy because you are easily "resigned by
                                      fate and circumstances".</p>

              <p>Tis is from your reply, on the thread <strong>1st world country, 3rd world situation, Uniquely Singapore,</strong> page 5, 22 Jul 11: 10 written by eagle. At the very last line</p>
              <p><em>It must have costed you a big bomb if you have been around Europe, having claimed you earned &lt;3k a month.</em></p>
              <p>Now who had changed the post before ? It is all the while 3000.</p>

              <p>Now tat is my take home pay. If u add in CPF contribution it is 3600 a month. I find tat a reasonable amount for an engineer and there r many people similar or worse off than me. So u r gonna classify them as incapable or lousy ? Wat happened to your earlier statement of</p>
              <p><em>Try again when you earn more. Someone not limited in views wouldn't have told me he's satisfied with $2.5k monthly. You are incapable because society has already told you so.</em></p>
              <p><em>As a NTU engineer, you must really be damn lousy to be earning $2.5k monthly when many others are earning near to $1k more =&gt; society's way of showing how incapable you are.</em></p>
              <p>U give a fake figure, play with it and hurl insults over it. Don't u feel u should eat back these words and apologise ?</p>

              <p>Since u claim the above, then please show me explicitly where did I say "resigned by fate and circumstances". It is on wat issue ?</p>

              <p>Wat is your comment on the other part of your passage ? It seems pretty empty to me.</p>
              <p>Now on the statement</p>
              <p><em>Actually u r pretty right on me being resigned by fate and circumstances</em></p>
              <p>Wat is the point u r trying to drive ? Some people r pessimist, some r optimist. Some people view things as realistic and view things as opportunity. Wat right do u have to say people who r more realistic to be "incapable" ? The old and needy folks r probably resigned to their fate and circumstances as well. R u gonna link them to be "incapable" as well ?</p>
