              <p>Let me see... in the whole argument here, I only see u fumbling and unable to answer for many areas and u giving out animalistic one liner grunt back. I told u u r wrong, and u grunt back a vague one liner without elaboration at all. Since u say so, then prove it. Wat have u really shown me ? Your one example is struggling under the sea, u cannot prove why an example shown can say the definition made by experts in tis field to be wrong, u cannot explain why your view is so limited tat if a fact is true under 0.1%-99.9% of the situation is is viewed as truth.</p>

              <p>Valid real life example ?</p>
              <p> *look around*</p>
              <p>WHere ? U mean u claim to have some real life examples isn't it ? U probably listed out many examples of engineers and u know wat, all r thrown under the sea. Do u know wat is really stupid ? <strong>U r trying to prove the professional of engineering board tat they do not know wat they r working as. U want to prove the dictionary wrong. U want to prove wiki is inadequate.</strong> And how do u do it ? By wrongly using examples which u cannot substantiate.</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>I have been answering tat point since u wrote it but the problem is u never reply to it at all. Then u blame on me for been silent ? Wat a joke. How r u gonna do the stupid task of trying to prove the professional of engineers tat they do nt know wat they r working as, u try to prove by thinking if u show one example of engineer not doing engineering work (which u have not shown) then the whole definition is throw off.</p>
              <p>However tis approach is just wishful thinking on your side. Not everyone knows wat engineers (someone like u who do not know wat an engineer do) as well as the board of professional engineers and there is the likelihood tat they had mislabel the title of the job. Lets say one chinese firm who do not know english well put up a job for a secretary/sweeper/cleaner and label it as engineer. Does tat means the board of engineers r wrong ? It is rather the chinese firm to be wrong isn't it ? However tat is wat u r trying to do in tis case. U r trying to find mistakes made by people or firms in their lax definition of the word and thinking tat if u find such idiots in the world the whole definition of the word is thrown off. U just shown the other party wrong, not the dictionary or board of engineer or wiki. It is like someone trying to find someone who made a vocab error in using the word "idiot" and then proclaim the word listed "idiot" in the dictionary to be wrong. Do u think tat line of argument is fair ? Nah... u r just trying to be funny and it is rather foolish. Tat is why I stated before tat unless u can find a whole bulk of examples of wrong usage of the word engineer, then can u consider it as a valid argument on the word. Otherwise u only find a group of people who do not know the meaning of engineer. Is tis too hard for u to understand ?</p>

              <p>Wat english r u talking here ? taking a whole field of software engineering to prove a single job scope impossible ? Taking to where ? DO u need to take back fundamental english before posting here ?</p>

              <p>I told you there's no professional engineer for research engineering. I asked you that question to confirm you do indeed agree with the previous sentence, because somehow, you keep disagreeing with it. <strong>Or rather, you continue to misunderstand it by thinking that I said professional engineers cannot do research.</strong></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>I think u r really going more and more stupid as time progresses. U agree tat professional engineers can do research right ? Then why can't NSPE do reseach since they r professional engineers ? Since they can do research, why can't they define wat is engineer when they have explicitly mention it is for all field ?</p>

              <p>When I have already told (and replied) you that I did not deny that you need to have research results to publish, but it is <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>equally important</strong></span> to be able to publish and educate. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>If not, what's the use of having the research results if you cannot educate others properly about it?</strong></span> =&gt; This has already been told to you.

              <p>Who says so ? In military research, <strong>u CANNOT publish research</strong> <strong>result</strong> out for other countries to copy. U have research result, u apply to your own device and tat is already very good. As said before, u must be able to generate results first then can u publish a paper. U know wat is the objective of engineering researchers and how they can make money back for government and companies ? They manage to come out with a commercial or usable product. To protect themselves from competition, they often do not publish out results for others to copy.</p>

              <p>We were talking about job scopes hor, not about requiring a person trained in engineering for the job. Different things, and don't twist away (yet again!)</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>I told u before. U show me 3 job scopes and one of them is on engineering. U conclude wrongly saying tat since only 1 job scope is on engineering, engineering is not the more important skill to have. It is wrong. They require other skill doesn't means engineering is not the more important skill. How do we know tat. They ask for people trained as engineers to apply, not business or admin or other professions.Tis clearly shows tat engineering is the more important skill to have.</p>

              <p>Isn't tat already describing an occupation. Lets look at some other statements</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Now wiki state it is a title and an occupation. Who say it is not an occupation ? Only a person who claims to have go to a university claims professor is not an occupation. Why don't u read wiki yourself and tell me which part of it is wrong ?</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>This is where you are wrong. It can be inadequate if it <strong><span style="color: #888888;">misses</span></strong> some information on the area too. <strong>The definition can be correct but inadequate.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Yet you are still telling me I said wiki is wrong when I merely said it was inadequate???</strong></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>If it misses out some part, then it is still wrong because it fails to address the term fully. If the definition is right, it must be able to address all reasonable and correct usage of the word. If it cannot, then it is wrong. We r talking about definition here. If it cannot address fully then it is the wrong definition.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Inadequate answers get half the marks in your exams. It can mean some areas are wrong, I'm not denying. <strong>But it can also mean that some areas are not stated/listed/answered.</strong></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>If it is not listed or answered, it is deemed u have done it wrong and marks r still deducted. Missing is considered as a wrong.</p>

              <p>Professional engineers for electrical works means that these professional engineers are engaged in taking legal responsibility for electrical works being done because they approved it. Anything wrong, the law goes for the one who gave the stamp and legal approval.</p>

              <p><strong>This is different from what you have said and misinterpreted consistently, that I said professional engineers cannot do research.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>So if you have agreed that there's no such things as PEs to give legal approval for research work to be done</strong>, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>are you still going to tell me NSPE is going to include PEs for research work only?</strong></span></p>

              uni, put yr sg ways behind.</p>
              <p>Try to adapt to the overseas uni culture and if u dont, u will
              get marked as being lazy. its not yr fault cause so many years of
              written exams in sg, and u cant take it when someone ask u to do
              reseach.</p>

              <p>I guess the main thing is that when we go overseas, you will find it much more difficult because the system of education is totally different from what we are used to. I can only say I'm glad to have the priviledge and opportunity to experience both local and Germany's uni education.</p>
              <p>Certain things might probably be easier for locals who are already used to their own country's education system, but for us, it could likely be much more difficult (but some bugger have difficulty understanding that). Similarly, if they come to NUS, they might find it difficult to cope as well. This is probably a reason why NUS made it such that exchange students only need to pass modules overseas to get the credit.</p>

              <p>EXACTLY.</p>
              <p>The examiners are well trained to do so, and for Singaporeans like us, our education system make it all the harder for us to properly prepare for oral exams. We are so used to having 'TYS' questions ready for us to do. For Germans, it might be easier though, since they will most likely be used to their own system.</p>
              <p>Then again, because of 10-year series, for Singaporeans, there are many ways to score. Once you know a system, it's always easy to score. :D Just keep doing and doing and doing questions, of course, in the right way. I have a method which I'm teaching all my tuition students right now. It's effective till the point where even if you are slightly clueless about the question, you could still answer well.</p>
              <p>Anyway, this is where I try to help students by providing questions and solutions for them. Do help spread to those who need the help :D<a href="http://examworld.blogspot.com"><br>http://examworld.blogspot.com</a> =&gt; Sort of like building an online ten years series. As long as exams here are written based, it will stay useful :D</p>

Then they want to engage tis engineer to do another project requiring programming (using photoshop is not programming or developing software), he is still doing his job as a software engineer. Then ? If tis guy is employed as a software engineer and do a graphic designer job, then similarly a software engineer can be employed to do a sweeper job too. However tat will make them technically a graphic designer and a sweeper and NOT a software engineer</span></p>

                                              For a thing such as definition, it can only be right or wrong. If u

              <p>So you one who is looking to play a game of patience and tolerance, and totally not interested in discussions at all. <strong>No wonder you like to doggedly harp on issues with weaker and more illogical posts as time goes on</strong> =&gt; you are only trying to tell me that you have much more free time on your hands to play a game of patience, and not interested in valid discussions.</p>
              <p>My websites and my time are mainly used for helping people who needs it, not playing a immature game of patience like what you are doing. Really, I don't see any contribution from you in helping anyone at all in this forum. Perhaps you are really just posting around to tell everyone you are immature and up for a game of patience and tolerance anytime (similar to something you have posted to redDust about you and Atobe before).</p>

                              for you to accept the opinions, and all you need to do is just to tell
                              me you do not accept it and brush it away as immature. I wouldn't have

                              and give bad opinions. Really, this paragraph of you portrays you as an
                              arrogrant and immature person who cannot handle any sort of opinions
                              (given virtually somemore) at all.</p>
              <p>I didn't issue you a challenge when you are back; I merely reminded you on what you have said. I asked perhaps you would like to continue. Really can't imagine how you would see it as a challenge. Be more mature can a not. You how old already.</p>

              <p>Oh ya, stupidissmart</p>
              <p>If you are posting merely for playing a game of patience and tolerance, then sorry, I have much better things to do with my time than showing you patience and tolerance. Because you are clearly evading yes-no questions with long paragraphs, and telling me I have not answered you when clearly, the answers have been provided to you. =&gt; That is clearly your M.O. of answering to play a game of patience and tolerance; just divert and evade by posting longer paragraphs so as not to answer a yes-no question.</p>
              <p>Another proof of the spastic you. I told you <strong>A is B doesn't mean B is A </strong>and you can misinterpret (again) and tell me that I meant <strong>A is B, and B is not C, hence A is
                          not C</strong>. Yet again, it is clear you are not interested in discussions, but coming up with stupid logics or understanding wrong logics. I have lost count of the number of wrong logics and misunderstanding you made in this whole thread.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">If you want to win in a game of patience and tolerance, I will gladly let you win.</span> Just state to me that you are indeed playing such a childish game. Why should I show patience and tolerance for virtual things that do not give any benefit to me or anyone else at all?</p>
              <p>I come to Speaker's Corner to give my views and opinions, not to play a game of patience and tolerance like what a troll does. I can tell you that my time is being used to increase my side income to at least match that of your supposed salary by the end of next year, so as to nearly double my monthly income.</p>
              <p>There's a difference between being able to tell with conviction how much income you are getting monthly, and not being able to tell how much income you are getting. I'm aiming for the latter. An engineer's job in Singapore is too under-paid. Even at 3700 monthly, it's only nearly 21 bucks per hour for a 22 day month, 8 hour day. I'm aiming for triple that at least for my side income. So far, I have only reached 1.5 times to 2 times of that. :(</p>
              <p>So this is the 3rd time I'm offering this to you again, because you have clearly told me your main aim is playing a game of patience and tolerance, and not discussing at all. I wished you a good day the other time to end this, but you viewed the whole post as declaration of war. I really have no idea why you would do that. Are you going to withdraw your challenge of seeing who is speechless first. It's your challenge hor. So it's up to you to make the decision now. I merely gave you a reminder that our discussions was not resolved yet, and you can tell me you see it as a challenge. -.-"  Super sensitive new-age guy?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>P.S. If you really have that much free time, I suggest you use your spare energy to explore ways to secure your personal financial freedom, not playing games of patience and tolerance. You can support the PAP for all you want, but a word of advice, don't rely on them for the rest of your life. It's for your own good if you can secure your own retirement without looking forward to things like GST offset packages.</p>

DO u think tis argument will hold water. Why don't I ask u back. A lecturer who is employed in a university in USA. Is he a professor or not ? According to wiki, he is a  professor.

              <p>I showed you clearly that MIT tells us oral examinations will be conducted in English. There may be oral exams, there may be not. But the probability is there that there is.</p>
              <p><strong>You are the one who is claiming they do not have at all, thus you should be the one that should prove that the statement I quoted indeed refers only to FYP presentation and thesis defence.</strong></p>
              <p>Don't get the logic wrong again.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>U got it wrong again. Who started talking about MIT ? it is u. U said tat MIT do provide oral exams in the first place and u cannot substantiate the claims. Since u make such a claim, u have to back it up. There is a probability and the probability is tat there is no such oral exams and thus u do not have any evidence on your side</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Be logical please.</p>
              <p>I made an error in quoting the wrong values. You made an error by doing calculations when quoting a wrong value of me without realising. This has already been said to you.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Then fine. So your very initial point tat I had made a calculation error which u had harped for many replies is wrong. Even if u wanna trace back the error it originates from u first. Just a question, when have u ever said tat to me ?</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><span style="COLOR: #ff0000"><strong>If you cannot educate your peers around of the results of your military research, please tell me how your research is going to contribute to national defence at all.</strong></span></p>

              <p>The first part of your sentence in bold perfectly describes the need for a CKO in a big organisation. Passing down work is not more important than building the system up, nor is it the other way round; <strong>both are equally important.</strong></p>
              <p>Of course, someone as stupid as you (especially when you can come up with a stupid nick called stupidissmart) will just keep repeating and fantasizing that you have indeed shot down points when you have been clearly illogical and proven to misunderstand many times when you twist words here and there. <strong>What's more, you have to resort to attempting to coerce me to saying something I did not mean just to further a point.</strong></p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>Again u failed to answer tis point I have repeated many times</p>
              <p>Which is more important ? Doing the work or telling people the work u had done ? If u do not do the work, can u tell anything at all ? Telling only become important only after u have the capability to do the job. If u cannot do the job no matter how good your talk cock skill is, u cannot say anything.</p>
              <p>I have been repeating the above so many times and u just choose to ignore it. R u here for discussion or just testing my patience ?</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Passing down is not a small component at all. I don't know about your company, but my department itself have minimum a weekly technical presentation, a monthly cross countries presentation, a daily email report educating us on the changes made in devices and the reliability of the devices. Furthermore, there's annual technical presentations for the whole company. There's a reason why my company is among the top few in coming up with patents worldwide, just a few ranks lower than companies like IBM and Intel.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Sure your company can have many meeting etc however as said before, u still have to be able to do something before u can say something. If u cannot repair a machine, the machine just sit there idly. If u cannot find the fault on the chip, the chip just stopped producing. If u cannot think of a patent, u cannot write it. If u cannot do your work, u cannot show it at the meeting. So the bottomline is u still need to perform something then can u start your "education" shit. If everyone is your company just know how to talk cock without doing actual work, your company is gonna sink</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>I have already told you that your phrase "process of writing" is clearly different from "as long as they are writing".

              </blockquote>
              <p>If so, then u surely can answer the question I posed with ease.</p>
              <p><em>However tat is out of point since it can be seen tat some reseach is done by a single author and they r not discussing. The only logical conclusion is tat writing paper is for educating other people.</em></p>

              <p>Finding the problem to the solution is solving the problem. I already told u repeatedly the problem is "finding the source of the problem". Wat is your answer to it ?</p>
              <p>About your teacher thingy, they r solving simulated problem not the actual practical problem when u do some engineering. So your definition is not correct</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Well, that means they can be employed as mechanical engineers in part of a mechanical engineering team to look at design and space in the project.</p>

              <p>Are you diverting (yet again) because you are merely looking for a game of patience and tolerance, and totally not interested in discussions?</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>However the main job of a mechanical engineer is still to design and a software engineer is still to program. Take note tat u say software engineer "only" to do photoshop which is really rubbish. As said before, a software engineer can be tasked to claen up his own cubicle in a small company and he can sweep his own office after eating some biscuits with crumbs all over. So is he a sweeper ?

              <p>I have not said that NSPE do not include engineers doing research only.

              <p>Tat is funny. Earlier u r talking about legal responsibility now u suddenly switch completely and talk about requirement ? Realised tat your earlier argument about legal responsibility is sh!t ? Well if u talk about "requirement', then u surely have to know tat u need to be deemed adequate as an engineer before u can start your engineering research. Isn't tat already your "legal requirement' ?</p>

              <p>No, I'm not retracting my statements on you at all. You are still in my eyes someone of limited view. That's my opinion. You have no right at all to ask me to retract my opinions at all.</p>
              <p>You can write a truce yourself, and give all your opinions and remarks on me if you wish. I do not need you to withdraw any at all. I have already mentioned I will not be as childish and immature as you to take it as a challenge and take it so personally, and have already set many examples.</p>
              <p>Oh ya, do write that truce that you said if you decide that you cannot answer the set of illogical statements you have made that I have pointed below. I do want to see it. Really, why don't you write it and see if I will reply with whatever I said you should reply with if you are someone more mature? Go ahead.</p>
              <p><strong>And since you have clearly stated that you are playing a game of patience and tolerance</strong>, <strong>and your M.O. is clear in using long paragraphs to avoid answering simple questions again and again, in addition to telling me I have not given my views on matters which I have clearly given you my views on, I'm not even going to bother reading all the stupid answers you have posted. <br></strong></p>
              <p>Think of this, I can tell you I have stated examples. Yet only after 6 pages, you tell me that you are generally correct, hence stepping yourself heavily on your own foot. You further compounded your stupidity by commenting it's because it is not statistically significant. And when challenged if examples must be statistically significant, you slunked away, defeated.</p>
              <p>Not only that. When I asked you your views on the statement from NUS that "Engineering is fun", you tell me that <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">it can be fun</span></strong>. It is not even the text "Engineering is probably fun". Yet now, you are telling me that because of the phrase "probably to your advantage", I must be wrong. Wow... Blatant double standards (lost count also) in playing your game of patience and tolerance.</p>
              <p>You have truly proven yourself stupid at that point in this thread.</p>
              <p>You also tell me this:</p>
              <blockquote>

              <p>Clearly, "A is B doesn't mean B is A" have no relation at all with your comparisons of "A is B and B is not C, so A is not C?"</p>
              <p>Of course, you saved yourself in your skin later when you attempt to explain away your illogical paragraph. However, you still failed to explain how when wiki says a professor is a qualified expert, how can a professor thus be an occupation?</p>
              <p>And because you have said, "A is B doesn't mean B is A" <span style="text-decoration: underline;">means that A
                                                          contains certain characteristics which B doesn't have</span>, you nailed your
                                                          stupidity again. I'm not disagreeing with that logic, but clearly, with that logic, "a professor is a qualified expert" is an inadequate explanation of what a professor is. With your same logic, you will have nailed yourself a 2nd time on the statement that "an engineer is concerned with blah blah blah" because clearly, an engineer will also contain characteristics (or in other words, do other things) that is not included in the subset of pple concerned with blah blah blah. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">This effectively cancel all your previous logics. </span></strong></p>
              <p>You tell me what they described is for an occupation, that's why wiki states professor is an occupation. You know your logic? A may do a set of actions B, the set of actions B describes what C do, hence A is C... or... <strong>Wiki states that a professor may do { }.  You tell me that { } describes the job scopes of an occupation. Hence, wiki did state that a professor is an occupation... </strong></p>
              <p>i.e. Stupidissmart may talk lots of rubbish and may make lots of illogical statements. Talking rubbish and making illogical statements describes what a lunatic do. Hence, stupidissmart is a lunatic... ???????</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I also challenged you that what they described is also what a qualified expert can do. Thus the simple question if the qualified expert is an occupation, which you failed to answer, but divert again using a long paragraph in your game of patience and tolerance.</p>

              <p>Sigh... shows your stupidity yet again...</p>
              <p>First, I set up <strong>concrete solutions</strong> which you can <strong>easily check and verify</strong>, not giving <strong>opinions</strong> with a word of '<strong>probably</strong>'. There's also absolutely no need to consider if professors (or anyone else) really do follow what has been said on the site so that it will be true. There's no denying that the solutions could be inadequate, and I have already set up many avenues for feedback.</p>
              <p>Second, what I have done is setting up a site by someone who has been through the Sg education system for another person who is going to go through the next part of the Sg education system. This is unlike your website of someone who has most likely gone through the German education system commenting on an exam which is probably to the advantage of those from the German education system as well, and which is in my opinions not to the advantage of pple from the Sg education system.</p>
              <p>Third, I'm doing it for the sake of contributing back to society, and not for the sake or benefit of any institutions at all. I'm not employed by anyone to do this.</p>
              <p>Fourth, I do not need others to trust my website, but as I have said, the concrete solutions are there for them to check and verify, and that it is my way of contributing back to society.</p>
              <p>Fifth, everyone who access the website <strong>will know immediately </strong><strong>exactly who</strong> put up those information, the contact and the qualifications of the webmaster. Immediately, they can decide whether they want to trust, which, as stated, do not bother me if they do not in the end.</p>

              <p>I change the word "professor" to be a "teacher" here and "qualified expert" to be "man".</p>
              <p>Then the statement becomes</p>
              <p><em>a teacher is a man, how can a teacher thus be an occupation ?</em></p>
              <p>U see how ridiculous and stupid your logic is ? Then there is no such thing as occupation in tis world since I can put all the job to replace the word "teacher". I have told u before already. A "professor" is a subset of "qualified expert". However a "qualified expert" can means many other things such as a cook, an engineer, and architect, a surgeon etc. All the characteristics of professor need not be reflected in qualified expert except one. So your logic is really just sh!t. Since u like to give such stupid logic, I will have to keep a record of it and see your explanation</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>And because you have said, "A is B doesn't mean B is A" <span style="text-decoration: underline;">means that A contains certain characteristics which B doesn't have</span>, you nailed your stupidity again.

              <p>Tis is again riduculous. U make another logic error here. A is similar to B and C is similar to D. If it is found tat some characteristic of A is not similar to B, then can we conclude C has some characteristics not similar to D ? Com'on la ! The 2 r completely different items and r mutually exclusive of each other ! Wat happen to your logic ?</p>
              <blockquote>

              <p>I told u from the university they give the job scope of people as "professor" which u did not comment at all. Wiki even states tat a professor is employed by the university as a lecturer in USA.</p>
              <p>Do u know wat is the problem with u ? U r making claims based on absence of a specific word instead of the meaning and understanding of the whole passage. In the description of "professor", they never explicitly say tat professor is a man as well. So professor is not human ? Going by your logic, then we have to write "professor is a man, occupation, job, career, human, homo sapiens, wears clothes, wear shoes, can grow moustache" etc etc. Tat is only wat an incredibly stupid person can propose</p>
              <p>However if u read the passage, u can understand tat it is indeed a man since they described human activity etc. In your case of occupation, if u read it naturally and interprete normally, u can get the idea tat professor is an occupation as well since they mention job scopes, employed by the university and below tons of example of people employed by the University etc. However because u r so dumb and thick skulled, u cannot interprete and comprehend passages.</p>

              <p>Fourth, I do not need others to trust my website, but as I have said, the concrete solutions are there for them to check and verify, and that it is my way of contributing back to society.</p>
              <p>Fifth, everyone who access the website <strong>will know immediately</strong> <strong>exactly who</strong> put up those information, the contact and the qualifications of the webmaster. Immediately, they can decide whether they want to trust, which, as stated, do not bother me if they do not in the end.</p>

              <p>First, the website in the university is free for people to verify and check as well. However u simply conclude they r wrong just by doubting them and because they r against your stand. Using tis logic of concluding everyone to be wrong in website, then nothing can be trusted</p>
              <p>Second, if we make use of your logic to doubt people without reason or rhyme, u telling me u gonna make a study on bla bla can be doubted as well. Who knows u may not even study in singapore before.</p>

              <p>Let me tell u some key points tat eagle is fighting on</p>
              <p>1) he claims software engineer can just use software applications. In tis way my son who plays game is a software engineer</p>
              <p>2) He claims professor is not an occupation. He say it despite many or all universities and name cards show people refering their job as professor.</p>
              <p>3) He claims all website cannot be trusted. He had said tat TUM official website is not to be trusted, a website informing other people of their experience is not to be trusted and even wiki is not to be trusted while his claims can</p>
              <p>4) He felt the definition made by the board of professional engineer on their job to be badly defined and want to define the word for them. He think he knows their job better than the board of professional engineer</p>
              <p>5) he make logical errors such as saying ' A is similar to B and C is similar to D. If A is found to have some difference with B, then C has the same problem with D". He do not know wat is mutually exclusive.</p>
              <p>6) He make the error of saying "professor is a qualified expert and since qualified expert is not an occupation a professor is not an occupation". Using his logic, then a teacher is a man and a man is not an occupation. A teacher is not an occupation.</p>
              <p>7) he kept telling people "educating" is as important as "work". However without result to show, he cannot educate. If he cannot repair the machine, he cannot educate. If he cannot find the source of problem he cannot educate. He refused to comment on tis point.</p>
              <p>8) he had made error in referencing other people claims and then insist his conclusion based on the wrong evidence. He claims I make 2500 when I never specifically mentioned tis and he have to apologise for it</p>
              <p>I can keep going on and on u know of the many blunders u had made u know</p>

              <p>Ok lor fine. Then I am not gonna end the discussion and lets see
                              who ends up speechless first.</p>
              <p>Since u r so keen on discussion, the point I wanna discuss is on
                              why u think I have a limited view and your rationale for doing so.
                              Since u r so confident of your points in the discussion, surely u
                              can continue.</p>
              <p>BTW I can retract my statement on u even though I think u r
                              still the most stupid person in tis forum. However I can
                              keep tis sort of flaming incendiary comments in my heart and
                              refrain from shooting them out simply because it is an
                              unfair statement to make unless i am really sure who is he. U
                              have shown yourself to shoot yourself in the foot by sending out 2
                              apologies to me on conclusions u have set without verification.
                              Lets see if u will continue here</p>
              <p>It is already written. Too bad u fail to see it. I think u r
                              avoiding the many issues which u cannot answer at all. I can write
                              my summary as well</p>
              <p>Stupid answer ? Tat is really the whole problem u see. U just
                              throw your propaganda without even listening. u refuse to hear
                              other people point and when u cannot answer, attempt to ask a
                              totally irrelevant question and when I answered it, u just ask
                              another irrelevant question or repeat the same old question again.
                              U think tat is discussion ?</p>
              <p>First, u cannot come out with any examples. Second, i have given
                              u the rationale why an example cannot show anything and u refuse to
                              comment on tis point. Third, i have never told u before just an
                              example can refute the whole definition of wiki, dictionary or
                              board of professional engineer. However U refuse to comment on it
                              and just repeat</p>
              <p>Tis is ridiculous u know. Who says engineering cannot be fun ?
                              If engineering can be fun, u can write the statement "engineering
                              is fun" without a problem. I think u r having confusion with the
                              word probably. U ask me wat is probably and I answered u the
                              question. However u simply refuse to say your punchline or anything
                              despite me answering u multiple times</p>
              <p>I have given u tons of evidence tat shows why professor is an
                              occupation in the paragraph and tat is why I can justify my
                              conclusion. However there is not a shred of evidence tat point your
                              above conclusion. Why don't u say</p>
              <p>"because no one wrote tat sweeping is an equally important skill
                              for engineer means it is not important"</p>
              <p>or a million kind of action into the line. U knwo who is the
                              retard here ? U</p>
              <p>I think it is more like u got the whole idea wrong in the first
                              case and attempt to make a big hoo haa out of it. I have given u an
                              example how ridiculous and stupid your statement</p>
              <p><em>a professor is a qualified expert, how can a professor thus
                              be an occupation</em></p>
              <p>I change the word "professor" to be a "teacher" here and
                              "qualified expert" to be "man".</p>
              <p>Then the statement becomes</p>
              <p><em>a teacher is a man, how can a teacher thus be an
                              occupation ?</em></p>
              <p>U see how ridiculous and stupid your logic is ? Then there is no
                              such thing as occupation in tis world since I can put all the job
                              to replace the word "teacher". I have told u before already. A
                              "professor" is a subset of "qualified expert". However a "qualified
                              expert" can means many other things such as a cook, an engineer,
                              and architect, a surgeon etc. All the characteristics of professor
                              need not be reflected in qualified expert except one. So your logic
                              is really just sh!t. Since u like to give such stupid logic, I will
                              have to keep a record of it and see your explanation</p>
              <p>Tis is again riduculous. U make another logic error here. A is
                              similar to B and C is similar to D. If it is found tat
                              some characteristic of A is not similar to B, then can we
                              conclude C has some characteristics not similar to D ? Com'on la !
                              The 2 r completely different items and r mutually exclusive of each
                              other ! Wat happen to your logic ?</p>
              <p>I told u from the university they give the job scope of people
                              as "professor" which u did not comment at all. Wiki even states tat
                              a professor is employed by the university as a lecturer in USA.</p>
              <p>Do u know wat is the problem with u ? U r making claims based on
                              absence of a specific word instead of the meaning and understanding
                              of the whole passage. In the description of "professor", they never
                              explicitly say tat professor is a man as well. So professor is not
                              human ? Going by your logic, then we have to write "professor is a
                              man, occupation, job, career, human, homo sapiens, wears clothes,
                              wear shoes, can grow moustache" etc etc. Tat is only wat an
                              incredibly stupid person can propose</p>
              <p>However if u read the passage, u can understand tat it is indeed
                              a man since they described human activity etc. In your case of
                              occupation, if u read it naturally and interprete normally, u can
                              get the idea tat professor is an occupation as well since they
                              mention job scopes, employed by the university and below tons of
                              example of people employed by the University etc. However because u
                              r so dumb and thick skulled, u cannot interprete and
                              comprehend passages.</p>
              <p>First, the website in the university is free for people to
                              verify and check as well. However u simply conclude they r
                              wrong just by doubting them and because they r against your
                              stand. Using tis logic of concluding everyone to be wrong in
                              website, then nothing can be trusted</p>
              <p>Second, if we make use of your logic to doubt people
                              without reason or rhyme, u telling me u gonna make a
                              study on bla bla can be doubted as well. Who knows u may not
                              even study in singapore before.</p>
              <p>Third, u tell u u r gonna do it to benefit society can be
                              doubted as well. Who knows  u do not have some secret worms or
                              virus in your website whereby u can leech money from unsuspecting
                              people ? U do not trust website, why should people trust yours
                              ?</p>
              <p>Fourth, u need people to trust your words somewhere otherwise
                              all the content is rubbish. Wat evidence can u show ? Pictures can
                              be photoshoped, website cannot be trusted and physical evidence is
                              too hard to verify. So how to verify and check as u claim it ?</p>
              <p>Fifth, who knows u ? U think your reputation is better than
                              some institute like a top five university in germany ? U can
                              even doubt their words, why should we trust yours ? If nobody trust
                              wat u wrote, then why bother forming a website ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>BTW, wat happened to the rest of your arguments ? I am waiting
                              for your reply to them. I don't see those points as lesser than
                              your selected biased few. Please do reply and keep the discussion
                              going. Tis is your objective and I can continue it the way u want

                                                      clearly, with that logic, "a professor is a qualified expert" is an

              <p>Realise that you are twisting words yet again. In no way did the logic I stated used the word similar. <strong>A is similar to B is different from A is B.</strong></p>

              <p>And you are yet again taking a different logic again. Sure, A&amp;B and C&amp;D are mutually exclusive; you don't conclude the relationship between C &amp; D because of A &amp; B. But that's not what was done here at all.</p>
              <p>Let me state to you in a way that your stupid brain can analyse:</p>

              <p>What rubbish again. Your logic is already wrong, as pointed out when you said that from A is B doesn't mean B is A means A contains characteristics, it merely means that the statement
                                                      that "an engineer is concerned with blah blah blah" because
                                                      clearly, an engineer will also contain characteristics (or in other
                                                      words, do other things) that is not included in the subset of pple

                                                      even doubt their words, why should we trust yours ? If nobody trust
                                                      wat u wrote, then why bother forming a website ?</p>

              <p>Till now, you still cannot tell me what gives the webmaster the qualifications to assure you that it is definitely true?</p>
              <p>As I have already said in point 4, I do not need them to trust. They have the right to judge from the full content. And again, they can do that easily because it is concrete solutions in which they can easily check and verify all by themselves, <strong>first-hand</strong>.</p>

              <p>Tis is ridiculous u know. Who says engineering cannot be fun ?
                                                      If engineering can be fun, u can write the statement "engineering
                                                      is fun" without a problem. I think u r having confusion with the
                                                      word probably. U ask me wat is probably and I answered u the
                                                      question. However u simply refuse to say your punchline or anything
                                                      despite me answering u multiple times</p>

              <p>Note that you still cannot tell me engineering is definitely fun because NUS website states so.</p>
              <p>Now you are telling me I'm wrong because TUD website states that it is probably so.</p>
              <p>Either you are confused with words, or you are still practicing double standards.</p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>Let me tell u some key points tat eagle is fighting on</p>
              <p>1) he claims software engineer can just use software
                                          applications. In tis way my son who plays game is a software
                                          engineer</p>
              <p>2) He claims professor is not an occupation. He say it despite
                                          many or all universities and name cards show people refering their
                                          job as professor.</p>
              <p>3) He claims all website cannot be trusted. He had said tat TUM
                                          official website is not to be trusted, a website informing other
                                          people of their experience is not to be trusted and even wiki
                                          is not to be trusted while his claims can</p>
              <p>4) He felt the definition made by the board of professional
                                          engineer on their job to be badly defined and want to define the
                                          word for them. He think he knows their job better than the board of
                                          professional engineer</p>
              <p>5) he make logical errors such as saying ' A is similar to B and
                                          C is similar to D. If A is found to have some difference with B,
                                          then C has the same problem with D". He do not know wat is mutually
                                          exclusive.</p>
              <p>6) He make the error of saying "professor is a qualified expert
                                          and since qualified expert is not an occupation a professor is not
                                          an occupation". Using his logic, then a teacher is a man and a man
                                          is not an occupation. A teacher is not an occupation.</p>
              <p>7) he kept telling people "educating" is as important as "work".
                                          However without result to show, he cannot educate. If he cannot
                                          repair the machine, he cannot educate. If he cannot find the source
                                          of problem he cannot educate. He refused to comment on tis
                                          point.</p>
              <p>8) he had made error in referencing other people claims and then
                                          insist his conclusion based on the wrong evidence. He claims I make
                                          2500 when I never specifically mentioned tis and he have to
                                          apologise for it</p>
              <p>I can keep going on and on u know of the many blunders u had
                                          made u know</p>

              <p>You do realise your logic is all haywired, and you have clearly put many words into my mouth, and twisted almost everything to a different meaning from what I have implied.</p>
              <p>Why don't you prove all the 8 points you have said by quotations? <strong>Because especially for points 5 and 6, <span style="color: #ff0000;">those were from you, not me. Don't go and take your stupid logics and fallacies and put it into my mouth. <br></span></strong></p>
              <p>Somehow, you are twisting words (yet again) and logics (wrongly) to suit your arguments, because it is already clear your arguments are weak.</p>
              <p>And for other points, it was from your own misunderstanding (yet again).</p>
              <p><strong>I challenge you to prove <span style="color: #888888;">all</span> </strong><strong>8 points, else you are merely talking rubbish and putting words into my mouth.</strong></p>
              <p>Do keep going on and on on the "blunders", because it really shows how you like to misinterpret things and put words and logics into my mouth when it was not stated.</p>
              <p>Somehow, especially for points 5 and 6 again, you are saying 100% of your blunders to me. Wtf? <strong>You are the one who said those, then now you tell me I said it?????</strong></p>
              <p>But glad you admit what you said was illogical.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Even for point 7, I have already told you, that without education, how are you going to spread your research knowledge to benefit others? You failed to reply, but instead gave an invalid example of military research in which one would still need to educate, and which is important because it is needed to spread to others for national defence.</strong></p>
