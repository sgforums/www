              <p>Since u want to play tis game, then fine la. SO u claim do not do any wrong, NEITHER DO I ? U cannot prove "tat" refers to your statement and to my statement as well.

So which one do u wanna choose ?</p>
              <p>If i am not wrong, u started off tis whole thing claiming "someone" make a calculation error. Then u r probably mentioning someone else isn't it because it cannot be me</p>

              <p>I think u totally mistaken the word "generally". It means the things tat do nto follow the law stated by wikipedia do be so statistically insignificant tat it is virtually ridiculous to point it out. Instead of listening to my explanation, u make it a big hoo haa and conclude tat the society of professional engineer do not know their job. Why don't u read the below analogy for a better understanding</p>
              <blockquote>

              <p>Let me give a better explanation of wat happen</p>
              <p>Me: The MORE IMPORTANT use of the eye is to see things</p>
              <p>You: You have a limited view</p>
              <p>Me: Why do u say tat ? Even encyclopedia also stated tat the eye is more important for human to see thing</p>
              <p>You: No no no .. the eye can be use for other extraordinary things... like seeing the traffic lights and crossing the road</p>
              <p>Me: Tat is using the eye for seeing</p>
              <p>You: Like watching TV</p>
              <p>Me: Tat is still using eye for seeing</p>
              <p>You: Well ! U can use your eye to push thumbtacks in !</p>
              <p>Me: .... Com'on la... generally speaking an eye is to see things.</p>
              <p>You: Ah ah ah... u use the word "generally". So u r wrong about the use of an eye and the explanation from encyclopedia is nonsense</p>
              <p>Me: Huh ?!?! Is it wrong for the encyclopedia to say the eye is for seeing thing ? If u insist all the freak cases in tis world is included, like using your eye for pushing thumbtacks, then u r just trying to be stupid and ridiculous</p>
              <blockquote>

              </blockquote>
              <p>If a person do photoshop to make complicated design, he is a GRAPHIC DESIGNER. Do I have to repeat tis simple fact for u ? Why can't a team include a graphic designer ? As said, u r abusing the word "generally". U better get the right idea first</p>

              <p>I have asked you if there are any Professional Engineers for the field of research, and your reply implied no.

              <p>R u reading my reply at all ? I said tis before which u chose to be quiet over</p>
              <p><em>The National Society of Professional Engineers (NSPE) is the national society of <strong>engineering professionals from all disciplines</strong> that promotes the ethical and competent practice of engineering, promotes licensure and enhances the image and well-being of its members.</em></p>
              <p>and if u look at their website, they r talking about research and publishing research material</p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.nspe.org/PEmagazine/pe_0408_Earthshaking_Rsearch.html">http://www.nspe.org/PEmagazine/pe_0408_Earthshaking_Rsearch.html</a></p>
              <p>Instead of looking at wat the society represent, u chose to see the word "professional engineer". Even if u see the word, it doesn't mean they exclude research out. Why can;t an engineer researching and building up a component stamp his sign ? U see the word "study", "design" and "analysis". Why can't a researcher do tis ?</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>I have already told you the job scope. Why do the job scopes differ from those listed in wiki????

Anything wrong with that????</strong></span></span> <strong>Obviously yes to you when you stated with conviction that the main job of an engineer is to come out with solutions</strong></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Wat is different ? U show one job and it do list out he got to do engineering. Then wat is wrong ? He do engineering and he is an engineer and I really don't see wat u r driving at. Even in the requirement he requires someone with an engineering background. <strong>If he cannot help his customers in technical issue, then wat good is he ?</strong> <strong>If engineering is not important, why don't he chose any other profession making the whole cost cheaper ?</strong> Why don't they just find a sales man ?</p>
              <p>And u still fail your english at PSLE level since u do not know the definition of words, u need me to spoonfeed u on how to interprete certain phases on the definition.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><span style="TEXT-DECORATION: underline">I'm asking you how providing engineering service is the <strong>same</strong> as developing solutions.

              <p>Let me give a better explanation of wat happen</p>
              <p>Me: The MORE IMPORTANT use of the eye is to see things</p>
              <p>You: You have a limited view</p>
              <p>Me: Why do u say tat ? Even encyclopedia also stated tat the eye
                                                      is more important for human to see thing</p>
              <p>You: No no no .. the eye can be use for other extraordinary
                                                      things... like seeing the traffic lights and crossing the road</p>
              <p>Me: Tat is using the eye for seeing</p>
              <p>You: Like watching TV</p>
              <p>Me: Tat is still using eye for seeing</p>
              <p>You: Well ! U can use your eye to push thumbtacks in !</p>
              <p>Me: .... Com'on la... generally speaking an eye is to see
                                                      things.</p>
              <p>You: Ah ah ah... u use the word "generally". So u r wrong about
                                                      the use of an eye and the explanation from encyclopedia is
                                                      nonsense</p>
              <p>Me: Huh ?!?! Is it wrong for the encyclopedia to say the eye is
                                                      for seeing thing ? If u insist all the freak cases in tis
                                                      world is included, like using your eye for pushing thumbtacks, then
                                                      u r just trying to be stupid and ridiculous</p>
              <p>If a person do photoshop to make complicated design, he is a
                                                      GRAPHIC DESIGNER. Do I have to repeat tis simple fact for u ? Why
                                                      can't a team include a graphic designer ? As said, u r abusing the
                                                      word "generally". U better get the right idea first</p>
              <p>R u reading my reply at all ? I said tis before which u chose to
                                                      be quiet over</p>
              <p><em>The National Society of Professional Engineers (NSPE) is the

                                                      the word "professional engineer". Even if u see the word, it
                                                      doesn't mean they exclude research out. Why can;t an engineer
                                                      researching and building up a component stamp his sign ? U see the
                                                      word "study", "design" and "analysis". Why can't a researcher do

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>A MisMatch Made in Peasant</strong> <br>The government is worried that Singaporeans are not getting hitched - there are increasing number of singles in Singapore. The government is offering a slew of incentives, and even advice on how to date, how to get married, but I doubt it will work. The problem I think is because these measures target the symptoms and not the cause of the problem; in my opinion, the root of the problem lies in the minds of peasantboys and peasantgirls.<br><br>Singaporean peasantboys are one of the most boring members of the adult male species - dating them is often a somniferous experience. Ever notice that the only topic of conversation that excites them, other than their jobs, is National Service? Yes we really want to hear about your days in the army, crawling through mud, or gory tales of training accidents - that really gets our loins burning. The added irony is that despite their macho tales, most peasantboys are mummy's boys - what self-respecting man would continue staying with his parents till the late 20's and even early 30's , letting his mum cook, clean and wash for him? Real women want to date grown up men, not little boys staying at home.<br><br>Peasantboys are also wimps - they let peasantgirls walk all over them. They act as their chauffer, their ATM machine and chaperone all rolled into one. Yet, in another ironic twist, they are also male chauvinists, hanging on to anachronistic notions of submissve virginal women who would do as they are told and go off looking for Vietnamese village brides when they don't get what they want here. A message for you peasantboys: most women would love to defer to their men, but strong men who know what they want, who have strength of character. We are not going to submit ourselves to wimpy mummy's boys.<br><br>Peasantgirls are not any better - they suffer from the 'I want the cake and eat it syndrome'. Singaporean women want the rights of Western Women and none of the obligations. They also want all the rights of Eastern Women and none of their obligations either.<br><br>If you want to be treated as an equal - behave like an equal. Don't expect your man to pay for everything and not even thank them for it. Go dutch sometimes. Take a taxi to the place that you are going to meet your peasantboy and not expect to be driven around like an invalid all the time. If you want to be an equal in marriage, contribute equally to the family accounts - in what world do you think it's fair that you get to spend your husband's money whilst keeping your salary for yourselves?<br><br>On the other hand, if you want to be treated like an Eastern Woman, for the husband to take care of you financially, materially, drive you around, do things for you then be prepared to take on the obligations of an Eastern Woman. Go learn how to cook - and not just instant noodels and fried eggs. Learn how to sew. Defer to your husband as the head of the household, and learn how to care for him as the primary caregiver (whilst he is the primary breadwinner).<br><br>Neither Western or Eastern Woman is superior; however the Singapore Peasantwoman who wants the best of both worlds is definitely inferior. Make up your mind - choose one or the other. Even Peasantboys wake up one day when they have been screwed over in a bad deal for too long.<br><br>So the problem as I see it is that the Peasantboy and the Peasantgirl are fudamentally a bad match, to the extent that they probably hate the sight of each other. Peasantboys complain about Peasantgirls all the time, Peasantgirls whinge about Peasantboys, and neither the twain shall meet.<br><br>Therefore, until the mindsets of peasantboys and peasantgirls are changed, no amount of economic incentives or nagging by the government will turn things around.<br><br>The illnesses of the peasant are of the mind, and unless it's cured, it's probably better they don't get together and procreate.</span></p>

              <p>My example is totally valid. In fact u canot find any loophole in the example and u can only make a claim which is unsubstantiated. I already say tat the definition is supposed to work for the "general" case and not freak cases and my examples do clarify tat stand. Up till not, u did not show me any examples or engineers tat remove the skill of solving practical examples as unnecessary. The example u given also states they need people who can solve engineering problem</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Not only that. I gave you job scopes of real-life engineers (product, software).

              <p>I think u miss the whole point of th argument. When u talk about software engineers, u tell me they use programs and not do ANY programming at all and even challenge me on tis point. True or false ? Only when i show u the definition of the job then u realise tat software engineers has to do programming and your work is merely on graphis designer. When u talk about product engineers, again u show your limited view by claiming they do not do engineering by looking at chips and finding the source of problems. Again I have to guide u to say tat looking at chips and finding the source of problems is engineering and they r solving practical problems. Do u knwo wat is the problem ? U do not know wat is engineering</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Still evading a question. The main point here is not whether the team can include a graphic designer. Of course they can. The main point is:</p>

              <p>I think u r really lame here. Of course there can be a graphic designer in a team or a coffee lady or a secretary or a technician or a sweeper or a machinist in the team.

              <p>To answer your question, no u do not need a seal to publish a reseach paper but tis point is out of meaning because it doesn't mean research engineer r not professional engineers.

              <p>I think tis is again stupid. If he cannot do engineer can he be a sales engineer ? No. So it is important for him to be an engineer in order to get the job. Even the requirement is stated as such. And remember the earlier statement I made. The MORE important skill. It is not the ONLY skill. U cannot prove my stand wrong either.</p>

              <h4>Is graduate qualifying exams the same as undergraduate courses
                                          exam ? </h4>
              <p> </p>
              <p> So ? Oral exam r still for graduate student when they r
                                          trying to defend their first/second year or thesis defence</p>
              <p>Wow. Do u have anything to show u got great knowledge of oral
                                          exams ? Nothing</p>
              <p>Wat is the logic ? I have stated clearly multiple times whichu
                                          clearly refuse to even read. U quote the number to my salary, u
                                          make the wrong quote I refer to your figure and tat is how the
                                          error appears. So wat is the logic u have used ?</p>
              <p>Then wat other EQUALLY IMPORTANT skills have u successfully
                                          stated ?</p>
              <p>I think u r missing hte original point. U askme to prove u claim
                                          writing paper is part of the equation. I proved it out isn't it and
                                          u have nothing to say on it. SO is the foot in your mouth now ?</p>
              <p>The more important skill to write a research paper is to have
                                          research result. U have already admitted to the above point before.
                                          So is it "equally" important ? Nope</p>
              <p>U just prove to fail in the comprehension of the example. It is
                                          about the stupidness of throwing away general facts because of
                                          an absurb example.</p>
              <p>There r example of people using their eyes to open beer bottles
                                          though</p>
              <p>search youttube "wickmans eye bottle opener finally works"</p>
              <p>Tis is again rubbish. The definition already stated wat is
                                          the engineer of interest. Wat r u trying to do now ? Trying to act
                                          stupid or something ? Wat do u understand from the word
                                          "definition" ? Now I know wat is the problem with your english, u
                                          do not care about definition of words ! U also claim tat the
                                          "society" does not define the word. SO wat is your answer to it ?
                                          Who defines the word engineer ? U ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Nah... u r avoiding the original question. U say tat studyng a
                                          chip and finding the problem to it is not a engineering. Wat is
                                          your comment on tis statement now ? Why do u talk about somethign
                                          totally out of point ?</p>
              <p>U r the one tat talk rubbish here ma. Look at the statement u
                                          said before.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>So why can it not be that a
                                          software engineer is engaged in only using photoshop to design
                                          complicated graphics within a software engineering team tasked to
                                          program a game?</strong></span></span></p>
              <p>The answer is: U can ask a person to <span style="color: #000000;">design complicated graphics within a software
                                          engineering team <strong>but tis guy is a graphic
                                          designer</strong>.</span></p>
              <p>If being in a team of software engineer will make u a software
                                          engineer, according to your incredibly stupid logic, then any
                                          sweeper in a software engineering firm is a software engineer. But
                                          because u r so dense, u do not know the joke is on u and ask stupid
                                          questions</p>
              <p>First, professional engineers can do research. Who say tat
                                          professional engineers cannot do any research at all ? If an
                                          engineer discover a great way to solve a practical problem,
                                          define and fine tune it and publish the result, he has done a
                                          great research for the people. U know who is nikola tesla ? He has
                                          devised a lot of theories on electricity and his job is an
                                          electrical engineer under edison</p>
              <p>However a person who do not know wat is engineering probably
                                          does not know professional engineers can do research</p>
              <p>So u r saying u r wrong about NSPE not including research and
                                          not trying to talk about another point altogether ? Wat is your
                                          answer to NSPE does not include research engineers ? Another false
                                          lie u made again ?</p>
              <p>And if u talk about NSPE "education", it is still on research
                                          and getting the research result is more important than just
                                          educating people about tis same result tat u need to get first.</p>
              <p>U only show there r other skills necessary. Surely u will know
                                          tat I can have a more important skill and hundred of other
                                          skills. </p>
              <p>It has 3 job scope but it require only engineers to apply, not
                                          business or salesmen or admin. So we should know the priority of
                                          the skills necessary.</p>

From my personal experience, I encounter a lot of hardworking Singaporeans in Singapore, but few has an independent mind and original insight into things. Our education system is built on spoon-feeding the students with information, whereas a proper education should focus on providing one with the framework to process information rather than telling you what to think.

              <p> Wat cock r u trying to say ?</p>
              <p>From the first time u stated oral exam, I already clearly told u
                                  tat thesis defense and course oral exam r totally different and u
                                  agree with me. The one tat u have listed r thesis or first year
                                  presentation. SO wat happened to your original stand ? If thesis
                                  defence is included, then NUS and NTU also got and wat u said is
                                  nothing special or different</p>
              <p>Do they say tat they have to go through oral examinations ?
                                   They r just trying to tell people they use english
                                  throughout. Furthermore oral examination may mean FYP defense and
                                  like NTU NUS, they r already present.</p>
              <p>Up till now u still cannot show the modules in MIT having to
                                  take oral examination</p>
              <p>The stupid person is the one who wanna fight
                                  with people on oral exam, call other people's view
                                  limiting and challenge people back for a long argument fight.
                                  Furthermore u cannot answer the so called "stupid" questions
                                  yourself. Maybe tat is wat u really r</p>
              <p>If u say u r not mentioning to me, how come u reply to my
                                  question, mention about my salary, quote it badly, then no one else
                                  is responding to u ? How can u justfiy all the words u said in a
                                  logical format if u r not implying me ?</p>
              <p>Wat is my logic ? U had twisted my logic out of context.</p>
              <p>U failed to understand your "education" failed to be listed as

              <p>u dishonestly switch the question to another one</p>
              <p><em>Where have you proved that writing a paper is not part of

              <p>DO NOT SWITCH THE QUESTION !</p>

              <p>U really lack a sense of imagination. It is an example, an
                                  illustration. Why do I have to show u cases of people using their
                                  eye to push things ? Without tat u cannot visualise the message
                                  behind the example ? Wow man I can really imagine how difficult it
                                  is for your teacher to teach u.  I show u examples of
                                  people using their eye to do other things other than seeing. U have
                                  a problem with tat ? Or u really lack a sense of imagination ?</p>
              <p>Do u have a problem with the word "definition" ? It is
                                  the description tat
                                  <strong>everybody can understand</strong> , it is
                                  <strong>used for explaining wat it is about</strong> and it is
                                  <strong>stated in the dictionary for all to refer to</strong>. Now
                                  u r telling me tat the definition is wrong, u do not understand
                                  when everybody else does and u wanna define it otherwise. Do u know
                                  wat does tis imply ? U r more stupid than normal people</p>
              <p>I think u r getting more and more crappy as time progresses. It
                                  is really interesting to see u trying to fight vainly against the
                                  professional of engineer board, dictionary and wikipedia on wat the
                                  engineer is about. U tell me the word depend on society to defines.
                                  Now the society includes the professional board of engineers, the
                                  school of engineer, the engineers themselves and many other people
                                  and they all give the same definition of wat an engineer is about.
                                  U think the definition is wrong, then PROVE ANOTHER DEFINITION FROM
                                  ANOTHER REPUATBLE SECTOR OF SOCIETY IN THEIR WEBSITE.</p>
              <p>U show me an ad for a sales engineering requesting people to do
                                  engineer and without giving any definition of the word engineer and
                                  tat is a proof ? Did your ad claims wat is an engineer ?</p>
              <p>U r avoiding the question. U claim tat finding the source of
                                  problem on a chip is not engineer. true or false ? SO wat do u have
                                  to say about it now ? I wanna hear an answer on tis issue u
                                  know</p>
              <p>Wa... engineer can also take up japanese as part of their
                                  module. So they r japanese ? Wat a lousy conclusion</p>
              <p>The example of sweeper in a software engineer team is a mockery
                                  of your stupid logic which u clearly r speechless over. If I use my
                                  logic, then I wouldn't make such a silly statement. However u r
                                  more stupid and come out with stupid logic and therefore a sweeper
                                  can become an engineer in tis case. U say</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>So why can it not be that a
                                  software engineer is engaged in only using photoshop to design
                                  complicated graphics within a software engineering team tasked to
                                  program a game?</strong></span></span></p>
              <p>SO using your twisted logic a sweeper can be an engineer isn't
                                  it ? COm'on tell me la ! I will keep harping on tis point
                                  till u either apologise and put your foot into your mouth by u
                                  claiming u made a stupid conclusion.</p>
              <p>Tis is another stupid thing u have said. Lets put is in
                                  simple logic for u. NSPE have researchers in their ranks. True or
                                  false. Instead of beating around the bush and talking about crappy
                                  items, why not answer to the point instead. And a reminder for u
                                  below</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Then u ask a stupid question on</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><em>Is it
                                  legally required to have a PE signature, seal and stamp for a

              <p>Why do u put it there ? Why do u refuse to answer tis same
                                  question repeatedly ? Because it had proved u made the wrong stand
                                  on obtaining signatures ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I can answer u but will u answer me ? U just feign ignornace and
                                  refuse to answer questions asked repeatedly. NSPE publish reseach
                                  papers. True.</p>
              <p>Let me ask u back. To publish a reseach paper, u need to have
                                  research result. And tat is the more important skill because
                                  without results u cannot publish anything. Wat is your answer to it
                                  ? Why ? Your balls dropped off ? Why r u not answering questions I
                                  posed ?</p>
              <p>Because they require a person trained in engineer for the
                                  job, not a sales person or a business person or an admin person. I
                                  have told u tis multiples times.</p>
              <p>Really ? Show me when have I said tat the definition of
                                  professor is inadequate. I really cannot remember such incident had
                                  happened and want my memories refreshed.</p>
              <p>And wat about the statement below ? WHy r u speechless over it
                                  ?</p>
              <p><em>as said before, u demand changes to be made to it regardless
                                  of whether u think it is wrong or inadequate. Logically
                                  speaking, it can only be inadequate only if it is wrong on some
                                  area.</em></p>
              <p>So am i wrong to use the word "wrong" here ? If not, then u
                                  surely have to apologise for framing me isn;t it ?</p>
              <p>Inadequate means it is wrong in some areas and u wanna correct

              <p>I told you there's no professional engineer for research engineering. I asked you that question to confirm you do indeed agree with the previous sentence, because somehow, you keep disagreeing with it. <strong>Or rather, you continue to misunderstand it by thinking that I said professional engineers cannot do research.</strong></p>
