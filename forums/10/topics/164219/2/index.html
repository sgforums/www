            <div class='col-md body'>The law does provide for imprisonment but the judge only fined him. In fact, this S.O.B wrote in to the authorities to inform them his intention to return. Seems to me THEY DID A BACKROOM DEAL! The coward came back knowing that they will not imprison him....that's why he did not dare to return all these years.<br><br>But now he is elite...and elites are a law unto themselves...<br><br>The great Singapore justice system! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>
