            <div class='col-md body'><br>I tend to agree with the view that the authorities were specially lenient to him (did not give him maximum penalty for his defiance) based on his current "talent" status - that with his art talent and fame, he could contribute significantly to enhancing the arts hub in Singapore. If he knew they were going to punish him severely, he's prepared not to return and they knowingly know they would lose a valuable talent.<br><br>The point of this example is talent is more valuable and recognised than NS and the state is prepared to draw in talent at the expense of non-NS.<br><br>So I strongly don't object to parents sending their kids overseas to acquire highly-valued talent and be famous without going thru lowly-valued NS.<br><br>Parents, plan and do it for your child's sake. Let him be somebody, a highly-valued person. He can make it big anywhere. If you do it for NS sake which makes him a nobody, everyone (including the state) will just step all over him, a lowly-valued so-called talent.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br></div>
