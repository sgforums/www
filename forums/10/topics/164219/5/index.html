            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by jeevna:<br><strong><br><br>An alternative view: Perhaps it wasnt so much a decision to run away from NS as to develop his talent? Is that so unlikely? What if there was no way he could have developed his talent while serving NS here, or if the enforced break while serving NS meant that he could never go back to music at that level. Would that make a difference? Would that not have deprived the world of a top musical talent? Would that have been better, purely because it would have appeased some? [b]After all, parity means equality on both sides. Let's compare like with like.</strong> How many others with that top talent or the promise of becoming a top talent are presently serving? or have served?[/b]</blockquote>In the same line of argument, we should then abolish NS and fly all out Singaporean man. Perhaps, we who then have a greater number of talented musicians, artisites, engineers, scientists etc etc...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree with one of the guys who said that people who AWOL had to go DB and all Melvyn got was a fine. That's life, life is unfair. If these guys had the money, they probably won't end up in such plights. Money talks, connections talk... in this meritocratic society.<br><br>I was wondering what kind of effect this negative publicity will do to his performances in Singapore. Maybe arty-farty people won't care about his past, but man, just imagine the money he's making.<br><br>Perhaps, ordinary guys will think twice about going. The irony is, there are actually discounts for NSFs.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>Look on the bright side, if Singapore had spent the money training him, I'm sure he may be on the first flight out of Singapore should a war occur.
