If you track the publicity / reports on him, he appears to be consistently referred to as "Singapore-born". That would be unusual without consistent input from him. So out the window goes your implication that just because he gave up his citizenship he has severed all links with Singapore. Really, your point is no point at all. Why don't you focus on why coming to judge at the music competition was not community service? That might be worth a discussion.</div>
