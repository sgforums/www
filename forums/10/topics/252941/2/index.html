Unfortunately, it refused to recognise its role, as the cabinet ministers (or their spouses on their behalf) are known to be dabbling in the property market as well. Even in the USA, the Federal Reserves and the Government will work in tandem to ensure that property prices are stable and will use the Bank Interest Rates to moderate the market and prevent speculative inflation.<br><br>What has our government done ?<br><br>In a PriceWaterhouseCoopers 2004 report - (after the last crash in 2002), it mentioned that ''Singapore's GDP per capita of USD24,560 in FY2004 is among the highest in the world, which should put them amongst citizens with the highest buying power. However, the level of personal disposable income is actually lower than perceived due to the high level of indebtedness.''<br><br>The report also quote the Singapore Department of Statistcs 2002 Survey that ''the average Singapore household is one of the most indebted in the world. Household debt, as a percentage of personal disposable income, stood at 174% in 2000, higher than countries such as Britain (116%), Japan (100%), and the US (90%). This is due to people chalking up huge amounts for car ownership, private property and club membership. The number of personal bankruptcies has continually reached records levels in recent years.''.<br><br>With a car control policy that encourages cars to be scrapped at zero values, and to be changed every ten years; PLUS the high import duties imposed even as other means have already brought car population under control - this only accentuate the debt problem for Singaporeans. Transportation absorb 21% of Singaporean disposable income.<br><br>Housing costs could have been made more reasonable without taking away all that Singaporeans have in their CPF, as well as absorbing 22% of their disposable income for housing.<br><br>Food is another big ticket item that absorb 21% of the disposable income - with the cost for all these three items being under the direct influence of the Government, whose GLC linked companies have a near monopoly in providing these services, and ringing in bumper profits.<br></span><br></div></blockquote>So you are blaming high property price as a cause for making singaporeans indebted for life, and you link that as a reason for the high bankruptcy rate during the last reccession, BUT you are not against the government and their housing policy?<br><br>You are quoting a report which was made in 2004 which focus on our economy in 2003, which happen to be the peak of the worst recession in Singapore history, thanks to SARS which started from end 2002 throughout 2003. I am sure there are plenty of reports highlighting the state of our economy right now, you might as well read it first before asking what our government has done over the last few years.<br><br>I am surprise that you have actually highlighted the high level of indebtedness of Singaporeans in 2003, especially from someone who is against property boom.<br><br>I thought that a rise in property price will help home owner who were caught in last recession to get out of debt (though downsizing of property and refinancing) faster.<br><br></div>

I would do that. If I cannot rid myself of a worker that cannot perform, I would be less likely to employ. That is the reason why the French government tried to make it easier for employers to fire young workers. The rigid employment policy there has resulted in the one of highest unemployment rates in the EU <strong>despite</strong> a flourishing global economy.<br><br><blockquote>Instead of wooing the Super-Rich, why is this Government not helping to create wealthy Singaporeans instead - in a similar way that politics and the laws are drafted in Switzerland that creates and protect the wealth of Swiss Citizens ? </blockquote>Protectionism does not work. Singapore has succeeded through globalisation and we will continue to prosper through the free movement of labour and capital. Protecting the interests of the bumiputras in Malaysia has not worked, even Mahatir admits that.<br><br><blockquote>With the large amount of money spent on reclaiming land from the sea and designated as the New Marina - Downtown Financial District - do you think that the Singapore Government will build low cost HDB units there</blockquote>Only you will think of such a daft way to waste money. High asset value individuals bring in jobs and create wealth for local Singaporeans. Monaco has very little in terms of manufacturing but is wealthy by promoting itself as the playground for the rich and famous.<br><br><blockquote>Who has paid for the massive amount spent on land reclamation, and who will be paying for the multi-dolloar spent on infrastructure that include new MRT lines, roads, and utilities ? </blockquote>Who gets to enjoy most the efficient public transport and excellent infrastructure in Singapore?<br><br><blockquote> a MP was quoted as saying ''I see the two main drivers to this : (1) the nature of work is fast moving away from full-time employment to a contract-based and flexi-time model.... '' </blockquote>A flexible wage system encourages employment. As France has demonstrated to us in recent years, the more rigid the system is to try and protect jobs, the less willing employers will be to employ and more unemployment results.<br><br>Initial contract jobs enables employers to assess if the worker can make it. For the worker who is in demand, it does not matter. My employer offers me permanent employment but I reject it for a yearly contract, so that I can negotiate my salary yearly and the notice period is shorter.<br><br>It does not matter whether you have a permanent or yearly contract, as long as your skills are in demand.<br><br><blockquote>Why do you think that this Government is allowing Sentosa Island and the old Keppel Shipyard to be developed into a World Class Private Housing with marinas that allow their yatchs to be moored next to their homes ?<br><br>With the IR and these Up-Market Developments, the Government had declared that Singapore shall be the next Monaco to be a playground for the Rich and Famous. </blockquote>They are the ones who employ Singaporeans. They are the ones who pay the most taxes (and only 40% of Singaporeans pay any taxes at all). They are the ones who will create the buzz that attracts more high asset value individuals like themselves. Having them here will benefit more Singaporeans.</div>

(That to me a obsolute rubbish)<br><br>My intention was never to waste me time to convince you that Singapore government is good, all I want  is to highlight how negative and senseless a crybaby you are.<br></strong></blockquote><span style="color: darkred;">I suppose you got rich being employed with a low salary compared to the government's high wages for the Civil Servants - and of course the Cabinet Minister's wages ?<br><br>Yes, did you also make a whopper of runaway profit from the stock market ?<br><br>Of course, you did recover your wealth from the booming property market, and got your million dollar back from the last stupidity in buying your home at a silly high price - did you ? Now that you have sold your home for a Million Dollars, did you recover enough to cover the interest paid since you bought your home during the last property boom in 1986 ? Did you happen to calculate the interests that you would have accumulated - over the entire period - on your property that you purchased at the peak of the last property boom ?<br><br>Meanwhile, I suppose you are going to trouble your parents or siblings while you wait for the property boom to go bust and buy another home ? Surely, you are not going to be stupid to buy another home NOW, when the property market is RED HOT ?<br><br>Boy, you can be brilliant, when you can fall for duds ?<br><br>Is the F-1 coming to my feet ? Should I be thrilled ? Yes, Singaporeans will get to participate in the F-1, and compete with new F-1 king ? Or is the Singapore Pools going to rake in more of your money that a dumb mind will throw in speculating the likely winner of the First F-1 race in Singapore ?<br><br>Yes, how thrilling to see a Super Priced Entry ticket to see the Singapore F-1 with all the empty seats that the Malaysian F-1 and nearly all other F-1 circuits are currently experiencing.<br><br>Did the STPB mention that Singapore will get to absorb $100 Million from tourist arrival for this F-1 event alone ? I wonder where will all the money end up besides the pocket of Mr Ong Beng Seng and the Singapore Government ?<br><br>Will any of the $100 Million dollar go into your account to boost your wages, perhaps help you recover more to cover your interests.<br><br>Is there anything to whine about the F-1, when all that need to be whined was done since the last Motor Racing Grand Prix was banned by the arrogance of an "I-Know-All" LKY ?<br><br>It will be a joke when the day come when we see a wounded Gazelle whining about the inconvenience of heading into downtown to work the night shift, as the cordon is placed to have the F-1 event held; and an 8 hour night shift will need to be extended as one has to clock in earlier before the city is shut off.<br><br>Then again, the wounded Gazelle will of course maintain an elegant wounded pride by diligently remaining loyal, while hoping to find more scraps being swept onto the floor, so that he can find some morselss to fill a pathetic skin and bone body of an incapacitated Gazelle.<br><br>Yes, afterall, a Gazelle will always know what it naturally can do best is with its herd instinct to maintain self-survival, stay sharp in a group, and let the weakest fall to be devoured, while the rest survive for another day.<br><br>Yes, look after yourself - in the same manner as your Pet Asian Poodles - as you have learnt well from their actions, thinking only for yourself, but unable to think for the general good.<br><br>''Obsolete rubbish'' ??  You seem quite obsolete with all the propaganda rubbish that you have been able to swallow and spout with a twist. </span><br><br></div>
