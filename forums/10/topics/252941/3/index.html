Hence, if you concur that gaming taxes are actually higher than most other consumer taxes, would it not make sense to suggest a large chunk of money that goes into the fascists' coffers would actually come from the gaming revenue?<br><br>Then again, I suppose you'd be almost ignorant to just about everything the fascist propaganda doesn't feed you with. So, once again, using your trusted Wikipedia source, let me show you some misguided drivel you've been fed with that actually convinces you that LV Sands' operations here is the <strong>MOST</strong> expensive IR in the world.<br><br>Referring to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_Resort , LV Sands' <strong>development investment</strong> in Singapore would work out to an estimated <strong>SGD3.85 billion</strong>. After factoring in the cost of land, that'd take their total investment to just over SGD5 billion.<br><br>Echelon Place (referring to your beloved Wikipedia : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echelon_Place ), alone, would cost <strong>USD4 billion</strong> to construct and that investment does not cover the cost of land on which the complex will be erected.<br><br>You aren't telling me now SGD1=USD1, are you? It's not rocket science to work out USD4 billion actually dwarfs SGD3.85 billion? For the record, Echelon Place isn't even the most expensive casino resort that will ever be constructed - there's something bigger than that in the pipeline at the moment which your fascist press has obviously not inundated you with for fear of realising your innermost fears that they aren't exactly competent enough to be no.1 at everything.<br><br>Now, surely, the fascists wouldn't highlight such misguided and less-than-flattering statistics to mislead ignorant folks like you, would they? It is indeed admirable, given your stupidity, to be making an ardent case founded on utopian fantasy...</div>

Hence, if you concur that gaming taxes are actually higher than most other consumer taxes, would it not make sense to suggest a large chunk of money that goes into the fascists' coffers would actually come from the gaming revenue?<br><br>Then again, I suppose you'd be almost ignorant to just about everything the fascist propaganda doesn't feed you with. So, once again, using your trusted Wikipedia source, let me show you some misguided drivel you've been fed with that actually convinces you that LV Sands' operations here is the [b]MOST</strong> expensive IR in the world.<br><br>Referring to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_Resort , LV Sands' <strong>development investment</strong> in Singapore would work out to an estimated <strong>SGD3.85 billion</strong>. After factoring in the cost of land, that'd take their total investment to just over SGD5 billion.<br><br>Echelon Place (referring to your beloved Wikipedia : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echelon_Place ), alone, would cost <strong>USD4 billion</strong> to construct and that investment does not cover the cost of land on which the complex will be erected.<br><br>You aren't telling me now SGD1=USD1, are you? It's not rocket science to work out USD4 billion actually dwarfs SGD3.85 billion? For the record, Echelon Place isn't even the most expensive casino resort that will ever be constructed - there's something bigger than that in the pipeline at the moment which your fascist press has obviously not inundated you with for fear of realising your innermost fears that they aren't exactly competent enough to be no.1 at everything.<br><br>Now, surely, the fascists wouldn't highlight such misguided and less-than-flattering statistics to mislead ignorant folks like you, would they? It is indeed admirable, given your stupidity, to be making an ardent case founded on utopian fantasy...[/b]</blockquote>a) I suppose you are not aware that our government target formula for the IR is to have 30% revenue from gaming business. NOT 70%. Hence this contradict the argument that our government's main intention have having the IR is the the casino tax revenue. (IF they do, I am sure they will no limit that to just 30% isnt it?)<br><br>b) With reference to your quote from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_Resort, may I know why you have choose not to quote a sentence which goes.<span style="font-style: italic;"> <strong>With the land price and associated capital cost, its total investment will <span style="text-decoration: underline;">exceed</span> S$5 billion.

Barring ignorant pets whose survival depends on the daily dosage of fascist propaganda, it'd be hard to imagine anyone would actually find your argument remotely coherent. Let's take your silly argument at face value and analyse on that basis : <strong>so you're effectively suggesting restricting the size of the casino to 3%-5% the size of the entire IR, that would actually constitute an effective way to ensure the IR's don't make more than 30% of its revenues from gaming avenues?</strong><br><br>Have you ever set foot in a casino(and I literally mean a modern, state-of-the-art casino which has a complex of its own; not your own underground gambling den)? Have you any idea how many gaming tables are there in these casinos and how much revenue these tables generate? It's not rocket science for anyone who has set foot in such casinos to know the area of a casino hardly provides a viable reflection of how much gaming revenue the casino generates, in respect to the size of its non-gaming complex as a whole. For all the grand ideology your propaganda machine has fed you with, obviously the precedences set out by casinos in Macau, Las Vegas and Monaco will do little to boost your ailing case. Macau's gaming industry alone was worth USD3.4billion alone in 2003 - for your warped theory to hold true, I suppose we're supposed to believe LV Sands will be capable of generating some USD7.9billion on its own from its non-gaming revenues? (Should you fail to convince any sane folks, you can try selling that notion to your dog though...)<br><br>Evidently, if an ignorant mug like you should genuinely believe the gaming revenues of a casino could be curtailed based on the size on which the casino operates, you ought to get your head checked.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Gazelle:</div><div class="quote_body">Again you are showing your inability to understand what you have read.
