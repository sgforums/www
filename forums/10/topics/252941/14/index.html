I donÂ’t think it make any sense to compare a develop country to a fishing village.<br></strong><br><br>then why did you quote the price of flats 25 years ago if you're talking about the future?  you can't even be coherent with what you're saying how to make sense?<br><br><strong><br>Your concern has been, because of 1 year of 5% rise in HDB property you are anticipating that this will affect our the ability of young couple buying HDB flat in future. Hence my question to you is that, can you use 1 single point to plot a trend into the future?<br></strong><br><br>using another point that you provided, 25 years ago, i can say property prices have outpaced salaries.<br><br><strong><br>Did you know that the 100 reference point used to be a 105 sometime ago and todayÂ’s 105 point mark would be 100 marks in the future. I am wondering if you could explain, why an economy need to be aiming for 100 instead of above 100?<br></strong><br><br>given that inflation is so low, some time ago and now wouldn't make much difference to the actual value unless you're talking about 10, 20 years.  an economy should be aiming for a 100 so as to take uncertainty away from housing prices so that ordinary folks can concentrate on working and contributing to economy instead of speculating on property prices.<br><br><strong><br>Yes, I cannot understand why you say that majority of NTU grad in 2006 are accountants. Would you be kind enough to give us some datas<br></strong><br><br>then i can only say that you don't have the common sense to know that a sizeable portion of accountants would push the overall average salary upwards.  would you be so kind as to help yourself?<br><br><strong><br>I am just rebutting your claim that there are no real wage increases in Singapore, just because you prefer to exclude civil servants and people working in the financial sector. Hence what is your basis that job creation and wage increase in financial and government sectors are not important.<br></strong><br><br>your rebutt is lame.  huge salary increases for the civil service and finance industry doesn't inply salaries have increased across the board.  what is your basis that salary increases in finance and government sectors makes up for stagnation in other sectors?<br><br><strong><br>Because we want to know what F-type industry you are in so others can avoid following your foot steps.<br></strong><br><br>just tell them not to become F-type like yourself<br><br><strong><br>What I am asking is yes or no.<br></strong><br><br>i've answered.  what more do you need?<br><br><strong><br>and I donÂ’t see why having highest immigration rate is not expected from one of the fastest growing country in the past 30 to 40 years.<br></strong><br><br>our growth is normal when you compare it with say korea, taiwan and hong kong.  i don't see them as having such high immigration rates.<br><br><strong><br>You are saying that Singapore is more prosperous than the whole of China and India.<br></strong><br><br>no, i'm saying we have a much higher per capita income.<br><br><strong><br>Would you mind telling us: -<br><br>a) When was this<br>b) How much more is more.<br>c) Did you grandfather move back to cities Shanghai or HK after they made a fortune in Singapore?<br></strong><br><br>a) grandfather came around 1950s / 1960s<br>b) life was so bad that coming here to do odd job was better<br>c) granddad's time was different from ours.  throughout his life, china was much poorer than singapore (per capita basis).  china started to boom after he passed away.  so if granddad were still around, he might wish to go back and enjoy the prosperity in china's coastal cities now.<br><br><strong><br>NahÂ…there is a difference between government discounting Singaporeans and Singaporeans deserve to be discounted.<br></strong><br><br>the difference is in the perspective.  the former reflects the feelings of the masses, the latter is the attitude of the govt.<br><br><strong><br>Please donÂ’t put words into my mouth, I am discounting Singaporeans like you who thinks that the world must stop and wait for you to buy your dream home and dream car.<br></strong><br><br>i am not putting words into your mouth, you sprouted them yourselves.  "singaporeans are no big deal" was said by you, not me, i merely quoted you.  i dare you to quote me anywhere in this thread for having used the words "dream home" or "dream car" to express what i desire or intend to get.  if you can't, then we know who's the one putting words into mouths.<br></blockquote></div>

Yes or No?<br></strong><br><br>your question is dumb and not worth answering.  a smarter question is how many rich persons are required to support just one taxi driver?<br><br><strong><br>If you donÂ’t know how much shareholding Temasek has in Comfortdelgro, than how can you say that majority of the companyÂ’s earning will go to government and not other shareholders?<br></strong><br><br>how do you know i don't know?  just because you don't know doesn't mean i don't know.<br><br><strong><br>Would appreciate if you could be more specific about which piece of information you are referring to from government website.

So I would like to ask, what other factors are the same besides giving me the lame answer like Â“improving economyÂ”<br></strong><br><br>it has yet to spread to the rest of the island but it is bad enough.  it is fundamentally different from the past in the sense that this time round, the demand has been jacked up by govt import of FT.  an improving economy is probably the single most consistently important but not 'lame' factor.<br><br><strong><br>I am simply questioning your view that booms in service industry will contributes to a surge in property price and vice versa.<br></strong><br><br>and i have given my views.<br><br><strong><br>Hence I donÂ’t see why you should divert your attention to FT. Plus, unless you know how many unsold housing and unused land are left in Singapore, if not I donÂ’t see how you can make the judgment that the supply of housing in Singapore is limited.<br></strong><br><br>i did not divert attention for FT is the primary culprit for our current predicament.  the fact that there are unsold flats in jurong west simply shows that they are god foresaken corners of the island that nobody wants, so i'm still entitled to my judgement.<br><br><strong><br>I donÂ’t see a need to reply to your grandfather story.<br></strong><br><br>because you have no answer to it?  i take that as a white flag from you.<br><br><strong><br>Could you explain why there is such a drastic surge in property price in the 80s and 90s? It is because Singaporeans can anticipate the economy of Singapore 20 years in advance?<br></strong><br><br>the difference from then till now, as i've said for the unteempth time is that this time round, govt is boosting our population by 60%.  the property developers know that and they are going for the kill now.  no need to wait for 20 years.  govt announced already and we are all in the know.  where have you been all this while?  timbuktu?<br><br><strong><br>When you say there is a huge herd in FT in Singapore I am sure you must have read the statistic on the growth % of FT in Singapore. As such, could you give us a brief of what it the growth rate of FT in Singapore from 1990 to 2006<br></strong><br><br>i saw it.  there is a sudden jump over the last two years which coincides with our current property price spike.<br></blockquote></div>
