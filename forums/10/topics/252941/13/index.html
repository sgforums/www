Referring to an article by Jocelyn Lee (Straits Times, 6 May 2007), Bukit Merah flats are selling at $100,000 above valuation.  A four room HDB in that area will cost almost $0.5 million.  For people who wish to stay near their parents, this price increase is significant and real.<br><br>The HDB price index is set to increase by about 5% this year which translates to a $15,000 hike for a $300,000 resale flat.  Not many young couples would see their combined salaries increase by $15,000 this year and they would probably have to carry this extra burden over the next three years, provided HDB prices do not continue to incease by $15,000 for the next three years.<br><br><strong><br>I think it is abit early to say that the soaring housing price will continue like what we see in the 80s and 90s. I believe once the en bloc fever subside the property price will stabilize. As far as wages is concerned it really depends on which sector of the industry, some sectors are definitely moving faster than others, but as long as our economy continue to focus on services be less reliant on manufacturing, globalisation will have lesser effect on us.<br></strong><br><br>with the current salary stagnation, it only takes a fraction of the price hike in the 80s and 90s to seriously impact the living standards of ordinary singaporeans.  the finance sector only accounts for 25% of our GDP, so three quarters of us do not enjoy the kind of pay increase that allows us to keep up with HDB price increases.  services too can be affected by globalisation, especially when our government is so ever eager to import foreign talent.<br><br><strong><br>As far as I know, the diesel for cab drivers are "subsidize", ie. cheaper than pump price, and they pay rental fee to the taxi companies, not necessary GLCs. What do you mean when you say bulk of their earning goes to the government?<br></strong><br><br>diesel subsidy is insignificant, the bulk of hike in diesel price falls squarely on cab drivers and passed on to consumers in the form of increased cab fares.  the shareholders of taxi companies are predominantly GLCs.  since the shareholder owners are ultimately GLCs, then the bulk of earnings goes to the government.<br><br><strong><br>The service industry might not look like an attractive job for the educated and able, but it is a good source of income for students, uneducated and unskilled workers and unemployed.<br></strong><br><br>the benefits of this income doesn't come free.  it comes with real disturbances to property prices which is a major cost component of living in Singapore.  furthermore, these aren't exactly the higher value added jobs that you mention below.<br><br><strong><br>The days of having huge manufacturing factories that employ thousands are over, and we are unlikely to see that again. Singapore economy has to move toward higher value added manufacturing which usually are less labour intensive, and service industry.<br></strong><br><br>bringing rich men here to wine and dine will not induce the so-called higher value added industries.  being a waiter at Le Amis restaurant isn't that much value added is it?<br><br><strong><br>Condo might be built by foreign workers, but there are also alot of local elements involves. E.g the people who design it, the people and companies who maintain it, the property agent the sells it etc.<br></strong><br><br>the people who maintain it are often banghras as well.  in any case, the construction industry is only 5% of our economy so the interests of this sector has to be balanced against the interests of the 80% singaporeans who stay in HDBs.<br><br><strong><br>Even for Ferrari, you also need SE to broker the sales, and the mechanic to maintain them (actually they do need alot of maintainces)<br></strong><br><br>the major cost component of a Ferrari is the Ferrari itself which the cost of maintenance pales in comparison to.  the import tax that the government imposes is a lot more significant instead.  so if there is ever a winner, it would be, as always, the government.<br><br><strong><br>Are you saying that an increase of dinners at Le Amis restaurant will cause a price increase of a bowl of Mee Pok in AMK? And an increase of Bentley cars in Singapore result in an increase in public transport?<br></strong><br><br>are you saying that as the number of restaurants in the like of Le Amis increases here, it will not in any way eat into the available land space for food courts and other smaller restaurants?  are you saying an increase in Bentley cars will not tend to lift up the price of COEs?<br><br><strong><br>The biggest culprit for the rise in commerical rental price will be the REITs, not so much of the rich people buying residential property. Singapore has a wide variety of shopping malls, and I am sure some will be more expensive than others.<br></strong><br><br>think about it.  why should REITs suddenly snap up commercial units?  it is the same reason for our current housing property boom.  REIT companies expect rich people to come due to vigorous invitation by the government and so are snapping up shopping malls, renovating them to make them more upmarket which translates to pricier goods for everyone.  There may be a wide variety of shopping malls but with more catering to the needs of the rich, there would be an upward pressure on shopping mall rentals which we end up paying for.<br><br><strong><br>If you are talking about the rich competing with Singaporeans for luxury goods, I would agree with you. However if you are talking about basic things like food stuffs and public transport etc. I dont think so.<br></strong><br><br>let me explain again.  if a lot of rich men are coming, businessmen being businessmen would convert more shopping mall usage to posh, expensive restaurants while cheaper outlets would be evicted.  cheaper outlets, if they were to justify their continued operation would be forced to up their prices which we ordinary folks end up paying for.<br><br>if a lot of rich men come here and take up all the available COEs for their Ferraris, it would jack up COEs for Nissans and Toyotas and the cost of car ownership to Singaporeans.<br><br><strong><br>Yes, but private residential area will never be developed as HDB and vice versa. So I dont see how one could affect the other unless singapore has exhausted every inch of land in Singapore. I think we should be more concern if we have too many middle class FT buying up HDB flat in Singapore.<br></strong><br><br>just like we used to say that Singapore will never have casinos.  once we acknowledge the fact that on a per plot of land basis, the price singaporeans pay for their HDBs is twice that a foreigner pays for his prime district bungalow, we should also acknowledge that it is fundamentally wrong and we should not continue to subsidise rich foreigners.<br></blockquote></div>

However I dont see how Le Amis could be competing with Kopitiam for coffeeshop space in HDB estate or outskirt shopping mall. Have you forgotten what you mentioned about 80% of Singaporeans living in HDB?<br><br>There are different Cat. of COE for different size of car and I am sure the top and bottom end buyer usually dont mix when they are bidding for COE, plus how many Ferraris and Bentley can the rich buy every month considering that the prices of cars are the most expensive in this world. I think the bulk of the owner of such luxury cars are not foreigners but Singaporeans </span><br><br>think about it. why should REITs suddenly snap up commercial units? it is the same reason for our current housing property boom. REIT companies expect rich people to come due to vigorous invitation by the government and so are snapping up shopping malls, renovating them to make them more upmarket which translates to pricier goods for everyone. There may be a wide variety of shopping malls but with more catering to the needs of the rich, there would be an upward pressure on shopping mall rentals which we end up paying for.<br><br><span style="color: red;">There are many different kind of REITs in singapore, some are focusing on shopping malls, like Suntec, while others are mostly focusing of factories and warehouses. Hence I dont think it is right to make the comments about REIT companies are driven by rich people coming to Singapore.<br><br>As you have mentioned that 80% of Singaporeans are living in HDB flats, hence do you think that shopping malls in Singapore can survive by catering only to the rich?</span><br><br>let me explain again. if a lot of rich men are coming, businessmen being businessmen would convert more shopping mall usage to posh, expensive restaurants while cheaper outlets would be evicted. cheaper outlets, if they were to justify their continued operation would be forced to up their prices which we ordinary folks end up paying for.<br><br>if a lot of rich men come here and take up all the available COEs for their Ferraris, it would jack up COEs for Nissans and Toyotas and the cost of car ownership to Singaporeans.<br><br><span style="color: red;">the big word is "IF". Suppose IF in the next 10 to 15 years, 50% of the population in Singapore are millionaires then you are right. </span><br><br>just like we used to say that Singapore will never have casinos. once we acknowledge the fact that on a per plot of land basis, the price singaporeans pay for their HDBs is twice that a foreigner pays for his prime district bungalow, we should also acknowledge that it is fundamentally wrong and we should not continue to subsidise rich foreigners.<br><br><span style="color: red;">If you want to look at it this way, then I would say the most expensive plot of land in Singapore is not HDB, they are the high rise apartment in dist 9 and 10 and for some 99 year leasehold project they are selling at around S$1500 to S$2000 psf, and their penthouse could hit $3000 per psf, plus they usually have a higher plot ratio than HDB. </span></div>

High tech manufacturing is different from mass production manufacturing that employs thousands of workers. High tech manufacturing requires higher level of skills and know-how and they are cannot be replace by cheaper unskilled work force.<br><br>In the service industry, there is a front office that deals directly with customers and they is also the back office. Hence it is not right to assume the you need all these attributes to be working in the service industry.<br><br><strong> i quote your words from below "plus how many Ferraris and Bentley can the rich buy every month ..." in the same token, how many meals can the rich eat per day. how many waiters does he require to serve him? in order to create a lot of waitering opportunities, you would need a lot of rich people who would in turn overwhelm the resources / infrastructures that are currently available. </strong><br><br>a) You donÂ’t buy a car everyday, but you have to eat 3 to 4 times a day, 365 days per year. Hence what does Ferrari has to do with eating?

I did not say that service industry catering ONLY for the rich would create enough job opportunity to those less skills and less educated.<br><br><strong>still, how many people can you employ to maintain an estate of say five condominiums? how many rich foreigners do you need to fill those condominiums? the ratio between the number of people you can employ against the number of rich foreign talent you have to import is so lob sided. </strong><br><br>I would say at least 50 permanent staffs to maintain a good size apartment that comes with full facilities, and also contractors that provide pool cleaning, gym maintenance, gardening, etc.<br><br>How many households that need to fill those condominium is not really an issue or concern because as long as the apartment has got its TOP, irregardless of the occupancy rate, everything will have to be maintained.<br><br><strong><br>the demand is artificially induced through vigorous import of foreign talents. that's where it is not so market oriented but government induced instead. </strong><br><br>FTs are attracted to Singapore <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not imported </span>and you donÂ’t need to be living in Singapore to buy property in Singapore, just like Singaporeans buying property in Australia, Malaysia etc. Hence if this is not a case of supply and demand, what is?<br><br><strong>no one's saying that the construction industry should be sacrificed. all i'm saying is that we should not be over zealous with foreign talent import and the rate of any such importation should be at a level that can be comfortably absorbed by the economy without creating price distortions or even bubbles.</strong><br><br>a) You are against FT, but you want them to build your house. Who do you tink you are? King?<br>b) Singapore government does not import FT, it is the companies that invested in Singapore that attracts them to our shore.<br>c) Is a boom in construction industry good for Singapore? Yes or No?<br><br><strong>your opinion is essentially one sided. it only considers the contribution to the economy and job creation without considering how much that contribution would be, how much job creation and at what cost. you refuse to see such signs as our current property boom (hopefully not bubble) as a signal that we're perhaps taking on more than we can comfortably chew.<br><br>as for who wins, that is also an essential ingredient in the discussion because if you look at the entire picture, the one that stands to benefit the most would undoubtedly be the govt. </strong><br><br>Your opinion is essentially focusing on yourself wanting to buy prime property, but unwilling to pay a premium. And you argument has never been about the people who have been struggling to find a stable job in Singapore, and instead you are always blaming the rich FT that is pushing up the price of your dream home and dream car.<br><br>Inflation is something that is going to hit Singapore just like it is going to hit other countries regardless if there is a IR or not.

And please taxi and occupancy rate of condominium has no relationship.<br><br><strong> in your own words, "FT population in Singapore is something that is within our governmentÂ’s control." so while FTs may be attracted, it is up to our govt to admit or reject them. so saying that the FTs are attracted is only half the truth, for they could be rejected. it is more like import because of the ambitious target of 6.5 million set by the govt and the active "wooing" all around the world. </strong><br><br>Are you saying that if your wife has had many suitors in the past, she is actually importing man into her life 50% of the time?<br><br><strong>but you don't find australia and malaysia going all out to woo foreign talent and boosting their populations by one third do you? there may be opportunistic buyers from overseas but the opporturnities they seek is in our rapidly rising property prices which is in turn caused by govt's overzealous wooing of FTs. so it isn't just a simple case of supply and demand. </strong><br><br>Are you sure the Australia and Malaysia are not wooing foreign talents and rich people? Have you check how much the property prices in Australia have risen over the years?<br><br>Please get your facts right before talking.<br><br><strong>you are making a baseless accusation against me. to engage in smearing isn't how gentleman conducts himself. </strong><br><br>baseless? I think you better read what you wrote. Or should I give you a list of what you have said?<br><br></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by Gazelle:<br><strong><br>And because of these peopleÂ’s preference, HDB prices in matured estate have to remain flat forever so that the offspring or their offspring can afford to stay together.<br>Is that what you are trying to say?<br></strong><br><br>not just any whimsical preference but good, well intentioned preference to stay near parents.  filial piety is important for asians and many pious children in outskirt towns also choose to stay near parents within the same towns.  so its not just matured estates like you said but all estates throughout singapore.  not flat but rather not shooting up at a rate much faster than salaries can keep up.<br><br><strong><br>A 5 room HDB used to cost $25K about 25 years ago. Are you saying that if you buy a similar size HDB flat at $300K today, you are paying $275K Â“extraÂ” for nothing?<br></strong><br><br>from $25K to $300K, price of flats have increased by 12 times!  whereas salaries may have only doubled over the same period.  so comparing prices of flats and salaries, we are now paying 6 times as much as our fathers used to pay so we're paying an extra 500% for nothing!<br><br><strong><br>A bowl of mee pok used to cost around $0.50 about 30 years ago should you start protesting and stop eating because you are paying $2.50 extra for nothing?<br></strong><br><br>price of mee pok is small compared to salary or price of HDB so there's no reason not to eat it.  furthermore, if mee pok truly became exhorbitant, we can always eat mee siam instead.  but if HDB becomes too expensive where are we going to stay?  bungalows?<br><br><strong><br>Really? So I presume that majority of the people working along Orchard Road are also living in Orchard Road, and if you are a waiter in a restaurant along orchard road, you should deserved to be living at Orchard Road, isnÂ’t?<br></strong><br><br>but this contradicts what you wrote earlier "Where you live really depends on where you work".<br><br><strong><br>Just like what you are saying, given a CHOICE you would prefer to stay where you want to stay, so instead of just stopping at matured HDB estate or near you parents bull crap, why donÂ’t you choose Nassim Hill bungalow instead?<br></strong><br><br>why should my preference to stay near parents have anything to do with Nassim Hill bungalow?<br><br><strong><br>What sort of pressure are you talking about because pressure is a relative word and it mean nothing if you canÂ’t quantify it.<br></strong><br><br>two months ago, prices around my area is $330K.  It is $360K now.  $30K increase in 2 months, what more quantification do you need?<br><br><strong><br>And just because of 2 year of rise in property sector after about 10 years of slump, you are making so much noise?<br></strong><br><br>so i should wait for the next slump 10 years later to buy a house?<br><br><strong><br>Is that just your selfish thought? And please have you forgotten the biggest cost component in buying house is servicing the mortgage? Obviously you know nuts about this isnÂ’t it?<br></strong><br><br>no, it's your own silly idea.  i am in no way selfish because i am saying that prices of housing all over singapore should remain stable for all singaporeans.  the morgage actually compounds the problem of property price hikes.  whatever price hikes we're experiencing now will be compounded over the years through interest on interest.  so because of interest, price hike now becomes an even bigger problem later.<br><br><strong><br>Yar, I forgotten that the cheapest HDB flat in Singapore is around $300K, hence this is probably the minimum you could go for buy a HDB flat right?<br></strong><br><br>it is the cheapest if i want to stay near my parents.  do i have to constantly remind you?<br><br><strong><br>You cant eat money and precious metal either, can you?<br></strong><br><br>so?  you can choose not to buy money or precious metal since you can't eat them.  but whether or not you can eat property gains you still need a house to stay in.  don't tell me you're using precious metal to build a kennel to stay in.<br><br><strong><br>You mean Singapore men have to place their wifeÂ’s preference before their aging parents? Are you talking about yourself and your family or the majority of Singaporeans?<br></strong><br><br>so if i have five siblings, all five of us plus siblings-in-laws will have to stay together with our ageing parents?  of course i am talking about the majority of singaporeans.  you on the other hand are talking crap.<br><br><strong><br>This depends of the property market and the economy, and yes very normal.<br></strong><br><br>i would say it is not normal<br></blockquote></div>
