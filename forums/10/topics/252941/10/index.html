Nevertheless, with their necks exposed to the hot breath of would-be F1 promoters in neighbouring Singapore, the Malaysians must be well aware that the region isn't capable of supporting two GPs. Malaysia and Singapore have clashed on similar issues in the past, and - given the huge losses racked up in Kuala Lumpur - my money's on Singapore if it comes down to a fight over who gets the privilege of giving Bernie the next big cheque.<br>Back in 1999, the Sepang circuit Â– <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">built and financed by the same state-owned company</span> which operated the nearby airport</strong> - was something new and exciting. At the time, Malaysia was only the second Asian country (after Japan) to have invested in an F1 race: guided by Formula One Management, the organisers seemed to be doing everything right. The circuit was designed by Hermann Tilke, the event had the full support of Malaysian strong man Dr Mahathir Mohamad, and the government-compliant national press was working flat out to persuade ordinary Malaysians that F1 was a sport they would enjoy.<br>Not everything went according to plan, of course.<br>First, the circuit was perhaps a bit too clever for its own good. During practice in 1999 I went out to Turn One and discovered it was a fiendishly difficult corner which tightened up on itself just as it went into reverse camber. It would have been great fun to see a gaggle of Formula Ford drivers getting it all wrong there, and I suspect that the MotoGP boys are good value, too. But F1 designers and engineers, unlike race fans, hate to see power slides and spinning wheels. As a result, the cars were set up to overcome the wiles of Herr Tilke, and they went through as if on rails, with not even a puff of tyre smoke.<br>Then there's the political aspect. We have to tread carefully here, because the Malaysians get a bit sensitive when anybody dares to suggest that their interpretation of democracy falls short of what most other nations understand the word to mean. Suffice to say, then, that Dr Mahathir was a lot more generous with his subsidies for Sepang than Tony Blair is ever likely to be for Silverstone, and he ensured that it was his face in the limelight. The publicity spin-off came at the glittering Thursday night party laid on in Kuala Lumpur, with a three-line whip for all the drivers and team owners to attend. The atmosphere was very tense until Dr M had been introduced in a blaze of flash guns to Mika Hakkinen, the reigning World Champion. Needless to say, the handshake picture appeared across eight columns on the front pages of all the Kuala Lumpur newspapers next morning.<br>Sadly, Malaysians don't appear to share their leaders' enthusiasm for F1. After a sparsely attended Friday there was a reasonable crowd in the grandstands on Saturday, and I went to join them. I estimated that <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>no more than 20 per cent of them were locals</strong></span>, with the numbers made up by tourists from Europe, Australia and Japan. Although there was a decent crowd on Sunday, my very personal observation tends to contradict the circuit's claims of a full house, at least in later years. There was a reasonable turn-out of locals that first year, although most of them didn't arrive until the last minute. I suspect that many of them were expecting F1 racing to be a superior sort of demolition derby, complete with flying wheels and flaming debris.<br><strong>With Dr Mahathir now in retirement, and with Formula One Management's financial demands ratcheting up at well beyond the pace of inflation, the country's leaders don't have the same commitment to their F1 event.</strong> Officially, they are committed to the GP. But <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: red;">the accountants may conclude, as they have elsewhere, that the costs of their race are beginning to outweigh the benefits</span></span></strong><span style="color: darkgreen;">. Who knows what will happen?<br>So take my advice. Visit Malaysia and take in a Grand Prix while you still can. It may cost you less than you expected. But hurry before it's too late.</span> [/quote]<br>[quote]<strong>Originally posted by Gazelle:<br>Facts with capital "F"?

The financial infrastructure in Formula One must change, and not just so the teams make more money."<br><br>Formula One charges so much for the rights to play host to a race that few circuits make enough from the ticket sales to make a profit. Silverstone is in the second year of a five-year deal brokered by Stewart in 2004.<br><br>Stewart said that even privately owned circuits like the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, where Formula One races in the United States, receive help from the local government.<br><br>Stewart's business sense has rarely failed him. He had a second Formula One career as a team owner, succeeding where many other champions failed.<br><br>He started Stewart Grand Prix with his son, Paul, in 1997 before the value of the teams began to rise. Two years later the team won the European Grand Prix at the NÃ¼rburgring, Germany.<br><br>Bernard Ferguson, director of Cosworth, which supplied the team with engines and now supplies Williams, said Stewart's credibility with Ford after decades as its ambassador permitted him to persuade Ford to instead start a team from nothing when it would have been easier to buy an existing team and provide it with free engines.<br><br>"That was a big leap of faith by Ford, and I don't think they'd have done it for anybody else," Ferguson said. "The Jackie Stewart phenomenon pulled that whole team together."<br><br>After three seasons, Stewart sold the team for $154 million to Ford, which changed its name to Jaguar.
