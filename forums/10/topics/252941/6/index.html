It was pathetic despite all the inconvenience put up by Residents in Singapore and the business community.<br><br>With the meeting held at Suntec City, and the high security given to all the high profile participants, we have seen that the mega-event has no benefit to Singaporeans, but became a nuisance with the high security and traffic diversions.<br><br>Do you think that those who visited Genting Highlands in Malaysia will make an effort to spend time in Kuala Lumpur, or if the family will simply spend their entire time and budget in the Highlands even as they must pass through Kuala Lumpur ?<br><br>Then again, how would you know, not until you have made a trip there yourself ?<br><br>Is there any logic in your last question - <span style="font-style: italic;">''Is singapore being build around the 2 IR?''</span> ???<br><br>You must be worn out by your two other nemesis in this thread.<br></span><br><br></div>
