They do not analyze figures objectively, but to derive their pre-determined conclusion.<br><br>This is likened to the research community, where usually 1 out of 10 papers are truly useful, while the rest are just biased research (where the conclusion is already pre-determined before the research is conducted)</div></blockquote>Get walloped?
