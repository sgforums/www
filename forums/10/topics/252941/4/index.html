Barring ignorant pets whose survival depends on the daily dosage of fascist propaganda, it'd be hard to imagine anyone would actually find your argument remotely coherent. Let's take your silly argument at face value and analyse on that basis : so you're effectively suggesting restricting the size of the casino to 3%-5% the size of the entire IR, that would actually constitute an effective way to ensure the IR's don't make more than 30% of its revenues from gaming avenues?<br><br>Have you ever set foot in a casino(and I literally mean a modern, state-of-the-art casino which has a complex of its own; not your own underground gambling den)? Have you any idea how many gaming tables are there in these casinos and how much revenue these tables generate? It's not rocket science for anyone who has set foot in such casinos to know the area of a casino hardly provides a viable reflection of how much gaming revenue the casino generates, in respect to the size of its non-gaming complex as a whole. For all the grand ideology your propaganda machine has fed you with, obviously the precedences set out by casinos in Macau, Las Vegas and Monaco will do little to boost your ailing case. Macau's gaming industry alone was worth USD3.4billion alone in 2003 - for your warped theory to hold true, I suppose we're supposed to believe LV Sands will be capable of generating some USD7.9billion on its own from its non-gaming revenues? (Should you fail to convince any sane folks, you can try selling that notion to your dog though...)<br><br>Evidently, if an ignorant mug like you should genuinely believe the gaming revenues of a casino could be curtailed based on the size on which the casino operates, you ought to get your head checked.<br>b]</blockquote>This goes to show why the government is complain about the lack of creativity in this country. Somehow you have demostrate that your mind can only think in 1 direct.<br><br>a) By limiting the floor space use for casino, the IR will have more floor area to cater for other business.<br><br>b) 30% is a relative number, hence to acheive that 30% target (not rules and I mentioned) you could either reduce the size of the casino or you could enlarge the non-gaming business.

I suppose anything that doesn't have <strong>Integrated Resort</strong> as a label isn't comparable to the IR's you have in Singapore, eh?<br><br>Using your beloved Wikipedia as a source, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echelon_Place" rel="nofollow">Echelon Place</a> is effectively a replacement for <strong>Stardust Resort &amp; Casino</strong>. From your trusted source, "This will be an 87 acre multi-use project with a 140,000 square foot casino, 4 hotels providing 5,300 rooms, 25 restaurants and bars, the 650,000 square foot Las Vegas ExpoCenter, and a convention center with 1 million square feet of space. <strong>The Echelon Resort will be a 3,300 room hotel owned and operated by Boyd</strong>. The other hotels are expected to be a Shangri-La Hotel, a Delano Hotel, a Mondrian Hotel, and the Echelon Tower." Failing which, you could still refer to <a href="http://www.echelonresort.com/pdf/fact_sheet.pdf" rel="nofollow">Echelon Las Vegas'</a> site to get a clue of what the whole place is about.<br><br>While I knew you had problems with basic arithmetic, I never knew you had a provlem with words. Are you an illiterate? <strong>Do you understand what it means if I should tell you the USD4 billion construction cost for the Echelon Place is shouldered by Boyd Gaming Corporation exclusively?</strong> While there're plans in place for other hotels to operate within its premises, it doesn't render them a part of Boyd Gaming Corporation, does it?<br><br>If your stupidity isn't enough to compound matters, you might want to know that "one of the world's two most expensive IR's" (at least, to your warped mind) is actually <strong>jointly developed</strong> by Genting International and Star Cruises. So if your argument that Echelon Place isn't more expensive than LV Sands' Marina Bay venture just because there're strategic partners in the vicinity of Echelon Place who commit further investments to Boyd Gaming Corp's investments, how does it make sense to suggest Genting International and Star Cruises' joint venture is actually worth, on the basis of each individual entity (ie.in terms for idiots, viewing Genting International and Star Cruises' as seperate and independent entities), the SGD5.5billion investment?<br><br>If Echelon Place doesn't qualify as an Intergrated Resort, your intellect certainly wouldn't even match a gazelle's. Then again, how could anyone espousing such drivel even have the intellect of a gazelle in the first place? I'd most certainly have to retract my comparison of likening your intellect to a dog's - afterall, I'm sure that'd be an insult to the canines out there.<br></div>

Guess what comes next, more stamp duties on all the Main and Sub-Contracts awarded to the various foreign and local building contractors and vendors, PLUS the 7% GST applied on every invoiced transactions on each delivery to these two projects would have rung the bells for Round 3 and 4 to Singapore Inc - and all these are even before the Main and Sub-Contractors can even total their Profit and Loss on the Projects until at least 2 or 3 years into the future.<br><br>If you are not involved in the construction phases of both the IRs, what benefit are you hoping to get from the IRs at this Stage ? </span><br><blockquote><strong><br>b) How do you explain the MICE business which LV Sands intend to bring into Singapore.

LV Sands will need a high volume of visitors in order to recover their $10 BILLION investment over the lease period of their investment.<br><br>The MICE events and other Family Entertainment is just a camouflage to make this Casino in Singapore a more palatable appearance to Singaporeans - who have been accustomed to the preachings of clean living by LKY.

In a feeble attempt to derail the merits of Echelon Place to sustain your argument that there aren't actually <strong>more expensive</strong> casino resorts than those to be constructed in your beloved regime, you've certainly done very well to reveal the emergence of the <strong>MGM Mirage's USD6 billion project</strong>. While I can understand it'd be hard for you to come to terms with the fact that there're actually grander and more expensive casino resort projects outside your beloved fascist regime, most sane folks with no problems performing basic arithmetic wouldn't have trouble comprehending the fact that the MGM Mirage's Project CityCenter would more than dwarf either IR built on fascist premises.<br><br>Illiterate, just thought I'd cite the <a href="http://www.echelonresort.com/pdf/lvrj.pdf" rel="nofollow">link</a> which forms the basis of your fallacious argument, so that you could refer back to it more conveniently for your senseless counter-argument later on.<br><br>Obviously, in your eagerness to prove me wrong, you've overlooked the simplest of facts in the simplest terms which could not possibly be incomprehensible to anyone with basic education. I guess, it ain't entirely out of place to suggest you're nothing more than an illiterate if that doesn't prove too flattering to begin with.<br><br>Echelon Resort's development plans clearly allude to the following "Echelon Place, on the west side of the Strip just north of Wynn Las Vegas, will feature the USD2.9 billion <strong>wholly owned</strong> Echelon Resort". For some reasons(either through your illiteracy or sheer inability to understand the full picture as a result of selective amnesia), I see you've conveniently ignored the fact that Boyd Gaming Corp, who will shoulder the USD2.9 billion exclusively, will actually be entering into 50-50 joint ventures with Shangri-La and Morgans Hotel Groups. Once again, quoting the above source :<br><br><blockquote><br>Boyd Gaming has entered into a 50-50 joint venture agreement with the Morgans Hotel Group, a developer of lifestyle-boutique hotels, for the construction of two hotels within Echelon Place.<br>The Delano and Mondrian, to be built at a cost of approximately $700 million, will be managed by Morgans. Boyd Gaming will contribute the land; Morgans will contribute $97.5 million in cash to the venture.</blockquote>Should your limited intellect not be sufficiently empowered to comprehend the fact a 50-50 joint venture does not necessarily (as in this particular case, it doesn't) mean a 50-50 cost-sharing in developing the project, you may wish to note that despite Morgans and Boyd engaging in a 50-50 joint venture, Morgans will only be chipping in with USD97.5 million for the additional USD700 million. With this in mind, that'd effectively take Boyd's venture to <strong>USD3.5025 billion</strong> <strong>before factoring in the cost from its other joint ventures with Shangri-La and other smaller players</strong>.<br><br>Now, further taking today's exchange rate where USD1 = SGD1.519, USD3.5025 billion (which does not include Boyd's stake in its joint venture with Shangri-La) would translate to SGD5.32 billion. Clearly, it's not rocket science that SGD5.32 billion actually dwarfs the SGD5.05 billion LV Sands plan to invest on its Marina Bay IR, does it?<br><br>Keep your comical antics coming in to prove me wrong here - for starters, you could perhaps conjure up an argument to suggest USD1 is perhaps equal to SGD0.5 and therefore, there's actually a miscalculation in my figures?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>
