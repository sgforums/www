Should you conveniently decide to put some spin to your tale, you might wish to note we're only considering the income from Premier League matches since you so conveniently claimed that for the EPL, "the winner of the season will get the biggest pie of the TV revenue".<br><br>Manchester United's income for 2006/2007 stands at Â£30.58m, but their total income from TV is Â£16.86m (include the Â£8.9m plus further revenue through PPV and live games). Chelsea's income for 2006/2007 stands at Â£30.97m, but their total income from TV is Â£17.45m (include the Â£8.9m plus further revenue through PPV and live games). So, if your theory that "winner of the season will get the biggest pie of the TV revenue" held true, would you like to explain how is it possible that Chelsea have actually raked in more money than Manchester United in 2006/2007?<br><br>If you're running out of arguments, you may wish to enlighten me that it was Chelsea, and not Manchester United, that actually won the 2006/2007 Premier League...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
