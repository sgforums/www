With this in mind, that'd effectively take Boyd's venture to [b]USD3.5025 billion</strong> <strong>before factoring in the cost from its other joint ventures with Shangri-La and other smaller players</strong>.<br><br>Now, further taking today's exchange rate where USD1 = SGD1.519, USD3.5025 billion (which does not include Boyd's stake in its joint venture with Shangri-La) would translate to SGD5.32 billion.

Glad that my extra effort has finally paid off.<br><br>b) At USD3.5025b, it is actually lower than Marina Bay<br>Sands (http://www.msafdie.com/php/print_project.php?id=92) which is US$3.6b<br>And we are not even factoring the increase in cost of sands and granite in Singapore right now.<br><br>c) Shangri-la is not an equity investor, it only manages the hotel at at Echelon Place.<br><br>back to you my boy!!<br><br></div></blockquote>Well done on shooting yourself in the foot yet again. Firstly, the site you quoted estimates the cost to be USD3.6 billion after factoring in the land cost - which is effectively what was quoted all along with the figure in excess of SGD5 billion. So <strong>it's a classic case of shooting yourself in the foot by trying to twist around the numbers through a miscalculated attempt at converting the worth of the Marina Bay project to USD</strong>.<br><br>More importantly, perhaps you're daft enough to not be able to see the picture. There's nothing to suggest the Echelon Place costs anything less than USD4 billion. Even if other joint investors were to help defray the financial liability of Boyd Gaming Corp (which you have obviously failed to explain besides Morgan's USD97.5m - and even that was highlighted by me - where the other sources of funding for the project will come from), there's still no running away from the fact that Echelon Place is a project worth in excess of USD4 billion. In terms for illiterates, for Echelon Place to be able to operate on the scale depicted by its current blueprint, the combined total coughed up for the project would exceed the USD4 billion mark. So what's worth more now - <strong>USD3.6 billion or USD4 billion</strong>?<br><br>To qualify your silly comparison, you're suggesting Echelon Place isn't more expensive than Marina Bay (in your stoic defence of your misguided belief that the IR's in Singapore are the most expensive in the world) just because Boyd Gaming Corp isn't investing more than LV Sands (which is hardly true to begin with). So if you were to start a business with your father and this company, A, is <strong>worth more</strong> than another business venture, B, run by a lone proprietor, are you telling me venture B is more successful just because B is run by 1 person? More pertinently, if both A and B were PLC's subject to public trading, are you telling me the cost of taking over Company A will be lower than that for Company B just because Company A is a joint venture?<br><br>As if you needed any incentive to prove there's hardly a bigger idiot than yourself, try making sense of your final point to make a case for your own argument. So if Shangri-La "only manages" the hotel at Echelon Place, does that not make Boyd Gaming Corp the chief proprietors who will be coughing up the lion's share of the remaining USD400 million, taking Boyd's investment in the project to a tune of USD3.9 billion?<br><br>All that before you consider MGM's got a project in the pipeline which is projected to cost USD6 billion, which would easily dwarf your "world's most expensive Singapore IR's" at a canter anyway.<br><br>Have fun espousing more drivel - it certainly makes for some good entertainment, albeit logically incoherent and practically ridiculous.</div>

Or did anybody for that matter. If you agree that business outcome cannot be predicted, aren't you agreeing that the 70/30 allocation will not stand, afterall if you cannot predict the sales of a certain product, how can you claim that the 70/30 allocation stands. Based on the Efficient Market Hypothesis, the use of historical information to forecast the performance of a company is weak.
