              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><strong></strong><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: black; font-size: 16.5pt;"></span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>LAST Saturday, I was upset by a former colleague who had relinquished his permanent-resident (PR) status in Singapore.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">He bade me farewell, saying: "I am going back to the Philippines to retire. I cashed out all my CPF (Central Provident Fund) savings but I will come back, as a tourist."</span></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">He showed me photos of his new home in the Philippines, renovated luxuriously and comparable to a Good Class Bungalow here.</span></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">His attitude made me see red.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Have we taken measures to ensure that only people who genuinely want to settle down in Singapore and contribute to the nation's economic growth are made PRs?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>I work in human resources, and some of my foreign colleagues <span style="text-decoration: underline;">who earn less than $2,500 monthly are PRs.</span></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>Almost all the foreigners in my workplace are vying for PR status. Some do so because the mandatory contributions to their CPF accounts result in savings which they can take out when they decide to leave.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">For new PRs, the CPF contribution rates are graduated, but they get full rates from the third year onwards (the same contribution rates as Singaporeans).</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Perhaps the CPF Board should revise the contribution rates for PRs to make it less attractive for those who want the status only for the CPF savings.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Foreigners who have become PRs find it easier to apply for jobs in Singapore, compared to those who are on employment passes.</span></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">PR status aside, are employers providing fair employment opportunities to Singaporeans?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Are graduates from Singapore universities not comparable to graduates from foreign universities, such as those in the Philippines, China, Myanmar, Hong Kong and Indonesia?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Before employers decide to hire a foreigner, have they exhausted all reasonable recruitment options in Singapore first?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">It is a myth that foreigners have lower salary expectations than Singaporeans.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>Of the foreigners who graduated from a university in their home country, the majority whom I have met and interviewed <span style="text-decoration: underline;">expect much higher salaries than, or salaries comparable to, what a Singaporean with a good local degree would get.</span></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Their reasons include having to pay rental fees and utility bills, to remit money to their families and to pay for their children's education in their home country.</span></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">But Singaporeans also have similar burdens: mortgage payments, utility bills, children's education fees, as well as a sum of money to be put aside for elders as a form of filial piety.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>Besides, a foreigner's salary could turn out to be quite a substantial sum after currency conversion.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">I hope that employers will provide employment opportunities to Singaporeans before considering foreigners.</span></p>

              <p>Dear PM Lee,</p>
              <p>Please see another article reported online @ www.asiaone.com (one of the SPH publication media) not from www.temasekreview.com (some people may call its “anti-PAP” news blog).</p>
              <p>See link: http://news.asiaone.com/News/AsiaOne%2BNews/Singapore/Story/A1Story20100531-219249.html</p>
              <p>How many foreigners that apply for PR or even Citizenship want to make Singapore their new adopted home? Can the Civil Servants get down the street and disguise as undercover to find out from these PR and new Citizen, why do they want a blue/pink IC? I can safety bet with my last penny that the CPF scheme is one of the reasons for them wanting to get blue IC ASAP.</p>
              <p>We have locally-born Citizens complaining that the Government come out all kinds of ways to keep Citizens’ CPF (I personally not against on minimum sum principle); and on the other hand we have foreigners happy with the CPF system that function just like any commercial bank’s fixed deposit (earning high interest annually) while working here. Which global banks in any parts of the world pay an annual interest of 2.5% (+1% for the first thousand dollars in the bank deposit) to their customers?</p>
              <p>Some people may argue that if locally-born Singaporeans see red on the foreigners; you can also cash out your entire CPF saving and migrate to greener pasture! However, how many locally-born Singaporeans can do that? Even if you can afford to migrate to greener pasture say Australia, you are starting all over again (to retire) in your NEW adopted home using the entire cash out from Singapore; compared to a foreigner cashing out from Singapore mean going back to a familiar place where you were born fifty years ago.</p>
              <p>PM Lee, I’ve been writing to you and ministers on these policies a couple of time before. I do sincerely hope that the Government don’t just pay lip service for the sake the PAP winning the next GE. Singapore has what it is today – a first-world living standard, credits due to PAP must be commended. However, I feel that locally-born Singaporeans have given the PAP too much power to decide our country destiny hence as the years go the Government neglected these people’s feeling.</p>
              <p>Thank you for your attention. And have a nice day.</p>
              <p>Yours Faithfully,</p>

              <p>Well  I think you have to explore the writers mentality there is a little jealous here....for what they can get in the Philippines. (I am not siding with foreigners taking advantage of Singapore)</p>
              <p>The cost of living in SEA including philippine are much lower as compared to Singapore. So be it the Philippines, MY. Thai, Indo, Viet....it make economical sense for them to come and work here and recoup the money back to their home country to get a house. If we are in their shoes we do the same.</p>
              <p>Singaporean should do the same get a PR in the Philippines and lived out our life there......no need to be jealous.  or Australia...NZ...for higher cost of living that better reflect your lifestyle.</p>
              <p>On the other hand for the high cost of living in Singapore who to blame?</p>
              <p>We vote for the party for 45 yrs, we speculate on public housing.....Our govt created liberal flow of immigrant.</p>
              <p>Just because migrant wokers come from less developed country doesn't means they don't have common sense to think for basic knowledge of self Gain.</p>

              <p>A bit jealous?  CPF or not, the PR/EP holder can always take his income back home.  The only difference is with PR the income is channeled into forced savings in the mean time.</p>
              <p>Employers' contribution is usually calculated back from the total cost of an employee, and it's common for employers to demand that contribution from the employee who has newly become a PR.</p>
              <p>As for interest rates, banks in Australia are paying 6-7% now on fixed deposits.  An extreme example, but not all countries' interest rates are as low as SG.  So the CPF interest is no real gain for PRs.</p>
              <p>At the end of the day the writer is simply miffed that foreigners can take their earnings with them.  So what are the options?  Prevent foreigners from coming in.  Or disallow them from leaving.  Or disallow them from taking their savings.  Only the first option is an acceptable solution (and by this I'm not saying it's a problem that needs solving).</p>

              <p>i think mrs anna lee is just disgruntled.</p>
              <p>there is no details how long this pinoy sing pr works in singapore and i didn't know one can retire in the philippines with the cpf money if he/she works for only a few years.</p>
              <p>`retire', `good class bungalow' etc. are all words to amplify her frustrations on being caught in the middle in singapore. </p>
              <p>applying for pr doesn't mean the person is staying for good. it means convenience on a lot of fronts for the person/family, and hopefully he/she will settle for good as pap would have liked. there is no such thing as a 100% hit rate as mrs anna lee would like it to be.</p>

              not surprising wat........
                  
                  From the way our govt shamelessly court foreigners, we Singaporeans are feeling neglected, unwanted and indeed alienated.
                  
                  The high cost of living also makes life unsustainable, let alone retire here on our paltry cpf accounts..............
                  
                  So making our homes in more affordable countries IS probably the only way for us, let alone PRs, to carry on life.........

              <p>To the govt, PRs are actually guest of honor coming here to help us, by right, they should be enjoying more rights and perks than locals.</p>
              <p>Govt are urging them to come, they also urge the locals to embrace them with open arms, otherwise, we may not be able to attract them...you have to understand, our govt are courting them, not the other way round ya... and when you want to court someone, you need to provide flowers, sweets and money.</p>
