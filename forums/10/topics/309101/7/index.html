              <p>a rebuttal if you will...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1)fuel.The tax has been constant. It has not risen. To decrease
              the tax is a subsidy.</p>
              <p>2)GST. There's never a good time to raise taxes. Do you raise it
              when growth declines and the budget is in the red? Or do it when
              times are still relatively ok? Neither is a perfect solution. Trust
              me, you don't want a GST hike in the next economic crisis. And we
              both know the time is nigh.</p>
              <p>3)inflation. Once again, I must point out that any reduction in
              existing taxes is considered a subsidy by the government. Do we
              subsidise rice and wheat too? Because those prices have inflated
              like crazy too. Where do we draw the line?</p>
              <p>4)Minister raise. You miss the point. The raise is not an
              attempt to keep existing ministers happy. It is offered as an
              incentive to potential political candidates. Theoretically, you
              should be doing everything for free because you're just happy to do
              your part for the community. Like I've said before, that's the
              utopian dream and not feasible.</p>
              <p>If I pay thee not in gold, I pay thee in silver. If we do not
              possess the incentives other countries have to draw in potential
              political candidates, we must offer new ones. This is what the pay
              raise is all about. It's not about shifting blame. Unlike you, the
              government is looking for solutions, not blame shifting. I don't
              know what utopian fantasy you've woven around your eyes when
              looking at how singapore should be. But I assure you, money
              matters. You would be doing something you hate(perhaps cleaning
              toilets?) if I offered to pay you a million a year. Trust me.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>For 1, 2, and 3, we could go on and on for the rebuttals, but let's keep it at here. They are a never ending discussion.</p>
              <p>I just want to point out that money offered as an
              incentive to potential political candidates is not a valid reason. Why? Do you think that none in the opposition are worthy of office? If not, by supporting the offering of more money as incentive to the political profession already the highest paid in the world, you are indirectly telling us that the opposition do not have the necessary quality candidates, and that only the PAP will have such candidates. Thus when the PAP finds it hard to attract people (to their party), they have to increase the incentive, so much so that the yearly income of one MP is nearly half of that of the US president.</p>
              <p>Why do we not possess the incentives other countries have to draw in potential political candidates? Is the fault of the people? I have already pointed this out earlier, and I believe wholeheartedly that such things are not the fault of the people. Yet if they are not the fault of the people, why are they being made to pay for a fault that is not theirs?</p>
              <p>Yet again, raising minister pay as incentive shows the incompetence of the PAP to attract people. Is money everything? Apparently yes, to both the PAP and you. For me, I will and do help people not because of money; I do it because I want to. Money matters so much that the only way to reduce road usage by the PAP is to increase ERP. Yet if they think that the roads are congested, why issue so many COEs in the first place? Yes, money matters to them so much that they issue more COEs so that more people own cars, then increase ERP so that you drive less; both ways they earn. Yes, money matters so much that ERP gantries have to be put in residential areas, and a GPS system is under trial ready to do a invisible ERP on you one day.</p>
              <p>And again, your analogy of paying a million dollar to do something you hate has a flaw. We are talking about running a country. Suppose you do something you hate, what are the chances of you not giving the best of your ability to do the best out of it, everyday for at least 5 years?</p>
              <p>The government is looking for solutions? Probably, but each and every single solution is related to money (again). Not enough population? No worries, pay money to attract foreign workers, give money or incentives for people to give birth. Too many cars? No worries, increase ERP price. People not happy with GST hike? No worries, give out GST package. Not happy with bugdet with 6 billion extra? No worries, give some of the 6 billion back to people. Economy needs to grow more? No worries, build IR irregardless of what the citizens say to get more money. Cannot get people to join them in their party? No worries, increase minister pay to attract people.</p>
              <p>So in conclusion, you are right. Money matters, and in Singapore, it matters a lot when you want to control your people. But to be fair, using money as a means to control the population is definitely better than using fear to control (Afghan).</p>

              <p>it is ridiculous that the onus is on me everytime you screw up.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You make a baseless claim and I have to clean up after you to explain why your data is wrong. You make logic errors and I have to write paragraphs to educate you. You prove yourself ignorant, and I'm supposed to educate you.</p>
              <p>All while you're being extremely hostile to me.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But I'll do it again, if only so others may learn from your mistakes.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> 1)"a <strong>luxury good</strong> is a <a title="Good (economics)" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_%28economics%29">good</a> for which <a title="Demand" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demand">demand</a> increases more than proportionally as income rises, contrast to a "necessity good" for which demand increases less than proportionally as income rises." A car is a luxury item. End of story. So is TV by the way.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2) I'm not trying to say Mas is not in singapore. I'm saying you're not making sense.</p>
              <p>3) For the last time, the government is not at fault for Mas's escape. Know what human error is? Is it your fault if your dog, despite all it's training one day decides to pee in your shoes?</p>
              <p>4)SAF was not designed to catch criminals. That's the police's job. Saf's involvement is that of an assistant. To link Mas's escape to the defence budget is so far fetched I'm starting to wonder if your head is screwed on right.</p>
              <p>5) Compensation - no one else seems to have found it hard to understand. Why are you struggling? In this context, it's obviously the pay he gets for delivering the goods. You are either making a pathetic attempt at mocking me, or are really THAT dumb. I'm not sure it's not both.</p>
              <p>6) You want evidence? Go travel. Get out of that couch and turn off the TV you deem to be a neccessity. You rant on and on about the inaccuracies of the propoganda machine, but refuse to take personal observations over statistics drawn from similar propoganda mediums. You need only open your eyes to see the truth. But hey, then you'll be force to admit your gov is doing a decent job. That's forumite social suicide. We can't have that, can we?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>7) learn the difference between making baseless conjectures and the sharing of personal experience. I'm guessing you've never been to these places outside the "tourist areas". Yeah, you don't see the homeless at the Night safari either.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>1) Thanks for your "edited" cut and paste to distort the explanation again. Exactly the same source as yours,</p>
              <p>"In <a class="tip" href="/forums/10/topics/economics"><span style="color: #1d4994;">economics</span></a>, a <strong>luxury good</strong> is a <a class="tip" href="/forums/10/topics/good+(economics)"><span style="color: #1d4994;">good</span></a> for which <a class="tip" href="/forums/10/topics/demand"><span style="color: #1d4994;">demand</span></a> increases more than proportionally as income rises", contrast with <a class="tip" href="/forums/10/topics/inferior+good"><span style="color: #1d4994;">inferior good</span></a> and <a class="tip" href="/forums/10/topics/normal+good"><span style="color: #1d4994;">normal good</span></a>. Luxury goods are said to have high <a class="tip" href="/forums/10/topics/income+elasticity+of+demand"><span style="color: #1d4994;">income elasticity of demand</span></a>: as people become more wealthy, they will buy more and more of the luxury good. This also means, however, that should there be a decline in income its demand will drop. It must be noted, though, that income elasticity of demand is not constant with respect to income, and may change sign at different levels of income. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>That is to say, a luxury good may become a normal good</strong> <strong>or even an inferior good</strong> <strong>at different income levels</strong></span>, e.g. a wealthy person stops buying increasing numbers of luxury cars for his automobile collection to start collecting airplanes (at such an income level, the luxury car would become an inferior good).</p>
              <p><a href="http://encyclopedia.thefreedictionary.com/Luxury+goods">http://encyclopedia.thefreedictionary.com/Luxury+goods</a></p>
              <p>2) You are not making sense either.</p>
              <p>3) You are talking about containment in a maximum security detention centre as compared to a home. I didn't know my house can be classified as a maximum security</p>
              <p>detention centre. Maybe next time we can detain Mas Kastari in my house.</p>
              <p>4) SAF not trained to search and destroy? WTF? So if a commander tells his man, there is suspected enemy presence in the Bukit Timah Nature Reserve, seek out the enemy and neutralise them. SAF can't do it? Gimme a break.</p>
              <p>5) Let's see what you said initially.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">In other words, if you have financial trouble paying for parking or ERP charges, you have absolutely no business owning a car in the first place. If you are a delivery vehicle, economic theory dictates that your compensation will eventually adjust to the pre-tax level.</span></p>
              <p>Your explanation for compensation.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Compensation - no one else seems to have found it hard to understand. Why are you struggling? In this context, it's obviously the pay he gets for delivering the goods. You are either making a pathetic attempt at mocking me, or are really THAT dumb. I'm not sure it's not both.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">What has ERP and parking got to do with wages of a worker? You haven't been working or you have no knowledge of how the business system works here?</span></p>
              <p>ERP and parking charges are paid by companies, companies don't lump up ERP and parking charges to a worker's salary, because these are business expenses.</p>
              <p>You try to sound intelligent by coming up with lingos, but fail at fundamental logic.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>6) I am only drawing from figures provided by the Hong Kong budget, which is free from statistical bias and propaganda machinery.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>7) Yes, agree that you don't see the poor and homeless in the Singapore Night Safari. You only see the poor and homeless in the housing estates, eye sores free</p>
              <p>from the view of visitors to Singapore.</p>

              <p>I got an idea on how you can apply Einstein theory of relativity.</p>
              <p>If your company made losses every year of $1,000, the following year your company made a loss of $500.</p>
              <p>You can declare to the shareholders that according to your theory of relativity, your company made a profit of $500.</p>

              <p>Maybe you can start explaining Lorentz Transformation and Time Dilation to them.</p>

              <p>Allow me to state this:<br>Relativity was not a concept way before Einstein. In fact, when Einstein came up with the theory of relativity, no one understood at all. Einstein got his Nobel Prize not because of relativity; it was physics way too advanced for his time. Even till now, the number of people who could really really understand relativity is only a handful.</p>
