              <p>Actually, i felt that this year's budget is so-so...not the best but not the worst.  From what the Govt is budgetting i believe...that they are very worried about the economy for this coming year. </p>
              <p>Did anyone remember the FM mentioning that they(the govt) are looking into ways to "tap" the reserves for next year? I suppose what they mean was to either draw or somehow reduce the money going into the reserve. </p>
              <p>I can almost see why they withdrew Estate Duty.  They want the rich people to live and park their assets here.(Good or bad i dont know)</p>
              <p>Truth is, it's easier for the rich people to AVOID paying taxes on their income( or company revenue). You know the like. lawyers to find a loop hole and exploit it...type  Something like the F1 driver hamilton living in switzerland with a small house to avoid the higher tax bracket.</p>
              <p>The only way to tax the rich is to tax their consumption.  You can declare you own nothing, are in bad debts while living in a huge bungalow on a 10 million dollar plot of land but you will have to eat drink take a dump and sleep.  So GST is the way to go and "catch" these people.</p>
              <p>Gst drawback is that it is a consumption tax - it makes consumption a more "luxurious" good instead.  So if you are really hard up, you will be unable to consume alot of things. (not that it is a bad thing to deter the spendthrift but it really ruins people who wants to splurge on occasions)</p>
              <p>The poor and not so well off owe little and can be taxed little anyway.</p>
              <p>By the way, not matter what happens, HK has a big brother to bring everything in their economy back under control by force. We sadly do not have such backups.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My only grouch is that because we are a FREE economy, we get strangled by</p>
              <p>the banks(i know economy is not doing well but housing loans ARE high vs savings rates these days ridiculous to be loaning 3-4% and giving back only 0.25% - 0.5% wth?!!)</p>
              <p>the petroleum companies ( govt declare openly liaoz they get a FIXED tax per litre which means that the petroleum companies are the culprits because they want to maintain profit margins Ie, they must have a profit of say 20% so if they fork out $1 dollar for petrol, they must make 20c profit but if they fork out $2dollars they have to make 40cents even though it's the same amount of petrol!) (Remember, Diesel used to cost only 60-70cents. Now's it's more than $1.5! That's more than double already.)</p>
              <p>What can the the government do when they are so powderful?  "if you dont let the economy be free, we will shift the operations NORTH" then we die more</p>
              <p>What the Govt can only do is to introduce alternative fuels and FAST so with more substitutes the free market will "lower" petrol prices. Problem is that alternative fuels are slow to come.  R&amp;D will take time. *sigh*. Subsidising petrol/ price ceiling will by the way means you are subsidising the RICH more since the really poor dont own a car. For the middle income, it's always kenna squeeze in the balls.</p>
              <p>For those who wonder why Singapore Petroleum dont start selling lower prices - you will have to study economics for a detailed explaination (oligopoly + if you are not the big boys). The end result will still be make it not so profitable to here they will move operations north.</p>
              <p>I can rant on forever...........</p>

              <p><br>The thing is, for most countries a budget of $6 billion is more than enough for defence expenditure.</p>
              <p>Did you show similar countries in size having a higher expenditure in defence?</p>
              <p>I agree that defence is important for Singapore, but what is a appropriate amount.</p>
              <p>We see countries like Malaysia and Indonesia without enlistment spending like $2 billion to $3 billion, whereas Singapore decides to spend $10.5 billion.</p>
              <p>Burnei only has a defence expenditure of $291 million, isn't Brunei with it's oil rich resources more at risk of being annexed by other countries.</p>
              <p>What is an appropriate amount for defence expenditure $10 billion, $20 billion, $40 billion, $80 billion?</p>
              <p>Since you conclude that Sweden, Denmark and Switzerland can do with less expenditure on defence, I conclude that Singapore can also have less</p>
              <p>expenditure on defence. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>SAF has no business with Internal Security, then why are they being deployed to look for Mas Selamat Kastari?</p>
              <p>The efficiency with which SAF captures Mas Selamat Kastari is a reflection of the effectiveness of the $10.5 billion in defence budget.</p>

              <p>I can't believe you think the overiding factor in deciding how much to spend in defence is the size of your country.</p>

              <p>That's so moronic. Proximity/vulnerbility doesn't matter? Allies? No?</p>

              <p>Where do you think the money's going? See the new camps to give soldiers better accomodation? These increase morale and reduce resentment over reservist training. Who benefits? Can I hear an "I do"?</p>

              <p>Like the earlier post to sgdiehard.</p>
              <p>Brunei is an oil resource rich country, isn't Brunei afraid that the country will be annexed.</p>
              <p>Why is Brunei's defence budget only $291 million?</p>
              <p>The point of contention with sgdiehard was, is the GST of $6 billion enough to fund the defence budget for another small country such as Hong Kong.</p>
              <p>If it is enough, then the GST and defence budget will negate itself, thereby showing a better benefits distributed by the Hong Kong government (because Hong Kong does not have GST and defence) than the Singapore government.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Huh? Taiwan military inferior? On what data did you base your assessment? Maybe you can share with us?</p>

              <p>lionnoisy does not present facts and information in an unbias manner, he is subscribed to promoting the P4P propaganda.</p>
              <p>I prefer to read and translate myself, words lose their meaning when being passed down the channels, especially if you have a bias person doing the translation.</p>

              <p><br>The scope of the USA military is much wider, they are not restricted to a small island such as Singapore.</p>
              <p>They have bases in most parts of the world.</p>
              <p>Whereas the SAF is only restricted to a small area of influence.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We are not even talking about cutting of budget now to look for a known terrorist, why are you circumventing to a different topic.</p>
              <p>Has the budget been cut now? It's still $10.5 billion for the defence of Singapore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>How well a military organisation plans and coordinate it's action is a clear reflection of it's efficiency and effectiveness.</p>
              <p>Obviously there wasn't any plan or coordination, because more than a week has past and Singapore's No.1 Terrorist suspect still evades capture.</p>
