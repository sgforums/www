              <p>well i guess we can go on and speculate where does the money kept in the reserves go to but the intention sounds logical and that is to keep  excellent reserves. You can give away everything and run the risk of low reserves - when a credit crunch or when SARs or when Chicken Flu hits - you need money from the reserves to ensure that the economy is minimally hit. - this is of cos an option - make the people happy now and if nothing happens, great!</p>
              <p>The other option is what Singapore took - be more cautious - keep a huge reserves - maybe the people will not be 100% happy - maybe just 50% happy but when a crisis happens, we will have money to still keep people happy enough. I believe, no matter how much i criticise the government, we are one of the few countries whose economy is not seriously crippled when SARs and Chicken Flu hits...where does the money come from? Comes from us of cos but at least well used by them in times of crisis.</p>
              <p>Well thats my opinion anyway, i guess no one will can be fully pleased.</p>

              <p>Having reserves is good, but having an excessive reserve like those of NKF is bad, all Durai could ever think about was exploiting those reserves for his own personal benefits, such as having solid gold taps, washbasins, etc., taking flights in first class airlines and living in first class hotels. Finally all the donations from hard earned savings from donors that trickled down to kidney patients was only $0.10 per dollar.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Are you that naive to think that the government will actually dig into it's deep pockets to help Singaporeans if SARS or Chicken Flu were to hit Singapore?</p>
              <p>We have a case history of SARS? How much was used to help stabilised the economy (like what you purport to say)?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We had a Bird Flu situation in Malaysia afew years back, where poultry and eggs was banned from Malaysia and prices skyrocketed.</p>
              <p>How much of this so called reserves were used to stabilise the prices of eggs? Eggs before the crisis was around $0.15, subsequently skyrocketed to $0.50 to $0.60.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Maybe some doomsday event did occur in Singapore and our beloved P4P government did dig into it's deep pocket to help those victims.</p>
              <p>Could you name any such events? Surely there must be at least one event through your years of existence.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Everyday you hear of foreclosures of HDB due to homeowners inability to make payments. Lately there was a case of 7 household members being forced to lived in the void decks. How much did the government dig into it's coffers to help these people?</p>

              <p>i do not think that SG reserve is excessively huge in terms of todays global market.  I believe SG trade is 3 or 4 times that of sg domestics consumption. So SG is always influence by outside,  remember the 97 financial sell off cris the reserved is only a small pcs of defence against throwing SG $ out the window. So i think need to look at relative terms of consideration in the global financial enviornment rather than comparing in domestics issue.</p>

              <p><br><span style="color: darkred;">Salary Expectations<br>A recent graduate can expect between US$20,000 to US$31,000 per year. Chinese New Year bonuses in the amount of one month's salary are given by most employers at the end of January or beginning of February. Most companies pay in Hong Kong dollars and salaries are often quoted in HK$ per month. When negotiating a salary in Hong Kong it is important to make sure both sides know which currency is being discussed.<br><br>http://www.amcham.org.hk/hongkong/employment.html#cost<br><br>Median household monthly income in the third quarter grew to HKD 16,700, up 4.4% on the same period last year, while the median individual monthly salary rose 2% to HKD 10,000.<br><br>http://www.news.gov.hk/en/category/businessandfinance/061123/html/061123en03002.htm<br><br>Average household income is HKD 18,884 and 30.6% (HKD 5,779) goes to housing.<br><br>http://www.censtatd.gov.hk/hong_kong_statistics/statistical_tables/index.jsp?charsetID=1&amp;tableID=54B<br><br>Average cost of 61.6 sq.m apartment = HKD 1,000,000<br><br>http://www.housingauthority.gov.hk/en/aboutus/news/pressreleases/0,,2-0-15512--0,00.html<br><br><strong>Time required for an average household to purchase apartment in Hong Kong:<br><br>(HKD 1,000,000 / HKD 5,779) / 12 months = 14.42 years</strong><br>====================================================<br><br>Average household income is SGD SGD 3,244 and 22.4% (SGD 727) goes to housing.<br><br>http://www.singstat.gov.sg/pdtsvc/pubn/softcopy/hes2003.pdf<br><br>Average cost of 3 room HDB apartment in Singapore = SGD 170,000<br><br><strong>Time required for an average household to purchase an apartment in Singapore:<br><br>(SGD 170,000 / SGD 727) / 12 months = 19.49 years.</strong><br><br>====================================================<br><br><strong>Conclusion: an average Singaporean would take 5 years longer than their Hong Kong counterparts to finish paying off their housing loan.</strong></span><br><br>Have you the faintest idea what is "reserves" in Singapore context? Where does the reserves come from? Do you know what is happening to OUR reserves now? Having a budget deficit once or a few times in a while is not the end of the world, it gives the economy time to restructure and focus on areas of development (instead of seeing your fellow citizens ending up on the MRT tracks as roadkill, in this case, track kill). Business cycles is not a linear line, it goes up it comes down, it's cyclical.<br><br>Have you analyse their budget 2006/2007? To increase taxes so that you can spend on areas to help stimulate the economy is one thing, increasing taxes so that you can have a bigger pay is another. In economics, it's called "Moral Hazard", a situation in which one of the parties to a contract has an incentive, after the contract is agreed, to act in a manner that brings benefits to himself at the expense of the other party to the contract.<br><br>In corporate finance, it's not good to have too much reserves, because it lowers your Return on Equity (ROE). That's why Singtel decided on a share buyback to reduce it's reserves, because they can't make that rate of return expected from them by the market. e.g. There is a difference between making a $10 profit with $200 and $100. $200: ROE = 5%; $100: ROE = 10%.<br><br>Do you know that the recent depreciation, since mid 2004 has resulted in a loss of 10% of our reserves? I would not discount a 15% to 20% loss of our reserves in afew years time.<br><br>[(1.71 - 1.54) / 1.71] X 100% = 9.94%<br><br>Why did such loss occur? A rigid system like ours will lead to more problems, because of it's inability to react to external circumstances with an appropriate response. Having 82 "Yes Sir!" people in the cabinet is not going to yield dynamic change.<br><br>You don't have to go Hong Kong to ask them about their lives, you ask me or any average Singaporean and they will tell you their lives.<br><br>According to "the Economist: world in figures 2007", Hong Kong's purchasing power is ranked 15th (77.7), whereas Singapore is ranked 24th (70.8 ); (USA = 100)<br><br>I admire you, you get all your information from ChannelNewsAsia, you are one smart aleck. Judging yourself in the mirror, you will always look perfect. But having others judge you is impartial.</p>

              <p><br>Huh?</p>
              <p>Hong Kong does not have GST 0%.</p>
              <p>Singapore has GST which is going to be $6 billion (2007) to $7 billion this year.</p>
              <p>You are comparing no GST with 7% GST, NOT 5% GST with 7% GST.</p>
              <p>Quite obviously you are quantitatively challenged, either that or you trying to distort facts</p>
              <p>and figures to twist your way out of truth.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>$5 billion is more than enough for a small country's defence budget.</p>
              <p>If Singapore decides to spend $100 billion on defence, is that going to be a global standard?</p>
              <p>Singapore's defence budget is too excessive, Taiwan (a much bigger country) preparing for war with China has a defence budget of $7.9 billion,</p>
              <p>while Singapore a small dot has $5.6 billion during peace time.</p>
              <p>Isn't this disproportionate?</p>

              <p>Huh? Since when I used rent subsidy to calculate housing prices?</p>
              <p>Do you mean that since Singapore's public housing is subsidise, so we shouldn't compare with Hong Kong's subsidised public housing?</p>
              <p>These are the prices paid by citizens in Hong Kong and Singapore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ok. Finally understood your point. You meant I used the housing statistic from Hong Kong census to calculate repayment period for mortgages.</p>
              <p>Obviously the "rent" housing there meant what Hong Konger's spend on housing, else there would be no expenses for housing.</p>
              <p>It's an annual census, so obviously not everyone rents an apartment (some purchase while others rent), it's the amount the Hong Kongers spend on housing.</p>
              <p>If you have a better statistical amount from the census on the Hong Konger's spend on housing, please share then, because that is the amount that</p>
              <p>Hong Konger's spend on housing in a census conducted by the Hong Kong government.</p>
              <p>I do try my best to present my data objectively and not try to distort figures (like others, I shall not mention names) by comparing public housing with private housing. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Another flaw in your argument being, I used "rents" to calculate mortgage payments, if you consider that the usage of rental subsidy to make payments to mortgages </strong><strong>is too unfair. Then maybe I should use another figure higher than the "rentals subsidy", therefore shortening the repayment period for the mortgage for public housing in Hong Kong. Generally, rentals </strong><strong>are smaller in amount than mortgage repayments.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>I like the way you shoot yourself in the foot without even realising it. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Funny how you compare Hong Kong's public housing with Hong Kong's private housing.</p>
              <p>Are you asking me to compare Hong Kong's private housing with Singapore's public housing?</p>

              <p><br>Whatever they decide to spend on Defence is their discretion, they can spend $100 billion on defence, but does that mean that all the other countries will follow.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The figures from Global Security is from 2005, it's what some countries around the world spend on defence.</p>
              <p>It not used to state that it's our budget for the year 2008, it's already stated 2005 in the report.</p>
              <p>I used the compilation to show what other bigger countries are spending in defence around the world.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You mean to tell me $6 billion is not enough for a small country to spend on defence?</p>
              <p>Maybe you should read the list of countries with less than $6 billion budget on defence.</p>
              <p>Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Belgium and Switzerland.</p>
              <p>Maybe the Minister of Defence for those countries are not as smart as you.</p>

              <p>What are you working as now? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>With regards to your accentuation on our inflated defence budget, I have only this remark to add.</p>
              <p>After spending $10.5 billion in our defence forces, we can't even catch a soon to be 50 year old limping uncle (Singapore's No.1 Suspect Terrorist Mas Selamat Kastari). <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>How does that make you feel?</p>
              <p>Was the money well spent?</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>We don't decide our budget following other examples, no country does that.</p>
              <p>Why do you think $6 Billion is enough? just don't tell me if other countries can do it with 5 we should do it with 6. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>
              <p>Do you know why Denmark, Sweden, Switzerland can do it with less than 6? I am not as smart as them, that's why they are defence ministers. Obvious isn't it?  you think I work as defence minister? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"><img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>From what you said, we should have the SAF takes over the internal security of Singapore. Do you serve NS? are you a singaporean? never read your post at the military nuts.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>

              <p>I can't believe you think the overiding factor in deciding how much to spend in defence is the size of your country.</p>

              <p>That's so moronic. Proximity/vulnerbility doesn't matter? Allies? No?</p>

              <p>Where do you think the money's going? See the new camps to give soldiers better accomodation? These increase morale and reduce resentment over reservist training. Who benefits? Can I hear an "I do"?</p>

              <p>Ever been to a Taiwan military camp? Would you like to serve there? Seriously, it's almost as if you're addicted to comparing with countries that are inferior.</p>
