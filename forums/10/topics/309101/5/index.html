              <p>Actually, i felt that this year's budget is so-so...not the best but not the worst.  From what the Govt is budgetting i believe...that they are very worried about the economy for this coming year. </p>
              <p>Did anyone remember the FM mentioning that they(the govt) are looking into ways to "tap" the reserves for next year? I suppose what they mean was to either draw or somehow reduce the money going into the reserve. </p>
              <p>I can almost see why they withdrew Estate Duty.  They want the rich people to live and park their assets here.(Good or bad i dont know)</p>
              <p>Truth is, it's easier for the rich people to AVOID paying taxes on their income( or company revenue). You know the like. lawyers to find a loop hole and exploit it...type  Something like the F1 driver hamilton living in switzerland with a small house to avoid the higher tax bracket.</p>
              <p>The only way to tax the rich is to tax their consumption.  You can declare you own nothing, are in bad debts while living in a huge bungalow on a 10 million dollar plot of land but you will have to eat drink take a dump and sleep.  So GST is the way to go and "catch" these people.</p>
              <p>Gst drawback is that it is a consumption tax - it makes consumption a more "luxurious" good instead.  So if you are really hard up, you will be unable to consume alot of things. (not that it is a bad thing to deter the spendthrift but it really ruins people who wants to splurge on occasions)</p>
              <p>The poor and not so well off owe little and can be taxed little anyway.</p>
              <p>By the way, not matter what happens, HK has a big brother to bring everything in their economy back under control by force. We sadly do not have such backups.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My only grouch is that because we are a FREE economy, we get strangled by</p>
              <p>the banks(i know economy is not doing well but housing loans ARE high vs savings rates these days ridiculous to be loaning 3-4% and giving back only 0.25% - 0.5% wth?!!)</p>
              <p>the petroleum companies ( govt declare openly liaoz they get a FIXED tax per litre which means that the petroleum companies are the culprits because they want to maintain profit margins Ie, they must have a profit of say 20% so if they fork out $1 dollar for petrol, they must make 20c profit but if they fork out $2dollars they have to make 40cents even though it's the same amount of petrol!) (Remember, Diesel used to cost only 60-70cents. Now's it's more than $1.5! That's more than double already.)</p>
              <p>What can the the government do when they are so powderful?  "if you dont let the economy be free, we will shift the operations NORTH" then we die more</p>
              <p>What the Govt can only do is to introduce alternative fuels and FAST so with more substitutes the free market will "lower" petrol prices. Problem is that alternative fuels are slow to come.  R&amp;D will take time. *sigh*. Subsidising petrol/ price ceiling will by the way means you are subsidising the RICH more since the really poor dont own a car. For the middle income, it's always kenna squeeze in the balls.</p>
              <p>For those who wonder why Singapore Petroleum dont start selling lower prices - you will have to study economics for a detailed explaination (oligopoly + if you are not the big boys). The end result will still be make it not so profitable to here they will move operations north.</p>
              <p>I can rant on forever...........</p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">One also has to take into account the government's petrol tax of $0.44 per litre in Singapore</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">In other countries, the government provides subsidies for petrol to help it's citizens maintain a decent living.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Whereas, in Singapore we are not even asking for subsidies, we hope that the government will lay of it's petrol tax,</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">instead the government decides to make profit at the expense of her citizens by imposing petrol taxes despite the current inflated price of oil.</span></p>

              <p>Rather than drift further from the topic that you have started,</p>
              <p>let's set things straight, even if i pay YOU the 10 billion dollars, i doubt you can catch that twit in a month.</p>
              <p>Next, SAF is an armed force against armed elements. They may have the manpower to deploy, they sure arent trained to plan how to catch crooks in HDB build up areas.</p>
              <p>If you want to question, try looking at the SPF.</p>
              <p>So rather than you skirt the hinting of how much SAF sucks and fails in this game of hide and seek with Kasturi, i rather you drop the issue.</p>
              <p>I'm going to bed. Yeah i need my beauty sleep. I'm too dumb and ugly to fight with you. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>P.S.  If you had read that post of mine proper. You would have noticed - poor people cannot afford to own cars and drive them.</p>
              <p>If you SUBSIDISE fuel, you will be subsidising the rich more than the pizza hut delivery man, the postman and the taxi driver will ever spend on diesel. Even if you dont tax fuel, you just make driving around in a limo cheaper for those can already are driving the limos mercs porsche and bmws.</p>
              <p>The lack of tax so what?  There's no guarantee that petrol prices will fall by the exact 0.44 cents per litre anyway.  There's not even a clean breakdown on how much the companny earns per litre of fuel now. Even worst, oil hits 110 then prices go up by 50 cents...what are you going to do then.</p>
              <p>Now, if you are talking subsidising public transport then that's something worth considering.</p>

              <span style="color: #ff0000;">Singapore, which prides itself on rigorous anti-terrorist measures, yesterday blamed a security lapse for the escape of an alleged leader of the Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) militant network. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Authorities mounted a massive manhunt as analysts said Mas Selamat bin Kastari, accused of planning to hijack a plane and crash it into Changi Airport, would try to flee to Indonesia. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">"This should never have happened. I'm sorry that it has," Home Affairs Minister Wong Kan Seng (é»ƒæ ¹æˆ�) told parliament. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Rohan Gunaratna, head of the International Center for Political Violence and Terrorism Research, said Kastari had escaped once when he was in Indonesia, but his flight from the Singapore facility was unexpected. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">"I think that it has surprised the Singapore authorities and everyone because Singapore's security systems are world-class," he said. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">The ministry said Kastari walks with a limp and was not known to be armed. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">It said he escaped on Wednesday afternoon from the Whitley Road Detention Center, which holds prisoners detained by the Internal Security Department. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Wong said Kastari had been taken from his cell to the family visit room to await his family. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">"He asked to go to the toilet, where he escaped," Wong said. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">The minister was responding to a member of parliament who said the escape "raised concerns about our police force vigilance and security operating procedures."</span></p>

              <p><br>The thing is, for most countries a budget of $6 billion is more than enough for defence expenditure.</p>
              <p>Did you show similar countries in size having a higher expenditure in defence?</p>
              <p>I agree that defence is important for Singapore, but what is a appropriate amount.</p>
              <p>We see countries like Malaysia and Indonesia without enlistment spending like $2 billion to $3 billion, whereas Singapore decides to spend $10.5 billion.</p>
              <p>Burnei only has a defence expenditure of $291 million, isn't Brunei with it's oil rich resources more at risk of being annexed by other countries.</p>
              <p>What is an appropriate amount for defence expenditure $10 billion, $20 billion, $40 billion, $80 billion?</p>
              <p>Since you conclude that Sweden, Denmark and Switzerland can do with less expenditure on defence, I conclude that Singapore can also have less</p>

              <p>The efficiency with which SAF captures Mas Selamat Kastari is a reflection of the effectiveness of the $10.5 billion in defence budget.</p>

              <p>Secondly, even if I were to do it, I consider my opinion has some value because I have served NS, your opinion got no backing because you know nothing about defence. So you can't do it just because I do it. We don't spend more money on defence just because others do it, neither do we spend less because some other countries are spending less. We spend what we deem is necessary and what we can afford. Do you know why we need the Eagle, Leopard? you think for the zoo huhh.... Have a mind of your own lah, don't just copy, or cut and paste, aiyoo <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/embarrassed.png" alt="embarrassed.png"><img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/wink.png" alt="wink.png"> </p>
              <p>Because you don't serve NS, you don't know what SAF is trained for, but, when the police need manpower, why can't they just ask the army to help, if there is a flood or something in singapore, SAF soldiers might also be asked to help. You think the SAF is trained for tsunami huh?? but they were great help in Indonesia. The more you talk, the more you show your ignorance, and stupidity.</p>

              <p>Rather than drift further from the topic that you have started,</p>
              <p>let's set things straight, even if i pay YOU the 10 billion dollars, i doubt you can catch that twit in a month.</p>
              <p>Next, SAF is an armed force against armed elements. They may have the manpower to deploy, they sure arent trained to plan how to catch crooks in HDB build up areas.</p>
              <p>If you want to question, try looking at the SPF.</p>
              <p>So rather than you skirt the hinting of how much SAF sucks and fails in this game of hide and seek with Kasturi, i rather you drop the issue.</p>
              <p>I'm going to bed. Yeah i need my beauty sleep. I'm too dumb and ugly to fight with you. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>P.S.  If you had read that post of mine proper. You would have noticed - poor people cannot afford to own cars and drive them.</p>
              <p>If you SUBSIDISE fuel, you will be subsidising the rich more than the pizza hut delivery man, the postman and the taxi driver will ever spend on diesel. Even if you dont tax fuel, you just make driving around in a limo cheaper for those can already are driving the limos mercs porsche and bmws.</p>
              <p>The lack of tax so what?  There's no guarantee that petrol prices will fall by the exact 0.44 cents per litre anyway.  There's not even a clean breakdown on how much the companny earns per litre of fuel now. Even worst, oil hits 110 then prices go up by 50 cents...what are you going to do then.</p>
              <p>Now, if you are talking subsidising public transport then that's something worth considering.</p>

              <p>If you give me 10 billions with 100% authority over SAF, I guarantee 100% I will catch Mas Selamat Kastari if he is really still in Singapore, but the issue is,</p>
              <p>do you have 10 billions to give me?</p>
              <p>Is the SAF checking forested areas or HDB? From what I know from the news, seems that their search is limited to forested areas.</p>
              <p>You have the police checking the built up areas and the SAF checking the forested areas, after 9 days, Mas Selamat Kastari the soon to be 50 year old</p>
              <p>limping man escapes detection.</p>
              <p>SAF not train to do search and destroy mission? Means if there is suspected enemy soldiers in a forest, they can't search and locate the enemy? Aren't you making a cuckoo of the army?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Only rich man drives car?</p>
              <p>I suggest you take a visit to the multi-storey carparks of 3-Room HDB flats.</p>
              <p>Then tell me what are those things stationary on the car parking lots.</p>
              <p>From your analysis, there must be lots of "rich" man living in 3-Room HDB flats.</p>
              <p>Some of these car owners (your so called rich man), does sales or otherwise, where the use of public transport will</p>
              <p>not be economically viable or feasible.</p>
              <p>These are the people disadvantaged by the higher cost of petrol, instead of richer man who drives a Ferrari, Porsche, Rolls Royce, etc.</p>
              <p>If the government truly wants to penalise the rich from their use of cars, maybe a higher road tax on higher capacity cars, instead of an</p>
              <p>all out tax on petrol which is used by the poor and the rich.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What a government derives from taxes, spends on social infrastructure to improve it, is a clear representation of how the government cherish it's citizens.</p>
              <p>The excess taxes that is derived from the P4P government, is it spent on social infrastructure, or put back in it's already bludgeoning reserves.</p>
              <p>Were there increases in marginal social benefits from the income derived from surpluses in the budget?</p>

              <p>Rather than drift further from the topic that you have
              started,</p>
              <p>let's set things straight, even if i pay YOU the 10 billion
              dollars, i doubt you can catch that twit in a month.</p>
              <p>Next, SAF is an armed force against armed elements. They may
              have the manpower to deploy, they sure arent trained to plan how to
              catch crooks in HDB build up areas.</p>
              <p>If you want to question, try looking at the SPF.</p>
              <p>So rather than you skirt the hinting of how much SAF sucks
              and fails in this game of hide and seek with Kasturi, i rather you
              drop the issue.</p>
              <p>I'm going to bed. Yeah i need my beauty sleep. I'm too dumb and
              ugly to fight with you. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>P.S.  If you had read that post of mine proper. You would
              have noticed - poor people cannot afford to own cars and drive
              them.</p>
              <p>If you SUBSIDISE fuel, you will be subsidising the rich more
              than the pizza hut delivery man, the postman and the taxi driver
              will ever spend on diesel. Even if you dont tax fuel, you just make
              driving around in a limo cheaper for those can already are driving
              the limos mercs porsche and bmws.</p>
              <p>The lack of tax so what?  There's no guarantee that petrol
              prices will fall by the exact 0.44 cents per litre anyway. 
              There's not even a clean breakdown on how much the companny earns
              per litre of fuel now. Even worst, oil hits 110 then prices go up
              by 50 cents...what are you going to do then.</p>
              <p>Now, if you are talking subsidising public transport then that's
              something worth considering.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>1) It is not subsidy. Just a reduction of petrol tax... you won't subsidize the rich at all because you are not even giving a subsidy.</p>
              <p>2) There are many people who use their car for a living; it is a necessity for them. Yes, they may be middle class, but this middle class is still a large group in Singapore. Not only that, industries which require delivery of goods are all affected. This includes the delivery cost of the truck that delivers eggs everyday to your nearby supermarket. Cost price of many things will rise indirectly (including the necessity goods) and this will affect the poor. It is all linked.</p>
              <p>3) Public transport companies are using rising fuel prices as the basis for raising their fares (recent example is the taxi companies). Reduction of the taxes on fuel will thus reduce the viability of this 'excuse'.</p>
              <p>4) We are not even asking for a subsidy; but merely a reduction in the tax such that the increase in the fuel prices can be cushioned a little.</p>

              <p><br>Thanks for posting irrelevant data about Private Housing.</p>
              <p>Another point I would like to add, if the Hong Kong government didn't provide as much public housing and making heaps of profits, like our Singapore government.</p>
              <p>Then despite the excess profits HDB made from it's sales of "public" housing, it is not distributing it's reserves to her citizens, instead it is amassing mountainous reserves.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyway, the topic is about Hong Kong's Budget, not about other issues.</p>

              <p>1) Usable land area is not by research. It was information gained from visiting Hong Kong and taking their information booklet quite a few years ago. And I don't think usable land area will change by a lot within a few years</p>
              <p>2) okok, 4.58 mil. My typo mistake there.</p>
              <p>3) I fail to see how money and political will can solve a land problem when land is a natural resource. The amount of land is fixed. Or you would support cases like when LTA was offering to pay a specific condo $1 for the carpark space?</p>
              <p>4) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">BTW,HK gavaman now depends much for high land price.high
                                          property prices and related income to survive</span>.</p>
              <p>This is a strong statement. You need proof.</p>
              <p>5) If the usable land area is same as singapore and population is higher by near to 2.4 million (52.8% more than Singapore's population), you would expect the demand for land to be much higher than Singapore's current demand. So by raising Singapore's population, you would definitely raise demand on land in Singapore, and land price will further increase. Remember land is not only used for residential purposes.</p>
              <p>Suppose we don't count by usable land area, but by total land area, including land that cannot be built upon. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_population_density">Hong Kong has already higher population density than Singapore.</a> If our population is to be raised to 5.5 million, our population density will then be <span style="text-decoration: underline;">7812.5 per square kilometre, an increase of 1443.5 from the current population density.</span> Land prices will only further increase. It is a simple case of demand and supply. Either that or you make every single person in Singapore stay in a smaller and more cramp HDB flat.</p>
              <p>So, in conclusion of point 5, your support for increasing population in Singapore contradicts your post of supporting Singapore over Hong Kong because of lower residential and land prices.</p>

              <p>The revenue estimates I posted already shows taxes is 50% of the government's revenue.</p>
              <p>The "other revenue" doesn't specifically state that it is land sales.</p>
              <p>Quite amazing that you miraculously point out that land sales is in "other revenue", when land sales is an outright capital account item.</p>
              <p>Maybe you can show me where you managed to extract the information that "other revenue" is land sales.</p>
              <p>In case you don't understand, there is a difference between revenue accounts and capital accounts.</p>
              <p>Singapore don't have stamp duties and exorbitant land sales prices?</p>
