              <p>Hong Kong is not a country. You can either say Singapore is prudent or Hong Kong is extravagant. That said, I rather they distribute the profits from land sales as it is not a significant portion of our reserves and some ppl (don't mind me but I'm not saying you) can just STFU.</p>

              <p>i dunno anything about singapore budget. mi dont care about
              singapore budget either. or course what u read LOOKS nice lar.
              where got pple so stupid will put something up that looks like shit
              one. u really think so caring meh? what makes u think it seems good
              even. u need to go to hongkong and live a while.</p>
              <p>dunno what's with pple in singapore. readread info and soak it
              in only. but dunno anything else that's outside of what they read.
              and only know how to complain and whine that other places are so
              much better, get so much etc etc etc. but in reality, life in
              singapore is so much better than so many other places. tsk. so
              ignorant. never been to other places but wanna say life there is
              better. :roll:</p>
              <p>i wasnt comparing. i was wondering what makes you think that
              what u read is so good. i was talking about Hongkong and hongkong
              oni. ur the one comparing, that's why you say it's good.</p>
              <p>some pple oso bery stupid. earn money in singapore and go
              overseas for holiday. and come back and say that life in the
              country they went to is damn good because everything is cheap etc.
              but they must have conveniently forgotten about the bloody exchange
              rate and they also conveniently forgot to check how much the

              <p>what's disturbing is that our gahmen forecasted that they would have a deficit budget for 2007 and therefore need to raise the gst from 5 to 7% to get the money to help the needy.</p>
              <p>in the end it was from a deficit of $0.5b to a surplus of $6.4b! i would think that the erroneous forecast only shows 2 things: </p>

              <p>so how does the equation works now?</p>
              <p>Amount of Singapore GST revenue + transfers of fund to Beijing = Singapore expenditure on defence??</p>
              <p>Or Singapore expenditure on defence - GST revenue = transfer of fund to Beijing??</p>
              <p>you sure you know what you are talking about?<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>

              <p><br>Since you don't understand, then I will elaborate further.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Singapore has defence spending expense and GST revenue. They more or less cancel each other out.</p>
              <p>Singapore's GST revenue for 2008 is going to approximate to $6 billion to $7 billion.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hong Kong does not have this defence spending and GST revenue. Equates to zero.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You still have problems understanding?</p>
              <p>Anybody else have problems understanding?</p>

              <p>i was in Hong Kong for work when the budget was announced. All I can say is that anyone who thinks that Hong Kong is a better place to live in, please go there and try. I would choose singapore anytime despite of all its shortcomings.</p>
              <p>People complain Taxi in singapore expensive - try HK taxis.</p>
              <p>People complain MRT in singapore expensive - try the airport express or MTR, they are equally expensive if not more expensive, and much more crowded.</p>
              <p>People complain housing in singapore too expensive - trying finding a 100SQM flat in HK for the kind of price we pay.</p>
              <p>People complain parking in Sg too expensive. - Try parking in HK.</p>
              <p>Everywhere is the same my fren. I talk to taxi drivers in HK and they are just like taxi drivers in Singapore. They complain how unfair their government is! When they know i am from Singapore, they will say wah, your singapore so good, how singapore is so advanced despite being a young country.... so are they wrong? nope. are they totally right? nope....</p>
              <p>its just the the other side of the fence looks better syndrome.</p>

              <p>well i guess if you read the HK newspapers, they are also not totally happy with the budget especially it doesnt really comprehensively cover the senior citizens, i did not read all the commentaries but obviously, no matter how good a budget is, it will never satisfy and cover all angles.</p>
              <p>I am not saying that Singapore's budget is damn good. It has always been the government's policy to provide a means to an end, not using the budget to provide an end to itself. I mean sometimes i wonder, if you have a surplus of $400mllion, why not just give everyone of us $100K cash or $50K cash or whatever, and not what give money to education lah etc etc, how would it help to give me $400 for a whole year but yet u collect GST for every year..... but then that would be terminal thinking, it is not sustainable.</p>
              <p>Again i say, the budgets of both countries have their merits but the dangers with giving too many goodies like what the Finance Minister of HK is doing with his first budgetary speech is that people would expect more and more and eventually there would be groups of people who think they can depend on the government....and thats the last thing we want in our country.</p>

              <p>Well, the important thing is Hong Kong distributed all her surplus to her citizens, though senior citizens might receive more benefits.</p>
              <p>But the main point is Hong Kong distributed all of her surplus.</p>
              <p>What did Singapore do?</p>
              <p>Put the surplus back into the coffers, like how NKF build huge reserves for never to happen calamities.</p>
              <p>They are like another NKF organisation waiting for the plumber to unravel the golden wash basins and taps.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I thought our bald headed Singapore Minister of Finance was a debut budget speech too?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What's the point of building hundreds of billion in surpluses when these surpluses are used to frivolously purchase bad companies?</p>
              <p>What's the point of having "paper" surpluses when citizens who have dire needs have no access to?</p>
              <p>It's like a can see and will never touch surplus.</p>
              <p>While citizens are having financial hardship, they take the opportunity to increase GST to make life more unbearable, not forgetting that they give you an annual GST offset package for afew years to smooth in the transition from 5% to 7%. At the end of the few years of GST offset, they will have increase their revenues by another few billions, while leaving the poor and middle income to suffer the consequence of the increase.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The poor and middle income earners have nothing to gain from the reduction in income taxes, from it's high of 33% for high income earners in the 1980s, to the current reduction to 20%.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In Singapore, only the rich will get richer, while the middle income and the poor get poorer.</p>
