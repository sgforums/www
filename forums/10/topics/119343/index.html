            <div class='col-md body'>i'd be the first here to recommend a change of poly student fares to the same fares as those in jc or sec sch.<br><br>if you're in poly, chances are, the cost of travelling to school can be a killer. especially when there are only 5 polys in singapore, each offering specialised courses not available at other polys, the result is many students travelling across the island at least twice a day to get to school. if not for mrt pass or bus pass, this would readily sap most student's allowance.<br><br>the arguement may be that poly  students have ITP and can earn 400 bucks per semester, but how is it that 400 can even cover transport costs?<br><br>the bus and mrt passes are retailed at approx $40-50 each, so a combined pass would be approx $90. for most students, buying a combined pass would be unaffordable. most of those who live far away simply get the mrt pass. but that leaves bus fares out, which in most cases costs $1.00 to $1.20 per ride.<br><br>we may be earning 400bucks for one semester(that's if you even have ITP at all during your school holidays), but it doesn't mean that money can justify the price we pay for transport in singapore. most poly students come from poor families. i wonder what LTA can say about this</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>As posted to FU:-<br><br>Many suggestions to lower public transport or utility charges had fallen on deaf ears of ministries due to mindset problems on the part of these ministries.<br><br>Recent developments show that medical fees need not be that high. Obviously in the past the ministries concerned turned down public suggestions either to save face or they are not people-oriented and doing enough homeworks.<br><br>Whenever people gave feedbacks against liberal pro-foreign work permit policies, ministries would gave stereotyped replies like asking people not to be choosy or to put the blame on lack of training. The worse is to keep to the old policies of over-relying on foreigners to create jobs. Ministries did not have the correct vision that local businesses also create jobs.<br><br>Our highly paid scholars in various ministries should have the vision to help local businesses survive and create jobs instead of over-relying on foreigners like in the past.<br><br>Now as a result of strong public feedbacks disagreeing with such limited visions of ministries, suddenly there is a newly realized solution - re- design jobs to reduce reliance on Foreigners and preserve more jobs for unemployed citizens.<br><br>So ministries should stop giving numbers and figures to deny admissions of real problems - mindsets.<br><br>Long entrenched meritocracy policy affecting the system of our Education was similarly denied as a problem. Only after more and more people disagree with the over-emphasis on scholars or meritocracy that there is now slowly some change from promoting EM1 to promoting all students. Broad-based education as successfuly implemented by Finland and Switzerland have helped these European countries excel in science and technology and practical knowledge application doing away with all the hype about scholars etc.<br><br>The change to the highly pressurized Mother tongue (CL1) policy finally was another example that past policy might be wrong or over-killed.<br><br>Lately Public Transport council's willingness to admit that bus and MRT fares should use its commercial premises rental to help offset further fee increases is yet another instance that autocratic tax-and-recover cost-centre approach in charging at all departments might not work as such policies would persistently produce high costs.<br><br>Civil participation is not acknowledged due to human nature in not admitting mistakes but these recent changes to past strongly emphasised meritocracy and high cost policies should show that without civil participation and knowledge application, the past can never change.<br><br>The "voting by the feet" (migration) reaction of people helps. Election time helps. Previous ministers or senior civil servants who regularly denied problems or suggestions from people on medical, transport and other problems should now realize that they had fallen short of entrepreneurship or mindset change.<br><br>If people know the solutions they should be able to know them too and should change or help persuade higher up to agree to change. Justifications like WITS or QCs that did not work should be admitted and more competitive training of civil servants adopted to create values for monies to customers and tax payers. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The government is elected to discharge certain duties and responsibilities to its citizens. There appear to be a dire lack of understanding of such duties over the years in that provisions of essential services are being passed off to non-government bodies or GLCs etc under schemes of corporatization etc which final objectives only served to reduce such duties and responsibilities to citizens.<br><br>At one time, security in any apartments or housing estates are covered by the government. Over the years not just security but a whole host of other local and municipal responsibilities have been progressively transferred to private management corporations. Even in areas of enforcements of fire regulations and traffic controls, government nowadays has less to do and more to charge and tax.<br><br>Transport, medical, utilities and education one by one are being passed off through corporatisation etc to GLCs or even NTUC enabling government to profit from expenditure savings and surpluses. The original tax allocations were not passed back to the citizens.<br><br>The tendency to corporatize and pass off government responsibilities and duties to citizens in Transport, medical and utilities etc is persistent. Minister Khaw Boon Woon is thinking of doing the same thing by corporatizing certain specialist medical treatments to private consultants which will no doubt result in another round of medical cost increases and lowering of service level.<br><br>It is suggested that each time any ministry is thinking of passing off duties to GLCs or private sector to save on its own costs, a portion of the taxes attributable to such services shall be put into an endowment pr capital funds from which any shortfall, inefficiencies or extraordinary expenditures can be jointly funded from such reserved expenditure witheld or owed to the people.<br><br>It is like sinking fund in the management corporations to be used for specific situations which can be defined objectively by panels of experts.<br><br>This inequity is confirmed by MediaCorp's CEO's latest revelation that one of the reason why MediaCorp cannot survive or stay profitable is that the licence fees on TV/radio are collected and kept by the government and the whole TV stations have then have to recover costs of operations purely from end users. Quality of the TV programs if affected is clearly caused by government's single-minded determination to avoid discharge of its duties and responsibilities to citizens and to create surpluses which at the end of the day only jack up costs of living to citizens and making the economy uncompetitive.<br><br>Lands acquired using tax payers' fund should not be sold at market prices again to citizens for basic housing and essential services. Land rentals should not be charged for utilities, education, medical or even LTA services. Only a certain percentage of state lands should be permitted to be sold at market prices to private sector for commercial and relevant development otherwise the costs of living and doing business in Singapore will keep going up.<br><br>Hospital and medical services should not be corporatised just to retain good doctor. People pay taxes to fund part of infrastructural medical costs through GST, personal and corporate taxes and medishield and all kinds of schemes.<br><br>They should not be short-changed in any surreptitious corporate schemes because of the above-stated reasons. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
