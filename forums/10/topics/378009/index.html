              <div id="post_message_2827731">
              <div id="post_message_2827731">SINGAPORE is small enough to be a suburb in Beijing, but it has something in common with the mammoth People's Republic. The little red dot and Red China are both countries the West loves to hate. <br><br>There are those who wish bad things to happen to the Beijing Olympics. Likewise, there are those who have had it in for the Lion City for years. <br><br>What's eating them? The easy answer is that both China and Singapore are authoritarian states. The freedoms taken for granted in the West - freedom of speech and assembly - come with more caveats in these two places. <br><br>But things are not so simple. There are plenty of authoritarian states around, but most do not attract as much attention as Singapore and China. <br><br>The real sin: Singapore and China are examples of countries which are taking a different route to development, and look to be succeeding. <br><br>Success grates, especially when it cocks a snook at much-cherished liberal values. <br><br>As Madam Yeong Yoon Ying, press secretary to Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew, said last month: 'Singapore is an example to other countries of how the free market plus the rule of law, and stable macro-economic policies, can lead to progress and success, but without Western-style 'liberal' democracy.' <br><br>Don't believe her words? Read these lines from British journalist John Kampfner, writing in The Guardian last month, lamenting the spread of what he calls the Singapore model. <br><br>'Why is it that a growing number of highly-educated and well-travelled people are willing to hand over several of their freedoms in return for prosperity or security? This question has been exercising me for months as I work on a book about what I call the 'pact'. <br><br>'The model for this is Singapore, where repression is highly selective. It is confined to those who take a conscious decision openly to challenge the authorities. If you do not, you enjoy freedom to travel, to live more or less as you wish, and - perhaps most important - to make money. Under Lee Kuan Yew, this city-state built on a swamp has flourished economically. <br><br>'I was born in Singapore and have over the years been fascinated by my Chinese Singaporean friends. Doctors, financiers and lawyers, they have studied in London, Oxford, Harvard and Sydney. They have travelled across all continents; they are well-versed in international politics, but are perfectly content with the situation back home. I used to reassure myself with the old certainty that this model was not applicable to larger, more diverse states. I now believe this to be incorrect. <br><br>'Provincial governments in China send their brightest officials to Singapore to learn the secrets of its 'success'. For Russian politicians it too provides a useful model. These countries, and others in Asia and the Middle East are proving that the free market does not require a free society in which to thrive, and that in any battle between politics and economics, it is the latter that will win out.' <br><br>Mr Kampfner seems in a genuine intellectual funk. He cannot quite understand why otherwise normal, intelligent Singaporeans would trade certain freedoms for economic progress, and accept the Singapore political system for what it is. <br><br>But perhaps he has got the wrong end of the stick. The problem lies not in the Singaporeans, but in his own assumptions. Namely: If you speak English, if you are well-educated and well-travelled, you must also believe in Western-style democracy. They are a package. <br><br>I was on the receiving end of similar assumptions when I was in the United States in 1991-1992. When Americans asked me, 'Why is your English so good?', often it was not out of admiration but bewilderment. Their next question revealed all: 'Why then do you (i.e. your Government) ban chewing gum?' <br><br>Another telling indicator of Western assumptions about Singapore comes from a remark by Singapore's Ambassador to Washington, Professor Chan Heng Chee, who went to the US at the tail end of the Michael Fay saga. <br><br>One year into her posting there, in 1997, she arranged for a retrospective of the late choreographer Goh Choo San's works. Her Washington audience was awed. <br><br>'People suddenly remembered Choo San was a Singaporean. They may have known about Goh Choo San, but to connect him with Singapore was not so obvious for them,' she said. <br><br>Sub-text: World-class choreography does not fit their image of a country with corporal punishment. <br><br>So the real difficulty for the West is this: We are so like them, and yet so not like them. We speak, dress, do business and do up our homes very much the same way as them. Yet when it comes to political values, we settle - apparently - for much less. <br><br>One observer draws an analogy with Pavlovian behavioural conditioning. So conditioned have Westerners become to associating cosmopolitan progress with certain political parameters, they do not know how to react when they encounter a creature - Singapore - that has one but not the other. <br><br>So they chide and berate us, as if we have betrayed a sacred covenant. <br><br>Adding to the iniquity is the fact that countries - rich and powerful ones too, like Russia and the Gulf states - are looking to the Singaporean way of doing things to pick up a tip or two. <br><br>I can imagine the shudders of Singapore's Western detractors should they read about a suggestion made by Mr Kenichi Ohmae this week. <br><br>In an interview with Business Times, the Japanese management consultant who first became famous as author of The Borderless World, said Singapore should 'replicate' itself in other parts of the world. <br><br>What he meant was that Singapore should use its IQ, and IT prowess, to help organise effective economies in other regions, as its own had succeeded so well. <br><br>To be sure, his reasoning was economic, not political. But for those who hate Singapore, a Pax Singaporeana would be something to work against and head off. <br><br><a href="mailto:leehoong@sph.com.sg"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #417e15;">leehoong@sph.com.sg</span></span></a><br><br>Adapted from: <a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/Breaking+News/Singapore/Story/STIStory_266146.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #417e15;">http://www.straitstimes.com/Breaking...ry_266146.html</span></span></a></div>

              <p>What a load of fucking bollocks.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>This blithering idiot's got it arse-end-round and using sleazy money-grubbing ends to justify the means, and he's got the fucking temerity to argue that people are jealous?!  Damn fool's the one who gets up on his hind legs and salivates at the sound of tinkling coins - he's got a fucking lot of nerve talking about Pavlovianism.</p>
              <p>On top of mental retardation, the author also seems to have a good case of amnesia.  Either that or while he's got his arm around China's shoulder, he's just conveniently glossed over how China right royally buttfucked Singapore in broad daylight in Suzhou.  Our friend here's quite happy to take China's cock in his mouth after China's pulled it out of his arse.  Filthy mainlanders probably didn't even bother to wipe it on the curtains first but this floozy doesn't seem to mind.</p>
              <p>It takes a fucking intellectual midget to assume that money is the be-all-and-end-all.  Then again, rumour has it that a frontal lobotomy is part of the induction process at SPH.</p>

              <p>This is one of the typical subtle methods used by the PAP Government to propagate and justify the continuation of their methods unabashedly employed in Singapore.</p>
              <p>It tantamount to thumbing the PAP nose at the "Western detractors" and at the same time justifying their own acts of political arrogance in governing Singapore.</p>
              <p>It is interesting to note that while Mr Kenichi Ohmae - <em><span style="color: #0000ff;">the Japanese management consultant who first became famous as author of The Borderless World</span></em> - was quoted as saying "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">Singapore should 'replicate' itself in other parts of the world</span></em>" - this was as quickly qualified  - "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">To be sure, his reasoning was economic, not political</span></em>." - and with this statement left as an end note.</p>
              <p>Was the author being politically polite so as not to offend the PAP with her statements that detailed accurately the Singapore scene, but hold back the punch lines ?</p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #0000ff;">'Why is it that a growing number of highly-educated and well-travelled people are willing to hand over several of their freedoms in return for prosperity or security? This question has been exercising me for months as I work on a book about what I call the 'pact'.</span></em></p>
              <p>Was there ever a 'pact' between the educated Singaporeans and the PAP, or has it not been a fact that Singaporeans have become apolitical as a result of the methods employed by LKY in dealing with those who dare to challenge him openly ?</p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #0000ff;">'The model for this is Singapore, where repression is highly selective. It is confined to those who take a conscious decision openly to challenge the authorities.</span></em></p>
              <p><em></em><em><span style="color: #0000ff;">If you do not, yo enjoy freedom to travel, to live more or less as you wish, and - perhaps most important - to make money. Under Lee Kuan Yew, this city-state built on a swamp has flourished economically.</span></em></p>
              <p><em></em>It is a fallacy to believe that "under Lee Kuan Yew, this city-state built on a swamp had flourished economically".</p>
              <p>This city-state would have flourished economically - WITH or WITHOUT - Lee Kuan Yew, as it was not Lee but Stamford Raffles who had the foresight to pick this piece of swamp land to build a natural posts that flourished within the first decade.</p>
              <p>Lee Kuan Yew was a devastated person when his dream - for Singapore to be part of a bigger Malaysia - was shattered after Tunku Abdul Rahman decided to kick LKY and Singapore out of Malaysia. LKY had to recuperate for the week at a government owned chalet at Changi Point, while his loyal colleagues Toh Chin Chye, Goh Keng Swee and Rajaratnam held the fort to keep some sense of organised government.</p>
              <p>The vision of converting the swamp into a commercial and industrial metropolis was neither LKY but that of a little known Dutch Consultant - <a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Winsemius">Dr Albert Winsemius (*1) </a>- who had the good fortune of having Dr Goh Keng Swee open minded support to implement the ideas.</p>
              <p>Is there any use for "visionary ideas" without the "support of the masses" ?</p>
              <p>Recognition will need to be given to the Singaporean masses, who were around in the 1960s, and who were willing to put aside the many political differences then, and move together to succeed.</p>
              <p>The motivation then was to prove that this Little Red Dot can make it on our own; even as many saw LKY cried openly on TV - but many were left wondering if it was belated crocodile tears for not listening to better advise against merger, or tears shed for his shattered ambitions after being given a surprise drubbing by Tunku.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans today are by and large dissatisfied with the PAP politics of self-aggrandizement, drowning themselves with self-congratulatory accolades and drunk with their own self-importance.</p>
              <p>Being the political animal that it is, should we be surprised that the PAP have now ungratefully turned against Singaporeans - who had given their support at the most critical moment in the 1960s, and will now threaten to withdraw government support to those Constituencies that voted for the Alternative Political Parties.</p>
              <p>This is Nation Building in the PAP way that the author did not honestly address.</p>
              <p>If there was any "Pact" made between the educated and the PAP - why will there be a continuous brain drain all through the years that make it necessary for the PAP to lament of a lack of talent ?</p>
              <p>Or is this lamenting an excuse to justify a bigger agenda of their own importance that need the parallel monetary compensations ?</p>
              <p>If there was any "Pact" made between the highly educated Singaporean population with the PAP, was it necessary for the PAP to be so insecure of their own political standing that with each election the PAP will need to resort to Third World political methods to deny success to the other Alternative Political Parties ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This propaganda attempt at suggesting a link for Western attitude to exist that will connect Singapore's position with China - is sheer vanity of a small time incorrigible hoodlum attempting to take umbrage with the success of a bigger hoodlum who had begun to turn a new leaf in its own development.</p>
              <p>It will be a surprise for the PAP when it begin to notice the many small steps taken in changing China's Communist ideological methods in governing her citizens, that will gradually evolve into a more open system, while the PAP position continue to be harden with its own insecurity.</p>

              <p>On top of mental retardation, the author also seems to have a good case of amnesia.  Either that or while he's got his arm around China's shoulder, he's just conveniently glossed over how China right royally buttfucked Singapore in broad daylight in Suzhou.  Our friend here's quite happy to take China's cock in his mouth after China's pulled it out of his arse.  Filthy mainlanders probably didn't even bother to wipe it on the curtains first but this floozy doesn't seem to mind.</p>
              <p>It takes a fucking intellectual midget to assume that money is the be-all-and-end-all.  Then again, rumour has it that a frontal lobotomy is part of the induction process at SPH.</p>

              <p>I've already covered your hard-on for the PAP above so I won't revisit it here.  It's fascinating how, again taking a Freudian perspective, you have revealed your own twisted view of the world with your projections.  You've noted my number of posts here, and if you bothered to do your homework you'll find that I take none of this online babble seriously.  As such, there's none of the anguish that you seem to assume that I have, and certainly I couldn't give a rat's about readership.  You think I'm here to sell my *gag* readership to advertisers?  Do you see me labelling myself as News Corporation or something?  It doesn't matter a jot to me if nobody bothers reading what I post - I'm in it for a laugh, but you mistakenly assumed that I attach the same gravitas to my posts as you seem to attach to yours.  I said before, I'll say it again - you're just being precious.</p>
              <p>Now, my shallow, ignorant little hand-wringer, allow yourself to be educated.  While Gedanken certainly translates as thought, it is also a shortening of Gedankenexperiment, which reflects the lack of consequence of online chatter.  You seem to place an inordinate amount of value on what's being discussed here, so much so that you bleat about people not entering this *snigger* "discourse".  Don't go taking yourself too seriously - that's someone else's job.</p>
              <p>So, to summarise, you're a PAP fanboy who makes laughable claims to a "history of violence", treat online chatter as a colloquium, and agonise about readership as if it'll ever have any tangible effect once people step away from their computers.  You've just proven that I was right in calling you a self-aggrandising wanker, and you really do need to get over yourself. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>

              <p>Dear Sunwukonga</p>
              <p>.<br>Just ignore the uncouth ex singaporean Gendanken - ran away living in Australia. He's in his usual self - ventilating. He offers no solutions, and any 'solutions' only upon hindsights. He has an inflated ego  and low self esteem problem.</p>
              <p>Everyone is intelligent. Some use intelligence meaningfully and help others. Some uses such powers to demean and attempt to dumb down others.Notice how he uses vulgarities and insults upon others in order to stand tall? Such are not signs of an intellectual. Shows himself as a presumptious roadside gangster fool.</p>
              <p>Others are not blind. One either builds or destroys his/her credibility, on their own.</p>
              <p>Look at this way - if he is living such a good life in Australia, he wouldnt be here in this Singapore site, cynically badmouthing my fellow citizens and their choices.</p>
              <p>He must be sad and lonely, and misery needs company, or at least to reassure himself on his personal choice to abandon the country that it had been a right decision, even if it turned out a wrong one.</p>
              <p>This site is not a site for praising the govt or the ruling party. There are other objective sites to do so. Should anyone do so, the loud vocal minority will shoot one down. It is only normal, because it's all about politics.</p>
              <p>You may usually find yourself alone, as this is what they wish, but the reality is that you will not be alone. Political apathy does not mean politically unaware on what is happening. Some just dont bother to reply, and let them talk till their tongues run dry, because the realities are there for all to see.</p>
              <p>But never be afraid to say what you think. You too have the freedom of speech, just as the opposition has it too, even though they may deny you of it. Singapore is still a democratic republic, not a Hitler state. The opposition supporters are not the brown shirts SS, as much as SOME of them are behaving as them. </p>
              <p>The People, the govt, and the ruling party had done pretty well since independence. It's achievements are there for all to see. There is no need even to praise.</p>
              <p>But the oppostition parties unfortunately have nothing to show, except for 2 MPs elected into the govt, and didnt do much to change or enhance the lives of Singaporeans. Worse still, some political officials resort to squabbles and even breaking laws, tarnishing the opposition parties still.</p>
              <p>Thus, the only way in their narrow and self centred minds is to tarnish the ruling party or any one deem supporting them any way possible, even twisting words and telling lies, bringing out dusty records of events that happened long ago, of choices made that were for the best under that time of circumstances.</p>
              <p>Today, such choices would have been considered wrong, given our climate, education levels and technological advances. It is so easy to condemn others using hindsight. And equally easy to condemn others when the future cannot be predicted.</p>
              <p>Put a thousand economists with a laptops in a hall to predict economies, and each will give different forcasts, and one of them will give an 'accurate' forcast for anything = from stock movements to economic performances. It is only a matter of numbers, but at the point of time when a decision is needed, which of the 1000 economists to believe is right?</p>
              <p> I can go on, but hope you get the picture of what I am driving at. So do not be too  disheartened or demoralized by what you see. It is only politics, and as short ninja had said, everyone has an ass, so too does everyone has some political leanings. This is after all, speakers corner, all about politics.</p>
              <p>No need to challenge each and every point. It is only when there are rally cries for outright disruptions to common peaceful living that needs to be put down, by any means possible, because often, the mongers get aways free, but it is always the common people who end up in jails, young lives destroyed and worse, in body bags. And for what? For someone else's political ambitions.</p>
              <p>Local or foriegner living here, we all want the best for Singapore. Some hurt it ignorantly, some work tirelessly for it, but all with one goal - to live in peace for our ourselves, our families, relatives and friends. Good luck to you. </p>
              <p>Gendanken, this is my honest assessment and right of speech, without fear or favour as a Singapore citizen. I am fully responsible for what I said. I had my say, and you, a foreigner now,  or anyone else are fully free to criticise me, in any way you wish, if you so wish. Cheers.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Yes, the Ruling Party and the Government had done pretty well for themselves - with their monolithic hold on politics and economics, and rewarding themselves wages for every minister that is almost 10 per cent of the GDP value.</p>
              <p>Can the bankrupt mind of a X-rat differentiate that while the Ruling Party and the Government had soaked themselves with the wealth accumulated from the People ?</p>
              <p>Obviously, the X-rat will prefer to turn a blind eye that The People are expected to accept low paying jobs, accept pay cuts when previous cuts have not been restored, and despite having done so well - The People are expected to face the future based on short term employment renewable contracts.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>It is amusing that the X-rat will be honest to claim that "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">political officials resort to squabbles and even breaking laws simply to tarnish the opposition parties still</span></em>".</p>
              <p>The rare honesty of the statement is seen in the venerable MM attempting to raise a <strong>petty squabble</strong> by accusing an Opposition Politician to be a liar, and when no action is taken in response - MM LKY then questioned the man's character, and all done to tarnish the Opposition.</p>
              <p>Did <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.singapore-window.org/ag0721.htm">Goh Chok Tong, Tony Tan and BG LHL (*1)</a> not break the law in Election 1997, and required the assistance of the Attorney General to re-interpret the law to get them off the hook ?</p>
              <p> Is it the fault of the Alternative Political Parties for not being able to get more then two MP in so many elections, or does it not present a starker bigger picture in the manner that the PAP conduct its dark politics in Singapore ?</p>
              <p>Obviously, the bankrupt mind of a X-rat can hardly be expected to see the bigger picture when it is only able to "copy and paste" what others have said that easily impress its X-rated mind.</p>

              <p>Thus, the only way in their narrow and self centred minds is to tarnish the ruling party or any one deem supporting them any way possible, even twisting words and telling lies, bringing out dusty records of events that happened long ago, of choices made that were for the best under that time of circumstances.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Does anyone need to tarnish the Ruling Party, when the efforts of an enthusiastic and sadly amateurish X-rat has done its level best to stir up the turbid political waters ?</p>
              <p>Without any help the Ruling Party had already done its own best to spoil its whiteness, that was used to blind the grey that was already clear even to the short-sighted.</p>
              <p>Does anyone have any ability to tarnish the image of the Ruling Party when its monolithic powers is all encompassing except over the free mind and intellect of those who are prepared to be discerning and circumspect ?</p>
              <p>We will not expect a X-rat to understand what "discerning" and "circumspect" shall mean as its blank mental capacity is blocked by a big "X" that marked the little spot on which its grey matter rest.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>With the ambivalence that only a X-rated kid can possess - that it is wrong to condemn others using hindsight, and similarly condemn others when the future cannot be predicted - can anyone move in any direction ?</p>
              <p>Is this not the obvious limbo that the PAP wish for Singaporeans to be, or is this the state of mind that a disingenious X-rat hope for Singaporeans to have - so as to allow the monolithic power the space to make more mistakes without being condemned ?</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>The X-rat should have left this to the expert and not pass comment.</p>
              <p>If the X-rat wish a lesson in the accuracy of computer models at "predicting" any possible outcome of a trend, perhaps it will be challenged to a lesson with the resident "Eagle" who has displayed a passion and pride in this field.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>With this "Wall of Text" that led to nowhere, was that a focus on some X mark that the  X-rat had tried to work toward ?</p>
              <p>This is surely another major flop that confirm what has been said that this X-rated Kid simply fail in its effort to deliver a message that its mind can plagiarized, but simply cannot copy the "spiritual" part of the conviction in the delivery of the message.</p>
              <p>Does any Singaporean own an 'ass' in high rise living environment of Singapore ?</p>
              <p>The X-rat must have itself confused between its "arse" with that of an "ass".</p>

And for what? For someone else's political ambitions.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is again obvious that the X-rat will surely prefer that there is "no need to challenge each and every point".</p>
              <p>The lack of confidence in the X-rat is due to the fact that every point is loaded with verbiage that is plagiarized, and when focus is placed on each and every point - its entire "Wall of Text" will crumble like the walls of Babylon.</p>
              <p>If History is to be read by examing official records of government reports that have been released by the British Colonial Office of Record for the periods up to the departure of the British from Singapore - one will need to revisit the history books that were prepared for the benefit of the Principal character in the Ruling Party.</p>
              <p>It is doubtful that the X-rat is capable at such a challenging venture, considering its only ability is with plagiarizing only.</p>

              <blockquote>

              </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>That is the obvious hope for a X-rated mouth piece for the monolithic political party in Singapore - and it is not a surprise that the X-rat has left out the responsibility of each and every Singaporean for the political future of Singapore.</p>
              <p>The danger is clear in the legacy of chaos that LKY has planned and will be leaving for Singapore, and can anyone else threaten LKY's plan except by his own failure ?</p>

              <p>Gendanken, this is my honest assessment and right of speech, without fear or favour as a Singapore citizen. I am fully responsible for what I said. I had my say, and you, a foreigner now,  or anyone else are fully free to criticise me, in any way you wish, if you so wish. Cheers.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is simply out of character for a X-rat to be honest, when it cannot face squarely the real political events that every Singapore Citizen faces each day.</p>
              <p>Can there be an iota of a Singaporean in the bankrupt mind of a X-rated kid behaving more like a X-rat as each day pass ?</p>
              <p>It is simply rubbing salt into open wounds of all the Singaporeans who were arrested on false charges, incarcerated without trials, forced to make dubious statements of confessions, forced to swallow the lies that a democracy exist when the principles of democracy have been ravished repeatedly for the sake of pragmatic expediency, and when the tenets of the Singapore Constitutions are ignored, and worst of all - the daily Pledge that is solemnly taken each day by younger Singaporeans are no longer to be taken as a Principle but to be re-considered as mere 'aspirations'.</p>
              <p>Only the unthinking mind of a X-rat will accept the status quo without a blink of the eye, and will have the audacity to propagate "the lies" by forcing it to be seen as "Truth" - pleading its case with its X-rat honesty.</p>

              <p>The rare honesty of the statement is seen in the venerable MM attempting to raise a <strong>petty squabble</strong> by accusing an Opposition Politician to be a liar, and when no action is taken in response - MM LKY then questioned the man's character, and all done to tarnish the Opposition.</p>
              <p>Did <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.singapore-window.org/ag0721.htm">Goh Chok Tong, Tony Tan and BG LHL (*1)</a> not break the law in Election 1997, and required the assistance of the Attorney General to re-interpret the law to get them off the hook ?</p>
              <p> Is it the fault of the Alternative Political Parties for not being able to get more then two MP in so many elections, or does it not present a starker bigger picture in the manner that the PAP conduct its dark politics in Singapore ?</p>
              <p>Obviously, the bankrupt mind of a X-rat can hardly be expected to see the bigger picture when it is only able to "copy and paste" what others have said that easily impress its X-rated mind.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Does anyone need to tarnish the Ruling Party, when the efforts of an enthusiastic and sadly amateurish X-rat has done its level best to stir up the turbid political waters ?</p>
              <p>Without any help the Ruling Party had already done its own best to spoil its whiteness, that was used to blind the grey that was already clear even to the short-sighted.</p>
              <p>Does anyone have any ability to tarnish the image of the Ruling Party when its monolithic powers is all encompassing except over the free mind and intellect of those who are prepared to be discerning and circumspect ?</p>
              <p>We will not expect a X-rat to understand what "discerning" and "circumspect" shall mean as its blank mental capacity is blocked by a big "X" that marked the little spot on which its grey matter rest.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>With the ambivalence that only a X-rated kid can possess - that it is wrong to condemn others using hindsight, and similarly condemn others when the future cannot be predicted - can anyone move in any direction ?</p>
              <p>Is this not the obvious limbo that the PAP wish for Singaporeans to be, or is this the state of mind that a disingenious X-rat hope for Singaporeans to have - so as to allow the monolithic power the space to make more mistakes without being condemned ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The X-rat should have left this to the expert and not pass comment.</p>
              <p>If the X-rat wish a lesson in the accuracy of computer models at "predicting" any possible outcome of a trend, perhaps it will be challenged to a lesson with the resident "Eagle" who has displayed a passion and pride in this field.</p>
              <p>Can the X-rat keep its own ignorance to itself ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>With this "Wall of Text" that led to nowhere, was that a focus on some X mark that the  X-rat had tried to work toward ?</p>
              <p>This is surely another major flop that confirm what has been said that this X-rated Kid simply fail in its effort to deliver a message that its mind can plagiarized, but simply cannot copy the "spiritual" part of the conviction in the delivery of the message.</p>
              <p>Does any Singaporean own an 'ass' in high rise living environment of Singapore ?</p>
              <p>The X-rat must have itself confused between its "arse" with that of an "ass".</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is again obvious that the X-rat will surely prefer that there is "no need to challenge each and every point".</p>
              <p>The lack of confidence in the X-rat is due to the fact that every point is loaded with verbiage that is plagiarized, and when focus is placed on each and every point - its entire "Wall of Text" will crumble like the walls of Babylon.</p>
              <p>If History is to be read by examing official records of government reports that have been released by the British Colonial Office of Record for the periods up to the departure of the British from Singapore - one will need to revisit the history books that were prepared for the benefit of the Principal character in the Ruling Party.</p>
              <p>It is doubtful that the X-rat is capable at such a challenging venture, considering its only ability is with plagiarizing only.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>That is the obvious hope for a X-rated mouth piece for the monolithic political party in Singapore - and it is not a surprise that the X-rat has left out the responsibility of each and every Singaporean for the political future of Singapore.</p>
              <p>The danger is clear in the legacy of chaos that LKY has planned and will be leaving for Singapore, and can anyone else threaten LKY's plan except by his own failure ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is simply out of character for a X-rat to be honest, when it cannot face squarely the real political events that every Singapore Citizen faces each day.</p>
              <p>Can there be an iota of a Singaporean in the bankrupt mind of a X-rated kid behaving more like a X-rat as each day pass ?</p>
              <p>It is simply rubbing salt into open wounds of all the Singaporeans who were arrested on false charges, incarcerated without trials, forced to make dubious statements of confessions, forced to swallow the lies that a democracy exist when the principles of democracy have been ravished repeatedly for the sake of pragmatic expediency, and when the tenets of the Singapore Constitutions are ignored, and worst of all - the daily Pledge that is solemnly taken each day by younger Singaporeans are no longer to be taken as a Principle but to be re-considered as mere 'aspirations'.</p>
              <p>Only the unthinking mind of a X-rat will accept the status quo without a blink of the eye, and will have the audacity to propagate "the lies" by forcing it to be seen as "Truth" - pleading its case with its X-rat honesty.</p>

              <p>Awwww, X, you're bringing a tear to my eye with that speech.  Damn, you've got my vote to write old Harry's eulogy when he finally carks it. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>Nonetheless, all of what you write adds up to nothing but a big joke.  You assume that I actually find some meaning in posting here, but you simply do not account for pure hedonism, nihilistic to its core.  I'm just here for a laugh and to give morons like you and monkey boy a reality check, but that's beyond your comprehension because this forum is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">your </span>be-all-and-end-all.</p>
              <p>For all of your flowery pontification, there's something you and your new pet ape need to be held to account for: what do you imagine will come out of all of the chatter here besides hot air?  To dumb it down and spell it out for you, have any of your "solutions" here ever led to any action being taken to improve Singapore?  Who have you actually helped, and will they please step forward with testimony so you can lay claim to the moral high ground?</p>
              <p>If you can't name any real results (and I mean something you can see and touch, not another one of your usual impotent claims of victory) and provide witnesses, then you know in fact that you're full of crap and also that you're the fool for taking this seriously. </p>
              <p>Let's face it, if you were serious, you'd be too busy doing something real instead of gasbagging on this forum.  Given your soap-box antics, and those of your new pet, there can only be two conclusions: either you're hypocrites because you're dramatising all of this in full knowledge of its utter and complete futility, or you're just sadly deluded in believing that what you write here actually means something.</p>
              <p>And it's funny that you should mention Short Ninja - he and I have trodden much of the same ground, and he would agree that he and I have actually <span style="text-decoration: underline;">done</span> (not just flapped our gums) more for Singapore than you have.  Interestingly enough, he's no longer in Singapore either - did he run away too? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
