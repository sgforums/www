              <p>It is simply a pathetic show of the bankrupt mind already proven for its inability to create, will also show its stupendous inability to absorb what has been written, and will go at a complete tangent to the subject contents to which it intend to respond. </p>
              <p>Was it about time management, or about using your time in more productive activities then plagiarizing ideas that even your PAPa will not take note of your efforts ?</p>

              <p>Have you not dishonestly protect the interests of your old PAPa to claim exclusivity in political rights to themselves, and prevent the print and broadcast media from giving any publicity to the Alternative Political Parties ?</p>
              <p>It is shameless dishonesty for a X-rat to propagate that the "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">best being made policy after consensual agreement in our democratic parliamentary style nation</span></em>".</p>
              <p>This dishonesty is clearly designed to ravished the common sense and put into normalcy what has been brazenly done to usurp and ravished the democratic process every step of the way - from the procedures in Election to the Parliamentary politics.</p>
              <p>Has the People's voices been heard through their Elected Representatives, when the Party Whip ensures that all honest voice of conscience are forced to be silent in the interest of Party Politics first ?</p>
              <p>Can the People's voices be heard when its Representatives have an easy walk-over ride into Parliament, in an election process designed to burden the Alternative Parties with an overbloated Parliament ?</p>
              <p>Only in the bankrupt mind of a X-rat will the present politics of the PAP be seen as Democratic.</p>

              <p>Can a X-rat be a simple man when it plagiarize devious ideas to be dumbed down to his level of simple words - to simply pretend these ideas to be its own ?</p>
              <p>How pathetic the democratic process is for the dumb-down mental process of a X-rat that it will believe that those who cannot reach its dumbed down level must be some "self-admitted clowns" ?</p>
              <p>How should we see the pathetic abilities of the X-rat in comprehending larger issues ?</p>
              <p>Making the X-rat a clown will surely belittle the profession of those who entertain kids with more intelligence then this X-rat.</p>
              <p>Perhaps, we will leave the X-mark on its intelligence as it is for now.</p>
              <p>We should not be in a hurry to condemn the X-rat so as to leave room for the X-rat to show its true potential in marking the X spot for its limited abilities before passing judgment.</p>

              <p><strong>free market plus the rule of law, and stable macro-economic policies, can lead to progress and success, but without Western-style 'liberal' democracy</strong></p>
              <p>What a bunch of Balony</p>
              <p>I think you have ignore 1 basic historical fact in our recent History.....the tools that fight against communist was against poverty. That's why one of the reason ASEAN was established. And liberal trade policies and surplus capital from western state was introduce into SEA thru Foreign Direct Investment as a form for introducing mass income distribution thru private interest.  </p>
              <p>We also saw the introduction of Capital financing thru Asian Dollar Market established by BOA to facilitate investment distribution within Asia.</p>
              <p>The success of foreign investment saw the rise of the 4 dragon in the 80s . Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore.  Success without Western democracy?  You think UNDP alone would be able to bring you to Singapore?   Whose Economics advise did Singapore LKY listen to on FDI? ...from Mao hand book?</p>
              <p>Look at the characteristics of these 4 states....</p>
              <p>Taiwan and Korea has longer and closer ties with US. While HKG is a colonial city.  3 out of 4 were against the influence of communist regime in the 60s and 70s. Not to forget that  Singapore wanted to be part of a Federation State.  </p>
              <p>The only reason why Singapore can continue to be an authoritarin because of its smallness. and continue rise in income for the later part of the 1900.</p>
              <p>So Singapore and China were able to prosper because of liberal western Trade policies and Trading system of comparative advantage thru private interest. Socially it benefit people around the globe. And in contrast we saw the inefficent of state planning distribution within the soviet block.</p>
              <p>So lets not stick gold to govt....and certainly if you think authoritarian is the reason you would not move south to Singapore.</p>

              <p>Cheap labour, Arapahoe, to put in bluntly. Western powers aint as noble as you assume them to be. Our forefathers slogged like hell for them, to give them profits and cheap goods in their giant supermarts, in exchange for a little cash from them to grow and learn their tricks. They werent even paying top dollar.</p>
              <p>The only few countries they tried to impose politics of democracy was Vietnam and we knew how it ended up. Philippines was another, but I am sure you are no Marcos fan.</p>
              <p>Taiwan was rich but was no democracy till the authoritarian Marshal Chiang stepped down in the late century. Korean democracy was marred by strikes regularly, that these western companies withdrew, resulting in their mafia called the Chaebols ruled. Hong kong was a free wheeling island, payed no taxes, owed no loyalty to anyone saved themselves.</p>
              <p>So what western democratic 'values' or 'assistance' are you referring to that enabled the 4 tigers to developed themselves? Freedom to be freely exploited by the west?</p>
              <p>The only thing that helped the 4 tigers were its hardworking people, pursuing a better life for their next generations while working in sweatshops for the West. I would grant you that if the West had not been such decadent consumerists, trade would not have happen and there would be no money to evolve our own poliltical standards.</p>
              <p>And evolution of politics had always been our country's strength. Democracy cannot happen overnight as USSR had proven. It takes patience and time. We are no longer an authoritarian state of the 60s but a full fledged democracy as proven by achieving FDI approval status, if that matters to you.</p>
              <p>So too will China evolve in time from its present state. But if you presume authoritarian states would give a care for FDI status from the west to give up their ways, just look at North Korea and Burma. They wouldnt give a damn, They have India and China for their trade needs, so they will not play to the western carrot dangling outside their eyes.</p>
              <p>The British parliament grew from trade guilds, the americans fought the brits for trade rights and the russians grew sick of lining up for loafs of bread, not because of communist tirades.</p>
              <p><strong>It is trade, that evolves the politics of nations. With earnings that can be spread to the population, a strong middle class will grow, whom will demand and set the pace for a greater say in their lives and eventually freedom.</strong></p>
              <p>Democracy or communism, both are only lofty ideals. If flawed men ruled in either system, that society will still fail.</p>
              <p>It is Capitalism, in its basic form, that provides trade, the lifeblood of our world, regardless of authoritarian, corrupt or enlightened rule. It was Trade from the decadent west, and not benevolent  lofty politics, that evolved us. </p>
              <p>Not benevolent because Trade had always been a 2 way street. Nothing is free. Best we make that clear and wise up to facts.</p>

              <p>Is this not another flop attempt of a X-rat attempting to spout hot air in some political thinking that barely deal with reality, but based on its own wild speculation based on some flight of fancy thinking ?</p>

              <p>Singapore has had Self-government in a guided Parliamentary Democracy under the British Colonial Rule since 1953 till 1963 - when Singapore was merged into Malaysia, and continuing with the Parliamentary Democratic form of Government.</p>
              <p>From 1965 until this date, Singapore form of government has all the superficial forms of a Parliamentary Democracy, that would have given Singapore a total of <strong>more then half-a-century</strong> of experience in democracy.</p>

              <p>Is there any relevance in the comparison of the Russian experience with Singapore's own circumstances ?</p>
              <p>If at all, the democratic practices of the 1950s is now a sham, and hidden under the thin veneer of Parliamentary Democracy lies a Communist style government that controls every aspect of Political Life, a Beijing style of sanctioned political representation of a cross-section of society, a Fascist state that is intolerant of any other public voices, a tightly controlled print and broadcast medias.</p>
              <p>It is not a surprise that the Ruling Political Party has been entrenched in Government for such a long time that it has turned into a monolithic entity.</p>
              <p>It had involved itself in the lives of every citizen as a major employer, as a provider of all essential services that include housing, food, utilities, transport, education, and as investor into strategic industries, manufacturing of industrial and consumer goods, and into financial and banking services.</p>

              <p>Did "the russian grew sick of lining up for loafs of bread" and QUIETLY broke free from the shackles of Communist Rule, or was there daily noisy demonstrations against the bankrupt ideas of authoritarian Communist oligarchs ?</p>

              <p>It is the old PAPa's philosophy created by Goh Chok Tong that "Politics should be for Politicians" - which this X-rat is dishonest not to clearly indicate but will deliberately dumb down the message by its X-rat intelligence.</p>

              <p><strong>free market plus the rule of law, and stable macro-economic policies, can lead to progress and success, but without Western-style 'liberal' democracy</strong></p>
              <p>What a bunch of Balony</p>
              <p>I think you have ignore 1 basic historical fact in our recent History.....the tools that fight against communist was against poverty. That's why one of the reason ASEAN was established. And liberal trade policies and surplus capital from western state was introduce into SEA thru Foreign Direct Investment as a form for introducing mass income distribution thru private interest.  </p>
              <p>We also saw the introduction of Capital financing thru Asian Dollar Market established by BOA to facilitate investment distribution within Asia.</p>
              <p>The success of foreign investment saw the rise of the 4 dragon in the 80s . Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore.  Success without Western democracy?  You think UNDP alone would be able to bring you to Singapore?   Whose Economics advise did Singapore LKY listen to on FDI? ...from Mao hand book?</p>
              <p>Look at the characteristics of these 4 states....</p>
              <p>Taiwan and Korea has longer and closer ties with US. While HKG is a colonial city.  3 out of 4 were against the influence of communist regime in the 60s and 70s. Not to forget that  Singapore wanted to be part of a Federation State.  </p>
              <p>The only reason why Singapore can continue to be an authoritarin because of its smallness. and continue rise in income for the later part of the 1900.</p>
              <p>So Singapore and China were able to prosper because of liberal western Trade policies and Trading system of comparative advantage thru private interest. Socially it benefit people around the globe. And in contrast we saw the inefficent of state planning distribution within the soviet block.</p>
              <p>So lets not stick gold to govt....and certainly if you think authoritarian is the reason you would not move south to Singapore.</p>

              <p>you talked a lot about reforming Singapore education to improve english, start by spelling "baloney" correctly.</p>
              <p>The fact that China prospers today but remains a communist state already prove your theory wrong, but of course communism in China is longer the same as what Mao or Carl Marx were thinking.</p>
              <p>don't stick gold to the western state,  They invested to capitalise on cheap labor, slack local environmental control (remember Bhopal), cheap industrial resources (land and raw materials) in Asia. investment from these states were never meant to introduce mass income distribution, like in HK, they took the mass income first, then the rest distribute.</p>
              <p>The fact you conveniently ignore is that the Philippines and Indonesia were anti communist, they got rid of the dictator, but they remains poor today. The fact that they are the most democratic countries in ASEAN, by western standard, has not brought their people what they need. Philippino remains dependant on the export of their cheap labour, Indonesian maids continue to be abused by the Malaysian. </p>
              <p>The korean would laugh at you when you say they succeeded with western democracy in the 80's. Until 87 South Korea was ruled by general Chun Doo Hwan, came to power by a coup de'tat. Until today, we still get news of their former head of state involved in scandal, corruption....blah blah blah. But along the way, these head of states implemented economic strategies that capitalise on cheap labour and aim at export, the same way the Asian tigers achieved economic miracles.</p>
              <p>Ask the Taiwanese, it was Chiang Jin Guo, the son of dictator Chiang Kai Shek, who laid the foundation for taiwan economic miracle, then later came the direct election when Lee Teng Hui was elected president. Ah Bian has not ensured continuing economic prosperity for the Taiwanese people.</p>
              <p>Philippines and india were both anti communist, speak english nation wide, embrace western democracy, but where were they when Asian economy prosper in the beginning of the 80's?</p>
              <p>If Singapore is an authoritarin because of its smallness, why is the big China also authoritarian? I wonder why is a small authoritarian state able to "continue rise in income for the later part of the 1900"</p>
              <p>The Asians tigers, china, and other Asian countries prosper for many reasons unique to the region (emphasis on education, savings, hardwork...), and in a globalized environment, but never because of western democracy. Dont' stick Gold where it doesn't belong, trying too hard to link economic sucess to democracy will only dilute what democracy can really do for the people.</p>
