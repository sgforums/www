              <h1>Another media report on MM Lee’s overseas trip</h1>
              <div class="date">
              <div class="dateleft">
              <p><span class="time">February 21, 2010</span> by</p>
              <p>2 days after MM Lee gave a speech exhorting Singaporeans to “bear” with the overcrowding caused by foreigners, he is in the news again.</p>
              </div>
              </div>
              <p>The Straits Times carried a report about MM Lee calling on Sultan Ibrahim Ismail of Johor at the Istana Besar to express his condolences at the death of the latter’s father, the late Sultan Iskandar Ismail, last month.</p>
              <p>Such news are usually not reported in other countries. What’s more MM Lee is not the Prime Minister of Singapore, but he is making the headlines more frequently than his son.</p>
              <p>By his own admission, he is not doing “much work” except “forecasting”. Why then is the state media giving so much publicity to him?</p>
              <p>As of this week, MM Lee has appeared in the papers at least three times while PM Lee only once which begs the question on who is really the leader of Singapore.</p>
              <p>A former Prime Minister of Singapore, the elder Lee has remained in the cabinet since relinquishing his position in 1990. While the exact role of a “Minister Mentor” remains unclear as it is the only position of its kind in the world, many believe Lee continues to wield a lot of influence behind the scene.</p>
              <p>Over the last few weeks, he has been busy defending the ruling party’s misguided policies ranging from immigration, public housing, foreign affairs to even tourism, completely overshadowing the ministers in charge.</p>
              <p>Though he will be 87 years of age this year, he still show no intention of retiring when all his comrades such as Goh Keng Swee and Toh Chin Chye had already done so many years back.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans should not be surprised to see MM Lee contesting in the next general election. After all, he once said that he would “rise from his grave” should he find that something is not right about Singapore.</p>

              <p>What can possibly be the reason for MM LKY hogging the headlines of the local media in recent months - while PM LHL is rarely heard ?</p>
              <p>Is this some kind of PAP attempt to polish up the image of MM LKY to manipulate the public psche towards acceptance of a fatherly figure as a national icon ?</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, the more space given to MM LKY, the more damage he is doing to himself with all the negative remarks that exposed his arrogance towards ordinary Singaporeans.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p> <em>“Mr Lee Kuan Yew kept on repeating how he built up this country and how much he has stored in the reserves. That is the tragedy of the man. For all his intelligence, he does not possess the wisdom of life. …</em></p>
              <p><em>Mr Lee Kuan Yew fights all his demons within himself to try to shore up his reputation. In the process, however, he destroys the very legacy that he so desperately desires to establish.”  </em>- Chee Soon Juan, Secretary-General of the Singapore Democratic Party</p>

              <p>Others before him - like Marcos and Suharto - got caught with their embarrassing bank accounts that cannot be explained.</p>
              <p>He simply stay on to collect what he has legitimately claimed to be his - and done so with so in very clean and legal manner, as his PAP dominated Parliament approves all that his PAP CEC has decided.</p>
              <p>It is sad that Singaporeans were never consulted on this single issue in a transparent referendum exercise - when the one and only referendum held in Singapore was a poorly and dishonest organised effort that resulted in the aborted merger with Malaysia.</p>

              <p><br>It is "hogging the headlines" - like it is "zwei-siao" to be a hog, or hogging the fast lane while driving slowly and ignoring other drivers behind you ?</p>
              <p>The news about MM travelling all over the world certainly does not affect your daily life at all - UNTIL - the PAP Government find that it is necessary to increase revenue to cover their "operating expense".</p>
              <p>The usual and easiest way to collect revenue is to milk the Singaporean wallets through increases to the GST, ERP, COEs, Petrol Taxes, Utility Charges, Hospital Fees, Education Fees, Stamp Duties, Income Tax, Property Tax and any other revenue collecting sources imaginable for the government.</p>

              <p>When you are too scared of losing power, you employed lots of elite incompetent yes man into your place.</p>
              <p>But, you end up working harder cos the yes man are truly mind less on their own and you have to stand up for them when they say something boo boo.</p>
              <p>It is also advantage to you as you get to go overseas for free and enjoy 1st class treatment even if your trip is meaningless in true sense.</p>
              <p>You are also "well" loved by people that they want you to show your mentorship in another dimension.</p>

All you have to do is to dissolve organizations and societies and banish and detain the key political workers in these societies. Then miraculously everything is tranquil on the surface. Then <span style="color: #ff0000;">an intimidated press and the government-controlled radio together can regularly sing your praises, and slowly and steadily the people are made to forget the evil things</span> that have already been done, or if <span style="color: #0000ff;">these things are referred to again they’re conveniently distorted and distorted with impunity, because there will be no opposition to contradict</span>.”<br></em>- <em>Lee Kuan Yew as an opposition PAP member speaking to David Marshall, Singapore Legislative Assembly, Debates, 4 October, 1956</em></p>
