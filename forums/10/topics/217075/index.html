            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Dear All<br><br>I had on the morning of 25th October 2006 responded with biting criticism to the Straits Times report on MP Wee Siew KimÂ’s comments in defiant defence of his dear daughter.<br><br>I was totally disgusted by MP WeeÂ’s comments which I will not let go pass untouched.<br><br>The STÂ’s Forum Editor had passed over my response and published another letter which was far less critical.<br><br>I am a strong proponent of freedom of expression, I will not stop at being silenced by elements of the mainstream press. Attached below is the letter that was targeted at our PAP AMK GRC MP Wee Siew Kim.<br><br>My purpose for publishing this letter is to encourage greater freedom of expression stronger and unrestrained criticism of the Ruling Party by all and I am taking the lead here.<br><br>Coincidentally, MP Wee made a statement in the press today which was of course published. This statement claims to be apologizing to the readers who were offended.<br><br>I have read MP WeeÂ’s statement and I am not of the view that the apology is full and unreserved. I trust Singaporeans can come to their own conclusions on the matter.<br><br>Â“RESPONSE TO PAP MP FOR AMK GRC MR. WEE SIEW KIMÂ’S COMMENTS IN STRAITS TIMES REPORT OF 24TH COTOBER 2006.<br><br>I had read in amazement of what Ms Wee Shu Min had written in her blog. I ruminated on her statements and her lineage and illustrious background and after much thought, decided not to criticize her in spite of the callousness she had exhibited at such a tender age.<br><br>For to me, there is simply no reason to overreact to the ignorant bigotry of an 18 year old girl and that the matter is best left to rest after the barrage of criticism she met with on the internet.<br><br>However, when I saw the Straits Times report of 24th October 2006, I read with disgust what Ms Wee Shu MinÂ’s father PAP MP for AMK GRC, Mr. Wee Siew Kim had said in brazen defence of his dear daughter justifying her callousness and adding further insult and injury to Singaporeans.<br><br>MP Wee, in his dismal attempt to soften the effect of his daughterÂ’s ramblings, had sought to downplay the incident as a lack of sensitivity on her part and to quote him Â“Some people cannot take the brutal truth and that sort of language, so she ought to learn from it.Â”<br><br>Whilst the less discerning may opine that MP Wee has apologized on behalf of his daughter, in truth both father and daughter have exhibited no more empathy or remorse than when the remarks were first made in Ms WeeÂ’s blog. MP WeeÂ’s remarks albeit more diplomatic had in fact exhibited an even higher level of arrogance and lack of empathy.<br><br>MP Wee must note that her daughter has since removed the offending posting from her blog. That is itself discordant with the stance he exhibited in his interview in the Straits Times. One wonders whether the removal of the posting was a father-sanctioned public perception management exercise for damage control or was it a true indication of remorse and regret?<br><br>If indeed MP Wee had similarly been just as careless with his callous remarks, he ought to acknowledge so and then extend nothing short of an unreserved apology to all Singaporeans especially those who are in situations similar to that of Mr. Derek Wee.<br><br>And upon doing so, MP Wee should also take steps to inculcate the appropriate level of humility in his daughter and do so in an early stage of her life, for MP Wee must remember that the government that he backs has taken bloggers to court, punished and shamed them for the undue comments they have made similarly for a limited audience.<br><br>Whilst I do not hope that the current establishment gets richer as a result of whatever discussion that takes place, I do hope that the former does get a lot humbler and wiser for Singapore will need leaders who can truly empathize with the people instead of having to live with parrots perched tree high above ground and their dissonant cacophony of callouness and insensitivity.Â”<br><br>The PAP and its supporters are invited to attack this posting with unrestrained fervour.<br><br>Regards<br><br>Chia Ti Lik<br></div>

If we have many of such people in Parliament and top civil service posts, can we not expect the cost of living to keep going up?? And the poor become poorer?<br><br>And he expects all the graduates and high earners to think and do alike, i.e. just accept the challenges, work hard and aim high for their own personal gains.  How about those who are at the bottom of the rat race ? Is it wrong for somebody who is more capable to speak on their behalf. Or should they be ignored and if possible eliminated ?<br><br>Do we need to see more people committing suicide (like throwing themselves at a moving MRT train) before our "elected" leaders reaslie that society as a whole is not as rich and glamorous as what they see, or pretend to see.</span></span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>After all that's been said, i did not expect Wee Siew Kim to apologise on behalf of his daughter.<br><br>On the other hand, he is certainly not obliged to, given the fact that his daughter is no longer cradle-bound and capable of standing on her own two feet. Having had the gusto to commit such a virulent outburst, surely she should be expected to reflect upon her words and humbly apologise, as many others before her have done.<br><br>One wonders whether enough 'lessons' have been taught and learnt by our self-styled ruling party. With MPs such as Wee Siew Kim, is it any surprise that AMK residents gave the ruling party a 'resounding' 66% mandate against a team of alternative 'freshies'?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Maybe the 'freshies' managed a surprise 33% because they offered a breath of 'fresh air' and down-to-earth approach the ruling party are simply incapable of nowadays. Even a simple press statement is deliberately used as a launchpad to staunchly defend their position when one was simply looking for a humbler response.<br><br>It is therefore unsurprising that our MPs, with little political experience and with a cushy path to office, are pathetically unskilled at diplomacy, revealing the true nature of their motives when they weren't asked to 'show hand'.</div>

Just look how fast Mr Brown's Mee Pok Man's podcast spread during election time?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>But the question is really: why should they fear it when they should be embracing it?
