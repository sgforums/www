Back then, my friends who studied in those schools were more than happy to mingle and make friends from all circles even if you were from some normal stream schools. When did this so called 'elitism' started? and will it ever end? i doubt not. just read an article on 'elitism' today on asiaone..and you wonder why the kids are all infactuated with the word ELITISM..</div></blockquote>It was practised, my dear friend.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> Though not as a whole.</div>
