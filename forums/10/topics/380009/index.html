              <h1>Sino-US relations</h1>
              <p>By Javid Husain  |   Published: October 27, 2009</p>
              <p>If there is one issue which will determine the future course of the
              21st century, it is the direction and substance of US-China relations
              in the coming decades. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The driving factors behind this relationship are
              twofold: the US determination to prevent the emergence of a power in
              any part of the world capable of challenging its global supremacy and
              the phenomenal economic growth of China over the past three decades
              which in due course would translate itself in the growth and strength
              of its military power.</strong></span></p>
              <p>The combined effect of China’s huge size and
              rapid growth makes it inevitable that the world would, at first, see
              increasing rivalry between the two nations in the economic field
              followed by a challenge to the US global supremacy in the military
              field by China in the second half of the 21st century. Of course, this
              conclusion is based on the bold assumption that the present trends of
              growth in the economic power of the two nations are sustained in the
              coming decades. These developments would transform the global
              geopolitical scene with far-reaching strategic, political and economic
              implications for the whole world.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>There is no denying the fact that
              the current world order has been shaped primarily by the West under the
              leadership of the US - a reflection of the Western countries’
              domination of the global political and economic scene since the end of
              the World War II. </strong></span></p>
              <p>The structure, the procedures and the functioning of
              the United Nations, particularly the Security Council, the World Bank
              and the IMF, established after the World War II, were such that no
              major decision could be taken without the backing of the West. The
              position has remained more or less unchanged since then. This state of
              affairs is going to change dramatically in the coming decades
              reflecting the redistribution of the economic and ultimately the
              military power globally.</p>
              <p>During the Cold War, the Soviet Union did
              pose a challenge to the military supremacy of the West. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The defeat and
              disintegration of the Soviet Union made the world unipolar briefly with
              the US emerging as the global hegemon. </strong></span></p>
              <p>However, the rapid growth of
              China and other powers like India and Brazil, the re-assertiveness of
              Russia, and the emergence of other power centres such as the European
              Union, Japan and the ASEAN indicate that the US unipolar moment has
              already passed.</p>
              <p>The world is increasingly turning multipolar with
              several centres of power emerging on the scene even though for the time
              being the US is the only country capable of projecting its military
              power in the different corners of the world. It is inevitable that
              these developments would ultimately lead to the re-writing of the rules
              which determine the way in which the world functions in the political
              and economic fields.</p>
              <p>China’s rapidly growing economic and military
              strength would make it a major player in this process of global
              transformation. An example of the kind of changes that can be expected
              in the coming decades was the call by the Governor of China’s Central
              Bank, Zhou Xiaochuan, in March 2009 for the replacement of the dollar
              as the world’s reserve currency by Special Drawing Rights (SDR’s).</p>
              <p>Changes can, thus, be expected in the structure and functioning of
              multilateral institutions like the UN Security Council, the World Bank,
              the IMF and the WTO.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The net effect of these changes would be the
              gradual decline in the influence of the US and the West and increase in
              the role of China and other emerging powers.</strong></span></p>
