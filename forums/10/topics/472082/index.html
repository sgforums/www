              Look like there 2 different standards from our main stream media here.  Last few days I had seen a lot of "questions" post in the newspaper regarding this.
              
              Yet during the AIM issue / the Town Council using the fund for "Long Term" investment without approval / the blow of budget of YOG when the volunteer are serve "dog food" (by the way who is the vendor that supply the food and how much do the vendor charge, can it be they are charging too much for dog food that is why overspending) / then the NEA buying the cycle etc..
              
              I am so surprise during that period, not much questions are being ask.  Guess for the elites, this rule always apply - It an honest mistake, let move on.

              <p>The National Solidarity Party (NSP) has called
               on the ruling People's Action Party and the opposition Workers' Party 
              not to exploit the ongoing hawker centre cleaning dispute for "political
               gain".</p>
              <p>NSP secretary-general Hazel Poa said on Monday night in a statement 
              that her party is "troubled by what we see as the declining level of 
              discourse in our politics recently", and "a growing culture of partisan 
              bickering". </p>
              <div class="related_col">She pointed to last week's Parliament sitting as evidence. Last 
              Tuesday, Minister for Environment and Water Resources Dr Vivian 
              Balakrishnan sparred with WP MPs Sylvia Lim and Low Thia Khiang on 
              whether the Aljunied-Hougang-Punggol East Town Council had asked for 
              extra payment for high area cleaning of Bedok hawker centres.</div>
              <p>Ms Poa called on both parties to focus on a thorough post-mortem, and
               to focus debate instead on recent licensing rules for news websites and
               the country's preparedness during the recent haze. These are issues 
              which are "top of mind for all Singaporeans" currently, she added.</p>
              <p>Ms Poa said the website rules would have a chilling effect on free 
              expression. She also asked why the Government did not issue stop-work 
              orders during the peak of the haze, and why the Government's stockpile 
              of masks bought with taxpayer money were given to retailers to sell for 
              profit. She also suggested an "emergency response czar", or a senior 
              minister, to head an inter-ministry committee to ensure the Government 
              communicates clearly in emergencies.</p>
              <p>Ms Poa added that <strong>"good leaders do not point fingers when things go 
              (wrong) or single out private citizens in an attempt to embarrass them."</strong></p>
              <p>She did not elaborate. But a week ago, Minister for Communications 
              and Information Yaacob Ibrahim named blogger Ravi Philemon as among 
              those who caused unnecessary public anxiety during last month's haze by 
              spreading rumours. Mr Philemon is a member of NSP.</p>
              <p>Ms Poa said leadership is about being honest and open about errors, and <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>focussed on problem-solving.</em></span></p>
              <p><strong>"That is the kind of leadership that Singaporeans voted for in the 
              last general elections, not what we have been seeing in Parliament of 
              late," she said, adding that elected MPs have a duty to ensure that <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em> parliamentary sessions focus on discussing issues that matter to the 
              people.</em></span></strong></p>
