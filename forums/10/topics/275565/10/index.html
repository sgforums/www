Jayakumar say that Singapore fishing vessels had been detained by Malaysia while in international waters.<br><br>Professor Jayakumar disclosed this at the International Court of Justice in The Hague, during hearings on the legal tussle between Singapore and Malaysia over an island in the Singapore Strait, which the Republic calls Pedra Branca and which Malaysia refers to as Pulau Batu Puteh.<br><br>Mr Goh said in Mandarin: 'I'm trying to understand what was the problem that caused my boats to be detained.'<br><br>He is hoping Malaysia will explain the detentions - or free his vessels and crew immediately.<br><br>Pointing to a charge sheet filed by the Royal Malaysian Navy (TLDM), he claimed that his trawlers, each staffed by four crew, were in international waters some 20 nautical miles off Johor when they were intercepted and detained by boats from the Malaysian navy in two separate incidents.<br><br>Under international law, a country's territorial waters stretch 12 nautical miles offshore.<br><br>The first incident in June involved trawler SMF 1096, a 20.8m-long wooden vessel said to have been 19.8 nautical miles off Johor.<br><br>Its four crew members were released on Saturday after four months in detention.<br><br>The second incident happened on Nov 11, when two sister trawlers, SMF 1089 and SMF 1095, were stopped and boarded, also some 20 nautical miles off Tanjong Penawar in southern Johor.<br><br>A Malaysian crew member, who declined to be named or photographed, was freed three days later after bail of RM3,000 (S$1,292) was paid, but seven Indonesian crew members from the two vessels are still in detention.<br><br>The Malaysian said the arrest took place on a Sunday morning in fine weather.<br><br>The first sign of trouble, he said, came when they saw someone on board the TLDM patrol vessel wave at them with hand-held signal flags.<br><br>Armed Malaysian navy sailors boarded each trawler and ordered them to sail to Tanjong Pengelih in south Johor.<br><br>Mr Goh said he continues to fret over the fate of the seven still in detention, and that company representatives went to a Johor court last Wednesday to try to get them freed.<br><br>Bail was denied.<br><br>The company then decided to lie low and allow Malaysian law to run its course.<br><br>With Prof Jayakumar's testimony that Malaysia had aggressively arrested Singapore fishing boats in the area and raised tensions, Mr Goh said he wanted to tell his story.<br><br>Besides the crew, he is also worried about his boats: 'These are old boats in danger of sinking as their pumps and machinery must be maintained regularly.'<br><br>Yesterday, the Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority, which oversees Singapore-registered fishing vessels, said it was investigating the matter.<br><br>Asked about the detentions, TLDM public relations officer Haslinda Rahim, said the Malaysian navy needed time to respond to the media's queries.<br><br>The Malaysian navy earlier alleged that the trawlers detained 10 days ago did not have a valid permit to fish in Malaysian waters.<br><br>Told about this, Mr Goh said: 'It looks like my boat and crew have been caught in the net of international politics.'<br><br>dboey@sph.com.sg<br><br><strong>MORE REPORTS, SINGAPORE</strong><br><br>Copyright, 2007, Singapore Press Holdings Limited</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="color: darkblue;">All the pieces in Singapore's case 'fit perfectly together'</span><br>Ambassador-at-large Tommy Koh summed up Singapore's case yesterday by highlighting the 10 key points of its arguments. He said these were pieces of a puzzle that fit perfectly together to show Singapore has sovereignty over Pedra Branca. Here is Ambassador Koh's summing-up of Singapore's case.</strong><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Straits Times, The (Singapore)<br>Home, Pg 4<br>November 21, 2007</span><br><br><img src="http://i13.tinypic.com/7y71zdg.jpg"><br><br>FIRST, Singapore has shown that in 1847, Pedra Branca was terra nullius. Malaysia disputes this and argues that it was not terra nullius but was part of the Sultanate of Johor.<br><br>Malaysia has, however, failed to produce any evidence that this particular island, Pedra Branca, was subject to the sovereignty of Johor. Malaysia has failed to prove her only argument, that she has a historic title to Pedra Branca.<br><br>She has failed to show that: (a) Pedra Branca was part of the Johor Sultanate; and (b) that any original title had been transmitted to the State of Johor.<br><br>Second, Singapore had shown that from 1847 to 1851, Britain was in possession of Pedra Branca without the consent of any native ruler.<br><br>Malaysia argues that she had given permission to Britain for the construction of the lighthouse on Pedra Branca.<br><br>Again, she has not provided any evidence of such permission. All that Malaysia relies on are indirect inferences from letters which do not even mention Pedra Branca.<br><br>Third, Singapore has shown that in the period, 1847 to 1851, the British acquired sovereignty over Pedra Branca by satisfying the two requisite criteria: animus or intention, and corpus or activities undertaken ? titre de souverain.<br><br>Malaysia has repeated ad nauseam her argument that the British lacked the animus and the corpus and that all the activities undertaken by them were merely concerned with the construction of a lighthouse.<br><br>The Malaysian argument is flawed and remains so no matter how many times it is repeated.<br><br>Fourth, from 1847 to 1979, a period of over 130 years, Singapore's sovereignty over Pedra Branca was open, continuous and notorious. It was acknowledged by all concerned and challenged by none.<br><br>It was only in 1979, when, like a bolt out of the blue, Malaysia published her infamous map which claimed, for the very first time, that Pedra Branca belonged to her.<br><br>Fifth, in 1953, when Johor was a sovereign State under international law, the State Secretary of Johor, writing in an official capacity, informed the Singapore Government that, 'the Johore Government does not claim ownership of Pedra Branca'.<br><br>This disclaimer is binding on Malaysia under international law. Malaysia is clearly embarrassed by this disclaimer.<br><br>Discarding her earlier argument that the disclaimer 'is not a model of clarity', Malaysia has invented a new argument, which is that Singapore is seeking to use the letter as the root of her title.<br><br>But this has never been Singapore's case. Singapore's case is that the disclaimer confirms Singapore's title and is further evidence that Johor has no prior title.<br><br>Sixth, in 1968, three years after Singapore separated from Malaysia, the Malaysian government demanded that Singapore should lower its marine ensign from its lighthouse in Pulau Pisang. Since Pulau Pisang was under Malaysian sovereignty, Singapore promptly complied with Malaysia's request.<br><br>However, Malaysia failed to make the same demand with respect to the flying of the Singapore marine ensign on Pedra Branca. Malaysia's conduct is recognition of Singapore's sovereignty over Pedra Branca.<br><br>Seventh, between 1962 and 1975, Malaysia published six maps which attributed Pedra Branca to Singapore. Singapore never published a single map, not one, attributing the island to Malaysia.<br><br>Eighth, Malaysia has argued that Pedra Branca, Middle Rocks and South Ledge should not be treated as a group but as three separate and distinct maritime features. This is an untenable argument.<br><br>The truth is that for reasons of proximity, geology, history and law, the three features are inseparable and must be treated together. Pedra Branca and Middle Rocks constitute a group.<br><br>South Ledge is a low-tide elevation within the territorial sea of Pedra Branca and Middle Rocks and its fate must necessarily follow that of Pedra Branca and Middle Rocks.<br><br>Ninth, Malaysia has repeatedly argued that this case is about title and not about competing effectivites. This is not correct.<br><br>Singapore's case is that Pedra Branca was terra nullius in 1847 and that we had acquired sovereignty over the island between 1847 and 1851 and have maintained it ever since.<br><br>However, should the Court find that the title to Pedra Branca were indeterminate at that time, and were to examine the competing effectivites of the two parties, Singapore has clearly shown that it has sovereignty.<br><br>I can understand why Malaysia would be concerned if the Court were to decide to walk down this path. The reason is that Malaysia has zero effectivites.<br><br>Tenth, Malaysia has, in the first round, said that Singapore may continue to own and operate the Horsburgh Lighthouse should sovereignty over Pedra Branca be awarded to her. This may sound magnanimous, but make no mistake, it is really an attempt by Malaysia to change a legal order which has existed for 160 years.<br><br>Mr President and Members of the Court, the evidence in this case presents a remarkably consistent picture. All of Singapore's actions are entirely consistent with that of a country that has sovereignty over Pedra Branca.<br><br>In contrast, all of Malaysia's actions (and inactions) are entirely consistent with that of a country which has no title over Pedra Branca.<br><br>In fact, all the pieces of the puzzle fit neatly together. The picture that emerges is that Singapore has sovereignty over Pedra Branca.<br><br>The British activities from 1847 to 1851, in taking lawful possession of the island, are simply the other side of the coin of the complete absence of Johor's original title or of any sovereign acts by Johor on the island.<br><br>Singapore's continuous stream of sovereign activities on Pedra Branca and within its territorial waters, from 1851 to the present, is the reverse side of the coin of the complete absence of any Malaysian effectivites on the island at all relevant time.<br><br>Singapore's actions were open and public and are the counterpart to Malaysia's silence in the face of these activities over a period of 130 years.<br><br>Malaysia's official disclaimer in 1953 and its series of official maps attributing the island to Singapore are further confirmation of this picture. The whole story fits perfectly together.<br><br>There can therefore be no doubt that Pedra Branca, Middle Rocks and South Ledge belong to Singapore.<br><br>----------------------------<br><br>'Singapore's continuous stream of sovereign activities on Pedra Branca and within its territorial waters, from 1851 to the present, is the reverse side of the coin of the complete absence of any Malaysian effectivites on the island at all relevant time. Singapore's actions were open and public and are the counterpart to Malaysia's silence in the face of these activities over a period of 130 years.' - AMBASSADOR-AT-LARGE TOMMY KOH<br><br>Copyright, 2007, Singapore Press Holdings Limited</div>

That is not correct,' he said.<br><br>The legal term effectivites refers to a state's activities that are an exercise of sovereignty over a territory.<br><br>Singapore has produced a wealth of evidence of its effectivites on Pedra Branca, and they include control of access to the island and naval patrols in its surrounding waters.<br><br>Singapore and Malaysia are appearing before the ICJ to resolve their dispute over the sovereignty of Pedra Branca, an island 40km east of Singapore which stands at the eastern entrance of the Singapore Strait.<br><br>As the hearing enters its third and final week, the court has heard Malaysia mount a claim based on the Johor sultanate's alleged title to Pedra Branca from time immemorial.<br><br>But Singapore has pointed out that Malaysia has failed to produce any documents to prove such a title.<br><br>Singapore's claim is that Pedra Branca was terra nullius, that is, belonged to no one, in 1847 when the British took lawful possession of it and built Horsburgh Lighthouse there.<br><br>But Malaysia has called into question the depiction of Pedra Branca as terra nullius since the island is located at the centre of what used to be the Johor sultanate.<br><br>Professor Koh argued yesterday that the court should not make a decision based on title alone, as Malaysia has repeatedly asked it to.<br><br>'Malaysia has repeatedly argued that this case is about title and not about competing effectivites. That is not correct,' he said.<br><br>'Should this court find that title to Pedra Branca were indeterminate in 1851, and were to examine the competing effectivites of the two parties, Singapore has clearly shown it has sovereignty.<br><br>'I can understand why Malaysia would be concerned if the court were to decide to walk down this path. The reason is that Malaysia has zero effectivites,' he added.<br><br>Essentially, Singapore is saying that its case stands even if the first of the two legs upon which it rests is a little wobbly.<br><br>Malaysia's case, on the other hand, must collapse if the one leg upon which it rests is shaky.<br><br>Yesterday, Singapore's international counsel Rodman Bundy pointed out that the ICJ has ruled on the basis on effectivites in four recent cases when neither side could prove it had title over the disputed territory.<br><br>One of those cases was the dispute between Malaysia and Indonesia over the islands of Sipadan and Ligitan, which Malaysia won on the basis of its activities on the islands.<br><br>'In every one of these cases - every one - the conduct of the parties was assessed to determine which one had demonstrated a greater intensity of state activities undertaken on the islands,' Mr Bundy said.<br><br>He also argued that if the court ruled in Malaysia's favour on Pedra Branca, it would produce an 'unprecedented result'.<br><br>'It would be the first time sovereignty over disputed territory would be found to lie with a party which never carried out a single sovereign act on the actual territory at any time,' he said.<br><br>In drawing Singapore's arguments to a close yesterday, Prof Koh laid out the 10 key points of Singapore's case.<br><br>He said they were like the pieces of a puzzle that fit perfectly together to show that Singapore has sovereignty over Pedra Branca.<br><br>The picture that emerged, he said, was that of British activities from 1847 to 1851 amounting to the taking of lawful possession of the island which belonged to no one.<br><br>That was followed by Singapore's continuous stream of sovereign activities on the island from 1851 to the present.<br><br>On the reverse side of the coin, he said, was the 'complete absence' of any Malaysian activities on the island.<br><br>'The whole story fits together. There can therefore be no doubt that Pedra Branca, Middle Rocks and South Ledge belong to Singapore,' he said.<br><br>Malaysia will rebut Singapore's arguments tomorrow and on Friday, when the hearing ends.<br><br>A verdict is expected next year.<br><br>lydia@sph.com.sg<br><br>Copyright, 2007, Singapore Press Holdings Limited</div>

Jayakumar say that Singapore fishing vessels had been detained by Malaysia while in international waters.<br><br>Professor Jayakumar disclosed this at the International Court of Justice in The Hague, during hearings on the legal tussle between Singapore and Malaysia over an island in the Singapore Strait, which the Republic calls Pedra Branca and which Malaysia refers to as Pulau Batu Puteh.<br><br>Mr Goh said in Mandarin: 'I'm trying to understand what was the problem that caused my boats to be detained.'<br><br>He is hoping Malaysia will explain the detentions - or free his vessels and crew immediately.<br><br>Pointing to a charge sheet filed by the Royal Malaysian Navy (TLDM), he claimed that his trawlers, each staffed by four crew, were in international waters some 20 nautical miles off Johor when they were intercepted and detained by boats from the Malaysian navy in two separate incidents.<br><br>Under international law, a country's territorial waters stretch 12 nautical miles offshore.<br><br>The first incident in June involved trawler SMF 1096, a 20.8m-long wooden vessel said to have been 19.8 nautical miles off Johor.<br><br>Its four crew members were released on Saturday after four months in detention.<br><br>The second incident happened on Nov 11, when two sister trawlers, SMF 1089 and SMF 1095, were stopped and boarded, also some 20 nautical miles off Tanjong Penawar in southern Johor.<br><br>A Malaysian crew member, who declined to be named or photographed, was freed three days later after bail of RM3,000 (S$1,292) was paid, but seven Indonesian crew members from the two vessels are still in detention.<br><br>The Malaysian said the arrest took place on a Sunday morning in fine weather.<br><br>The first sign of trouble, he said, came when they saw someone on board the TLDM patrol vessel wave at them with hand-held signal flags.<br><br>Armed Malaysian navy sailors boarded each trawler and ordered them to sail to Tanjong Pengelih in south Johor.<br><br>Mr Goh said he continues to fret over the fate of the seven still in detention, and that company representatives went to a Johor court last Wednesday to try to get them freed.<br><br>Bail was denied.<br><br>The company then decided to lie low and allow Malaysian law to run its course.<br><br>With Prof Jayakumar's testimony that Malaysia had aggressively arrested Singapore fishing boats in the area and raised tensions, Mr Goh said he wanted to tell his story.<br><br>Besides the crew, he is also worried about his boats: 'These are old boats in danger of sinking as their pumps and machinery must be maintained regularly.'<br><br>Yesterday, the Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority, which oversees Singapore-registered fishing vessels, said it was investigating the matter.<br><br>Asked about the detentions, TLDM public relations officer Haslinda Rahim, said the Malaysian navy needed time to respond to the media's queries.<br><br>The Malaysian navy earlier alleged that the trawlers detained 10 days ago did not have a valid permit to fish in Malaysian waters.<br><br>Told about this, Mr Goh said: 'It looks like my boat and crew have been caught in the net of international politics.'<br><br>dboey@sph.com.sg<br><br><strong>MORE REPORTS, SINGAPORE/b]<br><br>Copyright, 2007, Singapore Press Holdings Limited</strong></div></blockquote><strong>They were at the right place but wrong time.Thanks for the 4-D numbers.</strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I was wondering how is Malaysia going to stand tall and face the international community in the future. The 7X magnified photo, maybe we can say they are attempting to be shrewd to band the ICJ to their favour. But the blog? I mean Malaysia is not so poor that they cannot afford to send a maritime patrol aircraft to use long range cams to take the light house rite? I mean using a blog, speaks how seriously they take this matter. It is like writing a thesis paper quoting sources from Sun, new-paper, wan bao, etc...........</div>
