            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.trollo-leuchttuerme.com/fotos/wls/wls_7.jpg"><br><br>Pedra Branca or Pulau Batu Puteh (both meaning "white rock" in Portuguese and Malay respectively) is an outcrop of rocks situated where the Singapore Strait, specifically Straits of Johor, meets the South China Sea, measuring at its longest, during low water spring tide, a mere 137 meters. It has a land area of 2,000 mÂ². It is known as Pedra Branca in Singapore and Pulau Batu Puteh in Malaysia.<br><br>The island was recorded as early as 1583, by the Dutch voyager Johann van Linschoten.<br><br>The rocks have long been a navigational hazard. For example, between 1824 and 1851, at least twenty-five sizeable vessels met with disaster on those rocks.<br><br>In 1851, the Horsburgh lighthouse was built and named after Captain James Horsburgh , a Scottish hydrographer to the East India Company<br><br>Ownership of the island is disputed by Singapore and Malaysia.<br><br>Singapore has been administrating Pedra Branca and managing Horsburgh Lighthouse as early as 1851.<br><br>The Separation Agreement in 1965 did not address the issue of sovereignty over Pedra Branca. Singapore continues to administer the island and manage the lighthouse.<br><br>Malaysia first claimed the island in 1979 when the country published new official maps, which included the island of Pedra Branca in its territory. Malaysia asserts that when Johor Sultanate ceded Singapore to the British in 1824, the island was not part of the secession and that the Sultan of Johor only allowed the British to construct a lighthouse on the island in 1844.<br><br>Pedra Branca is located 25 nautical miles away from Singapore; the island is 7.7 nautical miles away from Johor.<br><br>In 1994, both sides agreed to bring the matter to International Court of Justice.[1] Both countries have made written submissions to the Court and public hearings will open 6 November 2007. .<br><br>==========================<br><br>After 6 Nov 07........Singapore may find that its area had shrunk......just like 50 years ago when we lost Christmas Island to Australia......<br><br>.........er........sorry.....when we sold it to Australia......</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There are two ways of looking at it.<br><br>One, Singapore has been administering the islands since 1851, and up to 1979 there was no claim on it by Malaysia, or even the Federation of Malaya. When Singapore became independent in 1963, there was no challenge to the boundries of the new nation. Therefore Singapore would be granted the right of possession.<br><br>The other, the island is part of the Federation of Malaya, belonging to the State of Johore. The island has never been part of any negotiations between the British authorities and the Malay sultans. Therefore it is still the property of the State of Johore.<br><br>Lets see what the ICJ says.</div>

When he became CJ last year, Parliament was informed that he had agreed to the Government's request to continue acting for it until its resolution.<br><br>Deputy Prime Minister and Law Minister S. Jayakumar will wrap up the Republic's case with a concluding statement on Friday.<br><br>The atmosphere in the court, or great hall as it is called here, of the Peace Palace was noticeably friendly and members of both teams greeted each other warmly on arrival.<br><br>As Prof Koh observed in his speech, Singapore and Malaysia are closely linked not just geographically, but also in their history, culture and economics.<br><br>The Pedra Branca dispute has, however, been an 'irritant' in the bilateral relationship.<br><br>'After almost 28 years, we are very pleased that the dispute will be brought to a conclusion,' he said.<br><br>lydia@sph.com.sg<br><br><strong>MORE REPORTS, HOME H8</strong><br><br>Copyright, 2007, Singapore Press Holdings Limited</div>

At the laying of the Horsburgh lighthouse foundation stone in 1851, the island was described as a 'dependency of Singapore'.<br><br>In 1952 and again in 1974, the Chief Surveyor and the Marine Department of Singapore respectively wrote that Singapore was entitled to claim a territorial sea around Pedra Branca.<br><br>In the early 1970s, the Singapore Government considered reclaiming land around Pedra Branca and even called a public tender for such works in 1978.<br><br><strong>RECENT HISTORY: HOW MALAYSIA DISCLAIMED OWNERSHIP</strong><br><br>IN 1953, in response to an inquiry from Singapore, the Johor government stated unequivocally in a letter that 'the Johor government does not claim ownership of Pedra Branca'.<br><br>In 1962, the Federation of Malaya published two official maps which attributed Pedra Branca to Singapore.<br><br>In 1965 and 1975, Malaysia again published maps showing Pedra Branca as belonging to the republic.<br><br><strong>CLAIM OF OWNERSHIP BEFORE 1847</strong><br><br>MALAYSIA'S historical claim to Pedra Branca rests on its argument that the island was part of the old Johor sultanate.<br><br>In its written arguments, it portrayed the sultanate as a stable kingdom whose territorial extent remained the same throughout all phases of its history, from the 16th century right up to the 19th century, when the British arrived on the scene.<br><br>But CJ Chan quoted from the writings of well-known historians Carl Trocki and Richard Winstedt, which stated that from her foundation, the kingdom of Johor 'was in a precarious state'.<br><br>Indeed, the official 1949 Annual Report published by the Government of the State of Johor noted that by the start of the 19th century, round about the time of the British arrival in Singapore, 'the old empire was in a state of dissolution'.<br><br>Malaysia's claim also glossed over the fact that traditional Malay sovereignty was centred not on territory but on allegiance.<br><br>Therefore, 'the only reliable way to determine whether a particular territory belonged to a ruler is to find out whether the inhabitants pledged allegiance to that ruler', Mr Chan argued.<br><br>It would therefore be difficult to establish with certainty sovereignty over barren, isolated and uninhabited islands such as Pedra Branca, he added.<br><br>He also sought to debunk Malaysia's attempt to use the 1824 Anglo-Dutch treaty to back its claim, saying that it amounted to a misinterpretation of the treaty.<br><br>lydia@sph.com.sg<br><br>Copyright, 2007, Singapore Press Holdings Limited<br></div>

A judgment is expected next year.<br><br><strong>WHAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY</strong><br><br>THE hearing opened with Singapore presenting its case first. Its arguments centred on the point that Malaysia has no evidence that Pedra Branca was ever part of the Johor sultanate, as it claims.<br><br>In contrast, Singapore has carried out many activities that showed it has all along considered the islet to be part of its territory.<br><br>Singapore will continue presenting its arguments until Friday.<br><br>Copyright, 2007, Singapore Press Holdings Limited</div>
