We've done our part, stated our facts, they will do the same next week and we trust the ICJ to come up with a fair judgment based on the merit of the case.<br><br>Frankly, coverage this time round is rather scant... Might be that both sides do not want to engage in "megaphone diplomacy".<br><br>Reasons for this could be due to:<br><br>(a) Both sides feel that its interests are best served by letting the ICJ do its job and hence refrains from making inflammatory comments<br><br>(b) Characteristic of opportunistic UMNO politicians, they know there is a higher chance that MY will lose this one and are more cautious about making any statements that might return to bite them in the arse, esp since elections are round the corner.<br><br>(c) Because elections are round the corner, its more productive to play the "race card" than the "Singapore card"... The Malay vote is still critical esp now that Anwar is back in the game and PAS had never left it...<br></div>

Anbalagan</span><br><br>SINGAPORE has had total control over Pedra Branca (Pulau Batu Puteh) since 1851, the International Court of Justice heard yesterday. Rodman R. Bundy, a counsel appearing for Singapore, said the British took possession of the island between 1847 and 1851 and constructed the Horsburgh lighthouse.<br><br>Thereafter, Singapore, was open on the activities on the island which confirmed their ownership, including its territorial waters. He said none of these activities drew protests from Malaysia.<br><br>"Singapore has exercised regulatory authority and jurisdiction over personnel residing on the island, maintaining peace and good order," he said.<br><br>"The island is used as a meteorological data collection station and Singapore has exclusive control over visits by third parties to Pedra Branca.<br><br>"She had also investigated navigational hazards and ship wrecks in the territorial waters of Pedra Branca and considered sea reclamation works to extend the island." He said the Singapore flag had been raised for more than 150 years on the island but drew no protest from Malaysia, unlike the 1968 incident at the nearby Pulau Pisang, where the flag was eventually brought down.<br><br>He said Malaysia's inaction confirmed its earlier decision that it had disclaimed ownership of the Pedra Branca in 1953.<br><br>Bundy was submitting on the territorial dispute between Malaysia and Singapore over Pulau Batu Puteh and the adjacent features of Little Rocks and South Ledge.<br><br>Both countries are asking the court to decide on the sovereignty of the island.<br><br>Professor Alain Pellet, who is also representing Singapore, told the panel of 16 judges that it was impossible for Malaysia to find evidence or confirmation that ownership of the island belonged to Johor.<br><br>"None of the documents produced could convince the court that Johor had the original title over Pedra Branca." Malaysia in its written submission asserts that: * Pulau Batu Puteh, the two features and other islands in and around the Singapore Strait were part of the Johor Sultanate before 1824.<br><br>* The Anglo-Dutch treaty of 1824 had no effect on the sultanate as the agreement only covered islands and territories to the south of the strait.<br><br>* Neither Great Britain nor Singapore ever claimed sovereignty over the three features at any time prior to the critical dates in relation to the present dispute (1980 as in the case of Pulau Batu Puteh and 1993 in the case of Little Rocks and South Ledge), and; * Singapore's legislation and treaty practice, its publications and maps as well as statements by the island republic's officials all confirmed that the three features were not territories of Singapore.<br><br><strong><span style="color: darkblue;">Hearing on 28-year Pulau Batu Puteh dispute begins</span></strong><br><span style="font-style: italic;">New Straits Times (Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia)<br>November 7, 2007<br>Author: V. Anbalagan</span><br><br>RESOLUTION of a 28-year dispute between Malaysia and Singapore over the sovereignty of Pulau Batu Puteh and two adjacent marine features began at the International Court of Justice yesterday.<br><br>Singapore, which began submissions, contended that Johor had no claim over the islands, which it referred to as Pedra Branca, the Middle Rocks and South Ledge marine features.<br><br>The island republic's ambassador-at-large Tommy Koh told the court that Singapore had had sovereignty over the island for the past 150 years.<br><br>"Malaysia said, prior to 1847, the island was part of Johor but there is no proof to support its claim," he said.<br><br>Koh said the British acquired sovereignty of Pulau Batu Puteh to build a lighthouse in 1851.<br><br>He said Singapore was part of the Straits Settlement in 1867 and became part of the British colony.<br><br>"So Singapore, a former British colony, is successor to the title to Pedra Branca and also the two marine features which are located nearby," he said.<br><br>He was making his opening address to settle the territorial dispute between the island republic and Malaysia.<br><br>He said the dispute had been an irritant in the bilateral relations between the two countries.<br><br>"After almost 28 years, we are very pleased that the dispute will finally be brought to an end." A 16-judge panel, led by court vice-president Awn Shawkat Al-Khasawaneh, will hear submissions from both parties scheduled for 12 days.<br><br>It is to decide the ownership of the 137-metre by 60-metre granite outcrop, which is located 7.7 nautical miles off Johor and 25 nautical miles from Singapore.<br><br>Situated where the Straits of Johor meets the South China Sea, it houses a light house, communication tower, helipad and a jetty.<br><br>Malaysia first claimed the island in 1979 when the country published new official maps, which included Pulau Batu Puteh as part of its territory.<br><br>This drew a protest from Singapore which currently has exclusive control over Pulau Batu Puteh, the Middle Rocks and South Ledge marine features. The court is expected to issue its judgment next year and both countries have said they would abide by its ruling.<br><br>Koh yesterday supported his submissions with maps and documents.<br><br>He said although Malaysia was formed in 1963 and Singapore became an independent state in 1965, many legal proceedings took place prior to that.<br><br>He said the lawful taking of Pulau Batu Puteh was effected by a series of actions such as the landing of a British agent in 1847 and the inaugration of the Horsbrough light house in 1851. He said Malaysia had been silent over Pulau Batu Puteh and only asserted sovereignty in 1979.<br><br>"The taking over of the island was through peaceful means and there was no opposition from any party," he said adding that there was also no evidence that the British sought permission from Johor.<br><br>Indeed, he said the Dutch governor-general in Batavia (Indonesia) in the 1880s recognised the British acquisition of Pulau Batu Puteh.<br><br>The Malaysian legal team is led by Tan Sri Abdul Kadir Mohamed who is the Malaysian agent, Datuk Noor Farida Ariffin, the Malaysian ambassador to the Netherlands, Attorney-General Tan Sri Abdul Gani Patail, Sir Elihu Lauterpacht, Penelope Nevill, Professors James Crawford, Nicolaas Jan Schrijver, Marcelo and G.
