Correct me here.<br><br>Anyway, thanks to hloc &amp; Atobe for sharing info about that "red-white-tower"<br><br>I did a little more bkgnd research about that structure and source says operated by MPA instead of PSA.  The later business core is on port operation while MPA (www.mpa.gov.sg) focus on maritime safety and navigation.<br>Kinda like ATC for shipping traffic.<br><br>MPA calls their ATC as Vessel Traffic Information System (VTIS). (source: http://www.mpa.gov.sg//infocentre/pdfs/jan-mar03.pdf). That tower is one of several built after 9/11.<br>You can spot the same tower on Singapore mainland like along ECP next to PA sailing club<br><br>okay. sure it can be used by military, but hey, at least we have civilian organsiation involved 24/7.<br><br>My conclusion so far:<br><br>If such CIVILIAN communucation/surveillence system exist on both S'pre mainland and its off-shore isle while custom operation and security are actively carried out in these territory, wouldn't that be an indication of  more than just a "lighthouse adminstrator"?

Its not really a matter of whether Malaysia intended to mislead or not but the fact that they got caught AGAIN using something that could be turned against them. They could have used any number of photos or even asked us for some (to demonstrate that they could not take the pics themselves cos of our "unfriendly" naval patrols)  but Nooo... They HAD to have one copied from a blog that was taken with a zoom lens... I wonder why...</div>
