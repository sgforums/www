I have yet to know of any other littoral state that charges ships passing through its territorial waters. Internal waters, yes... territorial waters, no.<br><br>I wonder if the UN Convention for the laws of the seas, guaranteeing right of innocent passage has anything to do with it?<br><br>Whether we win or lose, at least that island won't be an irritant holding up the rest of the outstanding bilateral issues anymore!<br><br><blockquote>Did Singapore dispute the fact?

Its not even Singapore's turn to reply to Malaysia's presentation yet. U think what? Watch too much Boston Legal ah? Happy happy can stand up and say "objection!"???<br><br>Wait for next week.

            <div class='col-md body'>For once, I will have to disagree with what andrew said.<br><br>This is not a PAP issue but a national issue. No matter which party, is in power today, they will have to stand up to protect the national iterest and sovereignty of our country. I believe this also applies to Malaysia. As eventhough they know their chances of winning the case is quite weak, but due to the strategic locations of those islands, they are trying to fight to the best position and advantage for their country.<br><br>Regarding your comments that if SG did not act in a so called arrogant and high-handed position, they will concede those island to us with a fair agreement. This statement might sound logical, but the question is, will the MY govt voluntarily cede those island to SG when it involves sovereignty and strategic interest? Under what conditions and terms will SG give in to them to get their acknowledgement that those islands belongs to us; and at what cost?<br><br>Regarding the so called military installations on those islands. I think the MY side is trying to raise a ruckus over a small issue or just cooking up some hearsay stories. Yes, they claim SG have military related installations on PB, but do they have evidences to that claim? If there is really some secret installation on that island that an threaten MY, why did their govt not openly exert diplomatic pressure on SG to remove them?<br>In fact, this is not the first time this type of hearsay, no-evidence nonsense appear on their main newspaper to stir up MY citizens' feeling against SG. Remember the "Johorean fishermen witness SG UAV flying in MY airspace and scaring away fishes" or the "SG military firing mortat bombs into MY waters". All these accusations after investigations all boiled down to rumors and false information, even MY official later made a public statement that such events never happened.<br>Besides, sir Elihu, is the lawyer for MY, for the sake of professionalism and the interest of his client, like a typical lawyer, hes has to twist and turn fact to the advantage of MY.</div>

Truth be told, its not the end of the world.<br><br>We're still the lighthouse operator.<br><br>We have to understand the substance of the Malaysian claim: to make the legal argument coherent, they have to agree to an interpretation of the colonial treaties and arrangements. Hence, it doesn't change the status quo much.<br><br>In sum, they do not dispute that SG "owns" the lighthouse on Pedra Branca.<br><br>At worst, we dismantle the "sensitive" facilities, or we explain what they're for and ask for permission to keep them.<br><br>Its not like we got a squadron of Gundams hidden under that rock.<br><br>We effectively "lose" nothing because we must respect the decisions of the ICJ. Such is the conduct of responsible and civilised countries.<br><br>BUT if ICJ rules that Singapore holds sovereignty over Pedra Pranca, then our strategic interests are protected, the status quo is maintained and our position is strengthened in our conduct of diplomacy with Malaysia in future.<br><br>In both scenarios, trade will flow. Right of innocent passage through the seas will be upheld and life will go on.<br><br>ICJ's decision will actually help us to move forward on many outstanding bilateral issues.<br></div>
