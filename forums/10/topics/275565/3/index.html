            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="color: darkblue;">Malaysia's Case: History to be cited to back claims</span></strong><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Straits Times, The (Singapore)<br>Home<br>November 13, 2007</span><br><br>ACCORDING to its written pleadings, Malaysia's claim to Pedra Branca rests on four pillars.<br><br>The first is that the Johor Sultanate exercised sovereignty over Pedra Branca from time immemorial and held what is called an 'original title' to the island.<br><br>Pedra Branca, which the Malaysians call Pulau Batu Puteh, is an island the size of a football field and is at the eastern entrance to the Singapore Strait.<br><br>To back its claim, Malaysia asserts on the basis of several history books on Johor that for centuries, the sultanate's territories stretched 'both north and south of the Singapore Strait' and included 'all islands within and at the entrance of the Singapore Strait'.<br><br>It argues that by contrast, Singapore's claim dates only to 1980 when it lodged a protest against a 1979 Malaysian map that placed Pedra Branca within Malaysia's territorial waters.<br><br>The second pillar is that Britain acknowledged Johor's title and sought permission to build a lighthouse there in the 1840s.<br><br>Malaysia has produced an 1844 letter from the Temenggong of Johor to the British Crown in Singapore, which it argues is evidence that such permission was granted.<br><br>Its third argument is that the British did not exercise sovereignty over the island, but only built and operated Horsburgh Lighthouse there. Singapore's activities, it claims, have also been limited to those related to the running of a lighthouse.<br><br>Malaysia argues that under international law, the operation of a lighthouse does not establish the sovereignty of the operator.<br><br>Lastly, Malaysia alleges that Singapore never acted as though Pedra Branca belonged to it, for it published no maps showing the island was part of its territory, nor did it include Pedra Branca in its list of islands.<br><br>From today until Friday, Malaysia's experienced team of international counsel is also expected to rebut forcefully many of the arguments that Singapore mounted last week.<br><br>The team includes Sir Elihu Lauterpacht and Mr James Crawford, two international law experts who helped Malaysia win its case in 2002 against Indonesia in their territorial dispute over the islands of Sipadan and Ligitan.<br><br>Singapore's Case : Long, non-stop display of state authoritySINGAPORE'S proof of sovereignty over Pedra Branca rests on two legs.<br><br>The first is that the British took lawful possession of the island in 1847 when it was terra nullius, a Latin phrase meaning empty or no man's land.<br><br>It backed this up with an 1850 letter by the General Secretary of the Dutch East Indies, in which he wrote of the construction of a lighthouse 'at Pedra Branca on British territory'.<br><br>In its oral pleadings last week, Singapore also highlighted Malaysia's absolute lack of documentary evidence to support its claim of an original title to Pedra Branca.<br><br>The second leg of Singapore's case is that since 1847, Britain and its successor, Singapore, have exercised sovereignty over the island through activities that were an open, continuous and effective display of state control.<br><br>These included naval patrols as well as the control of access to the island.<br><br>Among the incidents Singapore brought to the court's attention last week was one that took place in 1974, when a group of Malaysians who wanted to visit Pedra Branca sought permission to do so from the Singapore authorities.<br><br>Singapore also described as 'sudden' and 'extraordinary' Malaysia's late claim to the island, through a map published in 1979.<br><br>The move, it said, came after 130 years of silence in the face of Singapore's exercise of state control on and in the waters around Pedra Branca.<br><br>During those 130 years, Malaysia had also acknowledged Singapore's sovereignty, it added.<br><br>Its legal team quoted from a 1953 letter in which Johor's top official at the time informed the British authorities in Singapore that 'the Johore Government does not claim ownership of Pedra Branca'.<br><br>They also highlighted six maps published by the Malaysian government between 1962 and 1975, which showed Pedra Branca as belonging to Singapore.<br><br>Copyright, 2007, Singapore Press Holdings Limited</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="color: darkblue;">Why Singapore is fighting the case to keep Pedra Branca</span></strong><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Straits Times, The (Singapore)<br>Home<br>November 13, 2007<br>Author: Lydia Lim</span><br><br>IN 1583, Dutch voyager Johann van Lindschoten wrote of the island on which South-east Asia's first lighthouse was eventually built:<br><br>'From the Cape of Singapore lyeth a cliffe in ye sea called Pedra Branca, or white rock, where the shippes that come and goe to and from China passe in great danger and some are left upon it.'<br><br>It is clear from this account that for centuries, Pedra Branca was notorious for being a navigational hazard.<br><br>It was for this reason that the British decided in 1847 to build Horsburgh Lighthouse there, to improve the safety of ships passing through the Singapore Strait.<br><br>Since the construction of the lighthouse began that year, the British colonial authorities had considered Pedra Branca part of Singapore territory.<br><br>When it became self-governing in 1959, Singapore assumed sovereignty over the island from the British and has controlled it and its surrounding waters ever since.<br><br>So it found Malaysia's sudden claim in 1979 that Pedra Branca stood within its territorial waters, 'to say the least, extraordinary'.<br><br>That was the phrase Deputy Prime Minister S Jayakumar used in a speech last Friday, as he wrapped up Singapore's first round of oral pleadings before the International Court of Justice.<br><br>To some, Pedra Branca may seem insignificant.<br><br>It is after all but a guano-covered granite island the size of a football field, located some 25 nautical miles from Singapore's mainland.<br><br>But for the Singapore Government, there is an important principle at stake, which is that no country should be able to suddenly and unilaterally claim its territory over which it has exercised sovereignty openly and continuously. In this case, Singapore has held the island for some 150 years.<br><br>In a way, Singapore is acting as any home owner would if his neighbour suddenly decided to encroach on his land.<br><br>It would come as no surprise if the owner strenuously resisted any such attempt, for otherwise, he would forfeit to his neighbour land that was rightfully his to begin with.<br><br>To be sure, sovereignty disputes are also usually tied up with feelings of national pride.<br><br>Malaysian newspaper the New Straits Times stated in an article dated Jan 2, 2003 that 'Pulau Batu Puteh, tiny as it is, is significant for its strategic position, impact on the delimitation of territorial sea and, most of all, for national pride'.<br><br>Pedra Branca is also strategically located and is key to the safety of international shipping passing through the Strait of Singapore.<br><br>It commands the entrance to the two main shipping channels - the south and middle channels - of the eastern part of the strait, through which some 900 ships pass each day.<br><br>Singapore has installed a VTIS or Vessel Traffic Information System tower on Pedra Branca, which it relies on in its management of shipping traffic.<br><br>While Singapore is confident of the outcome of the dispute now being heard before the International Court of Justice, it will no doubt be watching keenly for surprises that the Malaysian side might spring on it this week.<br><br>Copyright, 2007, Singapore Press Holdings Limited</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="color: darkblue;">P. Batu Puteh dispute for ICJ reference soon</span></strong><br><span style="font-style: italic;">New Straits Times (Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia)<br><strong><span style="color: red;">February 6, 2003</span></strong></span><br><br>KUALA LUMPUR, Wed. - The dispute over Pulau Batu Puteh will soon be on its way to the International Court of Justice, with the signing of the Special Agreement tomorrow.<br><br>The case could be heard by the 15 judges of the ICJ in The Hague in two to three years.<br><br>Foreign Minister Datuk Seri Syed Hamid Albar and his Singapore counterpart, S. Jayakumar, will represent their countries at the signing at Wisma Putra in Putrajaya.<br><br>The terms of the agreement will cover Pulau Batu Puteh, as well as two adjacent marine features - Middle Rocks and South Ledge.<br><br>Pulau Batu Puteh is located at one degree 20 minutes North, and 104 degrees 24 minutes East. Middle Rocks is at one degree 19 minutes North, and 104 degrees 25 minutes East, while South Ledge is at one degree 18 minutes North, and 104 degrees 25 minutes East.<br><br>The signing marks the first step to a legal resolution of the dispute, which has eluded a diplomatic or political solution since it arose in 1979. Two rounds of bilateral negotiations in 1993 and 1994 ended in a stalemate.<br><br>The Special Agreement, which lays out the terms of the dispute and timeframe for the legal processes, is necessary because neither Malaysia nor Singapore accepts the jurisdiction of the ICJ as compulsory.<br><br>After it is signed, it will have to be ratified by both governments before being submitted to the ICJ which will then set timetables for the filing of written submissions.<br><br>In the Sipadan/Ligitan case, the ICJ granted a year for both countries to file the Memorials, followed by another four months for the Counter Memorials. These can be followed by another two sets of submissions, namely the Reply and Rejoinder.<br><br>The ICJ's decision will be final and binding, and there is no appeal.<br><br>Pulau Batu Puteh, called Pedra Branca by Singapore, is 7.7 nautical miles off Johor and 25 nautical miles from Singapore. It is about the size of a football field, and holds a lighthouse, communications tower, helipad and jetty.<br><br>The dispute arose in 1979 when Malaysia published its continental shelf map showing the island as its territory. Singapore lodged a protest in 1980.<br><br>The dispute centres around the administration of the island. Singapore asserts that it has sovereignty as it has maintained the Horsburgh lighthouse there since 1851.<br><br>The lighthouse is today maintained by the Singapore port authority, along with four other light-houses, including another one on Malaysian territory - Pulau Pisang in the Straits of Malacca.<br><br>In Malaysia's view, the lighthouse was built and administered only by consent of the Sultan of Johor, which was granted in 1844.<br><br>Both countries are expected to furnish maps, historical documents and treaties to support their position.<br><br><span style="color: red;">Pulau Batu Puteh, tiny as it is, is significant for its strategic position and impact on the delimitation of territorial sea boundaries.</span> The exchange of words between both countries over the island has been acrimonious, and not just recently.<br><br>There have been sporadic exchanges since the late 1980s, with both countries claiming that the other side's fishermen or boats had encroached on the waters of the island.</div>

More of an illustration of my point of view that newspapers and journalists do not operate in a "free-for-all".<br><br><blockquote>The Singapore press has been dishonest when it will not fulfill its serious responsibility to report truthfully the mistakes of this government through investigative journalism.<br><br>It has preferred to target oridnary Singaporeans, who are helpless in defending its own privacy, while the Singapore Government will shackle any news reporter that dare to make any unsanctioned investigation to the activities of the State. </blockquote>There u have it... are u still convinced that the ST covered the proceedings of the ICJ due to the althruistic intentions of making information available to those interested?<br><br><blockquote>How did you come to this state of mind in concluding from my postings that domestic crowd will be roused into a rabid frenzy ?<br><br>If at all, my concern is that WITHOUT any objective and detailed reporting of the proceedings at the ICJ, any outcome that may NOT benefit the side with the least information - may actually result in this state of frenzy that you are now describing. </blockquote>I disagree... It really depends on the level of maturity of the politician and the public. The reason why I feel that no reporting could be good news is because I totally do not trust them to not make a big deal every time we sneeze.<br><br>If anything at all, I feel that it is TOO easy to inflame them, whether there's information available or not.<br><br>If the intention is to calm sentiments, then no news is good news.<br><br>In any case, no verdict will be forthcoming for another 6 to 9 mths. Thats an eternity in politics.<br><br>The brutal truth be told, it doesn't matter what's reported now. It can still be skewed later.<br><br><blockquote>With both governments having stated publicly to their own citizens that the matter be placed before the ICJ, and that its decision will be final with no further recourse to appeal - it is only right that any news reporting should not be selectively printed and done with a twist at ridiculing or belittling the statements made by either side. </blockquote>Like I said, so far, I do not find the  reports on the Malaysian side to be offensive. Selective and sparse, yes. But not offfensive.<br><br><blockquote>The Singapore Straits Times have so far done a proper job at reporting the details of the daily proceedings at the Hague, lets see if they will do the same for Malaysia during the course of their presentation made this week.</blockquote>To hazard a guess, I think the Malaysian side will start to pick it up, but coverage will not be extensive. They have a lot to report in recent weeks  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> The rock is low on their list of priorities.<br><br>From my sense of the situation, I think the Malaysia is bogged down with domestic concerns. In theory, its the perfect time to slam us to distract their people from the real problem, but they have not done so.<br><br>Mahathir would have done so if he was still PM  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>The question is: Why have they not yet done so IF it was their intention to do so all along?<br><br>Dare we hope for a more mature phase in SG-MY relations?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by FG42:</div><div class="quote_body">we already has a monument there.<br><br>its our Horsburg Lighthouse at Pedra Branca.<br><br>read the following:<br><br>Sir Standford Raffles was a Freemason. So was Thomas Bradell - the first Attorney General of Singapore, William Henry Read, George W. A. Trimmer, Sir Herbert Ralph Hone, Frank Swettenham, Joaquim Parsick P. Joaquim, John Colson Smith, Admiral Henry Keppel, and John Turnbull Thomson. Across the Johor straits, the Sultan of Johor, Sultan Ibrahim and three of his sons were also Masons. Further away, Raja Brooke of Sarawak was also a Mason. Other Masonic figures that passed through Singapore included Marquis of Dalhousie, the Governor General of India and Charles Warren, the former Commissioner of Police of Metropolitan London.<br><br>In 1850, Lord Dalhousie (they were addressed as such back in those days) came to Singapore. An obelisk, known as The Dalhousie Obelisk was built to commenmorate his visit.<br><br>The Obelisk is a Masonic architecture, is associated with the Sun and is the symbol for continuity, power, regeneration and stability. More than saying Â‘Long Live the QueenÂ’, the Masons had erected another stone phallus to mark their global presence, transcending the political and religious boundaries of their era. Singapore counts itself as one of the few places in the world with a contemporary obelisk. The most famous modern obelisk is the iconic Washington Monument.<br><br>Lord Dalhousie Â“emphatically recognized the wisdom of liberating commerce from all restraints, under which ENLIGHTENED policy this settlement has rapidly attained its present rank among British possessions and with which its future prosperity must ever be identifiedÂ”. From those words, Freemasons believed in unfettered turbo-capitalism. It is not coincidental that many of them worked in the East India Company, one of the progenitors of the Multi-National Corporation that is able to formulate trade policies backed up by gunship.<br><br>The Dalhousie Obelisk was designed by John Turnbull Thomson, who was also responsible for the construction of the Horsburg Lighthouse at Pedra Branca. The Masons turned up at Pedra Branca in full regalia for the consecration of the lighthouse in the same year when the Obelisk was built.<br></div></blockquote>Noted your source... I think its a bit dodgy... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>You might like to know that the fact that the Masons turned up at Pedra Branca in full regalia was seized upon by the Malaysian side that as such, the taking into possession of the rock was not a state-act, but a private one  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>It was further noted that a similar ceremony was conducted at the construction of Raffles Lighthouse on Coney Island and since Coney Island was strictly within SG's domain and this ceremony was conducted in a similar fashion, the Pedea Branca ceremony cannot be considered a state action taking possession of a territory.<br><br>Anyway, this doesn't change the fact that the Masons in effect, represented the who's who of the British establishment in the colonies... Hence, their participation would've been as ubiquitous as the participation of the Chinese secret societies in the consecration of a new Chinese temple.<br><br>The difference here is:<br><br>A chinese temple built on land in the colony remains under the jurisdiction of the colonial administration (as much as they can and care to control the Chinese in those days)<br><br>BUT<br><br>A lighthouse built on no-man's land witnessed by Colonial administration VIPs, influential european merchants and local Malay chiefs, and accompanied by a speech that said "Â“May the All Bounteous Author of Nature bless our Island (Singapore), of which this Rock (Pedra Branca) is a dependency ...Â”<br><br>That pretty much sums up the case in my humble opinion...<br><br>So really... its beside the point that they were Masons... but that they were VIPs who happened to be Masons <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Its like an ultra atas country club in those days  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br></div>
