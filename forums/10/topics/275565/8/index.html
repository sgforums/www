See the pictures, says S'pore<br><br>IN THE HAGUE - AT A glance, the two pictures look alike. Both have Horsburgh Lighthouse and Pedra Branca in the foreground.<br><br>But look again - at the background which shows the Johor mainland, with Point Romania and a hill named Mount Berbukit. In one picture the hill is highly visible; in the other, it is hardly visible.<br><br>Therein lies the photographic illusion that Malaysia had created to exaggerate the closeness of Pedra Branca to Johor, Singapore said yesterday at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in The Hague.<br><br>The first photograph, which Malaysia had shown the court last week, was taken by a camera using a telephoto lens.<br><br>The second photograph was taken by Singapore, using a camera lens that approximates what the human eye sees. As a result, the Malaysian photograph exaggerated the height of Mount Berbukit by about seven times, Singapore's Attorney-General Chao Hick Tin said when he presented the two photos before the court.<br><br>He described it as 'an attempt to convey a subliminal message of proximity between Pedra Branca and the coast of Johor'.But it was not an accurate reflection of what visitors to Pedra Branca would see if they were looking towardsthe Johor mainland, he said.<br><br>Mr Chao was speaking before the ICJ as the hearing over the Pedra Branca dispute enters the third week. Yesterday was the first day of Singapore's rebuttals against Malaysia's oral arguments made last week.<br><br>Both countries are appearing at the ICJ to resolve their dispute over the sovereignty of the island 40km east of Singapore and which stands at the eastern entrance of the Singapore Strait.<br><br>Last week, Malaysia had also claimed the photo in question was taken from an online blog or weblog. The implication was the photo came from an independent source.<br><br>But yesterday, Mr Chao raised questions about the blog: www.leuchtturm3.blogspot.com .<br><br>'This blog site is a most unusual one. It was created only last month. There is no information on the identity of the blogger and the photograph used by Malaysia was only put on the website on Nov 2 2007, four days before the start of these oral proceedings,' he said.<br><br>Mr Chao also sought to debunk Malaysia's claim that Pedra Branca was near Point Romania in Johor. The phrase 'near Point Romania' was used in an 1844 letter from the Temenggong of Johor to Governor Butterworth in Singapore.<br><br>In that letter, the Temenggong gave permission for the British to build a lighthouse on any island near Point Romania.<br><br>Malaysia claimed the phrase included Pedra Branca, and that the letter showed Britain acknowledged Johor's sovereignty over the island.<br><br>Mr Chao said the letter did not refer to Pedra Branca but to Peak Rock which, in 1844, was where the British planned to build a lighthouse.<br><br>He pointed out the distance between Pedra Branca and Point Romania was six times that between the latter and Peak Rock.<br><br>In an 1846 letter, Governor Butterworth explained his original preference for Peak Rock as the site of a lighthouse because Pedra Branca was 'at so great a distance from the main land'.<br><br>Singapore's rebuttals yesterday were launched by Deputy Prime Minister S. Jayakumar. He highlighted five 'baseless allegations and insinuations' that Malaysia had lobbed against Singapore and rebutted each in turn.<br><br>Among them was Malaysia's charge that Singapore wished to 'subvert' long-established arrangements in the Singapore Strait.<br><br>On the contrary, he said, it was Kuala Lumpur that tried to alter the status quo through the publication of a map in 1979 that altered its maritime boundaries with seven of its neighbours.<br><br>That was also the map that sparked the current dispute.<br><br>Prof Jayakumar said he was disappointed that Malaysia had resorted to such allegations in its bid to win the case. 'We should seek to win by stating objective facts and submitting persuasive legal arguments, and not by resorting to unfounded political statements and making insinuations damaging to the integrity of the opposite party,' he said.<br><br>lydia@sph.com.sg<br><br>Copyright, 2007, Singapore Press Holdings Limited</div>

Jayakumar said these insinuations were baseless and unnecessary.<br><br>He said that in Singapore's first round of oral pleadings, it had focused its presentations on legal and factual issues.<br><br>It had carefully avoided mentioning extraneous matters that might affect the integrity of the court proceedings, he told the International Court of Justice (ICJ).<br><br>'In view of the good relations between the two countries, we had expected Malaysia to do the same,' he said.<br><br>'We are therefore surprised and disappointed that Malaysia has, in her oral pleadings, made a series of allegations and insinuations against Singapore.<br><br>'These are of a nature which, unless rebutted, would impeach or diminish Singapore's integrity or could impress on the minds of the members of the court that there could be dire consequences for relations in the region if the dispute were decided in favour of Singapore.'<br><br>Singapore and Malaysia are appearing before the ICJ to resolve their dispute over the sovereignty of Pedra Branca, an island 40km east of Singapore and which stands at the eastern entrance of the Singapore Strait.<br><br>Both sides have presented their first round of oral arguments in the last two weeks. The hearing is now in its third and final week, with each side given two days to rebut the other's arguments.<br><br>DPM Jayakumar said that contrary to Malaysia's claims, Singapore was an honest, law-abiding state that has never and will never do anything to endanger navigational safety, security arrangements or the Singapore Strait's environment.<br><br>He also said it was Kuala Lumpur, not Singapore, which sought to alter the status quo by publishing a map in 1979 that altered the maritime boundaries with seven of Malaysia's neighbours.<br><br>That map sparked the dispute over Pedra Branca.<br><br>The DPM read from a telegram which KL had sent to its overseas missions in December 1979, informing them that the 1979 map would 'affect' Thailand, Vietnam, Singapore, Indonesia, Brunei, the Philippines and China.<br><br>He also took pains to debunk Malaysia's insinuation that Singapore had hidden two letters from the ICJ, a charge he described as 'the most disturbing' of the lot. He said Singapore did not have the letters and had searched various archives to no avail.<br><br>Five other speakers delivered presentations on Singapore's behalf yesterday.<br><br>They included Chief Justice Chan Sek Keong, who focused on KL's claim that the Johor sultanate possessed a title to Pedra Branca from time immemorial.<br><br>Drawing from historians' accounts, he painted a picture of the Johor sultanate as an unstable kingdom whose geographical boundaries were unclear and based more on people's allegiance than territory.<br><br>To establish Johor's sovereignty over an uninhabited island like Pedra Branca, Malaysia thus had to produce documentary proof of its title, CJ Chan argued. This it had failed to do, he added.<br><br>Besides asking the ICJ to decide Pedra Branca's fate, Singapore and Malaysia have also asked it to rule on who has sovereignty over two smaller maritime features near it: Middle Rocks and South Ledge.<br><br>Yesterday, Malaysia's stand that the two should be regarded as separate and distinct from Pedra Branca was criticised by Singapore's Attorney-General Chao Hick Tin.<br><br>Singapore's stand is that whoever has sovereignty over Pedra Branca also owns the two smaller features.<br><br>Mr Chao asked why Malaysia was 'so anxious' to separate their fate from that of Pedra Branca. Was Malaysia hoping to salvage something for the future delimitation of its seas, in the event the court ruled Pedra Branca belonged to Singapore, he asked.<br><br>Or was Malaysia hoping the court would split the goods between the two countries? If it was the latter, Mr Chao said: 'The law and the facts simply do not support such a ruling.'<br><br>lydia@sph.com.sg<br><br>Copyright, 2007, Singapore Press Holdings Limited</div>

Jayakumar expressed surprise and disappointment at the allegations and insinuations made against Singapore by Malaysia last week. He has to rebut them, he said yesterday. Otherwise, they will leave an impression of dire consequences for the region if the ICJ decided in Singapore's favour, he added. Below is an account of his arguments.</strong><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Straits Times, The (Singapore)<br>Home, Pg H6<br>November 20, 2007</span><br><br><img src="http://i15.tinypic.com/7wyovtk.jpg"><br><br><strong>Concealment of letters</strong><br><br>MALAYSIA insinuated that Singapore might have hidden two 1844 letters from Governor Butterworth to the rulers of Johor, in which he sought permission to build a lighthouse near Point Romania on the Johor coast.<br><br>Both countries are disputing whether the scope of the permission sought included Pedra Branca.<br><br>This is an important point as Malaysia claims that Pedra Branca was part of the Johor sultanate at the time and the Johor rulers gave the British permission to build a lighthouse there.<br><br>Singapore disputes that. It argues that Pedra Branca belonged to no one when the British took lawful possession of it in 1847 and built Horsburgh Lighthouse there.<br><br>Both Tan Sri Abdul Kadir Mohamad, Foreign Affairs Adviser to the Malaysian Prime Minister, and Malaysia's counsel, Sir Elihu Lauterpacht, spoke about the missing letters.<br><br>Sir Elihu told the International Court of Justice (ICJ) at The Hague that the letter must originally have been in the Singapore archives and that he would have to 'leave entirely aside any suggestion...that Singapore has deliberately concealed'.<br><br>Yesterday, DPM Jayakumar told the court that remark was the 'most disturbing' of Malaysia's insinuations.<br><br>Singapore did not have copies of Butterworth's letters, he said, and had searched for them in various archives to no avail.<br><br>The reality was that its archives were incomplete, as noted in Mary Turnbull's authoritative history of the Straits Settlements, he added.<br><br>DPM Jayakumar also pointed out the difficulty Singapore would face in hiding such documents, even if it wished to, as microfilm copies of its archival records were available in other institutions, including Australia's Monash University, which bought them in 1961.<br><br>Finally, he noted that Governor Butterworth sent the letters to Johor's Sultan and Temenggong.<br><br>'Why should Malaysia say that 'these must originally have been in the Singapore archive'? Would it not be more logical for the original of the letters to be in Johor, not Singapore?<br><br>'However, Malaysia has stated that she also does not have the letters. Singapore has accepted that in good faith,' he said.<br><br><strong>Subverting the legal order</strong><br><br>MALAYSIA also claimed that Singapore 'seeks to disrupt' long-established arrangements in the Singapore Strait and 'subvert' arrangements reached between Johor and Great Britain more than 150 years ago.<br><br>But it is Malaysia, DPM Jayakumar said, that is trying to alter the status quo by claiming Pedra Branca after 130 years of inaction.<br><br>In 1979, Malaysia published a map which showed for the first time that Pedra Branca lay within its territorial waters.<br><br>DPM Jayakumar said it was evident from a telegram Malaysia had sent to all her overseas missions on Dec 20, 1979 that Kuala Lumpur knew the map would alter the status quo.<br><br>That telegram said the 1979 map would 'affect' Thailand, Vietnam, Singapore, Indonesia, Brunei, the Philippines and China.<br><br>'As Malaysia had anticipated, her map indeed attracted protests from all seven countries,' DPM Jayakumar said.<br><br>'Who then, may I ask, was seeking to upset the existing legal order?'<br><br>Malaysia also told the court that if it found in Singapore's favour, the stability of Malaysia's relationship with Indonesia would be affected.<br><br>DPM Jayakumar said that was another attempt to influence the court with 'extraneous considerations which have no foundation'.<br><br><strong>Sinister motives</strong><br><br>MALAYSIA also alleged sinister intentions on Singapore's part.<br><br>It speculated that Singapore might reclaim the sea around Pedra Branca to create a 'maritime domain', with potential adverse impact on the environment, navigation and security.<br><br>DPM Jayakumar said that was 'scaremongering' as Singapore was a law-abiding country.<br><br>Its economic well-being and very survival depended on its status as a major port of call, which, in turn, was dependent on the smooth flow of shipping traffic through the Singapore Strait.<br><br>'We have never taken, and will never undertake, any action which would endanger the marine environment, the safety of navigation and the security situation in the Singapore Strait,' he said.<br><br><strong>Used navy aggressively</strong><br><br>MALAYSIA also complained of Singapore's 'military presence' on Pedra Branca. It alleged that Singapore sent its naval vessels to the island in 1986, after the dispute arose, raising tensions in the area and chasing away Malaysian fishermen.<br><br>But Singapore's navy had been patrolling Pedra Branca's waters since the British navy withdrew in 1975, four years before the dispute arose in 1979, he said.<br><br>The Singapore navy's presence in the area had also been peaceful and non-confrontational and none of its officers had arrested any Malaysian fishing vessels.<br><br>By comparison, Malaysia had aggressively arrested Singapore's fishing vessels in the area and raised tensions, he added.<br><br><strong>Offer to let Singapore continue running lighthouse</strong><br><br>MALAYSIA also told the court that it had always respected Singapore's position as the operator of Horsburgh Lighthouse on Pedra Branca and would continue to do so.<br><br>DPM Jayakumar said there was no need and no basis for Malaysia to do so.<br><br>'Singapore's rights in relation to Pedra Branca are the rights of a country having sovereignty over the island, not that of a lighthouse operator,' he said.<br><br>And Malaysia had recognised Singapore's sovereign status over Pedra Branca until December 1979, he added.<br><br>'The questions for the court, as agreed by both countries...concern sovereignty. This case is not about the right to operate the Horsburgh Lighthouse,' he said.<br><br>In closing, DPM Jayakumar said Singapore had no choice but to rebut Malaysia's baseless allegations and insinuations.<br><br>'Every state which appears before this honourable court in a dispute would of course do all it can to persuade this court to decide in its favour. That is perfectly legitimate.<br><br>'However, we should seek to win by stating objective facts and submitting persuasive legal arguments, and not by resorting to unfounded political statements and making insinuations damaging to the integrity of the opposite party,' he said.<br><br>He reiterated that Singapore and Malaysia agreed to submit their dispute to the ICJ instead of allowing it to adversely affect their overall good relations.<br><br>'I have no doubt that both countries are committed to maintaining our friendly and peaceful relations,' he said.<br><br>Copyright, 2007, Singapore Press Holdings Limited<br></div>

Andaya and Carl Trocki, whose writings Malaysia had also relied on.<br><br>He told the court: 'In the context of a Malay sultanate which was people-centric and not territory-centric, general descriptions of the geographical extent of the sultanate's domains have no probative value at all as attributions of sovereignty.'<br><br>Yet, Malaysia had sought to rely on such general descriptions to debunk Singapore's stand that Pedra Branca was, in the 1840s, terra nullius.<br><br>Yesterday, Mr Chan and counsel for Singapore Alain Pellet also highlighted Malaysia's complete lack of documentary proof that Johor ever possessed title to Pedra Branca.<br><br>They noted that none of the historical documents cited by Malaysia to back its claim even mentioned Pedra Branca by name.<br><br>The only one that did was a newspaper article that Professor Pellet had earlier argued was unreliable.<br><br>Yesterday, he highlighted a previous International Court of Justice ruling in which the court had said that documents which did not mention an island by name were not relevant in deciding which state had sovereignty over it.<br><br>That ruling was issued in the case between Malaysia and Indonesia over the islands of Sipadan and Ligitan.<br><br>Mr Chan also reminded the court of a 1953 letter in which Johor's top civil servant of the time informed the British authorities in Singapore that Johor 'does not claim ownership of Pedra Branca'.<br><br>That disclaimer, he said, was entirely consistent with the lack of evidence that Johor ever possessed title to the disputed island.<br><br>It was also consistent with Malaysia's silence in the face of Britain and Singapore's display of state authority over Pedra Branca since 1847.<br><br>'Johor disclaimed title because it had no title. What more can be said?' he asked.<br><br>Copyright, 2007, Singapore Press Holdings Limited</div>

And most likely armed SAF personal if needed. About 12-13 years ago, Umno Youth planned to plant the Malaysia Flag on the island..... the Navy was on 24hr standby, while the Airforce was on short notice to send in troops by helo....... luckily in the end, no malaysian boat owner wa crazy enough to let the Umno Youth charter their boats.<br><br>And yes...... after the 'problem' with Malaysia over the claim of the island, S'pore did post Coast Guard personal ( 7 - 8 ) to the lighthouse...... If i remember correctly, for week long posting. The ships in my sqn was task to send the men there unless the sea are too rough to safely transfer then over by seaboat.<br><br>Radar Surveillance gears can be use by both PSA or SAF.... no doubt about it, but who doesn't think Malaysia does the same with their own system.
