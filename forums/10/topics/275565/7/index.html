It may not even have an impact on the final verdict becase the Malaysians did not use this as their core argument.<br><br>In the conduct of the proceedings in the ICJ, both countries have to abide by the court rules and formats.<br><br>4 days for oral presentations by each side, followed by 2 days for rebuttal of each other's claims.<br><br>This statement uttered would not even require a rebuttal because it does not constitute the core of the Malaysian side's argument and they were wise to keep it to a minimum because there were other points that were more worthwhile to present.<br><br>U are harping on a point which even the Malaysian delegates to the ICJ found peripheral to the core question: Which country has a rightful title over Pedra Branca, South Ledge and Middle Rocks, based on colonial treaties and actual excercise of authority over the area.<br><br>Also, both sides have made interesting and persuasive points, not because they were democratic or autocratic, but because they were both defending what they felt was their country's interests and territorial sovereignty.<br></div>
