Sheesh...there goes Pulau Batu Puteh!'<br><br>Pulau Batu Puteh is Malaysia's name for Pedra Branca.<br><br>Singapore and Malaysia are appearing before the International Court of Justice (ICJ) to resolve their dispute over the sovereignty of Pedra Branca, an island 40km east of Singapore and which stands at the eastern entrance of the Singapore Strait.<br><br>On Monday, Singapore's Attorney-General Chao Hick Tin said the photo Malaysia produced was shot using a camera with a telephoto lens, which exaggerated the closeness of Pedra Branca to the Johor coast.<br><br>In questioning the blog, Mr Chao saidthe photo had been put up just four days before the start of the ICJ hearing.<br><br>In the blog, its author claims to be a lover of lighthouses and 'leuchtturm' is the German word for lighthouse.<br><br>Simplyjean found the following sentence on the design of lighthouses was lifted from Wikipedia: 'Often these are cylindrical to reduce the effect of wind on a tall structure on less stable soil. An example of this is Pulau Batu Puteh Lighthouse.'<br><br>The only change the author of leuchtturm3 had made was to use Pulau Batu Puteh Lighthouse in place of Cape May Lighthouse. But it was done in a way that anyone who clicks on the hyperlinked words Pulau Batu Puteh is led to a page on Cape May Lighthouse in Wikipedia.<br><br>Meanwhile, some netizens posted criticisms on the leuchtturm3 blog of what they called the 'doctored picture'.<br><br>Yesterday, its author confessed he knew little about Singapore or Malaysia and hoped to visit the region one day when he had the money.<br><br>As for Simplyjean, its writer confessed in a post that the Pedra Branca case held little interest initially. 'But when they decided to bring the blogosphere into the news, then I felt that I had to do some justification for the community.'<br><br>Simplyjean has this message for the person behind the leuchtturm3 blog: 'To the author (and all other implied parties), you suck.'<br><br>lydia@sph.com.sg<br><br>Copyright, 2007, Singapore Press Holdings Limited</div>

He said the Johor Agreement and the Federation of Malaya Agreement, both of which came into force in 1948, provided that all external and defence matters of the state be transferred to the British.<br><br>"Such affairs were to be executed through the high commissioner of the federation," he said in the opening session of Malaysia's second round oral submission before the International Court of Justice.<br><br>In that year, the nine Malay States, including Johor, the former Straits Settlements (SS) of Malacca and Penang made up the federation.<br><br>Under both agreements, Johor, which was a protected state, transferred all of her rights, powers and jurisdiction on defence and external affairs to the British, he said.<br><br>Gani said both agreements continued to be in force until the Federation of Malaya Independence Act 1957 came into force.<br><br>He said a clause in the Federation Agreement provided that the executive authority of the federation shall be exercised by the high commissioner either directly or through officers subordinate to him.<br><br>Gani said another clause in the Federation Agreement clearly showed that no power or authority exercised by the high commissioner could be exercised by a state secretary.<br><br>"The Federation Agreement does not provide any executive authority to any state or settlement.<br><br>"Johor, therefore, had no power or competence to deal with matters pertaining to external affairs," he said.<br><br>Gani said the then Johor acting state secretary, M. Seth Saaid, was merely a civil servant and had no legal capacity to write the 1953 letter to renounce any part of Johor's territories.<br><br>On Tuesday, Singapore's agent Tommy Koh, in his closing remark, claimed that Johor in 1953 was a sovereign state and Seth's letter to the Singapore government was binding under international law.<br><br>Malaysia had earlier submitted that Singapore was seeking to use the letter as her root to claim title over PBP.<br><br>Gani also pointed out that the letter from Singapore representative J.D. Higham was addressed to the Johor British adviser and copied to the chief secretary of the federation.<br><br>He said it was not addressed to Seth and the acting state secretary undertook himself to issue the letter to Higham.<br><br>"He wrote directly to a local authority of the British colony of Singapore.<br><br>"He did not copy his letter to the chief secretary," Gani said.<br><br>He added that there was no evidence that the chief secretary or the high commissioner was aware of the contents of this letter.<br><br>Gani said the way the correspondence was conducted was procedurally irregular and incorrect.<br><br>He said Singapore could not prove PBP was no man's land although she claimed that the British had taken possession of the island between 1847 to 1851.<br><br>"Singapore's case simply rests on the inference that PBP was terra nullius (no man's land)," he said.<br><br>Gani said Singapore also remained silent or failed to produce the "incontrovertible legal evidence" in the form of documents claimed in 1978 to be in her possession.<br><br>He said Singapore's conduct after the critical date of dispute in December 1979 were relevant for assessing state activities carried out by the island republic.<br><br>"They are not a normal continuation of Singapore's prior acts of administrating the lighthouse but to strengthen her legal position in the present dispute," he said.<br><br>Hearing continues.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Â© Copyright 2007 The New Straits Times Press (M) Berhad.

But to many countries, their "national reputation" pales in importance to their domestic agenda.<br><br>Its not often that you find an electorate, even in mature democracies, vote in a government because of its foreign policy.<br><br><blockquote>Is it any surprise that every agreements will have to be a win-win situation, in which ''everyone'' in the system will ''benefit'' from any agreement ?<br><br>Is it not a surprise that such a practise can only encourage the festering of the continued habit of ensuring that the ''benefits'' will trickle down the political system ?</blockquote>Aiyo... Signing a deal from a perspective of mutual benefit is not the same as wanting a cut under the table.<br><br>Truth be told, if it was that simple, we wouldn't be at the ICJ... either party would've been bought off by the side that has more money to spare for this venture.<br><br><blockquote>It require a political will of a disciplined national leadership to change the mind-set of the society that encourage positive social values. It certainly do not help when the national leadership succumb to the characteristics of the herd that they are leading.<br><br></blockquote>U assume that the people who are called to positions of authority are individuals of a higher moral standing, or who are subject to a higher standard of morality then the "herd"...<br><br>It has been proven time and again that this is often not so... Bill Clinton for instance... But then again, what is a BJ enjoyed in the comforts of the Oval Office when compared to starting a war and causing the death and destruction of a country that is all but broken by sanctions?<br><br>Another point is that of accountability, for who will guard the guards themselves? Its circuitous isn't it? When we assume that Leaders need to set positive examples for the untidy herd to follow, so... How does the untidy herd check the powers of the leaders? Since the untidy herd is not of a sufficiently high moral standing as compared to the leaders (or they would be the leaders wouldn't they?)<br><br>So it comes down to the point where the leaders eventually descend to the levels of the untidy herd, if it is indeed, the duty of the untidy herd to check the powers of the leader.<br><br>It has nothing to do with alpha-males or herds... Its simply a matter of pple getting the leadership they deserve... Through voting, through participation and through plain and simple CARING for what's going on around them.<br><br>We can argue till the cows come home on the lack of political space in SG, and the oppressive climate of the ruling party, but seriously... How many pple care?<br><br>Our views differes but I know you care. I do too. How many of us are there?<br><br><blockquote>The failure of the Indonesian legislature to accept and ratify the negotiated and formalized treaty between the Governments of Indonesia and Singapore - was perhaps a failure of the Indonesia Government to present the matter to the legislature before formalising the agreement with Singapore.<br><br>Singapore should have realised this required process before raising their own misplaced faith in the believing the show is over after the ink is dried on the Agreement.</blockquote>To be fair to the poor civil servants who had to fly over and do all the leg work before getting the big-wigs to come over and sign on the dotted line, I actually believe that there was a great deal of good faith between both parties.<br><br>Unless u believe the "conspiracy theories" that it was tied to the sand, that was incidentally being held by the Indonesian authorities at that time.<br><br>So in any event, nothing was agreed to and nothing was settled.<br><br>Its actually no worse that where we were before since its well known by now that SBY doesn't have enough clout to call the shots anymore.<br></div>
