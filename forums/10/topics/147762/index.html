            <div class='col-md body'>Many other constituency functions similarly are held for the purpose of showing off. Such functions are very lavish with sponsors being coerced to take up advertisements for commemorable publications which benefit only the personal reputation of MPs or only a few people while spending hundreds of thousands for little benefits of all.<br><br>Such public facilities like community clubs etc are also too lavish and at the end there is only a few users or benefiaries.<br><br>The millions spent on such underused facilities and their maintenance should have been collected as endowment funds to relief the unfortunate and unemployed. If the MPs are really concerned about the under-privileged and poor they should set good example in spending public monies and channel the hard-earned public funds to where the mouth is and not to tsunami alone for international name and recognition.</div>

Just look at all of your replies...its astounding how easily the PAP has bribed some people through their stomaches. It's so obvious and yet so blinding, it's stunning.<br><br>For the record, that is your stomach and your heart talking, not your brain. As for your moral principles, you have none whatsoever.<br><br>I don't attend such dinners because<br>1) I believe in healthy eating and living<br>2) It's wrong to celebrate in such lavish manner when there's such a high unemployment rate among the people<br>3) I believe the dinners are just a bribing exercise to boost their flagging support among the people in the heartlands and also at least 25-35% of those living in private estates or condos.<br><br>And besides I'd like to think I have better stronger moral values than you have.</div>
