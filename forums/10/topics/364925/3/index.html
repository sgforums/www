              <p>Good for you, this is the most noble remark on this issue, you don't have to go down on your hands and legs and bark just because you are irritated by a dog barking at you.</p>
              <p>But if you want to counter them, you need wisdom and patience, so that you win standing tall. Many people ended up being just another dog, a different kind of dog, a singaporean dog.</p>

              <p>The minute you admit that you "losed out with those..." you finished liao. your mother gave birth to you, your father brought you up, your teachers taught you...and many kids know how to think even when they were in primary schools, when did you?</p>
              <p>you can blame the government, or the world, but if you don't learn how to fight now, you will always have to admit defeat, wherever you go! for indians, chinese,...are everywhere.</p>
              <p>may be you should start a family in India, so that your sons can be PHD but can work for only 4.5K, and they can set example for what singaporean can do.</p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">When In
              graduated from university, I was thinking of having a good prospect
              in life. Earning and surviving, being capable of making a good
              living. I am an engineering student; my results are good in
              the way I have obtained a higher honor degree.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">As a fresh
              graduate, I didn't request for much, I know that economic are bad,
              that is 5~6 years back, the economic is extremely bad, just
              about the same as now.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">I was called for
              an interview by NEA. The advertisement called for fresh
              graduate.It's a rubbish incinerator plant in Tuas. 5 men went for
              the interview session. 4 Singaporean Chinese + 1 Indian (from
              India.) <span> </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">The Singaporeans
              were smartly groomed for the interview session, tie, long sleeve,
              slack and boots. The Indian man was in polo t shirt, jean and
              running shoes.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">While waiting,
              one of the Chinese guys told us to exchange HP number, since there
              is only one vacancy for the job, if one of us got it, we shall
              inform the others via sms. We agreed.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">3 weeks have
              passed; I had received the sms from the other guys saying they
              didn’t get the job. Heard from one of the guys who have a friend
              who is working in the plant told him that the Indian guy have got
              the job. His salary demand is 4.8K. He is 45 years old. But after 6
              months, he left the company. he wasted the chance of us,
              singaporean . in getting a job. the advertisement put. "those who
              have applied before please do not apply again".</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Well, government
              related sectors also start hiring foreigner rather then Singapore
              graduates. I was at PUB before, I can see they are hiring YOUNG
              china lady to become engineer, their work attitude and their speech
              is really bad. Their salary are very high, about 5K per
              month.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">The current
              "Foreign Talent" come here to mess up singapore. they worked in
              singapore, but they constantly looking for jobs in the other
              countries. they don't belong to singapore. PAP is messing with our
              life.</span></p>

              <p>just a little suggestion,</p>
              <p>know your rights in the company and in your position, and exercise it when necessary; stick to your job and do it well; stay out of these people who irritate you. </p>
              <p>After office, unload everything trouble you have in the office by going out with the people you like, so that you can start afreshed the next day.</p>
              <p>Wait, wait for the moment when they are vulnerable, when they make mistake, then make your move, let them know they make mistake too...don't have to end in a vicious cycle, retaliation after retaliation.</p>
              <p>In the meantime, wait for the economics to get better, there will always be a better job out there.</p>
              <p>There is one thing you must know, the indians are very good at politics, especially office politics.</p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">When In
              graduated from university, I was thinking of having a good prospect
              in life. Earning and surviving, being capable of making a good
              living. I am an engineering student; my results are good in
              the way I have obtained a higher honor degree.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">As a fresh
              graduate, I didn't request for much, I know that economic are bad,
              that is 5~6 years back, the economic is extremely bad, just
              about the same as now.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">I was called for
              an interview by NEA. The advertisement called for fresh
              graduate.It's a rubbish incinerator plant in Tuas. 5 men went for
              the interview session. 4 Singaporean Chinese + 1 Indian (from
              India.) <span> </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">The Singaporeans
              were smartly groomed for the interview session, tie, long sleeve,
              slack and boots. The Indian man was in polo t shirt, jean and
              running shoes.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">While waiting,
              one of the Chinese guys told us to exchange HP number, since there
              is only one vacancy for the job, if one of us got it, we shall
              inform the others via sms. We agreed.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">3 weeks have
              passed; I had received the sms from the other guys saying they
              didn’t get the job. Heard from one of the guys who have a friend
              who is working in the plant told him that the Indian guy have got
              the job. His salary demand is 4.8K. He is 45 years old. But after 6
              months, he left the company. he wasted the chance of us,
              singaporean . in getting a job. the advertisement put. "those who
              have applied before please do not apply again".</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Well, government
              related sectors also start hiring foreigner rather then Singapore
              graduates. I was at PUB before, I can see they are hiring YOUNG
              china lady to become engineer, their work attitude and their speech
              is really bad. Their salary are very high, about 5K per
              month.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">The current
              "Foreign Talent" come here to mess up singapore. they worked in
              singapore, but they constantly looking for jobs in the other
              countries. they don't belong to singapore. PAP is messing with our

              <p>If i understand you correctly that "It is indeed a serious issue,... that the fault lies with management. All they care about is their bottom line...But then that's how a company is suppose to operate"? so is it a fault then?</p>
              <p>if that is the case, why should "Local bosses be aware how our society members are affected and should give locals a chance, offer a fairer wage"?</p>
              <p>With low company tax, high salaries for directors, it is difficult for common workers who have to compete with lower salary, enjoying little social protection, enduring high medical costs to understand.</p>
              <p>and if the bosses are "our own citizens", and are paid very high, like the ministers, that makes it more difficult for simple citizens to understand, doesn't it?</p>
              <p>I agree it is a serious issue, and where the fault lies,...but is it something we can do, or the government should do?</p>

              <p>With low company tax, high salaries for directors, it is difficult for common workers who have to compete with lower salary, enjoying little social protection, enduring high medical costs to understand.</p>
              <p>and if the bosses are "our own citizens", and are paid very high, like the ministers, that makes it more difficult for simple citizens to understand, doesn't it?</p>
              <p>I agree it is a serious issue, and where the fault lies,...but is it something we can do, or the government should do?</p>

              <p>We pride ourselves as a democracy. Thus we must accept the good with the flaws. Singapore is not communist state where the state controls all biz enterprises. Do you want our country to be a totalitarian state? It can be done, you know?</p>

              <p>Utimately, the govts can only do so much. But we, the citizens are not without powers to effect change. We are a society, and much better placed to effect changes, espacially during these times.

              <p>Citizens are totally powerless in this red dot. All change has to be decided and implemented by the ruling party. It has nothing to with the citizens. If the citizens had their way, there wouldn't be so many foreigners here today.</p>

              <p>What exactly does that mean? Are you saying Singaporeans are only bothered about their own survival and will therefore not take up this issue? That they won't give a damn if their bosses are socially responsible or not, as long as their jobs and salaries are not in danger?</p>

              <p>Usual empty stuff from you. The truth is: unless and until the govt steps in, companies will continue to exploit foreign workers and refrain from employing locals at decent wages.</p>
