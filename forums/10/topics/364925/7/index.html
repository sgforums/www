              <p>It is only a matter of time before the evil PAP will be overthrowed and replaced by a new government.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>How do you want the new government to treat the foreigners?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have some ideas on how foreigners should be treated in order to be fair to singaporeans.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1. All S pass and work permit holders earning less than 2k a month will have to pay 20% income tax, earn 2k to 4k a month will pay 30% income taxes, earn 4k to 5k a month will pay 40% income taxes, earn more than 5k a month will pay 50% income taxes.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Since they come to singapore to work and earn our money, it is only fair that they pay higher taxes than singaporeans.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. All foreigners who comes to singapore and pay for a education and subsequently they work at singapore will be expemted form these high taxes. They will pay the same amount of tax as singaporeans. This is because they are willing to invest money and time for an education in singapore. This shows they are sincere in working in singapore so we can exempt them from the high taxes.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3. Singapore government will not give any scholarships to any foreigners. If the government is so rich they should give scholarship to singaporeans.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>4. For all S pass and work permit foreigners, they can apply to become PR after working for at least 3 years. Once they become PR, they get to enjoy all the benefits that singaporeans enjoy such as low income tax, medical subsidy etc. But they will have to pay a 1 time payment of $20k if they want to be PR. Note that this 20k is not to give to the government so that they can use all this money for corruption to increase their own salary.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The government will collect all this money and at the end of the year, they will distribute all the money equally to all Singaporeans.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>5. For PR who wants to become citizens of singapore, they will have to serve 2 years NS irregardless of whether they are guy or girl. If they are too old to serve NS, they can get their son or daughter to serve on their behalf. If they have no kids too, they have to pay $60k to be exempted from NS to become a citizen of singapore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Note that these money will not be given to the government too. It wil be collected by the government and at the end of the year, the total sum of money will be distributed equally to all singaporeans.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Do you think we treat foreigners in such a way is fair to us?</p>

              <p>the feeling of being backstabbed by FT at work is really hard to swallow here in our own homeland. imagine a local being backstabbed and sabotaged real bad by someone who doesn't even belong here, complains about singaporeans being unfair to them (but not working to prove their mettle) and spend money like crazy but complains about low wages?? (the pay is not so low, its same as mine!!)</p>
              <p>i dont hate the whole flock, but really, somehow this gives me a bad impression, plus I noticed that many FT nowadays, esp the younger ones, have this really stuck-up, snobbish look. &lt;-- do you notice this?</p>

              <p>But they still act like snobs, and the ones in my office give me that "WTF-are-you-doing-here-you-F***-SGean?" look. They still make things difficult for me. Just yesterday, I was using two machines to do work, alternating between both cos both have different functions. Then the male pinoy FT hogged either of those machines whenever I was using the other.</p>
              <p>Fine. But he wasn't doing anything. He just sat there to annoy me, knowing that I had to have my results out by yesterday. I told my manager (another pinoy, but no choice, since she's the one who wanted the results) and <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">she didn't do anything</span></strong>.</p>

              <p>How to? I tried being nice to them. Im not normally mean until
                  someone starts being mean to me, so it isn't hard being nice.</p>
              <p>But they still act like snobs, and the ones in my office give me
                  that "WTF-are-you-doing-here-you-F***-SGean?" look. They still make
                  things difficult for me. Just yesterday, I was using two machines
                  to do work, alternating between both cos both have different
                  functions. Then the male pinoy FT hogged either of those machines

                  me, knowing that I had to have my results out by yesterday. I told
                  my manager (another pinoy, but no choice, since she's the one who
                  wanted the results) and <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">she didn't do

              <p>Your manager is also Pinoy ah ? Then finish already.</p>
              <p>I suggest you go find another job and make sure your immediate supervisor/manager is a Singaporean.</p>
              <p>Usually those foreigners will be very protective of another foreigner from their own country. If they had to sack.. they will sack Singaporean first.</p>
              <p>That's how they take over and protect their "territory".</p>
              <p>To them.. there's no such thing as fair play. Especially the ones from third world country.</p>

              <p>FTs will find it much tougher to join in, simply because they do not know and can't experience our current syllabus and system first hand... This is a high barrier of entry to FTs...</p>
              <p>And yup, serious... And already under-charging according to my students... Then again, not everyone is capable enough to give effective tuition...</p>
              <p>Only benefit of staying in my company is 1) still serving my scholarship bond, 2) provides CPF, not that it has much use, 3) company insurance, 4) social networking with pple of similar or older age, 5) tuition occurs after office hours anyway</p>

              <p>Other countries can operate their army forces to tackle different part of the their country problem by sending the army of no relationship to fight for them. One very good example is the Tiananman case, no beijing stationed army was involved.</p>

              <p><br>I do agree that many of the foreign professional tend to b troublemaker for the local.
