              <p>Hi guys. To all Singapore citizens born and bred here.</p>
              <p>I am thinking of setting up a group in Facebook entitled 'Foreign talents should not play office politics with Singaporeans'.</p>
              <p>This is nothing political. I don't care if there are any political spies here trying to monitor our activities in this forum. I just want to set up an online petition to protect the interests of the Singaporeans especially during this economic recession. FTs are still welcome but they don't do this mess with us. Of course we don't deliberately bully them as well.</p>
              <p>Now, if you are interested, PM me at <a href="mailto:scorpio_of_82@yahoo.com">scorpio_of_82@yahoo.com</a>.</p>
              <p>No violation of the Sedition Act here, i.e. badmouthing Muslims or Hindus.</p>
              <p>However, I am neutral with regards to nationality criticisms.</p>
              <p>Racial Harmony until now includes pre-1965 races of Singapore.</p>

              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">As a fresh graduate, I didn't request for much, I know that economic are bad, that is 5~6 years back, the economic is extremely bad, just about the same as now.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">I was called for an interview by NEA. The advertisement called for fresh graduate.It's a rubbish incinerator plant in Tuas. 5 men went for the interview session. 4 Singaporean Chinese + 1 Indian (from India.) <span> </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">The Singaporeans were smartly groomed for the interview session, tie, long sleeve, slack and boots. The Indian man was in polo t shirt, jean and running shoes. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">While waiting, one of the Chinese guys told us to exchange HP number, since there is only one vacancy for the job, if one of us got it, we shall inform the others via sms. We agreed.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">3 weeks have passed; I had received the sms from the other guys saying they didn’t get the job. Heard from one of the guys who have a friend who is working in the plant told him that the Indian guy have got the job. His salary demand is 4.8K. He is 45 years old. But after 6 months, he left the company. he wasted the chance of us, singaporean . in getting a job. the advertisement put. "those who have applied before please do not apply again".</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">Well, government related sectors also start hiring foreigner rather then Singapore graduates. I was at PUB before, I can see they are hiring YOUNG china lady to become engineer, their work attitude and their speech is really bad. Their salary are very high, about 5K per month.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">The current "Foreign Talent" come here to mess up singapore. they worked in singapore, but they constantly looking for jobs in the other countries. they don't belong to singapore. PAP is messing with our life. </span></p>

              <p><br>it all blame our government (PAP) education system. with all the university used up mainly for foreigner. and the long winded primary school, secondary school education system, with 2 year of national services. it's obvious we losed out with those indian. we are what our government made. they build the amount of school, insitutes and uni for us to study, impose the type of training /education for us, and make us losed out to foreigner.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>they put fresh graduate for the position. training, on job training will be provided. end up they get some foreigner craps.we asked for only 2.3K for a fresh member.</p>
