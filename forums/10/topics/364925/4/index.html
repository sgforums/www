              <p><br>"We pride ourselves as a democracy. "</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You may tae pride on Singapore being a democracy but everyone knows what kind of democracy is practised here.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Singapore is not communist state where the state controls all biz enterprises."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Then why is the govt involved in so many business activities? What about the companies it runs? Is there a minimum wage in place? If not, why not?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Do you want our country to be a totalitarian state?"</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Isn't Singapore already a totalitarian state? What makes you think it isn't?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Utimately, the govts can only do so much."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You keep repeating this all over this forum. Has the  govt actually done what it can? I'd say no.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"But we, the citizens are not without powers to effect change."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Citizens are totally powerless in this red dot. All change has to be decided and implemented by the ruling party. It has nothing to with the citizens. If the citizens had their way, there wouldn't be so many foreigners here today.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Singaporeans are pragmatic people and ruled by logic and reason with the issue of more socially responsible bosses."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What exactly does that mean? Are you saying Singaporeans are only bothered about their own survival and will therefore not take up this issue? That they won't give a damn if their bosses are socially responsible or not, as long as their jobs and salaries are not in danger?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Change can only begin with you and me, at the bedrock base of where all society springs and grows- the family."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Usual empty stuff from you. The truth is: unless and until the govt steps in, companies will continue to exploit foreign workers and refrain from employing locals at decent wages.</p>

              <p>4 years ago I had an indian boss, titled Director. He was good at entertaining all the people from head office, he brought in an accountant from india, after all the local accountants resigned, he set unrealistic targets for us to follow, and I never new if he had a degree. But hard luck, the people in the HQ thought he was good.</p>
              <p>The most important thing for me at that time was that I had all my sales people understanding me and standing by me, these included 1 prc chinese. My life was tough, unbearable at times, but there was no point complaining.</p>
              <p>I left the company 14 months after he came.</p>
              <p>Since then I worked for a german boss, good life for a year, a new boss came, big problem to make him understand this is singapore, not germany; just when I thought we are getting along, the financial crisis started........</p>
              <p>there is no difference between indian, prc chinese, angmoh, jap or singaporean, the difference is between the good the bad and the ugly. that's life!</p>

              <p>We pride ourselves as a democracy. Thus we must accept the good with the flaws. Singapore is not communist state where the state controls all biz enterprises. Do you want our country to be a totalitarian state? It can be done, you know?</p>
              <p>There is a line drawn between govt and biz enterprise, and there is so much govts can do before being accused of dictatorial authoritative rule with interferences. We could push our MPs to push for legislation, but once approved, it is across the board and may change the political landscape of our nation.</p>
              <p>Utimately, the govts can only do so much. But we, the citizens are not without powers to effect change. We are a society, and much better placed to effect changes, espacially during these times. Singaporeans are pragmatic people and ruled by logic and reason with the issue of more socially responsible bosses. Change can only begin with you and me, at the bedrock base of where all society springs and grows- the family.</p>

              <p>I don't really take pride in anything called "democracy". Indians claim India is the largest democratic country in the world, but the poor remain poor and the rich get richer.</p>
              <p>The greedy wall street fat cats in the US, which many claim is the model of democracy, squandered billions from the poor; the government use tax payers' money to save companies where their CEO made billions in terms of salary, benefits and bonuses.</p>
              <p>2 years ago I would believe that a democratic society with free market force is good for civilization. Today, it is obvious that democracy give the decision makers the freedom to write their own pay cheque. In this aspect, what's the difference between democracy and totalitarian?</p>
              <p>While I agree that Singapore is small and vulnerable, and the government need to run the country in ways unique to Singapore, it is difficult to understand that we need to be "dictatorial authoritative" to our people, but give total freedom to companies, especial foreign MNC; it is difficult to understand how leaders of a nation are expected to be treated as CEO and citizens are citizens only if you are useful to the country.</p>
              <p>Its about time we allow companies to come here just to employ cheap labour, enjoy low tax rate, and make maximum profit for repatriation. we should be asking how much are they contributing to the society in Singapore? how much are they spend on training locals staff every year,  how much transfer of technology and knowhow.</p>

              <p>Going beyond this issue, I think the govt blundered in not cultivating a diaspora. It should start now. Why should Singaporeans remain stuck to opportunities in this tiny red dot? The govt must aim to send people overseas so that they can take their true place in the first world, instead of competing with FTs for measly wages.</p>

              <p><br>Singaporeans are not asking for 3 times an FT's wage, FTs are willing to work at one-third of what a Singaporean will need for decent living. That's precisely the cause of the problem. The problem is not with Singaporeans demanding outrageously high wages, but FTs willing to work for outrageously low wages.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If there were a minimum wage policy, it would change many things.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Many locals claim they can do the job of FT, so dont you think bosses should give them a chance."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Of course they should, but what about the wages? When a boss says it makes business sense for him to hire FTs in place of locals, what does one do? Love for fellow Singaporeans won't help the bottomline.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"You will need a closeness to convince them of such social reponsiblities."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What is the need for all this? That's why I suggested that govt step in. But of course you have an aversion to govt interference in business.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"No. The govt only goes in, being the ones with society funds to create a stable employment and financial returns such as SIA, PSA, etc."</p>

              <p>My understanding of Expat vs FT.</p>
              <p>Foreign expat is a worker who works on Expat terms. They are paid according to the same wage structure as their home country.</p>
              <p>Most expats are transfered from their home country within the SAME corporation.</p>
              <p>Foreign talents are LOCAL hires. They are paid on local terms. On local wage structures.</p>
              <p>SO yes.. that guy in I not Stupid is a FT.</p>
              <p>However.. if the guy works for a international consulting firm ( an independent contractor)  .. he may be either a FT or a Expat.. depending on the terms of hire.</p>

              <p>Yes. They are already welcome here to work with us and compete with us for jobs.</p>

              <p>You know! I think in terms of upcoming racial harmony, Singapore should separate what I call pre-1965 races and post-1965 races.</p>
              <p>Pre-1965 races are the Chinese, Malays, Indians, Eurasians, Caucasians. The Malaysians, Indonesians, China and India can also belong to this category.</p>
