              <p>It is only a matter of time before the evil PAP will be overthrowed and replaced by a new government.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>How do you want the new government to treat the foreigners?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have some ideas on how foreigners should be treated in order to be fair to singaporeans.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1. All S pass and work permit holders earning less than 2k a month will have to pay 20% income tax, earn 2k to 4k a month will pay 30% income taxes, earn 4k to 5k a month will pay 40% income taxes, earn more than 5k a month will pay 50% income taxes.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Since they come to singapore to work and earn our money, it is only fair that they pay higher taxes than singaporeans.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. All foreigners who comes to singapore and pay for a education and subsequently they work at singapore will be expemted form these high taxes. They will pay the same amount of tax as singaporeans. This is because they are willing to invest money and time for an education in singapore. This shows they are sincere in working in singapore so we can exempt them from the high taxes.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3. Singapore government will not give any scholarships to any foreigners. If the government is so rich they should give scholarship to singaporeans.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>4. For all S pass and work permit foreigners, they can apply to become PR after working for at least 3 years. Once they become PR, they get to enjoy all the benefits that singaporeans enjoy such as low income tax, medical subsidy etc. But they will have to pay a 1 time payment of $20k if they want to be PR. Note that this 20k is not to give to the government so that they can use all this money for corruption to increase their own salary.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The government will collect all this money and at the end of the year, they will distribute all the money equally to all Singaporeans.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>5. For PR who wants to become citizens of singapore, they will have to serve 2 years NS irregardless of whether they are guy or girl. If they are too old to serve NS, they can get their son or daughter to serve on their behalf. If they have no kids too, they have to pay $60k to be exempted from NS to become a citizen of singapore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Note that these money will not be given to the government too. It wil be collected by the government and at the end of the year, the total sum of money will be distributed equally to all singaporeans.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Do you think we treat foreigners in such a way is fair to us?</p>

              <p>Erm arn't you abit too harsh to them? I am not trying to protect them but just stating the fact. Who will pay $60k just to live here, might as well go live in Switzerland.</p>
              <p>Personally I prefer</p>
              <p>1. All S pass and work permit holders earning less than 2k a
                                          month will have to pay 10% income tax, earn 2k to 5k a month will
                                          pay 25% income taxes, earn 5k to 10k a month will pay 40% income
                                          taxes, earn more than 10k a month will pay 50% income taxes. Plus at least base salary at $1000.</p>
              <p>2. Regarding the education and the scholarships, I still prefer the way they charge foreigners studying here and I don't think giving scholarships is a problem.</p>
              <p>3. For them to apply PR must work here at least 5 years and must prove that they have adapted to the community and at least high amount of work experience so that they can contribute back to the society. Also a max no. of PRs allowed per year must also be imposed.</p>
              <p>4. To become citizens, must be at least 6 - 10 years, if appliants is male and still able to serve NS, they will serve, if they are too old. They must at least have a good record (no crimes committed and contributes alot to society.) same goes for womans (all age).</p>
              <p>Of course as Singaporeans, we will pay lesser income taxes (5 - 15&amp; lesser) and higher base salary.</p>

              <p>8800, I can see you've put a lot of thought into this.</p>
              <p>Making life difficult for all FT will only serve to drive away all FT.  It's a very black-and-white strategy that misses the overall picture.</p>
              <p>Here are my ideas to improve the current situation; Both go hand-in-hand:</p>
              <p>1) Mandate a fair minimum salary, enough for a local to bring up a family.  It's not realistic for us to compete for salaries that we can't live on.</p>
              <p>2) Only allow foreigners who can fill a skills shortage or have value-add that we can't match. It's nuts that a China-man is serving a till at SPC.  A job that a local would happily fill, for a company that can afford a reasonable salary.</p>

              <p> Erm... Earning 5k monthly isn't exactly high with today's cost of living.</p>
              <p>Simple way is to decrease the foreigners to locals ratio ==&gt; means employ less foreigners for every local employed. If need to increase ratio, have to submit, with valid reasons, lawyer's letter, 80% approval from employees and board of directors, etc... to a committee to decide and pay application/processing fee for it. Quite reasonable right?</p>

              <p>first and formost is to limit the overflow and flooding that the FT/fw is flooding over here.</p>
              <p>i would recommend</p>
              <p>an overall of positons at various levels to be reviewed (from bluecollar to top management) on the number of vancancies and capable people for those post.</p>
              <p>once reviewed, pirority would be given to the locals, FT/fw would be considered once only if more than say the company min 80% is held by local people. tax /reduction rebate be given to companies who have the above mentioned , this will force companies to the "damn if i do , damn if i don't sceneario" where they have to comply eventually if they want to increase their profit margins and payscales.</p>
              <p>for those FT/FW already in..a increment of tax of 2-5%per annual depending on their payscale.</p>
              <p>scolarships to welcome them should not exceed beyond 3 out of 10</p>
              <p>well..this is what i could conjure up ATM..it might work to stablize ..then again it might not work ...since this  suggestions are still " in the works".</p>

              <p>It is only a matter of time before the evil PAP will be
              overthrowed and replaced by a new government.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>How do you want the new government to treat the foreigners?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have some ideas on how foreigners should be treated in order
              to be fair to singaporeans.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1. All S pass and work permit holders earning less than 2k a
              month will have to pay 20% income tax, earn 2k to 4k a month will
              pay 30% income taxes, earn 4k to 5k a month will pay 40% income
              taxes, earn more than 5k a month will pay 50% income taxes.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Since they come to singapore to work and earn our money, it is
              only fair that they pay higher taxes than singaporeans.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. All foreigners who comes to singapore and pay for a education
              and subsequently they work at singapore will be expemted form these
              high taxes. They will pay the same amount of tax as singaporeans.
              This is because they are willing to invest money and time for
              an education in singapore. This shows they are sincere in working
              in singapore so we can exempt them from the high taxes.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3. Singapore government will not give any scholarships to any
              foreigners. If the government is so rich they should give
              scholarship to singaporeans.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>4. For all S pass and work permit foreigners, they can apply to
              become PR after working for at least 3 years. Once they become PR,
              they get to enjoy all the benefits that singaporeans enjoy such as
              low income tax, medical subsidy etc. But they will have to pay a 1
              time payment of $20k if they want to be PR. Note that this 20k
              is not to give to the government so that they can use all this
              money for corruption to increase their own salary.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The government will collect all this money and at the end of the
              year, they will distribute all the money equally to all
              Singaporeans.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>5. For PR who wants to become citizens of singapore, they will
              have to serve 2 years NS irregardless of whether they are guy or
              girl. If they are too old to serve NS, they can get their son or
              daughter to serve on their behalf. If they have no kids too, they
              have to pay $60k to be exempted from NS to become a citizen of
              singapore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Note that these money will not be given to the government too.
              It wil be collected by the government and at the end of the year,
              the total sum of money will be distributed equally to all
              singaporeans.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Do you think we treat foreigners in such a way is fair to
              us?</p>

He happen to be in the same reservist camp as i do.<br><br>He also does not agree that Foreigners are needed to keep the economy going ( partly because he is educated overseas degree grad), he says that in other western countries where he worked, locals do the same.

              <p>Our society is <strong>build upon meritocracy and respected the dignity of human lives</strong> since the day of self determination. The white collared worker is supposed to lead while the blue collar worker simply followed instructions.</p>
              <p>These are the work expectation by employers, who will not use their hard earned profits to feed wastrels or spend on liabilities. Each worker must perform. While white collared workers are given slack at work, they are expected to be on call 24/7 come up with ideas to help the company gain profits.</p>
              <p>There are lower expectations from the blue collar workers, but are expected to work and keep to their hours allocated fully utilised. If the blue collar worker have to 'crack his brains' to find a solution at work, it would only mean the white collar worker who is his management had been useless and a waste of corporate resource.</p>
              <p>No employer will hire anyone for ANY reason other than profitability, be it out of nationalistic pride <span style="text-decoration: underline;">or of the knightly classes of soldier profession, which <strong>do not</strong> exist in our equal society.</span></p>
              <p>We all serve NS, only because we want to learn to protect our own families, relatives and friends as an organised army in the event of conflicts or war.  Thus for economic policy and societal economic goals, each must perform, so that a company may profit, and share such profits, circulating our monies around for everyone in our society to have earnings.</p>
              <p>FW/FTs <strong>are not</strong> slaves to be abused or mis-treated, but to assist us in our economic push to uplift our society. Blue or white collared workers, foreigners and bosses, each have a role to play, and only if we all work together, and fairly, will we get out of this crisis and surge forward to a brighter future. </p>
