              the going gets tough. And they complain bitterly. Whine whine
              whine and the singaporean media gets hold of these quitters, warns
              Singaporeans about migration evils and labels the rest of us

              <p><br>only an AV museum, but the museum never come alive, aint it? You aint equally pervert as you SE asia frens, you are a class higher. Saving sometime only rust your money, money is like human body, need to exercise and move about, so invest it is better than saving it, but of course you have to invest wisely, otherwise, no bones left. And once you are rich, pamper yourself ya. Dun be like my stupid ah ma, rich rich but still eat porridge and very thrifty.</p>

              <p><br>only an AV museum, but the museum never come alive, aint it? You aint equally pervert as you SE asia frens, you are a class higher. Saving sometime only rust your money, money is like human body, need to exercise and move about, so invest it is better than saving it, but of course you have to invest wisely, otherwise, no bones left. And once you are rich, pamper yourself ya. Dun be like my stupid ah ma, rich rich but still eat porridge and very thrifty.</p>

              <p>Spending is an individual decision, but definitely you dun get much frens with a stingy mentality. Spend wisely, save moderately, invest smartly. The worst case are those Uncles and Aunties spending thousands on comestic, surgery and fashion just to look young again, and again spending thousands just to maintain it, that is not wise spending, we should learn to grow old gracefully.</p>
