              <p>It is only a matter of time before the evil PAP will be
              overthrowed and replaced by a new government.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>How do you want the new government to treat the foreigners?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have some ideas on how foreigners should be treated in order
              to be fair to singaporeans.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1. All S pass and work permit holders earning less than 2k a
              month will have to pay 20% income tax, earn 2k to 4k a month will
              pay 30% income taxes, earn 4k to 5k a month will pay 40% income
              taxes, earn more than 5k a month will pay 50% income taxes.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Since they come to singapore to work and earn our money, it is
              only fair that they pay higher taxes than singaporeans.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. All foreigners who comes to singapore and pay for a education
              and subsequently they work at singapore will be expemted form these
              high taxes. They will pay the same amount of tax as singaporeans.
              This is because they are willing to invest money and time for
              an education in singapore. This shows they are sincere in working
              in singapore so we can exempt them from the high taxes.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3. Singapore government will not give any scholarships to any
              foreigners. If the government is so rich they should give
              scholarship to singaporeans.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>4. For all S pass and work permit foreigners, they can apply to
              become PR after working for at least 3 years. Once they become PR,
              they get to enjoy all the benefits that singaporeans enjoy such as
              low income tax, medical subsidy etc. But they will have to pay a 1
              time payment of $20k if they want to be PR. Note that this 20k
              is not to give to the government so that they can use all this
              money for corruption to increase their own salary.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The government will collect all this money and at the end of the
              year, they will distribute all the money equally to all
              Singaporeans.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>5. For PR who wants to become citizens of singapore, they will
              have to serve 2 years NS irregardless of whether they are guy or
              girl. If they are too old to serve NS, they can get their son or
              daughter to serve on their behalf. If they have no kids too, they
              have to pay $60k to be exempted from NS to become a citizen of
              singapore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Note that these money will not be given to the government too.
              It wil be collected by the government and at the end of the year,
              the total sum of money will be distributed equally to all
              singaporeans.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Do you think we treat foreigners in such a way is fair to
              us?</p>

              <p>The educated ones are very classy. The ones I know are probably much better looking than you, smell of some expensive cologne and have good manners. Unlike you. Ah Beng...kpkb.</p>
              <p><br>Wake up your idea. World markets are globalising. If majority of Singaporeans think like you , then siao liao. Compete what? Nothing to compete with that attitude. OK?</p>
