              <p>just a little suggestion,</p>
              <p>know your rights in the company and in your position, and
              exercise it when necessary; stick to your job and do it well; stay
              out of these people who irritate you. </p>
              <p>After office, unload everything trouble you have in the office
              by going out with the people you like, so that you can start
              afreshed the next day.</p>
              <p>Wait, wait for the moment when they are vulnerable, when they
              make mistake, then make your move, let them know they make mistake
              too...don't have to end in a vicious cycle, retaliation after
              retaliation.</p>
              <p>In the meantime, wait for the economics to get better, there
              will always be a better job out there.</p>
              <p>There is one thing you must know, the indians are very good at
              politics, especially office politics.</p>

              <p>the problem lies in which type of FT that deserve it,and the current situation..</p>
              <p>allow me to share some of my experiance to you: i knew a few PRC technicians when i was still a senior tech abt 4 years ago, the problem lies in their country system..over there in china..it is the more experiance workers that are valuable, not the newbies, regardless of what cert they hold. which is why many of them would come here to work..however not all of them want to go back after enjoying their "life" here, some will settle down to become PRs and citizens or just work till they get enuf money to immigrate to other countries.</p>
              <p>now i am ok with some FT/FW IF they do their work well or properly..however it seems more and more of these FT/FW are getting more $$ while doing sloppy work or work that many of us are familiar with the term " half fuck standard". while we work our butts out to get it done properly and take pay cuts from some of our non 'farsighted" employers who only thinks about + signs in their budgets, but for going  that this solution also term "short term gain over long term loss" where servicing to repair the FT/FW cockups is cost them more.</p>
              <p>another experiance i like to share with all is a recent comment by my new employer</p>
              <p>he said i was very luckly as he and his collegue had to go thru 1 meter height of application forms and most of it PRC and pinoys..what is shocking is that this bastards were engineers and some even had masters degree but they were willing to stoop very low to "snatch" even a technician post. it was by luck that my employer know 1 of their tricks was that they would never stay long term in the company ( it was a  big transport company fyi) that he finally narrowed it down to 4 people for Assist engineer post and technician post.</p>
              <p>so how they should be treated?? i would say those that deserve our respect ought to stay, those that are F up character can go back home and F off here. however right now the need is to cut off the flood of the FT/FW and really filter all those that really  deserve to stay here. </p>

              <p><span style="color: #993300;">SG Govt operates like corporate so they only look at final result.......rather than looking at the social outcome.</span></p>
              <p><br>I agree with you on this. Most of our PSC scholars had been trained in this manner and had not place priority on the social angle, and believed that somehow it will 'all fall into place natuarally'.</p>
              <p>While none of us citizens will want Singapore to be a welfare state, paying higher taxes, but there is a need to ensure these officers pay more attention in that sector and do make serious attempts to balance it out.</p>
              <p>I dont have any solutions to do so, thus our civil service needs the best and brightest, if possible, more sensitive, to serve and not run to the financial sector and lavish themselves on high incomes and neglect the very society whom had given them the opportunity to excel in life.</p>
              <p>Social responsibility must be taken seriously at ALL levels in the employment field, from the worker to the bosses to the ministries.</p>
              <p>As for MNCs, it is a fact we need MNCs. Post independence, the richest Singaporeans were bankers and landowners such as Mr. Ng Teng Fong. Do you think Mr. Ng would create SIA, which needs a whole lot of different skillsets to manage, let alone have the kind of money to run an efficent and hi-tech operation such as SIA and not one like the languishing MAS flying fleet? I sincerly doubt so.</p>
              <p>Are the govts then to just simply use our $100 million then in our kitty, and give it to any Tom, Dick, Harry to run it or set up industries, the way Malaysia is now being accused of cronyism and corruption? No, its better elected representative be held accountable for our funds.</p>
              <p>Growing Singapore companies take time. It isnt going to happen overnight, as our market is small and no single local company can survive on our own market alone, with no resources to sell even, and have the sufficient capital to go global.</p>
              <p>The govt's direction is the only way to go for now. First they venture out with elected or accountable representatives onto the world's stage with our massive collective society funds, make them profitable, then sell it to our local talents. This is one way to 'entreprenuerise' and grow our Singapore brand.</p>
              <p>There are other ways I suspect. But certainly not for local talents with their small capital and market base to set up shop. Good and chest thumping only for a while but suicide later on extended unsupplied lines, causing massive unemployment later.</p>
              <p>We have best be realistic. We are a nation of no resources except for a tiny port. Our best resources are our people, whose forefathers were only peasants and coolies, and it would take time to groom them up to be on par with the best in the globalised world.</p>
              <p>Do be patient and give encouragement. Bear the unbearable for now. There is a future for our nation, which had constantly improve itself, not out of nationalism, but for survival, and within a few more generations, we may even conquer the world, the way our youngsters had proven themselves better than others of the world in the academic fields and military prowess in competitions or attachments.</p>

I know this is a cosmopolitan city and a fast-paced one, but nobody ain't perfect in society.</p>
              <p>But I damn FUCKING hate if someone from a poorer ASEAN country were to act like us!</p>
              <p>Who they think they are? Assimilated into Singapore society so what? BIG FUCK AH! LANJIAO lah.</p>
