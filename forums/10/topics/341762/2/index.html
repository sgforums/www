              <p>Instead of squarely pinning the blame on the children, does it cross anyone's mind as to the negligent role of the state in this whole episode?</p>
              <p>For a regime that punishes parents who do not send their children to primary school, punishes children for not upkeeping their parents who struggle to get by, dictates how the finances of a family can/cannot be utilised (think the restrictions imposed on the circumstances under which parents can utilise their CPF funds to fund their children's education) and still levies taxes (both direct and indirect), just what on earth are the funds hoarded in the name of the state Treasury used for?</p>
              <p>No wonder Temasek has billions to burn (and simply dismiss them as "paper losses"), in addition to the astoundingly-unbelievable wages paid out to the "talents" running this regime... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>I agreed with wat u guys said, SG should hv a beta Social Welfare system... Most charity organization is depending on public funding(NKF). I believe Gov should step the gear up to help the unfortunate.</p>

              <p>build a good family means marrying young bet 20 to 30. But most ppl now are postponing marriage to 35 to 45 - lesser support, more mental problem when they grow old.... </p>

              <p><br>then give birth to one or two lor, why give birth to so many and cannot take care of them?? You cannot say you like to have to sex but dun want to take responsibility rite?? So you enjoy your sex without birthcontrol, fine, but remember to take care of what you created.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We see lots of people here married earlier and then give birth one by one without taking care of them. So instead of  creating and bringing up good peoples to this society, more nonsense peoples are created giving the society more problems.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We hv to look at our state of financial, life and capabilities before engaging to be ready to be a parent and not anyhow sex sex here and there and leave the childrens run about...and later when old start to feel sorry about it.</p>

Then he always wanted to go out, but dunno how to come back, so his sons make him wear a dog tag with the address...that is why police car alway sent him back.</p>

              <p>For a regime that punishes parents who do not send their children to primary school, punishes children for not upkeeping their parents who struggle to get by, dictates how the finances of a family can/cannot be utilised (think the restrictions imposed on the circumstances under which parents can utilise their CPF funds to fund their children's education) and still levies taxes (both direct and indirect), just what on earth are the funds hoarded in the name of the state Treasury used for?</p>
              <p>No wonder Temasek has billions to burn (and simply dismiss them as "paper losses"), in addition to the astoundingly-unbelievable wages paid out to the "talents" running this regime... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
