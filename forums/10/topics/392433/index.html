And eventually, 107 families found alternative housing. <br><br>Depending on the needs, families were given options. They were either helped to buy a flat within their means, or referred to temporary private shelters or rented public flats. <br><br>Dr Balakrishnan said the government-funded welfare homes for the destitute were a last resort for those who had no jobs, and no family. But he said the Ministry was most concerned about the impact of homelessness on children. <br><br>He said: "I have taken such an active stand to make sure we do not have people camping out on beaches, or parks or void decks, even though these may be safe and indeed, sometimes even pleasant areas for adults. <br><br>"These are not good and safe areas for children. And so I have insisted that (to) anyone with children. The children must be put in a proper home; they must continue to go to school. They must continue to get access to good food, good hygiene. <br><br>"And if any family has difficulty providing these things to the children, then MCYS will step in, and we will step in assertively if need be, in order to protect children." <br><br></span></p>

              <p>It is odd that VB will want to portray the PAP government in an altruistic way, when this government is known for its callous stand towards offering help directly and on the scale of involvement that VB has stated that tantamount to a State sponsored welfare.</p>
              <p>Is there something more significant to this speech made by VB ?</p>

              <h1>Beware the Slippery Slope!</h1>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong></strong><em><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">By Choo Zheng Xi</span></em></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">What do Yoda, Vivian Balakrishnan, Yvonne Lee, and ex-CJ Yong have in common? </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">No, this isn’t the opening line of a dirty joke. All of the abovementioned characters are guilty of having used a form of logical deduction known as the ‘slippery slope’ argument. It’s a line of reasoning that works as such: if we allow A to happen, we will be taking the first step down the slippery slope of allowing B, C and D to happen too. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Remember Yoda’s warning: ‘Fear leads to anger, anger leads to hate, hate leads to suffering’? Classic slippery slope.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Vivian Balakrishnan, who was a debator in his college days, took a page out of Yoda’s book to deploy this rhetorical tactic in Parliament. Commenting on bartop dancing, he noted:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in"><strong><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana; COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">“If you want to dance, some of us will fall off that bar-top. Some people will die as a result of liberalising bar-top dancing, not just because they have fallen off the bar-top. Because usually a young girl, with a short skirt, dancing on a bar-top, may attract some insults from some other men, and the boyfriend starts fighting. Some people will die. Blood will be shed for liberalising this policy. While I support the liberalisation of the policy, I also want all of us to be aware that there is a price to be paid for liberty.”</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Thankfully, little blood has yet been shed for the government’s bold steps in deregulating bartop dancing. Perhaps Dr Vivian was being too pessimistic in his somber projections?</span></p>
              <p class="judg-quote-1"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Here’s yet another slippery slope argument, this time by PAP MP Denise Phua during the elections last year – as reported by <a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/206154/1/.html"><span style="color: #336699;">channelnewsasia</span></a>:</span></p>
              <p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in"><strong><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">“In this movie starring Singaporeans, called ‘The Days After’, based on what will happen if you put more and more opposition members into Parliament, this is what the scene will look like. ‘The Days After’ — the analysts will rate our political risk very high, it’ll be negative; the stock market will tumble; potential investors will hold back their investments; current business will seriously think about moving business out of Singapore.”</span></strong></p>
              <p class="judg-quote-1"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">In the recent ministerial pay hike debate, MM Lee offered the public a particularly steep slippery slope to contemplate: a failure to raise ministerial pay might lead to shoddy characters being elected into Parliament, which would lead to economic collapse, and eventually, our womenfolk being exported as foreign domestic labour. One wonders why this doomsday scenario didn’t occur in the days before ministers were paid as well.</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">The Slippery Slope And The Law</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong></strong><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Perhaps we can permit our politicians a dose of occasional scaremongering. But you might be slightly worried to realize that our legal scholars and judges occasionally indulge in it too. You might be especially concerned if it is relevant to our basic rights guaranteed under the constitution. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Section 14 (1) of our Constitution guarantees that</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">(a) every citizen of </span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Singapore</span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana; FONT-SIZE: 10pt"> has the right to freedom of speech and expression; </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">(b) all citizens of </span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Singapore</span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana; FONT-SIZE: 10pt"> have the right to assemble peaceably and without arms; and (c) all citizens of </span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Singapore</span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana; FONT-SIZE: 10pt"> have the right to form associations.</span></p>
              <p class="judg-quote-1"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">However, Section 14 (2) allows these rights to be circumscribed:</span></p>
              <p class="judg-quote-1"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Parliament may by law impose —</span></p>
              <p class="judg-quote-1" style="TEXT-INDENT: -21.75pt; MARGIN-LEFT: 39.75pt">&lt;!--[if !supportLists]--&gt;<span>(a)</span><span style="FONT: 7pt 'Times New Roman'"> </span>&lt;!--[endif]--&gt;<span style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">on the rights conferred by clause (1)(a), such restrictions as it considers necessary or expedient in the interest of the security of Singapore or any part thereof, friendly relations with other countries, public order or morality and restrictions designed to protect the privileges of Parliament or to provide against contempt of court, defamation or incitement to any offence.</span></p>
              <p class="judg-quote-1"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Now this in itself is not remarkable: even the freest of democracies realise that no rights are absolute, and legislatures have the power to pass laws circumscribing these rights. </span></p>
              <p class="judg-quote-1"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Sadly, good ol’ Slippery Slope is trotted out as a justification for circumscribing many of our rights, and really, sometimes these arguments are downright weak. </span></p>
              <p class="judg-quote-1"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">In his judgment on Dr Chee Soon Juan’s abortive 2002 Labour Day protest, our then Chief Justice Yong Pung How offered the following slippery slope justification for circumscribing Dr Chee’s rights:<a title="_ftnref2" name="_ftnref2" href="#_ftn2"><span style="color: #336699;"><span>&lt;!--[if !supportFootnotes]--&gt;</span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">[2]</span></span></a></span>&lt;!--[endif]--&gt;</p>
              <p class="judg-quote-1" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in"><strong><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">“The opening of the Istana grounds on Labour Day was a highly visible event with strong public participation. Indeed, there were close to 5,300 people in the grounds on the day of the offence. It did not take a great stretch of imagination to conclude that a political rally in the grounds that day could have resulted in a threat to public order and safety”.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="judg-quote-1"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">With all due respect to the then Chief Justice, in the context of our famed Singaporean orderliness and respect for the law, it really does take quite a stretch of imagination to see a political rally on the Istana grounds of a sort that would result in a threat to ‘public order and safety’. Kudos to his creativity.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Perhaps the silliest slippery slope argument to date is the bunch of comical assertions recently put forward by Assistant Professor Yvonne Lee from NUS </span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Law</span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana; FONT-SIZE: 10pt"> </span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">School</span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana; FONT-SIZE: 10pt"> (writing in her personal capacity)<a title="_ftnref3" name="_ftnref3" href="#_ftn3"><span style="color: #336699;"><span>&lt;!--[if !supportFootnotes]--&gt;</span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">[3]</span></span></a></span>&lt;!--[endif]--&gt;.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Singaporean society, she says, is generally conservative and has always been respectful of religious sensitivities. Therefore we should not abolish 377a. To do so would open the door to legalizing paedophilia and bestiality, lead to reverse persecution of religious leaders, and generally undermine family values. Sadly for her, her first premise exposes the fallacy of her slippery slope argument: it is precisely because our society is a conservative one respectful of religious sensitivities that her doomsday scenario is that much quackery.</span></p>
              <p class="judg-quote-1"><strong><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Context: The Achilles Heel of The Slippery Slope</span></strong></p>
              <p class="judg-quote-1"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Deductive logic, if honestly utilized, is a powerful intellectual tool. However, the problem is that many of these lines of reasoning happily discard the context within which they operate. As shown in the course of this article, any idea, taken to its most negative logical extreme, can be construed as potentially apocalyptic. Public figures owe us at least intellectual integrity of honest and realistic projections in decision making.</span></p>
              <p class="judg-quote-1"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">So here’s a simple rule of thumb to help you pull apart badly constructed slippery slope arguments and strengthen your own: <em>it all boils down to context</em>. </span></p>
              <p class="judg-quote-1"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Keep this in mind the next time a politician, academic with an impressive sounding title, or even jedi master offers you a slippery slope argument that projects disaster.</span></p>
