              </span>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The <a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=singapore+people%27s+party&amp;ei=UTF-8&amp;fr=moz35"><span style="color: #005790;">Singapore People's Party (SPP)</span></a> has written to the newly-elected MP for <a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=potong+pasir+smc&amp;ei=UTF-8&amp;fr=moz35"><span style="color: #005790;">Potong Pasir SMC</span></a> Sitoh Yih Pin to protest the latter's termination of 16 <span id="lw_1306989124_0" class="yshortcuts">Potong Pasir</span> <span id="lw_1306989124_6" class="yshortcuts">Town Council staff</span>.</p>
              <p>All except three of the staff were served one-month termination notice letters, and asked to re-apply for employment to Sitoh's newly-appointed managing agent, EM Services, which also looks after eight other town councils.</p>
              <p>Under this arrangement, they may be deployed to any of the other town councils, and their employment conditions will also be subject to change, under the jurisdiction of their new employer.</p>
              <p>In a letter submitted to the <a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=potong+pasir+town+council&amp;ei=UTF-8&amp;fr=moz35"><span style="color: #005790;">Potong Pasir Town Council</span></a>'s new general manager Ms Soh Chor Yin on Thursday morning, SPP second assistant secretary-general Benjamin Pwee said the change in management was not rational ground for termination to their contract of employment.</p>
              <p>Pwee's letter also called for either reinstatement of employment of the staff, or an appropriate retrenchment or <span id="lw_1306989124_1" class="yshortcuts">severance package</span>.</p>
              <p>About 30 members of the SPP also signed the letter, claiming that Sitoh had previously promised his Potong Pasir opponent Lina Chiam that he would "keep all the staff at the Town Council", and further, that he would honour his words.</p>
              <p>In the recently-concluded General Elections, incumbent SPP candidate Lina Chiam lost the Potong Pasir single-member constituency by a slim 112 votes to the PAP's Sitoh.</p>
              <p>On Wednesday, <a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=sitoh+yih+pin&amp;ei=UTF-8&amp;fr=moz35"><span style="color: #005790;">Sitoh Yih Pin</span></a> said he had not promised to keep the staff and that he had instead told Mrs Chiam, "Since you asked, I will try my best to see what I can do," reported <em>The Straits Times</em>.</p>
              <p>He also said offers of severance packages to the 16 retrenched staff were "fair" and that he would "follow all the employment rules."</p>
              <p>But he also added that severance packages would have to come out from the town council fund, saying, "The town council funds belong to residents. My priority must be to ensure that the service standards delivered to residents are not compromised."</p>
              <p>All 16 Potong Pasir Town Council staff have also been handed <span id="lw_1306989124_4" class="yshortcuts">job application forms</span> from EM Services.</p>
              <p>Nine of which had been filled up and submitted to the company to date. The remaining  seven are still deciding whether or not to re-apply, given that new employment conditions include a six-month probation.</p>
              <p>====================================================</p>
              <p>Just for info, the conservancy charge in Potong Pasir under Mr Chiam's care in SPP is cheaper than those in PAP HDB estates, it is below $30.00.    This info is from a resident in Potong Pasir.</p>

              <p><br> I am surprised you condone such act.  What about you start
              work and a new employer takes over and terminate
              you?    Not to forget you have problems getting jobs
              and finally after a long search you landed yourself with this job
              which the employer just terminated you.    
              Where is your heart?</p>

              <p>You'll be surprised most companies actually do that. I know one oil well drilling company that does. They give you a retrenchment notice, but absolutely no benefits.</p>

              <p>Expected such ruthless treatment from Sitoh.    One look at him tells he is not a kind soul, like any other PaP members he works for personal gain.    Stupid voters in PP voted for him, congratulations!   </p>

              <p>But Sitoh offer them employment, same job same pay right? So how can u say he's unfair?</p>
              <p>Also he has not increased the TC fees, right?</p>
              <p>Anyway he does not owe Lina Chiam a cent to promise her anything. AFter all he's the winner and winner decides, that's democracy!</p>
              <p>The underlying issue is : can Sitoh expect loyalty from these employers? So he must as well start afresh with a new team and a better team.</p>
              <p>Ms Soh, the new GM is well known for her estate mgt skills, so PP residents is very lucky to get a PAP MP and a skilled TC GM</p>

              <p>Get your facts right. Sitoh is still serving the residents to the best standards.</p>
              <p>He's just restructuring the new TC as it really needs a fresh change after 27 years in the stale.</p>
              <p>He's doing it for the residents, not for himself. By doing it, Sitoh knows he's inviting unfair criticisms but he's till pressing it for the residents and taking flak in his stride</p>
