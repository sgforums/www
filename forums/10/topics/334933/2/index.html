              <p>The point i'm trying to make here however, is that corruption will always exist. You talk as if a drastic change in local government would automatically removed such scandals. Free press or no free press. When history has actually showed the opposite, as shown in Chen Shui Bian of Taiwan.  </p>
              <p>In his defense however, i believe the corruption was neccessary to consolidate his power in a KMT dominated parliament.</p>

              <p>Or it could mean they're just not caught until the next big scandal.</p>
              <p>But ultimately i'm just saying all this for others to hear the other perspective. You have no interest in discussion, only forcing your views on others.  And quite frankly, exactly the behaviour we hate getting from the PAP.</p>

              <p>The point i'm trying to make here however, is that corruption
              will always exist. You talk as if a drastic change in local
              government would automatically removed such scandals. Free
              press or no free press. When history has actually showed the
              opposite, as shown in Chen Shui Bian of Taiwan.
               </p>
              <p>In his defense however, i believe the corruption was neccessary
              to consolidate his power in a KMT dominated parliament.</p>
              <p>Or it could mean they're just not caught until the next big
              scandal.</p>
              <p>But ultimately i'm just saying all this for others to hear the
              other perspective. You have no interest in discussion, only forcing
              your views on others.  And quite frankly, exactly the
              behaviour we hate getting from the PAP.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Sure individuals will succumb to corruption and that is why it is important that no individual gets to retain power by dishonorable means. That is why it is iomportant that no individual or party can be allowed to suppress the press from doing its job. No individual or party can suppress opposition and dissident voices.</span></p>

              <p>See:</p>
              <p>...Nowhere has this been more the case in Japan, whose economy has remained in the doldrums ever since its bubble burst in 1990. For seventeen years straight, quarter after quarter, Japanese land prices fell, and so did stock market prices – and hence, the collateral pledged as backing for loans. This quickly left Japan’s banks with negative equity. The Bank of Japan’s response was to devise a way for them to rebuild their balance sheets – to “earn their way” out of the bad loans they had made.<br><br>The policy was not to revive the faltering domestic market in Japan or its industrial corporations. From 1945 through 1985, Japanese had a model industrial banking system. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">But in 1985, U.S. diplomats asked Japan to please commit economic suicide.</span></p>
              <p>Angered by the striking success of Japanese industry,<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> U.S. officials asked their <strong>compliant Japanese counterparts </strong>to raise the yen’s exchange rate so as to make its industrial exporters less competitive</span>, and in due course to flood its own economy with credit so as to lower interest rates, thereby enabling the Federal Reserve to flood the U.S. market with enough cheap credit to give a patina of prosperity to the Reagan Administration.</p>
              <p>This policy – announced in the Plaza Accord of 1985 –<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> led economist David Hale to joke that the Bank of Japan was acting as the Thirteenth Federal Reserve District and the Japanese government as the Republican Re-election Committee.</span></p>

              nope never, neither have i met mister yap either. but the way he carried himself from clips i've seen of him, his track record, plus the fact that we share different views made it clear enough to me i'm no supporter of him and a view very unlikely to change even in the far future.

              <p>Hello, first of all,  what is SDP, of course you can comments
                                          and gives critics about them, they are nobody in comparing to
                                          PAP.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>So you are saying PAP cannot be criticised because they are big.</p>
              <p>Small people can be criticised?</p>

              <p> haha maybe they don't allow criticism but i don't have a good view of LHL after seeing him on tv either lol. </p>
              <p>only time state media made me view him more favorably was when he did that chili and onion thing 
              </p>
              
              <p>on the other hand with regards to SDP site, "fair and balanced" apparently depends on the readers' viewpoints on politics.
              
              this is my honest view on why opo parties suck in SG</p>

              <p><br>That is fact of life, take it or leave it, u try critising your director and the sweeper of yr organisation or our PM Lee and Dr Chee in public , u see what is the outcome.</p>

              <p>It is not a matter of big or small, it is a matter of power, even you, when yr boss talks, you listen and obey, but if yr desk cleaner talks, you take it leisurely. Got it.</p>

              <p><br>We voted the PAP with a 66.6% confident in them, if people critise LKY, he/she criticised our votes too, isn't that a shame to us. But if people criticise Dr Chee, what loss do we get? nothing.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To be fair, like it or not, PAP won the last election, we endorsed them to be our govt, lead our nation to glory. Same goes to US, if democrat wins, the Republican will still celebrate and embrace it, but our people here are not so liberal to accept the truth.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If SDP gets voted as the next govt, i will support them and condemn anyone critising them..tho me not eligible to vote yet</p>
