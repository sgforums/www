              <p><strong>U.S. has plundered world wealth with dollar: China paper</strong></p>
              <p>BEIJING (Reuters) - The <strong>United States has plundered global wealth by
                              exploiting the dollar's dominance</strong>, and the world urgently needs other
                              currencies to take its place, a leading Chinese state newspaper said on
                              Friday.</p>
              <p>The front-page commentary in the overseas edition of the People's
                              Daily said that Asian and European countries should banish the U.S.
                              dollar from their direct trade relations for a start, relying only on
                              their own currencies.</p>
              <p>A meeting between Asian and European leaders, starting on Friday in
                              Beijing, presented the perfect opportunity to begin building a new
                              international financial order, the newspaper said.</p>
              <p>The People's Daily is the official newspaper of China's ruling
                              Communist Party. The Chinese-language overseas edition is a small
                              circulation offshoot of the main paper.</p>
              <p>Its pronouncements do not necessarily directly voice leadership
                              views. But the commentary, as well as recent comments, amount to a
                              growing chorus of <strong>Chinese disdain for Washington's economic policies
                              and global financial dominance</strong> in the wake of the credit crisis.</p>
              <p>"The grim reality has led people, amidst the panic,<strong> to realize that
                              the United States has used the U.S. dollar's hegemony to plunder the
                              world's wealth</strong>," said the commentator, Shi Jianxun, a professor at
                              Shanghai's Tongji University.</p>
              <p>Shi, who has before been strident in his criticism of the U.S., said
                              other countries had lost vast amounts of wealth because of the
                              financial crisis, <strong>while Washington's sole concern had been protecting
                              its own interests.</strong></p>
              <p>"The U.S. dollar is losing people's confidence. The world, acting
                              democratically and lawfully through a global financial organization,<strong> urgently needs to change the international monetary system based on
                              U.S. global economic leadership and U.S. dollar dominance</strong>," he wrote.</p>
              <p>Shi suggested that all trade between Europe and Asia should be
                              settled in euros, pounds, yen and yuan, though he did not explain how
                              the Chinese currency could play such a role since it is not convertible
                              on the capital account.</p>
              <p>A two-day Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) of 27 EU member states and 16
                              Asian countries was set to open on Friday. Though few analysts expect
                              much in the way of concrete agreements, Shi said it could prove
                              momentous.</p>
              <p><strong>"How can Europe and Asia grasp each other's hands and together
                              confront the once-in-a-century global financial crisis sparked by the
                              U.S.; how can they construct a new equitable and safe international
                              financial order?" </strong>he said.</p>
              <p> "The world is waiting for this Asian-European meeting to achieve big results in financial cooperation."</p>

              <p><span style="font-size: 13pt;"><strong>The Dollar System and USA economic reality</strong></span></p>
              <p><em><span style="font-size: 10pt;">It's accepted wisdom
                              that the United States, despite recent problems, is still the strongest
                              growth locomotive for the world economy, the pillar of the global
                              system. What if we were to discover that, instead of being the pillar,
                              that the United States was, in fact, the heart of a dysfunctional
                              economic system, which is spreading instability, unemployment, and
                              depression globally?</span></em></p>
              <p class="Lauftext"><em></em>No
                              other nation on earth comes near to the commanding US military
                              superiority in smart bombs, military IT, or in sheer force
                              capabilities. The US position in the world since 1945, and especially
                              since 1971, has rested on two pillars, however: The superiority of the
                              US military over all, and, the role of the dollar as world reserve
                              currency. That dollar is the Achilles heel of American hegemony today.</p>
              <p class="Lauftext">In
                              my view, the world has entered a new, highly dangerous phase since the
                              collapse of the US stock market bubble in 2001. I am speaking about the
                              unsustainable basis of the very Dollar System itself. What is that
                              Dollar System? ...</p>

              <p class="Lauftext">One of the crucial pillars of support for today's Dollar System is
                              Washington's control of the International Monetary Fund, the IMF. The way this
                              actually works is carefully disguised, behind a facade of technocrats and
                              economic theory of free market ideology.</p>
              <p class="Lauftext">In reality, the IMF is a modern era
                              collection agency for the Dollar Empire. It collects its tribute, through
                              major international banks, who use the dollars to further extend the power of
                              American financial and corporate hegemony, in effect the driving motor of what
                              is globalization...</p>

                        the genesis of America's political and financial domination. </span> <span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica;">Michael Hudson's in-depth and highly controversial study of U.S. financial 
                        diplomacy explores the faults built into the core of the World Bank and the 
                        IMF at their inception which -- he argues -- were intended to preserve the 
                        US's financial hegemony. Difficult to detect at the time, these problems have 
                        since become explicit as the failure of the international economic system has 
                        become apparent; the IMF and World Bank were set up to give aid to developing 
                        countries, but instead many of the world's poorest countries have been plunged 
                        into insurmountable debt crises. </span></p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica;">Hudson's critique of the destructive course of the international economic 
                        system provides important insights into the real motivations at the heart of 
                        these institutions - and the increasing tide of opposition that they face 
                        around the world...</span></p>

              <p>Gowan argues compellingly that the process of globalisation has been
                  relentlessly driven forward by the enormous political power of the US
                  state and business interests in a highly conscious bid to extend their

                  international finance system - the 'Dollar-Wall Street Regime' -
                  created out of the ashes of Breton Woods has been exploited as a
                  political lever to open up local economies to US products and
                  speculative flows of 'hot' money, and demonstrates how each financial
                  crisis over the last ten years has been used by the Washington-Wall

              <p><strong>Confessions of an Economic Hit Man: How USA Uses Globalization to Cheat Poor Countries Out of Trillions</strong></p>
              <p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> It’s good to have you with us. Okay, explain this term, “economic hit man,” e.h.m., as you call it.</p>
              <p><strong>JOHN PERKINS:</strong> Basically what we were trained to do and what our job is to do is to
              build up the American empire. To bring—to create situations where as
              many resources as possible flow into this country, to our corporations,
              and our government, and in fact we’ve been very successful.</p>
              <p>We’ve built
              the largest empire in the history of the world. It’s been done over the
              last 50 years since World War II with very little military might,
              actually. It’s only in rare instances like Iraq where the military
              comes in as a last resort. This empire, unlike any other in the history
              of the world, has been built primarily through economic manipulation,
              through cheating, through fraud, through seducing people into our way
              of life, through the economic hit men. I was very much a part of that...</p>

              <p><strong>U.S. has plundered world wealth with dollar: China
                      paper</strong></p>
              <p>BEIJING (Reuters) - The <strong>United States has plundered
                      global wealth by exploiting the dollar's dominance</strong>, and
                      the world urgently needs other currencies to take its place, a
                      leading Chinese state newspaper said on Friday.</p>
              <p>The front-page commentary in the overseas edition of the
                      People's Daily said that Asian and European countries should banish
                      the U.S. dollar from their direct trade relations for a start,
                      relying only on their own currencies.</p>
              <p>A meeting between Asian and European leaders, starting on Friday
                      in Beijing, presented the perfect opportunity to begin building a
                      new international financial order, the newspaper said.</p>
              <p>The People's Daily is the official newspaper of China's ruling
                      Communist Party. The Chinese-language overseas edition is a small
                      circulation offshoot of the main paper.</p>
              <p>Its pronouncements do not necessarily directly voice leadership
                      views. But the commentary, as well as recent comments, amount to a
                      growing chorus of <strong>Chinese disdain for Washington's economic
                      policies and global financial dominance</strong> in the wake of the
                      credit crisis.</p>
              <p>"The grim reality has led people, amidst the panic, <strong>to
                      realize that the United States has used the U.S. dollar's hegemony
                      to plunder the world's wealth</strong>," said the commentator, Shi
                      Jianxun, a professor at Shanghai's Tongji University.</p>
              <p>Shi, who has before been strident in his criticism of the U.S.,
                      said other countries had lost vast amounts of wealth because of the
                      financial crisis, <strong>while Washington's sole concern had been
                      protecting its own interests.</strong></p>
              <p>"The U.S. dollar is losing people's confidence. The world,
                      acting democratically and lawfully through a global financial
                      organization, <strong>urgently needs to change the international
                      monetary system based on U.S. global economic leadership and U.S.
                      dollar dominance</strong>," he wrote.</p>
              <p>Shi suggested that all trade between Europe and Asia should be
                      settled in euros, pounds, yen and yuan, though he did not explain
                      how the Chinese currency could play such a role since it is not
                      convertible on the capital account.</p>
              <p>A two-day Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) of 27 EU member states and
                      16 Asian countries was set to open on Friday. Though few analysts
                      expect much in the way of concrete agreements, Shi said it could
                      prove momentous.</p>
              <p><strong>"How can Europe and Asia grasp each other's hands and
                      together confront the once-in-a-century global financial crisis
                      sparked by the U.S.; how can they construct a new equitable and
                      safe international financial order?"</strong> he said.</p>
              <p> "The world is waiting for this Asian-European meeting to
                      achieve big results in financial cooperation."</p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">It is just stupid for the Chinese to blame the Americans. NOBODY asked them to be the USA coolies.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">They have no choice, like Singapore has no choice but to play along and be coolies because their systems are not democratic. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Thailand, Philipoines, and Indonesia (now), and maybe even Malaysia can show the US their middle finger but Singapore and China cannot because the despots in these two countries are afraid of losing power.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Japan will come out on top because they do not have to play nice to the USA for the simple reason that their Prime Ministers are honorable people and are willing to step down anytime. They will do the right thing for the country even if it is unpopular and they get kicked out, because if they get kicked out, it is of no consequence to them.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Singapore and China? hahaha.. they will continue to lick the US asses...</span></span></p>

Singapore and China are still working as their coolies, knowing that they owe so much. Power or not? hahahaha</span></span></p>

              <p>I believe this is the only response i need to give.</p>
              <p> For those who are afraid that it's a virus link, lemme just post a quote.</p>
              <blockquote><span style="font-size: x-small;">
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="color: #000000;">Students of Japanese government disagree over the prospects for purifying a system that has been characterized as "rotten to the core."16 Some contend that "there is far less corruption now than there was in the past" and predict that corruption is "almost certain to continue to decline in importance" in years to come.17 Others argue that corruption "will continue to flourish in Japan" because its cultural roots are deeply imbedded in government and society.18 I doubt that corruption in the bureaucracy has declined. If anything, the number and seriousness of bureaucratic scandals have increased during the last decade (although the relationship between "corruption revealed" and "real corruption" is famously difficult to discern). Whatever the long-range realities, one may still ask who, ultimately, is responsible for the dirty messes Japan's government so frequently finds itself in. For me at least, this question admits no easy answer.</span></span></p>

              <p>As we all know it politics is dirty but if you understand Japanese style government you would surely shake your head.There are so many father/son prime ministers like the previous Mr Fukuda (and akan datang Mr Nakasone in a few years time.Even Aso's father was notorious for running a mine company that used allied prisoners as slaves.</p>
