              <p>USA's dollar hegemony and their exploitation of world's wealth
              through the dollar system must end.</p>
              <p>We must oppose the current USA financial dominance and push for

              <p>There is an economics-textbook myth that foreign-exchange rates
              are determined by supply and demand based on market fundamentals.
              Economics tends to dismiss socio-political factors that shape
              market fundamentals that affect supply and demand.</p>
              <p>Ever since 1971, when US president Richard Nixon took the dollar
              off the gold standard (at $35 per ounce) that had been agreed to at
              the Bretton Woods Conference at the end of World War II, the dollar
              has been a global monetary instrument that the United States, and
              only the United States, can produce by fiat.</p>
              <p>World trade is now a game in which the USA produces dollars and
              the rest of the world produces things that dollars can buy...</p>

              <p>Agree.</p>
              <p>However, since we have trouble attracting people to the opposition, let's think about ways to change the PAP internally since that's our best hope now.</p>
              <p>There's a reason why the PAP was voted into power in 1959. It was because people saw hope and reason in their platform plus the candidates were worthy. Somehow, throughout the years, they started deviating.</p>
              <p>Either we give them an external therapy (more opposition) or the internal method. Since their deviation lowered the possibility of success of external therapy, I guess the internal method is our best hope now.</p>

              <p><em><br></em></p>
              <p><em>"Lee Kuan Yew was
                  secretly a party with Lim Yew Hock," adds Poulgrain, "in urging the
                  Colonial Secretary to impose the subversives ban in making it illegal
                  for former political detainees to stand for election."</em></p>
              <p><em>In 1959, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">while Lim
                  was in prison, the PAP won the general elections under which Lee became
                  Prime Minister</span>, and Singapore was granted self-government by the
                  British in all matters except for internal security, defence and
                  external affairs. </em></p>
              <p><em>Although Lim and
                  other leftist political detainees were released from prison, their
                  co-operation and alliance with Lee ended in 1961 due to disagreements
                  over policies and strategies.</em></p>
              <p><em>Until then the media
                  presented the PAP as a leftwing party, indicating the pervasive and
                  dominant influence of Lim's faction within and outside the party. Their
                  rivalry was intense and ideological. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Lee finally resorted to arrests to
                  remove Lim and his faction.</span></em></p>
              <p><em>The <span style="text-decoration: underline;">PAP split in 1961
                  saw Lim taking away with him almost the entire PAP branches and
                  personnel to form and lead a new party, the Barisan Socialis</span> (Socialist
                  Front)...</em></p>

Lim choose to act at a time his rivals have the resources and means to do him in.</p>
              <p>just like what CSJ's doing, his timing's horrible. for those claiming he's smart because he has a phd, last time i checked he's a neuropsychologist not a lawyer he didn't study Political science either. striking openly in a time when PAP's already consolidated their rule?</p>
              <p>if even an outsider like me can point out where he's gone wrong then chances are he's really inept in politics or he's a PAP mole out to ruin SDP.</p>
