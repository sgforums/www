              isn't that how changes usually come about? by convincing you're the better side to bet on? just look at the fiasco in US, the way the ones on top agreed to all the bonus and payments even after they're in deep shit. who better to work on than a bunch of corrupt self preserving moral less gentlemen who are right at the top.

Let me take a govt scholarship in Oxford, then come back as a scholar to hold MP position and later Minister title, then when i get the home affair or defence minister post, maybe, i will try to change...all must support me hor.</p>

Japanese press like to angkat the LDP so it is still propaganda here,I really cant imagine Minshuto winning the next election as much as Worker Party getting the better of PAP cuz unlike the  American Singaporean and Japanese are afraid of change.</p>

              <p><br> Japan government is like PAP.The LDP runs the country since
              Godzilla was walking around destroying Tokyo and the opposition
              just take a back seat .Minshuto is like the workers
              party  and they KPKB a lot but no matter how much
              the LDP screw up, the people would still support this
              party....kinda like Singapore doesnt it? Japanese press like to
              angkat the LDP so it is still propaganda here,I really cant imagine
              Minshuto winning the next election as much as Worker Party getting
              the better of PAP cuz unlike the  American Singaporean and
              Japanese are afraid of change.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Do they have a Sick Manic and a Moronic Manic despots in the cabinet?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Do they have an assson unwilling to relinguish power even when he had cancer and his cancer cells probably making a come back soon or they they have honorable prime ministers willing to step down if they are unpopular. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Here the people curse them to the third generation and they still cling on like the  asspotic despots that they are.</span><br></span></p>

              <p>is it an asian trait? personally i'm one of those who don't like big changes, there are things i would like to be changed in sg but the choices offered always seem to be a bad trade off.</p>

              <p>I guess for our asian ancestors, big changes normally mean a whole lot of people are gonna die.</p>
              <p>It probably provide incentives for not wanting big changes.</p>
              <p>If AndrewPKYap represents our alternative to LKY and his sons, i'd stick to the "asspots" thank you very much.</p>
