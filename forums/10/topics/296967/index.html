            <div class='col-md body'>Many ministers have tried to look into solutions to our low-wage workers' problems.<br><br>From workfare to welfare to the latest financial aids of granting additional S$45,000 to be distributed to the poor via the political agency of CCC it looks like there is no practical solution in sight.<br><br>The low-wage workers include cleaners, sale personnel, security guards, construction workers, whose salaries are low - less than $800.00 pm.<br><br>This group of workers could not survive as what they earn are not enough to pay for transportation, utility and medical plus three meals.<br><br>On the other hand the ministers, senior civil servants, CEO/GM's, of GLCs were constantly given increments and upgrading and today many of the employees in these categories were not being paid exceeding 15-150 times of wage of low-wage workers due to policy (to retain talents) and not due to actual market forces.<br><br>So it is quite fair and practical for companies instead of squeezing the low-wage workers by passing some of the excessive current or future increments of these fortunate ministers, senior civil servants, CEOs/GM/directors of GLCs to such low-wage workers. Many of our ministers and senior civil servants and CEOs/GMs/directors of GLCs were being over-paid.<br><br>In any recession instead of talking about cutting the wages of low-wage workers the government should re-distribute the excessive increments and bonuses to the high-wage workers to the low-wage categories so as to make the multiple less skewed. The real and practical solution should be to cut back the over-generous salaries of senior management instead of the low-wage workers.<br><br>To build a compassionate and caring and competitive society it is time to adopt such a policy and practice to return to competitiveness again not by constant tax and fee increases. Otherwise the rich will only become richer and the poor poorer.<br><br>Let the new post-65 MPs and younger ministers accept this as a challenge to their talents and leadership.</div>
