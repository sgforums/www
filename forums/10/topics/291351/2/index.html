The max is 10 years..<br><br>So what is Dubai doing now? They built the Burj Al Arab, building the Burj Dubai, Palm Island, and the World Island now.."For what?!" you may ask..this is for their future..when their oil reserves run out (which is going to be fast), they must complete their tourism attractions so that they can turn themselves into an exotic getaway for rich people..<br><br>So don't look at Dubai as if they like to splurge and show off for the sake of splurging and showing off..they didn't build the Burj Al Arab (first 7-star hotel and tallest hotel in the world), Burj Dubai (tallest building in the world when completed), Palm Island and World Island to show off..it is part of their plan to secure their future..</div>
