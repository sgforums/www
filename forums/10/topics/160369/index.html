            <div class='col-md body'>I will tell you the truth about this Sedition Act and why the govt wants it.<br>The govt is not stupid. They know very well that Muslims will never be able to defend Islam given all the terrorism in the name of jihad today. You ask any apologetic imams enough questions and they will surely get stuck. So they want to shut Singaporeans up on this issue, period. No more quarrels.<br><br>Yes, you can get analysis &amp; criticisms of Islam all over the net and it would seem silly to ban it among Singapore bloggers. But the govt wants to ban it from blogs &amp; forums by Singaporeans so that as far as possible, you won't have a  local movement on it. Its a very kiasu nip it in the bud thing but thats how our govt always work. They will rather be over kiasu on the safe side in whatever that we can do.<br><br>Those guys who were arrested and charged are nobodies, but they are scarificial lambs to kick start the message. You kill a few to warn a million.<br></div>
