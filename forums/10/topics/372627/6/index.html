              <p>Yes... you <strong>DID NOT</strong> use your brain.....</p>
              <p>1st - that quote was to highlight that as your pay increase.... so did the cost of the Flat.... that is call 'Inflation'.....</p>
              <p>2nd - The 2009 HDB of $300K is because you are buying <strong>RESALE Flat</strong> instead of buying <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">New Flat</span></strong>. A schoolmate of mine is getting his flat in 2011 near the S'pore Sport School in Woodlands at $186+K. Therefore, if you don't have the $$$$..... buy and then wait for newly built flats (2-3years to complete) instead of die die also want to buy resale at mature housing estate like AMK, Yishun, Toa Payoh...etc. Mature Estate will always cost more than new estate like Sengkang....</p>

              <p>And don't you understand that my loan of 88+K at $460+ a month <strong>DOES NOT CHANGE EVEN WITH INFLATION</strong> ?? I will pay $460 a month from 10years ago, till today, and untill the loan is over and yet my flat is already worth more than what I agreed to paid for..... and for crying out loud.... Do you think Banks are into the business of giving you an Interest Free installment.....  Get Real.... Ah Long also charge you 20% interest for 6 weeks.</p>
              <p>And which part of - <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">HOUSE ALREADY FULLY PAID FOR</span></strong> - do you <strong>NOT</strong> understand ??</p>

              <p>Huh! u dun have to paid the loan that you loan out from the bank meh?? I am just give you a estimate figure as i dunno what is your loan and payement mah...wha lau take it so serious, in the end of the day, i am trying to tell you that whatever you do, you are going to loose, both to the govt, govt tax and govt/local agent fees.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I dunno how you think, but to me, go for freehold private house will have better returns. Ok let say you took a 20 years loan at 3% (min) p.a. You paid $460 for 10 years, that will be $55,200 gone, your downpayment $24,000. In total you paid $79,200 already, and you still own the bank 32,800 + 3% interest p.a, so you may need to pay $1,760 interest per year for another 10 years will be 17,600. In total you paid 32,800 + 26,400 another $59,200 for the next 10 years, if you sold your house now, you have to paid all these back to the bank. So, in all, you paid 79,000+59,200=138,200. You sold your house for $300000, minus tax and agent fees, u get let say $290000- the 138,200 u paid the bank, you get $151,800, then you go buy a 3 rooms for $200,000..are you in deficit or surplus?? and yet get a smaller house,,..needs renovation, live with bangalas and PRC..OMG!</p>

              <p>1st - like you said.... you don't know the term and condition of my loan.That is why I'm not paying too much.... reason - 1st time loan buying 1st house with parents staying with me.....</p>
              <p>2nd - Like I said earlier.... when I 1st took up the loan, my avg pay was only $1200-$1300 only.... where got bank willing to loan big amount to someone with such low pay ?? And I nearly can't get a loan because my pay near miss the minimum sum needed for that amount. Luckily I was working for a GLC link company and that the company is unlikely to close shop.... which is why I kept saying $112K while 'CHEAP' now.... wasn't cheap then....</p>
              <p>3rd - Like you said.... I <strong>DO NOT</strong> wish to work like a Slave inorder to pay off my loan.... Why buy a<strong> freehold private house </strong>and work like a dog when I could live like a man with a less stressful loan.... And beside, seeing<strong> num 2 </strong>- I nearly can't get a loan.... do you think the bank would loan me enough to buy a <strong>freehold private house </strong>costing into the half million zone<strong> </strong>?? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"></p>
              <p>Now.... I'm not trying to offence you or anything..... but do you know that all S'porean have a RIGHT to get special low interest loan from Bank or HDB when they buy their House for the first two times ?? The reason I manage to get the low interest loan was because this was my 1st house.... and I don't plan to abuse the privilege without good cause. A few of my workmate brought their flats at low cost.... sold them away during the mid 90s housing boom.... earn as much as $70-$100K over night. But they have to buy Resale at high cost (Boom time + didn't downgrade or anything). So now..... in their mid 40s..... their loan per month is $1500-$2000+.... and all the money they made already used up for hoildays and cars.... some even use the money to go for the Haj. Their Resale flat is now worth less then they paid for in boom time..... SLAVES are made of these people..... People who didn't plan and  think.....</p>
              <p>Btw..... your attitude towards foreginer is<strong> uncalled</strong> for.... I agree that some PRC or Bangalas is hard to get used to and do cause problem.... but I find the same could be said with some of my S'porean neigbours. The funny thing is, my family gets on well with the PRC family next door.... Just live and let live i suppose....</p>

              <p>I think you are better off not selling your flat to downgrade, since you have already paid off your debt in mortgage.</p>
              <p>I don't know how many children you have .Your kids may start their own family and leave you with empty nest, but you will need the space when you have grandchildren.</p>
              <p>Unless your offsprings have no intentions of living with you at all, and your spouse has passed away, then downgrading to a senior studio will be a sensible move.</p>
              <p>However, most females outlive the males by at least 10 years.Your financial planning using your HDB does not take into consideration the long term life style plan.</p>
              <p>Do you want to leave your wife all alone and in a one bedroom flat just so you can have more money in your pocket during your retirement ?</p>

              <p>In general, I think the only reasonably risk free way people would have made money on property was buying it during the 70s and 80s when a decent HDB flat cost only $10-20K.   It is obvious that prices will never drop back to 70s and 80s level, hence you are assured of making money if you sell now.

              <p>At this point in time, people are punting on $500K flats in the hopes that years down the road, the price would increase say 50%.  They base it on the historic example of the flats in the 70s and 80s now being worth 20 times their original values.  The trouble is now, due to the volatility and higher interdependence of the world economy now, economic growth (and hence employment growth, wage growth etc) is not as stable as before and is subject to even wilder swings.</p>

              <p>It seems that you guys/gals don't own a House and don't understand how its done..... let me explain.</p>
              <p>My house brought at $112K..... will I sell just because 'Market' is good. ?? -  <strong>No</strong>.</p>
              <p><strong>Why</strong> -</p>
              <p>Because I don't intend to get into 'New' debt (new loan with new interest... etc)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Because that is my HOME.... NOT an Investment like Shares in the Stock Market. (you just don't Buy Sell Buy Sell for fun)</p>
              <p><strong>But I will sell it WHEN</strong> -</p>
              <p>My childrens are all grown up and leaves the house (need not so much room)</p>
              <p>When I retire and could use the extra cash along with my CPF.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Downgrade -</strong></p>
              <p>If my new smaller until is expensive due to inflation.... wouldn't you said that my 4Room would also worth more due to Inflation ?? Or do you think that only one side got inflation while the other won't ?? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"></p>
              <p>Example - <span style="text-decoration: underline;">If I'm to retire NOW</span> (<strong>House already Fully paid for</strong>).... FYI, my loan will finish before I hit 55... I did my MATH before I buy <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"></p>
              <p>Accounting to <strong>deepak.c</strong> update on HDB price of resale 4Room flat in Woodlands area.... My flat would be worth $300K +/-..... A resale 3Room flat in Woodlands is selling on the avg of $190-205K NOW... (go to HDB Resale and click 3Rooms Woodlands from Jan to Aug 2009)</p>
              <p>So... $300K - $200K = $100K +/-</p>
              <p>Since I don't need any more loan.... it will be pure cash (after agent &amp; Govt take their shares lah) <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"></p>
              <p>And I wouldn't even need a 3Room..... because only me and the Wife would be living there.... and since I never did believe that I would live till 80 anyway.... I will most likely apply for those very small Studio Apartment for Seniors.... You get a 30year lease for perhars $60K (I think <strong>deepak.c</strong> will update me the price soon) but Govt will take back the flat once you are dead... as you DON'T own the until.....</p>
              <p>But who cares...... at the most will live another 20years after leasing the House only anyway. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"> </p>
              <p> FYI..... if younger S'porean can't afford to buy house NOW..... do anyone here think it was 'EASY' for me 10years ago ?? My House might seems 'Cheap' now when compare to the price today... but it wasn't 'CHEAP' 10years back.... Don't forget, Inflation was around 10years ago too. If  <strong>deepak.c</strong> wants to said 40years ago House is only $8000.... do <strong>deepak.c</strong> knows how many people have $8000 back then ?? Yeah yeah... my $112K House is CHEAP.... do you think I would need a 30years loan if it was CHEAP then ?? Use your BRAIN lah.... When my Parents was working 40years ago... basic pay was $500+. My time - $1200+.... nowadays.... No young S'porean from poly would work for anything less than $1600-1800....</p>
              <p>So.... how you want to compare long time ago.....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"></p>

              <p>Singapore is not ONLY about you, we were talking about affordability of housing for the current generation, but you seem to be sucked into a vortex of self glorification. Gimme a break, you only made around $180,000, I made at least 3 times your amount and I don't find it glorifying at all. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You just tell us that people made $500+ a year in 1970s, a couple would have made $1,000 a month, you pay $200 a month, you would have paid $8,000 in 40 months. Think about your annual wage growth from then till now is only 3.72% while your HDB has been increasing at 8.72% a year. In the past you only need pay 5 years for your house, at present you have to pay 30 years for your house.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ermmm.....I thought you were the one that brought up your case of buying a house 10 years ago, when everyone else was comparing about the current price level of HDB houses. You don't even have the honour to stand by what you say and push your losses to me. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> Now it's me that brought up HDB prices from 10 years ago? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Back then when the gahmen implemented the program to shoo villagers out from landed dwellings, the leased flats were not meant to be investments and traded as such.</p>
              <p>Property taxes will only encourage HDB valuations to go UP. </p>
              <p>I think it would be more prudent to issue lease flats for a fraction of the price to new families and offer them 10, 15, 20 or 30 year leasehold rights.  And then when the lease is up, extend or return flats for another type of floor plan with similar lease structure. This should effectively curb resale speculations.</p>
              <p>That way, new families don't have to worry about the pitfalls of short term renting, still enjoy affordable long term public housing, better flexibility for family expansion/contraction and save up money for their children's expenses for a better family life.</p>
              <p>HDB really needs to restructure the policies if not the newer generations will suffer.</p>
