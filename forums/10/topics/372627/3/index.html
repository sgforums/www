              <p>Not sure when is your source but as far as I know, over 50% of the HK population live in public housing. The more important thing is the ownership, most HK rent the government housing while most singaporean own the housing.</p>
              <p>Singapore and HK have similar population density of around 6400 psm. while Hk is interjected with mountains, singapore need to preserve the water reservoir, water catchment area, military training area, and small farms. Average Singapore flats are around 24 storeys while in HK it is 40 storeys. check with the HK people and you will find out the comparison of the sizes of the flats between the countries. I expect you to be more knowledgeable on this.<img src="http://www.sgforums.com/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>The major land owner in Singapore is the government, in HK it is the Lee family and others. Tong Chee Hwa wanted to build public housing similar to the HDB for HK but the main objections came from the private developers. "government should not have any influence on property market". Hk has more billionnaires than Singapore, no doubt, but how do they become billionnaires? property development! it is still the rich get richer, the poor get poorer. the difference is who are the rich and who are the poor. You can't be the government of HK, but do you think you can be the developers in HK?</p>
              <p>since when has the market for private housing, besides the landed in singapore sustained by internal growth? prices have gone exponentially high before the financial meltdown in the US, then prices came down by more than 40%. now you see prices going up, will it sustain? ever heard of the 12 years cycle?</p>
              <p>if you get better returns from private housing, why should the 3.5% be a limit to your investment in private housing. Why do you want to leave in money in your CPF and be exploited by the government. go join the q for private condos, I have one for sales, when the price is high enough.<img src="http://www.sgforums.com/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>The data of 52% private home ownership was in 2007, it is from the Housing Authority of Hong Kong. Whether rental or purchase, it makes no difference, because public housing is for families to live in, it is not an investment like private properties, if you sell off your house, you still end up with no roof over your head. To the financially burdened which do you think is better? Renting a flat or buying one? According to you, most in Hong Kong rents public housing, which means that the Hong Kong government has public interest in providing the less financially capable with a roof over their head, this cannot be said of the Singapore government. The rental rates of Hong Kong public housing is HK$38 to HK$45 per sq. m., which means 800 sq. ft. unit would only cost SG$522. Where in Singapore can you get a 3 room HDB for SG$522 a month?</p>

              <p>You mean to tell me in the past, housing was built for the benefit of foreigners to purchase? You sure about your claims? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> Housing for foreigners was just a small percentage in the past, but within these few years, with the governmen't policy of increasing citizens by importing foreigners has led to a drastic increase in the price of properties. (1.5 million foreigners compare to 3 million citizens {also take note that some of these 3 million citizens are newly converted foreigners}) That's why I said, in the past housing was more of an internal growth, but these past few years, with a steep increase in population (by immigration from PRC, India, Indonesia), the price of housing has increased more drastically. If you have problems understanding this, just go to the Singstat website to confirm that Singapore's population has increased substantially these few years. 12 year cycle? Maybe you can cite the source of your theory? So when is the peak and trough of this 12 year cycle? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Interesting post from the governments' REACH website. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When we complained about the rising cost of livings, it simply means one thing:</p>
              <p><strong>Since the Mid-80s Recession, our salary had been suppressed such that for doing the same job in SIngpaore, I am earning TWICE that in Hong Kong, Macau, UAE and Middle East.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>We are complaining now because we are paid 3rd World Salary with 1st World Cost of Living in Singapore.</strong></p>
              <p>And do remember that in mid-80s, CPF was 20% - EMployer 20% Employee; adn briefly 25% - EMployer - 25% - Employee.</p>
              <p>Guess that most of you all are too young to remember PAP Government Proud Boast at the then Booming 80s that CPF will eventually reach 50% overall when "Re-structuring Singapore Economy to "Hi-tech, Hi-Pay" is completed".</p>
              <p>Guess we are still re-structuring isn't it?</p>
              <p>And PAP Aristocrats are quietly telling us to lower our expectation sin't it?</p>
              <p>Whereas in Booming 80's, our expectation was then to upgrde from:</p>
              <p>- 1-room HDB rental to 3-room HDB flat</p>
              <p>- 3-room HDB to 5-room HDB flat</p>
              <p>- 5-room HDB to private condo.</p>
              <p>You mean that in 21st Century Uniquely Singapore, a developed 1st World COutnry, we got to lower our expectation below even our 1980's SIngpaore Dream?</p>
              <p>Let alone attaining Swiss Standard of Living 1999?</p>
              <p>How quaint.</p>

              Most north European democratic governments disclose fully their information e.g. Sweden has a law that all must be published since the gov comes from the people it makes sense. It's a way for the public to make sure no hanky panky is going on.
              
              Most PR's that I know would not consider staying here in Singapore when they get older for the simple reason that it is too expensive to live here and with the money they earned here they can live a much better life elsewhere.

              <p>no difference between renting and buying? when you buy the house its yours,  30 years or sooner, and you can pass on to your children.

              <p>In every country, the financial Minister will announce it annual financial position with a budget proposed, recommended, endorsed and implemented. The way the position is deliberated depend on each country models of governing, can be different democratic kind of models or other governing system like communism or socialism. But there can never be full disclosure, it just a matter of wanting to release more or less of the statement, and even if the nation account book is partially released, it only serve the purpose of seeking its citizen understanding, and usually these figures are massaged and presented for a cause. Also, bearing in mind that national account are audited within the national secruity act, you believe in them? It is of the National security that national account should not leak out as other nation will study your position and know all weak and strong points.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The swedish declared their account the same as our Finance Minister declared our bugdet for the year, their financial minister will only make a few key notes on the deficit and surplus thereby proposer and implementation. Most of these Scandinavian Vikings also have a CPF system which i think they call it PPM.. state authority that handles a part of the <strong>pension savings</strong> of the  population, collected through <strong>taxes on income</strong>. PPM gives each pension saver the possibility to choose among a wide range of funds in which to place his/her savings. The saver can change funds as often as wanted, and at no cost. A pension saver's account gives a snapshot of a person's holdings in form of shares in various funds at a given time. And there is no guarantee of any sort. In a nutshell, I believe we are better than them in our CPF that cover our medical cost and insurance..etc etc.</p>
