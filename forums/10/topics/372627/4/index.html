              <p>Mr Sg immigrant. Do you know how much to build a block of HDB ? And how much is the profit margin HDB is getting ? A mystery to you and me, no ?</p>
              <p>If I did not remember wrongly, some bloke posted in this forum that a unit cost only $30,000 to build. In today's prices. How much is the gahmen leasing you for 99 years ?</p>
              <p>My capital gains are from properties I own, not leased. And leaseholds don't appreciate, they depreciate because of expiry.</p>
              <p>Whats the big deal about the Capital gain tax repeal during market lull ? Is that a PERMANENT deal ? Is the govt going to reinstate that when the market goes up again ?</p>
              <p>The only good thing that can come out of this tax repeal is to entice more people to buy properties NOW.</p>

              <p>Mr Sg immigrant. Do you know how much to build a block of HDB ? And how much is the profit margin HDB is getting ? A mystery to you and me, no ?</p>
              <p>If I did not remember wrongly, some bloke posted in this forum that a unit cost only $30,000 to build. In today's prices. How much is the gahmen leasing you for 99 years ?</p>
              <p>My capital gains are from properties I own, not leased. And leaseholds don't appreciate, they depreciate because of expiry.</p>
              <p>Whats the big deal about the Capital gain tax repeal during market lull ? Is that a PERMANENT deal ? Is the govt going to reinstate that when the market goes up again ?</p>
              <p>The only good thing that can come out of this tax repeal is to entice more people to buy properties NOW.</p>

              <p><br>Mr oz beach, I don't know about the cost of $30,000 per unit, as long as if I buy $240,000, 10 yrs later it is $300,000 and not 24,000.</p>
              <p>Bad for you, here even private 99 yrs lease also appreciate, Farrer Court 99 yrs lease then enbloc for better price. of course here the landed fetch higher return.</p>
              <p>again, you won't be permanent, why expect anything to be PERMANENT?</p>
              <p>already so many people buying properties now, no need any extra incentive, those got house to sell happy, those got money to buy house happy, those got house but not selling happy, only those who rent must hope rental don't increase. </p>

              <p>Think about it.... are any of us going to stay in our parents house forever <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="icon_question.gif"><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="icon_exclaim.gif"> Sooner or later you will need to own your own place.... for me, renting is NOT the answer.... The cost of my loan will only change slightly (already lower than I started).... but in renting, my landlord could thrown me out anytime my contract is over and I refuse to pay an increase in rental..... even Ang Mor are moving out of Prime Area because of rental increase.......</p>
              <p>And lets not forget that your BOSS / COMPANY will also have to pay out 20% to your CPF..... its like you putting $100 inside, and someone else top up $100 more. My boss is partly paying my loan <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"></p>
              <p>For those NOT needing to use CPF to buy their House..... Remember that NOT everyone is born with a Sliver Spoon or have a mid four figure pay every month. There are alot of avg joe's here who own their HDB due to CPF. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"></p>

              <p>You sure you got your 4 Room HDB for $112,000? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I would be scared living in there, it might be the haunted, that's why owners are letting it go cheap, the current resale prices of 4 Room HDB ranges from $230,000 to $351,500. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I wonder if you pay $460 a month, will you complete paying for your 4 Room HDB in 100 years. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Not possible, you would need to pay $562 a month in order to pay up your $230,000 4 Room HDB in 100 years. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
