              <p><br>temasek lost is nothing going to stop you from using or taking from CPF, yur account still remain the same with the same interest, so, what is the big deal about temasek lost, CPF still oblight it terms and conditions to you. If you dun have CPF, employers will be the most happiest, they dun have to contribute, and what have you got, let said a mere average singapore paid of $2500, with no CPF, per years with 13th month is only 32,500, add average a mth bonus is only 35,000, your expenditure take on an average minimium spending basis will be 1500 per month, total 18000, so you save 17,000 per year, in 40 years of working you saved $680,000..can buy condo meh????</p>

              <p>Singapore is not the Singapore of the 80s and 90s anymore.  The massive influx of cheap labour flooding the island only pushes wages down.

              <p>They get to keep 7 more years of our money. And the more people die before 62, the less people CPF needs to pay.</p>
              <p>If they want seniors to keep working, they should deal with age discrimination in employments and come up with policies that protect the rights of older workers.</p>
