              <p>So, singapore is the only unique country that the government takes 20% of ur monthly salary into a so called bank that you can withdraw when u are 62(used to be 55 until PAP decides that we should work until 62 before we can retire) or when u are sick. What if there isnt such a thing? Will life be the same? or will life be worse/better without it? And how do cpf really contributes to your retirement when you only get monthly payment from the cpf board(instead of withdrawing whatever amount you want) when u reached your golden age .. if you can live that long.</p>
              <p>To me i feel that cpf has its pros and cons. You can rely on it for medisave when you are sick etc etc. But for lower income families, that draw less than 1.5k a month it makes no sense to take 20% out of it making the family harder to make ends meet for that month if the person is the sole bread winner.. What are your thoughts about CPF? Good that it helps us to save? Or bad that it always take much of ur hard earned money into a invisible bank that you can see only when u reach a certain age.</p>
              <p>I dont see other countries struggling without a so called CPF aka Social security savings plan.</p>

              <p>They are just exploiting common folks, pay you pathetic interest for the use of your capital, compare with Hong Kong's MPFA, which advises you on the investment for your retirement based on your risk profile, you make your own investment choice. The Hong Kong government provides a guarantee for your funds, but the choice of investment is certainly yours, it doesn't pay you a cheap interest rate of 3.5% for the use of your capital like CPF.</p>

              <p>For CPF there is a $60,000 cap before excess can be used for investment, there are like 3.2 million CPF members, so you get cheap of $192 billion (provided everybody has $60k in their account, the current Total CPF balance is $153 billion). <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>The CPF pays you 3.5% for the first $60,000. If you look at the Return on Equity (ROE) for a blue chip company, say OCBC, there isn't a year where the ROE is below 6.3%. It's like me asking you to put your money with me, I pay you 3.5% while I make investment gains of 6.3% to 13.4% (average for 10 years is 11.3%). For UOB, the ROE for the past 5 years has never been below 10.8%.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Other countries have their Social security plans, just which one is better in the individual's opinion. people in countries without any kind of social security plan usually wish there is one.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #808080;">you make your own investment choice</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">hehe, when they lost money on Lehman they demonstrated to get money back, so much for making own choice, but others bear the consequence. make money, I made the right choice, lose money I got conned.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #808080;">OCBC, there isn't a year where the ROE is below 6.3%. ...For UOB, the ROE for the past 5 years has never been below 10.8%.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">you can use your CPF money to buy OCBC and UOB shares, or any other shares, depending on your own risk factor, which is how much are you able to lose and don't put the blame on others.</span></p>
              <p>You can also use CPF to buy houses, buy low sell high, its your choice.</p>

              <p><br>Very true, not only HK, many countries are envious about our CPF system, and yet here, our own local keep complaining,...another praise I get from some other countries' citizen is that we also have a very good tripartite relationship, even they copied it and use in their own country, it cannot work.</p>

              <p>The historical average returns of a diversified portfolio in any market ALWAYS beats the returns from your savings rate of 3.5%!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Don't blame you, cause you have no firm foundation in Economics or Finance. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>From the inception of Dow Jones to year 2000 , through it's ups and down from the great recession, the recession in 1970, the big company stock still manages to give an annual average return of 11.05%. CPF gives you 3.5% and pockets the rest of the 7.55%, don't underestimate the value of 7.55%. If you have $10,000 compounded by 11.05% for 40 years (your productive working life), you will have $661,824 by the end of 40 years.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>A central bank can always guarantee the paper value in your CPF, because it has the authority to print more money when it's required, but then again to control the inflation due to more retirees withdrawing funds they can increase CPF minimum sum like what they are doing recently.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #808080;">OCBC, there isn't a year where the ROE is below 6.3%. ...For UOB, the ROE for the past 5 years has never been below 10.8%.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">you can use your CPF money to buy OCBC and UOB shares, or any other shares, depending on your own risk factor, which is how much are you able to lose and don't put the blame on others.</span></p>
              <p>You can also use CPF to buy houses, buy low sell high, its your choice.</p>

              <p>Lehman brother was more of the banks' hardselling and withholding certain information from investors. That's why investors in Hong Kong got their money back and you can't use a single event to generalise about the whole market, like I said before you need a diversified portfolio to reduce the risk, not putting your eggs into one basket. In any case, whether the market is good or bad, there will always be companies losing money and filing for bankruptcy, it's just that when there market dips, there are more companies closing, but then those who survive will take over the bankrupted company's share. Diversification would need about 30 different company stocks.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Also, don't forget that CPF (government) has the funds necessary to diversify into many investments, with diversification the risk are reduced, they are able to get a higher return from the investments. But what they do is to pocket the difference between your 3.5% and their investment gains, they are just merely exploiting CPF members' cheap source of funds.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I think you are totally unknowledgable about CPF, don't you know that there was a cap of $60,000 before you can even make an investment, it was mentioned in a previous National Day Rally. Where are you from? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>You attracted a PRC engineer, he becomes a citizen, brings his wife, his one kid, mother and father in, buy a HBD flat, and later on get promoted, get a car, upgrade his house and so on. Question: Do you think he will give up all these to jump to another country??</p>

              <p>you look at those ppl age from 20-35 on the average.</p>
              <p>which of them have cars/go drinking/rent condo but have no money? plenty.</p>
              <p>because they just spend what they have. if no CPF is implement, what can they use to pay for their medical fees when they are sick? sell away their cars?</p>
              <p>if no CPF, i bet most of ya can't even afford a HDB.</p>
              <p>to be fair. HDB pricing is riduculous, well thats why they came out with a brillant schme to suck your money at 1 time, and let u pay for this HDB u are in.</p>
