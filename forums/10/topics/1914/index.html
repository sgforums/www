            <div class='col-md body'>For my 2 cents worth at least...<br><br>Although I do believe S'pore can become a sports-crazed nation but there are some obstacles that needs to be tackled first<br><br>1. People's mindset of Sports<br><br>This is partly blamed to the Govt. The govt indirectly influenced the parents of children today, to have gd education to get a job. Now, they want the parents to change that mindset. It is difficult as many people here see sport as a waste of time(My parents say it is although I say otherwise)<br><br>2. Lack of facilities<br><br>Even though officials say we have plenty of facilities, I find it not true. Yeah, there are facilities but the facilities are placed unevenly. Example, Queenstown is quite a small area, yet only a few misreable facilities available for sports. Soccer? Sheesh! No courts at all! Tampines is one big area and divided. Yet not all of these divided areas have facilities.<br><br>3. Funding<br><br>I'm a bit peeved about the funding from the Govt. The way they give the funds to the sports associations is like a selfish rich a** giving very little money to the poor. Seriously, S'pore is a very rich nation. Yet, the govt doesnt want to use the money to benefit for the citizens. Yeah yeah the cpf, the facilities we use etc.. But when comes to sports, we get f***** off by them saying its a waste of money..<br><br>4. Build a new National Stadium<br><br>I find that the National Stadium is too old and not up to date with the technology available. Even though I am sentimental about it but it has to give way to a better version of it. Maybe a larger capcity with new technologies stadium and fited with an underground parking system? LOL, just making a suggestion<br><br>5. Environment<br><br>The environment here is too rigid. If you are seen playing sports, people will say that you are wasting your time instead of working. And the environment set here is that you must work or else you wun survive in S'pore...<br><br>Thats all...if you have any other comments, go ahead.. Although I wish the government listen to the youths of today on what we really want for sports.<br><br>------------------<br>*[]-= The greatest gift that humanity has over other dominant physical densities is knowledge while the greatest curse that humanity can give is humanity itself =-[]*</div>
