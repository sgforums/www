            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Culture of protests is finally taking root in the island</strong><br><br>Ladies and Gentlemen,<br><br>If there was a day of victory for the cause of freedom over Lee Kuan Yew's authoritarianism in Singapore, it was October 1, 2007, outside the gates of the Burmese Embassy, 15 St Martin Drive, Singapore 257996, where peaceful protesters stood bravely in defiance of police orders that they should disperse, proclaiming their right to freedom of peaceful assembly, even if Singapore law makes it illegal.<br><br>On that day, according to the Singapore Democrat, the newspaper of the Singapore Democratic Party, Dr. Chee and other political activists organized a protest and a petition campaign outside the Burmese Embassy in Singapore, against the Burmese government's action in brutally suppressing peaceful demonstrations by Burmese demanding freedom in their country.<br><br>The number of people who had assembled outside the embassy in Singapore clearly exceeded 5, which therefore required a permit under Singapore law.<br><br>Needless to say, such a law is clearly illegal among the free nations of the world.<br><br>Dr. Chee and his protesters did not have that permit.<br><br>DSP Deep Singh of the Tanglin Police station had come around with his police subordinates which included several plain clothes policemen armed with video cameras, who began filming the protesters, who were clearly in violation of the law which required a permit.<br><br>DSP Deep Singh went around the crowd of people, repeatedly, perhaps no less than 50 times, saying the same thing again and again; that they were in violation of Singapore law in not having a permit; that the police will and are investigating their conduct; that they should therefore leave the area immediately.<br><br>This was a clear and unequivocal order from the police, who were the representatives of the Singapore government. There was no doubt at all that the protesters were breaking the law.<br><br>The protesters there appeared to show exceptional courage and defiance to the direct order of a senior ranking police officer, DSP Deep Singh.<br><br>In total defiance to the authority of the Singapore Police Force and the Singapore government, not a single person complied with his order.<br><br>Dr. Chee and everyone there stayed put at their spot and eventually DSP Deep Singh and his policemen were left with no choice but to leave the place while the protesters jeered, mockingly thanking him for his advice.<br><br>The Singapore Police Force had lost all it's authority and dignity on that momentous day, October 1, 2007, outside the Burmese Embassy in Singapore, at 15, St Martins Drive, Singapore 257996.<br><br>A video of the entire spectacle can be seen on the Singapore Democrat Website http://singaporedemocrat.org/ in the article "Steady Stream of petitioners despite harassment by Singapore Police" Oct 1, 2007.<br><br>In that video, you will see the pathetic helplessness of DSP Deep Singh, who had to walk away with his tail between his legs, his side kick subordinate police officers at his tail, and indeed the total helplessness of the Lee Kuan Yew regime.<br><br>The protesters, by their actions were telling the Singapore police that such a law requiring a permit for 5 or more peaceful people to gather is a violation of the Singapore Constitution; that it is an unjust law; and unjust laws need not be obeyed; even if DSP Deep Singh were to tell them a million times that such a gathering is a breach of the law!<br><br>There is no doubt that on that day, in the battle between those who seek freedom and the Lee Kuan Yew administration which wants to suppress it, it was a resounding victory for the Dr. Chee and his human rights activists for the cause of the right to free speech and assembly.<br><br>Perhaps the authoritarian Singapore regime has finally realized that it is becoming increasingly difficult to silence the democracy activists and it is best to leave them alone; since afterall justice in this case is with the activists.<br><br>And this surely must be the de facto end, if not de jure, of the unjust law that requires a gathering of 5 or more peaceful people to require a permit.<br><br>I can clearly see in the Singapore horizon, more and more protests, by Burmese, by Filipinos, by mainland Indians, by mainland Chinese, by Indonesians and of course by Singaporeans. Dr. Chee by his dogged determination has managed to bring about the culture of protest, which Singapore badly needs. We have to salute him for this.<br><br>Not unlike Mahatma Gandhi defying British Law which forbid Indians from making salt which was a British Government monopoly, at Porbundur, Gujarat, India where he marched to the Indian Ocean coast and in full view of the British Colonial masters, collected salt.<br><br>What Gandhi was saying to the British was that unjust laws need not be obeyed just as Dr. Chee and his activists were saying to Singapore Police Officer Deep Singh that a law requiring 5 or more people to gather is inherently illegal and in violation of the fundamental human rights of citizens all over the world. Therefore he will not obey.<br><br>Copy of this letter is sent Emailed to:<br><br>(1) Deputy Superintendat of Police, Deep Singh son of Piara Singh<br>deep_singh@spf.gov.sg<br><br>(2) Minister of Home Affiars, Wong Kan Seng<br>wong_kan_seng@mha.gov.sg<br><br>I urge all readers of this blog to Email both these people to stop harassing citizens from exercising their human rights and reminding Mr. Singh one more time that a law requiring a permit to peacefully assembly is without any legal basis, even if the Lee Kuan Yew Administration says so and that you will break it as many times as you wish.<br><br>Gopalan Nair<br><br><a href="http://singaporedissident.blogspot.com/2007/10/culture-of-protests-is-finally-taking.html" rel="nofollow">http://singaporedissident.blogspot.com/2007/10/culture-of-protests-is-finally-taking.html</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Singapore. Power corrupts. Absolute power corrupts absolutely. </strong><br><br>Ladies and Gentlemen,<br><br>It is not long more to wait. Not at all.<br><br>Lee Kuan Yew is 84 years old. He is an old man. And through his years in power, he became corrupt; as all dictators become. He gave power and money to his family and relatives and cronies. The difference between the Burmese junta and Singapore is only a matter of degree.<br><br>In Burma, as in Singapore under the Lee Kuan Yew administration, the military dictators plunder the countries wealth before the eyes of the people enriching themselves. If you complained in Burma, you would be imprisoned and killed. In Singapore, you would be sued and bankrupted. As to which is worse, I leave it up to you.<br><br>But now the clock is especially ticking for Lee Kuan Yew. He is 84. And the truth is like everyone else, he is human. His body has to give way, his mind too. He will very soon turn to vegetable; and then he will die. That is certain. The only remaining question is when?<br><br>The biggest mistake he made is anointing his son Prime Minister. Unfortunately for him, his son does not instill any confidence even within his own party. There are many things Lee Kuan Yew did over the years that attracted the hatred of the vast majority of his people. The only one's benefiting from his rule are his cronies and relatives who are paid enormous sums; and through globalization, the foreign millionaires now resident in Singapore. The rest merely get along.<br><br>The reasons for the hatred towards him and his family in power are many; such as nepotism, corruption in paying themselves unacceptably excessive sums as their salaries, the politicisation of the judiciary, using the courts to silence dissent, the muzzling of the press, and various other blatant human rights violations.<br><br>The people are angry. They are waiting for Lee Kuan Yew to die; like vultures around a dying hyena in the desert. And when he dies, his son, lacking any ability will not be able to govern. The pent up anger within people will finally erupt; I expect massive street demonstrations, the present ministers who have got their money will be the first to leave the country, others will follow, capital will flow out, and there will be a momentous change.<br><br>I hope when the day comes; mind you, I do not say "if" that day comes; because it is bound to happen; I hope that Singaporeans will hold his son and his family members to account for their ill gotten gains of millions of dollars and made to answer for their actions.<br><br>The day that Lee Kuan Yew dies will be the day that sets Singapore free; if the present political opponents in Singapore do not mange it earlier. The political dissidents in Singapore now are working hard to propel the protest movement, which, mind you, has already begun, to full steam ahead. I expect when Lee dies very soon, that protest movement will be the cause for massive protests throughout the island.<br><br>I have many more years to live. So have all the other political activists. And unfortunately for Lee's son, he too has many more years to live. All of us will see what happens after Lee's death. And all of us expect his son, the Prime Minister and the others who have abused the trust of Singaporeans to answer for their actions.<br><br>After all Lee Kuan Yew will have to die very soon whether he likes it or not. A piece of advise for Lee Kuan Yew. If he is smart, he will play it safe by asking his son, his family and his cronies to leave Singapore forthwith. That way, they may be able to avoid the dangers that may befall them; no guarantee, of course.<br><br>Waiting any longer may be too late for them.<br><br>Gopalan Nair<br><br><a href="http://singaporedissident.blogspot.com/2007/10/singapore-power-corrupts-absolute-power.html" rel="nofollow">http://singaporedissident.blogspot.com/2007/10/singapore-power-corrupts-absolute-power.html</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Congratulations SDP on the Burma Protests. Now the next step.</strong><br><br>Ladies and Gentlemen,<br><br>It was excellent job by the Singapore Democrat Party, Dr. Chee Soon Juan and every other protestor in the recent Singapore Burma protests.<br><br>I believe their intention was very clear from the start. It was to goad the Lee Administration into reacting to their protests, by arresting them. And this, as expected of the Lee Kuan Yew Administration, they did, to their shame.<br><br>By their arrests, the government has lost a great deal of respect; exposing SingaporeÂ’s repressive actions to the world community; telling the world that the difference between them and Burma was only in degree; including reminding us of the fact that they are one of the largest trading partners or enablers of the brutal Burmese junta.<br><br>A brilliant coup. Well done SDP.<br><br>Since the protest movement through the sacrifice and struggle of Dr. Chee and his colleagues is now well under way in Singapore, it has now to be put to good use in furthering the democratic cause of Singaporeans.<br><br>I believe that for a protest movement to succeed and gain in strength and numbers, it has to be a cause that will have support within a large section of the community, such as issues relating to bread and butter.<br><br>Abstract ideological issues such as the fundamental freedoms of the press and assembly may not, in a society such as Singapore at present, attract large massive support.<br><br>Therefore, in my view, the activists for democratic change should look to the present main problems of the people; such as the inability of Singaporeans to draw on their CPF in old age; the failure of the government to sufficiently provide for the old and sick who are given as little as $300.00 per month in welfare payments when the Ministers are paid, in addition to the various other hidden sources of income, a pay of a thumping $3 million a year; the displacement of local Singaporeans workers by the massive immigration of foreigners who take the jobs from the Singaporeans locals.<br><br>Such issues which hit at the heart of a wide section of Singaporeans are good protest cases which Dr. Chee and his admirable colleagues should look into.<br><br>The difficulty with international opinion is this. The world community has to see Singaporeans themselves demanding their rights from the government through protests strikes and other civil disobedience; which unfortunately at present the world does not see, except occasionally such as this Burma protest.<br><br>Otherwise the world sees Singapore as a very peaceful place with the population entirely content. In this situation, it is difficult for Singaporeans to expect the world to put any pressure on Singapore when they see that the Singaporeans themselves do not appear to want any change.<br><br>It is my humble opinion, now that Dr. Chee has managed to make great headway in the protest movement tin Singapore, to now push ahead with more protests on issues which are hurting the poorer and older sections of the Singapore population most, such as their inability to withdraw the CPF and the neglect of the old, sick and infirm.<br><br>Another is the race issue. I am sure Dr. Chee speaks for the Malays and the Indians as well as everyone in Singapore and therefore there is no shame in mentioning it.<br><br>The Malays and Indians are hurting because of the Singapore government policy of importing disproportionately large numbers of Chinese from mainland China when in fact; the Malays who have more children that anyone else continue to be kept as a small minority of 15 % and the Indians at 8%.<br><br>I think local born Singaporean Chinese stand in support of the plight of the Malays and Indians in this case, when the government deliberately keeps the Malay population at a small minority. Malays should protest for a halt in this unfair unjust massive importation of Chinese.<br><br>I hope that Dr. Chee now will begin working the HDB flats to target and identify in sufficient numbers those who are hurting in such seminal causes; because of the unfair policies such as the CPF retention of savings by the government and work towards even massive protest movements for these grievances.<br><br>Any protest movement requires money. The government has an unjust law; just as many of their laws are unjust in favor of the government; that disallows local organizations from being funded by foreign sources.<br><br>If you really think of it, this law makes no sense. I concede it is wrong to use foreign money to further foreign interests. But it is not wrong to use foreign money for the good of Singapore and to bring about democracy.<br><br>I think Singapore opposition politicians should ignore and defy Singapore law which forbids foreign funding of democratic causes in the country and they should seek the help of foreign organizations, of which there are many, to lend support to the cause of freedom in Singapore.<br><br>And lastly, one point about the Singapore governments repeated accusation that Dr. Chee was in violation of Singapore law that makes protests of more than 5 people illegal. Let me remind the Singapore government that it is not Dr. Chee' protest that is illegal; it is the law itself which is illegal.<br><br>First remember, just because the law is passed by Parliament does not make it good law.<br><br>Second, the supreme law of the land is the constitution which gives the right of assembly to the people.<br><br>Third, constitutional law states that no law can be validly enacted which contravenes the constitution unless there are compelling reasons for such a law. Therefore since there are no compelling reasons why a peaceful assembly of 5 or more people should need a permit, this law is clearly without any legal basis. Such a law is illegal and Dr. Chee and everyone else in Singapore should violate that law whenever they see fit. And what I say is the law. Ask any lawyer.<br><br>And the most important reason why the 5 man assembly law is illegal is simply because; the government will refuse a permit even if you applied!<br><br>I hope Dr. Chee and his brave friends who have so bravely protested make the government realize that if other Singaporeans want to accept even unjust laws, it is up to them; but as far as they are concerned, this permit law is rubbish and should be trampled on like rubbish.<br><br>Gopalan Nair<br><br><a href="http://singaporedissident.blogspot.com/2007/10/congratulations-sdp-on-burma-protests.html" rel="nofollow">http://singaporedissident.blogspot.com/2007/10/congratulations-sdp-on-burma-protests.html</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>He really doesn't need to play the race game and suggest that political parties in Singapore be allowed to be funded by foreign sources. The idea of local political parties being funded by foreign sources is pure absurdity. Chee Soon Juan is already getting himself into trouble with the law. The idea of him breaking the law and at the same time getting funded by foreign sources doesn't seem right, if you get what i mean.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Singapore. The true reason for political apathy.</strong><br><br>Ladies and Gentlemen,<br><br>Except for Dr. Chee Soon Juan and his colleagues, there is a total nationwide apathy and indifference for politics in the entire island of Singapore. No interest in civil liberties, no interest in how the country is run, no interest in anything at all that happens around them. The people appear only interested in having a job, sufficient income, the more the better and a comfortable life. As to how the country should be run, they leave it entirely to Lee Kuan Yew, his son and his friends and relatives.<br><br>This strange attitude, this total indifference to government and politics, is strange and unique; different from people's behavior in every other country. Why are Singaporeans disinterested? Since they are citizens of their country and since their money goes to pay the huge salaries of the Ministers their relatives and friends who run the country; should it not be natural for them to demand to be heard in matters that affect them? Well apparently in Singapore, they don't see the need to complain or make suggestions on governance.<br><br>I now know the reason why.<br><br>The reason for Singaporeans to believe that they are helpless in complaining to the government their grievances or making suggestions is because the vast majority is unaware that they have such rights. The vast majority, through ignorance, believe that they do not have such rights.<br><br>The fault for the sad state of affairs in Singapore where Lee Kuan Yew and his government are able to continue to rule unchallenged by any Singaporean; the blame for this sad state of affairs lies entirely on the lawyers, those educated in social sciences such as philosophy, sociology and political science. It is they who are aware, because of their training, of the principles of democracy, of the rule of law and the way a modern civil society should be run. But these people have shamefully let the country down because of their fear to oppose Lee Kuan Yew and the dire consequences that will follow. So to protect themselves, these very people who should be leading the way in making sure that Singapore is indeed a democracy that was intended in it's constitution; have let the people down by not ensuring that each man and women is made aware of his or her rights, so that this country, like other first world countries is governed for the benefit of the people; rather than for the benefit of Lee Kuan Yew, his relatives and friends as is the sad situation now.<br><br>And the ignorance which the majority have about their rights is not their fault. The idea of democracy, the need for it, and why it is necessary, are things that have to be learned. They are not things that people would automatically know. And the duty to make the people realize their rights lies with the lawyers; these lawyers who have miserably failed their fellow citizens and betrayed their calling.<br><br>I have a friend, Thanabal. I speak to him very often over the phone. I knew him since childhood. He lived in PUB flats in Somerset Road. His parents knew my parents. Although a good student when young, it was not good enough for the Singapore education system of the time. He did not manage his O levels well. He ended up as a store man and now is security guard.<br><br>I asked Thanabal why he is not agitating for his rights, since he is a Singaporean. His answer was basically that the government has some bad laws and policies which he disagrees with. But beyond that, he had nothing more to say. He did not even believe that he had such rights as to protest, to demonstrate or peacefully assemble to demand his rights. It is not because he is particularly stupid. It is simply because no one ever told him that he has such rights. He has never read the constitution of Singapore and even if he did, would not know the importance of its provisions.<br><br>It is not just Thanabal. It is almost the entire country that is kept in the dark this way. For Lee Kuan Yew and his family members who reap the rewards of the toils of Singaporeans like him; it serves Lee very well to keep my friend Thanabal in the ignorant state that he is in; in politics or government. The less Thanabal is told about matters such as the Constitution, the better for the Lee family. I could safely say that the vast majority of Singaporeans, even those who are educated in non legal or non philosophical subjects, graduated from the University of Singapore are not much different from my friend Thanabal. Surprisingly, they display the same level of ignorance in political matters. In college, they have all been deliberately kept in the dark on matters such as the Constitution or the people's rights.<br><br>And Lee Kuan Yew being the corrupt dictator that he is; he deliberately ensures the people's ignorance in government, thereby able to govern them easily.<br><br>And as equally disgraceful as Lee Kuan Yew and his family; are the Singapore lawyers. Why, because lawyers are aware of such things as the constitution and the rights of citizens and yet they do nothing, because they fear; fear to encourage the people to demand their lawful rights. And because these disgraceful Singapore lawyers remain silent, having abandoned and abdicated their duty to the people and the law; Lee is able to run roughshod over his people at his pleasure.<br><br>Since I came to the United States, I have been in regular contact with lawyers whom I knew. I want to tell you what they say and generally it is the same disgusting line of thinking that they conveyed. All of them, the moment they know it is me on the telephone; almost invariably start off by saying that they are not interested in politics. This is because they expect me to ask them what they thought of the government's refusal to refund CPF payments; why is the government constantly arresting Dr. Chee for his peaceful protests; are they not aware that the constitution allows peaceful assembly; and why are they not doing anything about it. These are embarrassing questions for them which they prefer not to answer. They are ashamed. They know that they should do something. They are afraid. Afraid for themselves and afraid for their families. They are afraid of Lee's retribution. So they remain silent. In fact they prefer not to speak to me at all...<br><br><a href="http://singaporedissident.blogspot.com/2007/10/singapore-true-reason-for-political.html" rel="nofollow">http://singaporedissident.blogspot.com/2007/10/singapore-true-reason-for-political.html</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Singapore. A call to conscience </strong><br><br>Ladies and Gentlemen,<br><br>Today's state controlled Singapore newspaper The Straits Times reports the Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew as saying that the strengths of Singapore are its "good governance and rule of law"! We are not sure whether it is senility or just plain dishonesty that makes him say this, but you and I know that the statement does not refer to Singapore and neither will it refer to Burma! He must be referring to some other country.<br><br>Singapore's governance has been thoroughly discredited by international organizations such as Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and the European Union as well as the Government of Canada. So has it's rule of law as can be seen by the use of legal process by government ministers to silence dissent. I am talking of defamation actions for which Lee Kuan Yew has become world famous or infamous. The world is now aware that Dr. Chee Soon Juan who has won several international awards for peace and recognized as a fighter for human rights and freedom, now is kept under city arrest, not much different from the brave Aung San Su Shi of Burma who remains under house arrest. City arrest in the case of Dr. Chee, who is denied the right to travel outside the bounds of Singapore island. And all for what? Just for criticizing the policies and the rule of Lee Kuan Yew and his son.<br><br>This injustice makes one's blood boil. And even more when this tyrant and bully, Lee Kuan Yew has the gall to say things like "good governance" and "rule of law" of the island that he rules with an iron grip. What a lair.<br><br>But one thing for which we can be thankful is modern communication technology which makes news travel throughout the world before you can bat an eyelid; and this technology is working against Lee Kuan Yew. Mr. Lee can keep saying things such as "good governance" and "rule of law" until he becomes blue in the face, but it will do him no good. The world knows that he is a corrupt dictator who pays himself and each member of his family $3 million of Singapore taxpayers money; or theft properly speaking, and Singapore is a dictatorship and nothing nothing less. By uttering such nonsense, it only makes him look stupid in the eyes of the world.<br><br>So I say this to all of you. You have a conscience. You have a duty to follow it, if you are an honest person.<br><br>Lee is already finding it very difficult to continue. He can make speeches flowing with confidence as much a he wants but he is fighting a losing battle. The tide is against him.<br><br>The English educated Singaporeans are leaving the country in droves; children are not being born in sufficient numbers; the population is shrinking except for the fact that he brings in 3rd rate immigrants from neighbouring Asian countries in an desperate attempt to maintain the population; he gives out scholarships generously to Chinese from the mainland, but they use it to learn English and leave for USA at the first opportunity; mainland Indians do the same, study computer science at Singapore's expense and leave for Silicon Valley USA on the first plane out; every so called immigrant to Singapore finds out what is underneath the varnish; that it is rotten to the core, so they have second thoughts and leave Singapore at first light.<br><br>It is, to borrow an expression from the Titanic, trying to arrange the deckchairs while the bow is already listing 60% and sinking! The ship is inexorably taking water.<br><br>I ask this of you. I ask every civil servant to refuse to do the dirty work of Lee Kuan Yew when his demands are to unjustly hurt the opposition. I ask police officers to refuse to obey orders to arrest Dr. Chee when he is engaged in nothing more that peaceful political activity, knowing that that Lee Kuan Yew's laws to arrest citizens in such cases is a violation of the Constitution which is the supreme law. Singapore laws that violate the constitution are devoid of legal basis and should be disobeyed. I ask Judges and magistrates when called upon to manipulate and abuse the law to silence and punish Singaporean peaceful dissidents to disobey and refuse such orders of Lee Kuan Yew.<br><br>I ask each one of you to stand up to your conscience.<br><br>I ask every citizen to search your conscience and ask whether what you do is just. Keep in mind that Lee cannot punish everybody. If you stand up to him, he will have to change his ways, and justice and truth will triumph.<br><br>Remember, you are not as weak as you think you are. And you will be doing good; not just for yourselves but for your descendants and future generations to follow. Singapore is your country; no one can deny you that. So take it upon yourself to do your country proud.<br><br>Just as Dr. Chee Soon Juan, Gandhi Ambalam, Chee Siok Chin, Charles Tan and Jeffrey George and all the others who have shown true grit in the face of repression in the on-going Burma protests.<br><br>These protesters as well as all Singaporeans are now able to see how weak this government really is. If they really are as powerful as they want us to believe they are, then they should shoot like the Burmese Junta did. But Lee Kuan Yew knows that Singapore is not a backwater like Burma. If he shoots, it will be the end not only of the protesters, but also himself and his family and last but not least, Singapore itself.<br><br>So he doesn't shoot. All he can do is to order his politically obedient judges to mete out one week jail sentences each time; for Dr. Chee to come out a week later and do the same thing again!<br><br>If there is a clown among the people here, it has to be Lee Kuan Yew. Surely.<br><br>Gopalan Nair<br><br><a href="http://singaporedissident.blogspot.com/2007/10/singapore-call-to-conscience.html" rel="nofollow">http://singaporedissident.blogspot.com/2007/10/singapore-call-to-conscience.html</a></div>
