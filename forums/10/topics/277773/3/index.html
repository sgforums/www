            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Singapore government's desperate attempt to show a pretty face at the IBA Conference.</strong><br><br>Ladies and Gentlemen,<br><br>At the ongoing International Bar Association's conference in Singapore, Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch of Canada and other respected international organizations have asked the Bar Association to condemn Singapore government's denial of the rule of law in Singapore. As the heat of international "lack of rule of law" criticism is now being felt by the Singaporean dictators Lee Kuan Yew and his family, they are desperately trying to refute these allegations, by making various important people there to make speeches refuting it, without much success.<br><br>You have seen Lee Kuan Yew himself making the keynote speech at the beginning of the conference say that Singapore is indeed a country where the rule of law is respected. In support of his claim, he refers to PERC, a Hong Kong based financial consultancy which places Singapore high on the list for legal efficiency. However he conveniently fails to say that this organization's main business is to give advice to foreign investors doing business in Singapore. PERC, by the very nature of their business, is not concerned whether the poor average Singaporean native will get the same justice as the rich American investor would, in Singapore courts.<br><br>Neither is PERC concerned whether human rights is respected in the country, since this does not factor into the equation for foreign businessmen in Singapore, as the bottom line is maximum profits, not human rights or the rule of law. We can assume that according to PERC, China too will have a good ranking for the rule of law, since American investors find China the best place to invest for manufacturing.<br><br>The Attorney General of Singapore has also found it necessary to weigh in on Lee Kuan Yew's claim on the rule of law in Singapore. He too has made a speech praising the existence of complete independence of the judiciary in Singapore and swears that the rule of law is followed to the letter.<br><br>However he has left unsaid the fact that the very newspaper that publishes these praises from these ruling elite of Singapore is in fact not independent. The Straits Times is fully owned and controlled by Lee Kuan Yew and his family just as all the other media in Singapore is. I understand all the media in Burma is also controlled by the military junta in that country.<br><br>He has also failed to mention that in this rule of law country that he claims, not a single member of Lee Kuan Yew's ruling party has ever lost a law suit brought before the courts against their political opponents. Lee Kuan Yew and his family routinely sue political opponents and foreign newspapers for defamation of character and they invariably win all their cases and always manage collect hundreds of thousands of dollars in damages, awarded by judges in those courts. Are we to assume that Lee Kuan Yew and his family members are always right and their political opponents always wrong, or is there some other reason for this definite pattern of judicial decisions in favor of the Lee family, such as judicial bias?<br><br>In the end, behind this pattern of defamation actions and humongous awards awarded against political opponents in these courts, and with such respected international organizations such as Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, Lawyers Committee for Human Rights, New York Bar Association and even the State Department of the US all saying that Singapore is indeed a country that denies it's citizens their fundamental human rights, and lacks the rule of law; is Lee Kuan Yew telling us that we should still believe him and his Attorney General?<br><br>He might as well go ahead and tell us that the moon is made of cheese.<br><br>Gopalan Nair<br><br><a href="http://singaporedissident.blogspot.com/2007/10/singapore-governments-desperate-attempt.html" rel="nofollow">http://singaporedissident.blogspot.com/2007/10/singapore-governments-desperate-attempt.html</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>"as the authorities stated, instances when members of the ruling PeopleÂ’s Action Party (PAP) have been sued for defamation. Mr. Chiam See Tong, an opposition member since 1984, had successfully obtained damages for defamation from PAP members in three instances.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Singapore. The Workers Party and the Singapore Democratic Alliance should stop claiming to be opposition political parties. </strong><br><br>Ladies and Gentlemen,<br><br>The Workers Party with Loh Thia Khiang, Sylvia Lim and the Singapore Democratic Alliance Chiam See Thong should stop wasting their time and Singaporeans time in claiming to work for democratic rights of Singaporeans. They are doing nothing for the cause of democracy in Singapore.<br><br>Look at what they do. They go to Parliament and make some speeches about this or that. The government promptly refutes their allegations. Then they go home and nothing more. In the meantime, the government carries on with a total disregard of the citizens rights; while these so called opposition politicians wait for the next parliamentary session to make further speeches upon speeches, ad nauseum. And as these opposition politicians make their speeches, Lee Kuan Yew continues to do whatever he wants whenever he wants; with total disregard of the citizen's rights.<br><br>These opposition politicians are doing nothing. They should be told to go home, and stay there.<br><br>The following are the startling glaring grievances. Citizens need permits for each of these activities following, and permits will always be denied if it furthers the opposition cause. In other words, they have no rights.<br><br>1. The people have no right to free speech<br>2. They have no right to assembly<br>3. They have no right to organize into societies<br>4. They have no right to print and publish newspapers<br>5. They have no equal recourse to justice. Political opponents cases will be lost.<br>6. Political opponents will not be able to find a lawyer to represent them.<br>7. They cannot criticize the ruling party. If they do, they will be sued for defamation of character and bankrupted.<br><br>The Workers Party is aware of the repression that goes on. Yet they do nothing, save making speeches upon speeches which are just ignored by the Lee Kuan Yew Administration.<br><br>It is not enough for the The Workers Party and the SDA merely to make speeches when they know the government just ignores them.<br><br>They should realize that they are elected to fight for citizen's rights. And if these rights are denied, they must do whatever is necessary; including peaceful street protests, boycotts, civil unrest and any other necessary means to force the dictatorial Lee regime to submit to the truth. They have to be forced, through whatever means, short of violence, to give the people their rights, which the government denies them.<br><br>These wasted opposition politicians of the WP and the SDA should be honest and tell their people that they are unable to deliver. Merely warming their seats and collecting their salaries is dishonest.<br><br>The people already know that the Lee Administration does not permit free and fair elections. They illegally deprive real and capable politicians to stand for elections for the opposition; by threats of defamation suits and other forms of punishment resulting in the eternal lack of suitable opposition candidates to stand in elections.<br><br>Therefore both you, I and they, know that it is impossible in these circumstances, for the opposition to defeat the tyrant Lee Kuan Yew through the ballot box.<br><br>In these circumstances, if the people really want to enjoy their fundamental rights to live as free people, the only way forward is to force the government to submit to the demands of the people.<br><br>Today, only the SDP with Dr. Chee Soon Juan and his colleagues are doing what should be done. They are using whatever lawful means they can; short of resorting to violence, to compel this authoritarian government to admit that they are bound by the constitution after all. That whether they like it or not, the interests of the people are paramount; not theirs with their $3 million salary each.<br><br>I have the respect and admiration of all the Workers Party supporters as well as those in the SDA. It is Loh Thia Khiang, Sylvia Lim and Chiam See Thong that I have quarrels with.<br><br>I ask that each member of these 2 opposition parties demand of them that they are required to do something tangible for the people. Otherwise they should step aside and allow more honest leaders to take the reigns. Second, I tell party members that they do not need the approval of these ineffective leaders to do what they want. They should go ahead and strike, protest, boycott and carry out other forms of civil disobedience until their demands are met; with or without the approval of these inept and ineffective leaders. And this can be done not only by opposition party members but by everyone in Singapore who cherishes to live as free men.<br><br>Of course, if you feel it necessary, you can also leave and join the SDP and stand with Dr. Chee and his friends in their courageous and honorable road that they take in their fight for freedom.<br><br>From Northern California, I watch with admiration the work of these martyrs for freedom. The wheel of democracy is turning. It may take some time but it is steadily moving in the right direction.<br><br>The destination has been charted. True course has been converted to magnetic giving magnetic course. Magnetic course has been corrected for the cross wind component giving magnetic heading. Compass deviation has been corrected giving compass heading. All navigation instruments working correct.The aircraft is spot on course. Nothing can go wrong now.<br><br>If the destination is Freedom City Airport, you can almost here the Captain say,<br><br>"Freedom City Tower, Antonov 12, 3754 Niner Victor, 15 miles south west of field over Kong Kong, with information Charlie. Inbound for Landing".<br><br>The human nature inherently seeks freedom. This is because humans have the ability to think. Between freedom and bondage, the force of nature always results in the success of the former. This is the law of nature. Lee Kuan Yew should realize this.<br><br>Gopalan Nair<br><br><a href="http://singaporedissident.blogspot.com/2007/10/singapore-workers-party-and-singapore.html" rel="nofollow">http://singaporedissident.blogspot.com/2007/10/singapore-workers-party-and-singapore.html</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br><br>Allow me to help copy-and-paste this article.<br><br><a href="http://singaporedissident.blogspot.com/2007/10/singapore-sylvia-lim-of-workers-party.html" rel="nofollow">http://singaporedissident.blogspot.com/2007/10/singapore-sylvia-lim-of-workers-party.html</a><br><br>Saturday, October 20, 2007<br>Singapore. Sylvia Lim speak with forked tongue.<br>Ladies and Gentlemen,<br><br>Had I been a Red Indian, instead of an Asian Indian, I would have told Sylvia Lim, Non Constituency Member of Parliament of Singapore representing the Workers Party, that at the recent International Bar Association Conference held in Singapore, she spoke with forked tongue! As the Red Indian had told the white man many years ago "White man speak with forked tongue"!<br><br>Instead of representing the interests of the law and the cause of justice and democracy, she instead shamefully decided to take the side of repression and authoritarianism when she told 3,000 lawyers from around the world that there was nothing wrong with the legal system of Singapore and foreign lawyers should mind their own business and not meddle in Singapore's domestic policies. Those may not be her exact words but in essence that is what she meant!<br><br>Wait a minute, you may say! Is this not the line that Lee Kuan Yew and the PAP would take when international human rights and legal organizations justly criticize the Lee Kuan Yew government for its various repressive laws that exist in Singapore; such as the denial of the right to peaceful protest and assembly, of the right to free speech and expression, rights which are enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human rights, which are glaringly lacking in this island dictatorship! Blatant human rights violations!<br><br>Well then, who is she representing, by the way? Is she representing the PAP or is she an opposition politician as she claims to be.<br><br>And her words become all the more shocking, when we are told that she is indeed a law professor in one of the colleges in Singapore!<br><br>I try to be a gentleman and try to avoid using strong words; but sometimes I find it difficult to restrain myself. This is what I will say to her. She has betrayed her cause, betrayed her party, betrayed the trust of the members of the Workers Party, betrayed the trust of the members of all opposition parties in Singapore, betrayed the trust of the people of Singapore and betrayed herself and her conscience. She should be ashamed of herself.<br><br>She knows that;<br>1. Lee denies human rights to his people<br>2. Lee denies his people any possible means to exercise their right of self determination<br><br>and yet she says, without any hesitation, that Singapore can take care of it's human rights problems and outsiders should not comment.<br><br>How can she honestly say this when at this very moment, her people are being politically suppressed in every way possible.<br><br>Her betrayal becomes even more shameful when she does this under the guise of being an opposition politician.<br><br>All that I can say is that she is a shameless woman. Singaporeans should ignore her. She should be sent to Coventry; as the saying goes. Or to the pantry, which ever is more convenient. There is no need to waste too much time with her. She is not worth it.<br><br>For more details of her betrayal, please go the the SDP web site, read 21 Oct 07 SDP disappointed with WP's IBA comments.<br><br>Gopalan Nair<br>39737 Paseo Padre Parkway, Suite A1<br>Fremont, CA 94538, USA<br>Tel: 510 657 6107<br>Fax: 510 657 6914<br>Email: gopalnair@us-immigrationlaw.com</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I refer to the following passage:<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>She has betrayed her cause, betrayed her party, betrayed the trust of the members of the Workers Party...</strong></blockquote>Should I be thanking this individual for speaking up for me, a WP member? Should other WP members thank him too?<br><br>But yet, strange to say, I don't feel "betrayed" by Sylvia and neither do I think I have been "betrayed" by her. Nor have I heard any indication from other WP members feeling "betrayed".<br><br>In addition, I wonder since when has it been a trend for non-members of an organisation speak on behalf of members of the organisation. Perhaps I can speak on behalf of NSP or SPP from now on. Would that be freedom of speech or flutter of speech?<br><br>Regards</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Maybe he should stop and reflect on his thoughts. Firstly he wanted foreign funds to be available for local parties. Next thing you know he insulted a law firm and a lawyer here, to the extreme of releasing the contact number of that lawyer. Now he come out with so much criticisms. What does he want ? Does he want WP and SDA to go down the road of SDP ? To lose their seats and join Chee outside Istana ? Does he want to get Sylvia sued ? If he wants to be an activist then come back Singapore and stand beside Chee to make the numbers.<br><br>Lets see. Chee Siok Chin, John Tan, Chee Soon Juan, Gandhi Ambalam and rest of SDP exco got 12 people. Add in Gopalan Nair, Yap Keng Ho got 14. Just 9986 short of the 10,000 they pleading for.<br><br>I think they should just stick to activism and stay out of politics for the greater good.</div>

After that, US, not the dissidents who called for its help, control the cards. Until today, US has refused to pull out of Iraq.<br><br>Secondly, at this point of time, no serious gathering of the international community, and I mean international governments not NGOs, appear to be interested in changing the Singapore regime.<br><br>Thirdly, most countries regime fall through the people, not foreign interference. Indonesians forced Suharto to retire. Fillipinos forced Marcos out. Singaporeans do not appear to want to do that. They exercise their vote.<br><br>While there is a view that PAP can't be displaced through the ballot and this may or may not be the case, Mexico, Japan and Taiwan are examples. The 130-year ruling PRI was voted out in favour of PAN led by Vicente Fox. The once-dominant LDP once lost the government to DPJ.

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree with some of Nair's views.  But while he might actually have an idea there, it's pretty obvious that a majority of us Singaporeans today are not ready for the "CSJ" way of doing things (aka protests).  Most of us are fearful of being associated with these ideas.  We'd rather pretend not to share any of his opinions (not that we have none).  We fear being associated with Chee, with his "strange" method of doing things, we shut his ideas out, and we ridicule him to distance ourselves from him.  "Know your rights, take action" are fast replacing "welfare" as the new dirty words.<br><br>However despite their seemingly misguided efforts, I feel that this.. change.. that CSJ and Nair talk of is nothing to be scorned.  What I find more scornful is those who shut these figures out before even hearing them out.  Especially those who divert from the topic at hand by dishing out personal attacks under the pretext of expressing a fact-based opinion (when obviously there is none).  Any idea is an idea worth hearing out.<br><br>Singaporeans want change.  But we want minimal disruption to our daily lives ($$$).  And we want someone else to take care of it for us.<br><br>Well.  Change can happen, but only through a <strong>collective</strong> effort.  And I'm talking about a movement here (and don't go thinking along the lines of those bus riots).  But before we even get there, most of us, as <strong>individuals</strong>, must already be ready to make a real decision.  And to be ready, we need to have the confidence in ourselves, in what we can do, and in our rights.  But most of us grew up as sheep, never really believing in ourselves, never knowing our full capabilities, never knowing the options available to us.<br><br>When the foot shackles are removed from an elephant that's been chained up all its life but fed relatively well, it does not move, because it does not even realize it can.  It has never known a different way of life.  It doesn't dare venture out of its comfort zone, nor is it sure it wants to.<br><br>We Singaporeans are like that right now.  We're free to "move", but we don't even know it.. nor are we sure we want to move.  I mean, life chained up was "pretty alright", we didn't go hungry, we didn't have to worry about predators, right?   All our lives, we've relied on and allowed our government to tell us our limitations, to "babysit" us.. what do we do when we're not happy?  Complain!  "Mommy <strong><span style="font-style: italic;">do</span></strong> something!"  We are trapped by our own minds.  We don't know, don't believe, that things can be done in another way.  Yes we are spoilt citizens - but we have been neglected and not allowed to grow.  We are like children of a celebrity parent.. overlooked because we are technically spoilt and should be well provided for by our cash-strapped parents.  I mean all parents love their kids, right?  And all parents know how to take care of their kids, right?  Riiiiiight..... so are these "spoilt" celebrity kids not worthy of help and sympathy?<br><br>The way I see it, the status quo will remain as long as our people continue to allow ourselves to let "mommy" provide for us as if we were children.. to be bound by our current social limitations.. by our own mindsets.. we can curse and swear at our social limitations and circumstances, but only when we develop our own ideas, unique personas, passions, and educate ourselves on the real options available to us - not just on hearsay - will we become confident enough to make a conscious decision.  To tell "mommy" - enough, we are grown up and we want to be treated accordingly.<br><br>Right now, we're all confused and apathetic, "let them do what they want, I can't do anything, I don't want to get in trouble".  Our young mull with much angst over the depressing prospect of graduating from cram school just to become another money-making robot in a broken dream factory.  Our adults are obsessed with fighting off various issues, big and small, that just keep coming.  We question, but once a govt official makes a move, we all cower in fear!  Nair perceives that the govt is more afraid of us than we are of them.  I concur.  The fear, the limitations.. we should start to think how much of it is based on fact and how much on fear (superstition).<br><br><strong><span style="color: blue;">What LazerLord mentioned below, imho, is pretty much the 1st step to take if real change and real improvement is what we want.  Educating yourself.  And others.  Knowing your rights.  </span></strong><br><br>To the reader.  Will you continue playing the victim to a select few, creating your own self-fulfilling prophecies by retaining the false belief that we haven't the power to escape our fates?<br><br>Or will you educate yourself?  And allow yourself to grow?<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by LazerLordz:</div><div class="quote_body">Educate your friends and family members, print out the Constitution and share it in class if you are a GP teacher.<br><br>We can't afford to have a nation that doesn't know the rights it is granted. </div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Singapore is being destroyed by the Lee Administration by authoritarian rule </strong><br><br>Ladies and Gentlemen,<br><br>I donÂ’t think I am too different from most other people who have a decent amount of education. As education enables people to think, with ideas and opinions beneficial to society; they would want to contribute politically and socially for the betterment of their society; engage in matters of national interest, public debate and controversy. In other words a desire to put their education to good use to make their country a better place. That is what an education is for.<br><br>Unfortunately for such people with an education; Singapore is a very distasteful place to live in. Distasteful, because Lee Kuan Yew and his family wish to selfishly hold on to power. Therefore, they find the need to suppress any opinion in the country which threatens their hold on power; even if that contrary opinion was in Singapore's best interests. For Lee Kuan Yew and his family that rule Singapore, all that matters is their personal interests, even if Singapore is destroyed.<br><br>And this is what Lee Kuan Yew is doing. Deliberately destroying Singapore.<br><br>Education as we know is empowering. With education, one knows that with or without Lee Kuan Yew, you can survive. Your skills will be accepted in any country in the world, and especially because you speak English. Throughout the world from Afghanistan to Zimbabwe, the world atlas alphabet, an educated person knows that he is welcome anywhere where his skills are needed.<br><br>And education tells us that first world countries are democratic. Where each person is respected. Where each voice counts. Where one can advance by one's ability; and not by one's sycophancy like the case in dictatorial regimes; North Korea where one advances with the patronage of Kim Jong Il, in Burma with the patronage of General Than Swe and in Singapore with the patronage of Lee Kuan Yew. Those who succeed in Singapore with Lee's support live as slaves. You are paid huge salaries to parrot LeeÂ’s orders.<br><br>On the other hand, in first world democratic countries, one advances because one has skills and abilities which are in demand, not because George Bush likes them.<br><br>Many Singaporeans presently view SingaporeÂ’s support, assistance and succor for the brutal Burmese military junta totally unacceptable. They are aware of massive Singapore investments in Burma. They are aware that Singapore sells arms to them. They are aware that it is these very weapons which have been used to shoot at innocent protestors. Yet they can do nothing to compel Lee Kuan Yew and his government to account for their actions.<br><br>In the case of Dr. Chee Soon Juan who felt the need to publicly protest, Lee Kuan Yew's answer is to arrest, prosecute and imprison him. The government is not open to contrary opinion. Educated people find this life of submission intolerable. Therefore they pack their bags and leave for more civilized counties where their opinions matter.<br><br>Take the fact that Singapore media is owned and controlled by the Lee family. The fact that news in Singapore is censored. The fact that there is no free flow of opinion. One is unable to read the Far Eastern Review because it is banned. You are compelled to read the government propaganda churned out in the government printing presses. An educated man would want to know the truth. Not propaganda. It is not necessary; indeed distasteful and shameful to humbly accept only propaganda. So they leave for countries where they can get the truth. They go to the UK the USA Britain Australia and New Zealand.<br><br>The daily working lives of Singapore citizens; if they are educated, is distressing and shameful. A civil servant, no matter how much he personally hates the dictatorial regime of Lee Kuan Yew, has to openly praise the administration in public; lest some government informer informs on him to his superiors, resulting in his career being jeopardized. As he needs the job and the income, he openly praises the government; yet when he goes home to his family he curses the government to high Heaven. In other words; for survival, he has to be a disgusting chameleon, living a double life.<br><br>I can take a bet with you that every civil servant, every government lawyer, every worker in government controlled companies, every taxi driver and almost everyone detests Lee Kuan Yew and authoritarian government. Yet they feel they have no choice but to go along with whatever is told to them, because there is nothing else they could do the change the system. They are aware that in Singapore Lee decides what next; and the people just go along with the flow. They feel helpless. They have no choice.<br><br>Those in high positions, do it for the money. They are prepared, for the money to trumpet the governmentÂ’s position, even if they personally find doing what they do distasteful and shameful. A very unsatisfactory situation; not only for them, but for the future of Singapore. You have an entire country of reluctant workers.<br><br>This sort of government where it is Lee's laws and nothing else; makes educated people very uncomfortable in Singapore. They are not prepared to live like slaves, because they need not. They can go anywhere in the world they want.<br><br>So, the educated leave. They leave in droves. They leave Singapore as I write this blog. There is an ongoing brain drain. This is damaging for Singapore. Singapore needs their educated. But Lee, because of his arrogance, forces them to leave. To replace them, Singapore tries to bring in foreigners to take their places. But their places are not being filled. A highly educated Singapore doctor who goes to Canada is being replaced by a Chinese sausage maker from Hunan who does not even speak English. A skilled native Singaporean born lawyer, who emigrates to Melbourne, is being replaced by a Chinese cook from Guangdong China.<br><br>Both the Hunan sausage maker and the Guangdong cook speak only Chinese. No English at all. Before coming to Singapore, they used to live in abject poverty in China. Needless to say, neither of them have read Treasure Island by Robert Louis Stevenson and neither have they ever heard of such a thing as the Constitution of Singapore. They were almost slaves in China. They have come to Singapore to be Lee's slaves. They are happy that way. Both of them will never see the need to challenge the rule of Lee Kuan Yew. Lee Kuan Yew is happy to have them. But people like them, with very little education or ability are destroying Singapore. Not making Singapore great.<br><br>The ones who can make Singapore great are the ones Lee Kuan Yew is chasing from the island. Lee's actions are deliberately causing this massive and continuing brain drain. And this brain drain is destroying Singapore. And Lee is responsible for it.<br><br>Lee is aware of this serious brain drain from Singapore. He is aware that those coming into Singapore from the nearby third world Asian countries cannot match the skills and abilities of Singaporeans who are leaving. He is aware that SingaporeÂ’s main asset is it's people, and without good and capable people, Singapore is slowly declining to become another Asian backwater. He is aware that he is destroying Singapore.<br><br>That is why we see him going to various Australian, US and Canadian cities, speaking to overseas Singaporeans and begging that they return to Singapore. He has set up, at public expense organizations such as the Singapore Overseas Unit trying to make Singaporeans return. But we have seen that all his efforts have come to zero. The fact is that educated people have more capability and self respect and they need not return to Singapore island to be told by Lee Kuan Yew what to think and how they should live their lives.<br><br>The sooner he realizes this fact the better.<br><br>Gopalan Nair<br><br><a href="http://singaporedissident.blogspot.com/2007/10/singapore-is-being-destroyed-by-lee.html" rel="nofollow">http://singaporedissident.blogspot.com/2007/10/singapore-is-being-destroyed-by-lee.html</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Singapore's Lee Kuan Yew family, their cronies and high level foreign talent enjoy prosperity. Not ordinary Singaporeans.</strong><br><br>Ladies and Gentlemen,<br><br>The state owned and controlled Singapore newspaper the Straits Times, just as all the other Singapore newspapers are; reports with pride the A380 Singapore Airlines aircraft made its first flight from Singapore to Sydney. Great. Should Singaporeans now go home and celebrate. Should they now open their champagne bottles; provided they can afford one? Or should they be asking what do they get out of it all? Nothing!<br><br>Don't forget, Lee Kuan Yew got Singapore Airlines with your money paid for through your CPF, by the ordinary Singaporeans; the taxi driver, the plumber and the hawker. Hard earned money, which Lee forcefully takes; I say forcefully, because it is illegal not to pay the government CPF and other forms of taxation such as HDB payments. Its your money which he uses to run his Singapore Airlines.<br><br>But who actually benefits from the success of the Airline which by the way is being run with your money? Not you, let me be clear. Not the average Singaporean worker. Here is who benefits.<br><br>First the directors of the airline who are comprised of Lee family members and his cronies and friends. Lee Kuan Yew and personal family members who pay themselves huge chunks of solid cash as directorship fees and salaries and dividends. Next come the high level executives, Lee Kuan Yew cronies, with mind boggling salaries which they take at will. Next comes the pilots, half or more of whom are foreigners, Australian, New Zealand, British and other nationalities, experienced pilots each with several thousand hours flight time. The other half are Singapore pilots. These you could say enjoy the benefits of the success of the world airline.<br><br>The vast majority of Singaporean employees, the ramp attendants, the cargo handlers, the traffic marshals, the cleaners and the grease monkeys do not. It does not matter how much the airline makes, these jobs will continue to be minimum wage jobs. And if the Singaporean is so stupid as to complain; the job will be taken away from him and immediately given to a recently arrived Chinese national from Harbin, who by the way is quite prepared to work for the peanuts!<br><br>So my dear Singaporean, don't let Lee Kuan Yew, deceive you as he appears very successful in doing. He has no plans to share the success of Singapore Inc with any one of you. He is happy that you are around to work and contribute your CPF monies to him, because he needs money. With your money, he will run Singapore Airlines intent on making profits. But the profits are not intended for you, mind you. He wants more and more money; and he needs you to be around to enable it.<br><br>And in doing this, in order to successfully deceive you; he has the help of his propaganda machine, the Straits Times, which will report on a daily basis to you that the company has done brilliantly, in Singapore, in London and all over the world; and they do this in the hope that you will feel a sense of gratification because of your airline's success. Please return to reality from somnolence, from your daydream and reverie. You are sleepwalking my friends. Realise that you are being deceived.<br><br>The truth of the matter is that the average Singaporean is worse off today than he was 10 years ago. There are many reports published on this. A380 may have made its maiden flight. But you are not on that aircraft. You may have a chance to clean it. But not more than that.<br><br>Take it from me. There is nothing in it for you. As for you, Lee Kuan Yew has one plan and it is not encouraging. He expects you to work at your job as a cargo handler until you drop dead, literally; as he has made it clear that he will not permit you to retire nor withdraw your CPF savings. You will work until you die. I am sorry but that is the plan. I have only tears for you.<br><br>It is the same with everything else in the country that they flaunt. The Port of Singapore Authority, the Formula I, Tumasek Holdings with assets all over the world, GIC trading with your money in Timbuktu, Republic of Mali? I do not know where, but they are all over the world. Singapore Inc International. All this buzz and activity carried out with the hard earned moneys of local Singaporeans CPF contributions, which Lee uses at his pleasure with totally no accountability. Not to you, not to me, not the world, not to anyone. He does whatever he wants, with your money. And what happens to the profits? Well, you know the answer. He and his family and friends eat that money. Nothing goes to you. As for you, just shut up, stop complaining and work until you drop dead.<br><br>Ordinary Singaporeans should know by now that they have no say in how their country is run. No say in where their money is going. No right to demand a share of the profits which is rightfully theirs, since it is their money that made these investments possible in the first place.<br><br>Making new malls, building new roads and building a new symphony orchestra will not make the average man feel any better because he cannot eat the new roads or the mall. Just looking at it gives him no satisfaction.<br><br>So next time my friend the average Singaporean reads in the state controlled local newspaper that Tumasek Holdings has made a billion dollars in profits, they should ask what is there in it for them? And if they do not get a satisfactory answer, it is about time to join Dr. Chee in his next protest and demand<br><br>"All right my boy, Lee Kuan Yew, congratulations. Now where is the bacon?"<br><br>as the huge Russian bear had asked Boris Yeltsin when he won the Russian elections; the bear balancing the diminutive Yeltsin in the palm of his hand; ready to be crushed at any moment.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The shameful 2 faced lives that Singaporeans lead.</strong><br><br>Ladies and Gentlemen,<br><br>I was in Singapore from Nov 1 to Nov 9. East coast Malaya from Nov 9 to 12. Nov 12 travel from Wakaf Bahru/ Tumpat Thai border to Singapore on Malayan Railway Eastern Line. Departed Singapore 5.40 pm Changi, SQ2 Nov 13. The following my observations.<br><br>Every morning Singapore I wake up and turn on TV Channel News Asia. Steven Chia and a diminutive woman who keeps nodding her head at regular intervals, almost to outdo TV's "noddy the horse" read the news followed by Jennifer Alejandro to read the business news. Alejandro on her part introduces herself phonetically as Olihandro for some reason when it should be pronounced Alejandro as spelt (J being pronounced as H in Spanish, unlike in Portuguese were it is the same as in English). Alejandro is simply Alexander in English.<br><br>The point is this. These TV newsreaders unlike their other Singaporean citizens, do actually speak English and not Singlish. Second they appear to have an education commensurate to their reading the news. Third they appear to be very westernized with westernized mannerisms, effusing confidence replete with the jokes and the small talk which is expected of any newsreader in any western country.<br><br>But one thing makes them very different from any western newsreader. The fact that they are quite prepared to surrender their destinies to the whims of a despot. Any western newsreader being unwilling to do.<br><br>It strikes me as odd, very odd, that such apparently educated self confident young men and women, such as these western style newsreaders would be quite prepared to act their parts in a so called first world country, yet are prepared to live, presumably out of fear, in circumstances where they have no rights at all, and all rights belong only to the Lee family.<br><br>It is not only them. The greatly experienced SIA pilots on all the legs to Singapore and back only spoke an atrocious form of English, as we know Singlish, which is in fact English with a Hokkien accent. I am quite sure that listening to them, any English speaker from any part of the English speaking world, hearing it for the first time, would be hard-pressed in being convinced that it is actually English. But what was even more astonishing was the fact that all of them had an English name before their Chinese name, like Robert Chong and so forth. One will wonder why these people are so determined to have English names when they have so much difficulty in speaking it. Why are they so desperately trying to hide their Asian identity? And if they are so ashamed to be Chinese, should they not try a little harder in trying to speak English for a change.<br><br>The taxi driver from Changi Airport to my hotel had many complaints. Not enough money. Taxi company charging too much. Difficult to survive. To my question why he did not do anything about it, his answer was that it was useless. He did not wish to openly protest as the government will retaliate and cause him and his family harm. He was afraid. He cannot do anything to change his bleak prospects. He is resigned to the fate the government has for him. A pathetic case, just as the sad cases of each and every Singaporeans that we meet. A country consumed in fear.<br><br>Dying for good Indian food, I head for Tekka Market. There I meet an Indian foreign talent, a civil engineer. He is a Singapore Permanent Resident. He lives alone in Singapore. His wife and children live in India. He has been in Singapore for 6 years. He is not interested in being a Singapore citizen. As too many Indian students are going into software engineering, there is a shortage of civil engineers in India, he claims. He claims he can make as much money now in India as in Singapore. He told me he cares 2 hoots for Singapore. He will go anywhere in the world where he can make money. Then he will go home to India. He is Indian, he reminded me.<br><br>At the market I meet up with Uncle Yap. He paints an even grimmer picture of Singapore. He says the government does not pay CPF because they have run out of money. This is evident in their laying off many workers in government departments. And these, even the highly educated ones, according to Uncle Yap, end up as security guards and taxi drivers. He even said that there was a PhD driving a taxi around. The foreign talent policy, according to him is deliberately carried on by the government to suppress the wages of Singaporeans to remain competitive. If true, very distressing news for all Singaporeans.<br><br>A friend of mine, Jagir Singh Towana. Ex police officer. Spent entire career in the Singapore Police Force. After retirement, one would have expected him to live in comfort and leisure. No not so. Despite ailing health, he has had a heart bypass operation, he has no choice but to drive a Mercedes Benz taxi as a relief driver to the licensee. This is another example of the dark side of the Lee Kuan Yew's first world country.<br><br>Another old friend Gurunathan is busy running around as a real estate broker. He claims he has no time to see me as before. He has to run around making money to pay for his HDB flat. According to him, the HDB did not care whether you had food. Their flat must be paid for first! So even though he retired from Telecoms many years ago, despite every muscle and limb hurting, if indeed it did, the man has to still run around the length and breath of the island, hoping to make a deal to pay for his flat and food on the table.<br><br>We have Bala and Thanabal, the former in his 60th year, and the latter 57. Both have all sorts of ailments. Bala has severe diabetics, suffered a stroke and now has a liver condition. Thanabal a lifetime smoker has had a "balloon" medical procedure in his heart. Both are ailing. Yet both, with all their strength have to work. This Lee Kuan Yew's first world country is not prepared to lend them a hand.<br><br>Yet neither Bala, Thanabal nor Gurunathan would dare to even mention the word "protest". They are terrified to even mention the word. Terrified at what Lee Kuan Yew would do to them if they even so much so as raised a whimper. This is the example of Lee Kuan Yew's first world citizens in his first world country.<br><br>I spoke to my friend Nazir Mohammed Khan. He is the grandson of carpet dealer Amir and Sons along Orchard Road. This man had a lot to say in complaints. He had stories like how Lee Kuan Yew and his family forced the then owners of Goodwood Hotel to sell it to them and other interesting pieces of information; whether true or not only God knows. But in the end, he will refuse to do anything even remotely of registering his complaints in the open. On a fear register of 1 to 10, you could consider him nine. Now since he knows that I write this blog, he has refused to meet me at all!<br><br>I saw my friend Sambasivam of MediaCorps Tamil Section. He was my old friend. Same complaints as usual of the government censoring the media. But as expected he is not prepared to do anything about it. Again, the all encompassing fear.<br><br>I sometimes find it hard to accept the fact that in a country with such an educated population, why do they not realize, as everyone can see, that if sufficient numbers show their dissatisfaction, the magic words being sufficient numbers, the government is powerless to punish everyone. And it is not too hard to galvanize sufficient numbers. Surely this is possible.<br><br>But as to why they do not see what I can see, is a problem that beats me. Especially why Mr. Steven Chia, the Channel NewsAsia TV newsreader, that outspoken, classy, sophisticated Western educated confident young man wishes to live his life in submission beats me.<br><br>And on the whole, the average Singaporean appeared to be classic Kaisu characters. Greedy, selfish, money driven, generally angry and impatient. A vast contrast to the people of Kota Bahru...<br><br><a href="http://singaporedissident.blogspot.com/2007/11/shameful-2-faced-lives-that.html" rel="nofollow">http://singaporedissident.blogspot.com/2007/11/shameful-2-faced-lives-that.html</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Singapore. It is impossible to change the government through national elections.</strong><br><br>Ladies and Gentlemen,<br><br>Anyone with a pair of eyes, ears and a functioning head on his shoulders should have realized this much in Singapore Island. That it is impossible to change the government through conventional channel of elections. And as proof of the utter corruption of the Singapore administration responsible for this unacceptable state of affairs is the glaring and obvious Dr. Chee Soon Juan and Mr. JB Jeyaretnam. One need not go further than that. But I will anyway, starting with Dr. Chee Soon Juan and Mr. JB Jeyaretnam.<br><br>Each and every honest Singaporean will agree; honest ones that is; that the bankrupting of Dr. Chee and Mr. Jeyaretnam by Lee Kuan Yew, defaming them at will in the state controlled papers, the Straits Times, repeatedly calling them liars and cheats and dishonest persons, was entirely without justification. Anyone with any honesty will agree with this statement. We all know that neither of them was guilty of any defamation of any sort against anyone; that the defamation actions against them were politically motivated and carried out by a corrupt judiciary; their being made bankrupt was totally unjustified and calculated for one purpose and one purpose alone, that is, to disqualify them from standing for elections.<br><br>We also know that both of them, Dr. Chee and JB Jeyaretnam; are the 2 most eminent and capable of politicians; responsible honest loyal sincere and intelligent among Singaporeans; who most deserve to be in Parliament; who are best suited to protect Singaporeans interests. Yet without any shame; knowing full well that each and every Singaporean considers their disqualification totally unacceptable, indeed ridiculous; yet the Lee Kuan Yew Administration goes ahead and does what everyone can see is nothing short of outrageous. Lee makes them bankrupt and disqualified from Parliamentary elections.<br><br>This alone shows that this Administration will not stop short of taking even the most unacceptable action to remain in power. With this fact well known, any Singaporean should know that it is impossible to remove this Lee Kuan Yew Administration from power, as they are capable of any and all illegality to remain in power.<br><br>Although not necessary, I will point out even more reasons why the opposition should forget here and now, winning Parliamentary elections and forming the government.<br><br>In order for free and fair elections, one has to have an independent media, totally lacking in Singapore. All media in Singapore is owned and controlled by the Singapore government. It is furthermore an offence to print and distribute newsprint without a permit; and just in case you are minded to apply for it, the advice should be to forget it, since it will not be granted.<br><br>The state owned and controlled media will repeatedly and with heightened intensity just before any general election, defame all opposition politicians, even threatening them with defamation suits. This will frighten off any possible opposition political candidate from running; and every citizen from voting for any opposition candidate.<br><br>Electioneering system is weighted against the opposition. The few days that is permitted for electioneering is too short favoring the Lee Kuan Yew party since they can plan it years ahead.<br><br>It is impossible for opposition politicians to speak freely at rallies since there is the constant fear of defamation actions; as what happened to Tang Lian Hong in 1997 elections.<br><br>The judiciary is corrupt and beholden to the Lee Government. This prevents any honest and capable politician from standing at elections since he knows that he may, the very next minute, be bankrupted by Lee Kuan Yew's judges who willingly do his bidding.<br><br>And I can go on but it is not necessary. As for Hougang and Potong Pasir, these wards will continue to remain under the opposition or pseudo opposition to be more correct. Lee Kuan Yew prefers these 2 politicians to continue in Parliament as they serve to paint a good face on the PAP for the rest of the world to see; since they can say that it is not true to call Singapore a one party state. At the same time Lee is confident, by the past actions of these 2 politicians, that they are really not interested in challenging the PAP. Hougang and Potong Pasir are therefore really not examples for anyone to use in arguing that Singapore has a fair election system.<br><br>What I say is this. First the people of Hougang and Potong Pasir should stop relying on these opposition political parties and do what is right. They should not follow laws that they know to be unjust. These laws such as the 5 person protest law should be broken. If you do it in numbers, Lee Kuan Yew is powerless to do anything. The newspapers licensing law should be broken as being without any rational basis. The societies act should be broken because of the same. The people should break the house to house street collections act and the political donations act and solicit for moneys locally and worldwide for the same. When defamation suits are filed, they should be just ignored and not given any co-operation, leaving the despot to do whatever he wants.<br><br>By doing these things and getting away with them, Singaporeans empower themselves. And when you empower yourselves, Lee will have to take you seriously. And when he does that, is when Singaporeans will ever manage to succeed through the ballot box.<br><br>Until and unless these things happen, Lee Kuan Yew will continue to treat each one of Singapore citizens, nothing more than a nuisance. Your views will continue to be ignored and you will forever remain in Singapore, nothing more than slaves.<br><br>There are a few free men and women in Singapore. The most notable of them are Mr. JB Jeyaretnam and Dr. Chee Soon Juan. I too am a free man living in California, Gopalan Nair of Fremont California, USA.<br><br>Gopalan Nair<br><br><a href="http://singaporedissident.blogspot.com/2007/11/singapore-it-is-impossible-to-change.html" rel="nofollow">http://singaporedissident.blogspot.com/2007/11/singapore-it-is-impossible-to-change.html</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The one big mistake Lee Kuan Yew made. </strong><br><br>Ladies and Gentlemen,<br><br>For all Lee Kuan Yew's talk of how smart he is, and how he has "a radar in his head that can see over the horizon" and all that bombast, one thing is very clear. He could not see that his greatest error was appointing his son Prime Minister.<br><br>Lee should know that Singapore has for the last 40 years been not only a one party state but more importantly a pure and classic dictatorship. Every order, every policy, every law, every program is decided by one man alone, Mr. Lee Kuan Yew.<br><br>You have ministers, that is true. But we all know that every Minister takes his decision only after having received the nod of the supremo, Mr. Lee Kuan Yew. Comical Vivian (Dr. Vivian Balakrishnan) as I like to call him can make as many speeches as he likes. The moment he speaks beyond Mr. Lee Kuan Yew's liking, comical Vivian becomes history. Same with every other Minister. I only mentioned Comical Vivian especially since he has provided amusement in the past, like when he told schoolchildren to speak up and not be afraid. That they should speak until either "they turn into jars" or their "mouths become ajar" I do not know which but equally ridiculous as we can see! You see, none of these Ministers are permitted to have a mind of their own. They can exist as nothing more than the mere mouthpieces of one man, or else they become history.<br><br>In these circumstances let us look at the long awaited demise of this man, Lee Kuan Yew. Now please keep in mind that the entire Singapore knows only one type of government, that is, taking orders from one man. With his demise; can we expect that suddenly every one will begin to take orders and comply to the dictates of Lee Kuan Yew's son? We have read various reports that his son does not appear to instill confidence even among his own political party! Will he be able to gain the confidence of the Singaporean public?<br><br>This is where Lee Kuan Yew went terribly wrong. In his mistake in appointing his son, Prime Minister. He could have done much better in appointing someone more senior and with more experience in that position; that way perhaps, I say perhaps, the fear that they had for him would also transcend to his successor. But his son was the worst possible choice of appointment for Prime Minister. That is quite clear, in this system where all orders emanate from one man at the top.<br><br>This is what I see, if I can humbly predict the scene after his impending certain demise. The news is good. There will be crisis in the political scene. With the crisis, those Ministers would be the first to cash out the Singapore dollars into better positioned hard currencies. I think the first man to pack and leave would probably be Comical Vivian himself. With a small country, small population like Singapore, it is enough that one dishonest Comical Vivian cashes out. There will be a run on the currency. There will be a run on the people. There will be a run on the banks. There will be exodus. There will be another perestroika and instability.<br><br>But the good news is, out of the chaos will rise a phoenix of democracy free speech and expression and betterment for all.<br><br>Lee Kuan Yew will unwittingly be the cause of the fall of his son and the fall of his party which has held an illegal stranglehold on power over his people for 40 years.<br><br>To that extent, we have to thank Mr. Lee Kuan Yew.<br><br>Gopalan Nair<br><br><a href="http://singaporedissident.blogspot.com/2007/11/one-big-mistake-lee-kuan-yew-made.html" rel="nofollow">http://singaporedissident.blogspot.com/2007/11/one-big-mistake-lee-kuan-yew-made.html</a></div>
