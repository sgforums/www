              <blockquote>
              <p class="intro"><strong>A TICKING bomb for the banking sector is its off-balance sheet activities, which at last count stood at $12.9 trillion.</strong></p>
              <p>Australian
                      banks have a big exposure to derivative markets. Their total
                      shareholder value of $110 billion is dwarfed by the size of the banks'
                      collective exposure to derivative markets of $12.9 trillion.</p>
              <p>Put simply, the total derivative positions of the banks are 117
                      times as big as the banks' shareholder value. If even 1 per cent of
                      these derivatives contracts default because third parties at the other
                      end get into trouble, the whole shareholder wealth would be wiped out
                      and our banks could be broke.</p>
              <p>Given total bank assets are $2.1 trillion, it begs the question why
                      Australia's banks have exposure to $12.9 trillion of derivatives
                      positions. All banks hedge to reduce risk, but this is a big amount of
                      hedging.</p>
              <p>For example, Westpac has a face value of $1.4 trillion in
                      derivatives at September 30, 2007, compared with an equity base of $16
                      billion, which is a multiple of almost 100 times.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>oz GDP is about A$1 trillion or 1,000,000 million or 1,000 billion.</p>
              <p>US GDP is about US$14 trillion.</p>
              <p>If u are a stake holder of oz,i suggest u spend ALL the free time of</p>
              <p>next week to study  this  topic .</p>
              <p>Fannies Mae gearings is about 70.</p>

              <p>Sy Tr,pl dunt waste time.This is really a serious matter.</p>
              <p>Help your frens in Oz and tell them,Let them decide.</p>
              <p>u can quote the newspaper if u dunt want to offend them.</p>
              <p>Tell them u come across this info  .</p>
              <p>May be he want to read.</p>
              <p>or u pretend send the e mails to wrong person.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My dear fren,THis is not a drill.It is supported by official figures.</p>
              <p>Dr Doom says he worry about UK and Oz.</p>
              <p>i understand why now.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Insurers also fail</strong></span></p>
              <p>All company think they can hedge against the risks by buying insurance.</p>
              <p>The fall of AIG speaks volume for this protection also not fool</p>
              <p>proof.</p>
              <p>Oz banks,i think,also adopt similiar protections.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The points are</strong></span></p>
              <p>U can see in the past 2 weeks u have to bite the bullets,even</p>
              <p>u are very big.So,if oz banks loss in this gamble by little bit,</p>
              <p>the consequences is not one or two or 3 big banks in trouble.</p>
              <p>But the whole finance system.Possible outcome</p>
              <p>-----oz dollar will drop like stone</p>
              <p>-----share price drops fast</p>
              <p>what else?</p>
              <p>But,there is a slim chance that Oz banks may win.</p>
              <p>What is the chance?</p>
              <p>If u use $1 to do $ 117 business,it is not brave,but foolish.</p>

              <h1 class="articleheading">Singapore AIA chief resigns as surrendered policies rise (2nd Roundup)</h1>
              <p>Singapore - The Singapore chief of American International Assurance Co (AIA) resigned Thursday as surrendered policies mounted with hundreds of customers unconvinced of the insurer's soundness.</p>
              <p>Mark O'Dell - who has been trying to persuade policyholders that AIA, a unit of the troubled American International Group (AIG) Inc, could meet its obligations - was said to be joining a rival firm and a new general manager would start Friday.</p>
              <p>The company said O'Dell's decision was not related to the three days of customers withstanding long lines and sweltering heat to enter its service center. By the end of Thursday, those waiting were given numbers and told to return Friday.</p>
              <p>'Even with the AIG bailout by the US government, everything is still uncertain,' said Karen Tan, a 42-year-old woman with no intention of keeping her policies.</p>
              <p>The US Federal Reserve's 85-billion-US-dollar loan to AIG provided little solace and so many more questions in Singapore that the insurer opened a second service centre in the AIA Tower next door.</p>
              <p>AIA said 2,500 policies had been returned by customers.</p>
              <p>'Our response is to focus on serving their needs as they come in,' O'Dell said earlier. 'If they want a loan or if they want to surrender, we're going to process it as properly as we can.'</p>
              <p>Wary policyholders were also lining up in Taiwan and Hong Kong.</p>
              <p>Reassuring statements from AIA and the Monetary Authority of Singapore that the insurer could meet its obligations were on prominent display.</p>
              <p>The insurer was said to be studying the option of allowing customers who terminated their policies to reinstate them without having to pay a penalty.</p>
              <p>The Monetary Authority, the city-state's central bank, urged customers against terminating their policies, noting they could lose coverage and suffer losses.</p>
              <p>'Things might get worse, and they'll need more money,' a businessman who requested anonymity said. 'I won't take that risk.'</p>
              <p>With 4,000 agents and more than 2 million policies in force, AIA is the largest insurance company in the city-state.</p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">At that price Temasek would have suffered a loss of $17 a share - or a total loss of about US$1.48b for the 87mil shares.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Despite massive write-downs and capital injection, Merrill Lynch's outlook remains uncertain, reports Bloomberg.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">The company's equity capital position is weak relative to competitors, said Brad Hintz, a New York-based analyst at Sanford C Bernstein, reports Ambereen Choudhury.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">"With $19.9b in CDOs still frozen on the balance sheet and with counterparty risk rising on the hedges underlying these troubled positions, the potential for additional material write-downs remains a concern,” Hintz said.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">The New York-based firm's credit rating was cut last week by Moody's Investors Service to A2 from A1.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">The third-biggest US securities firm probably will report a loss of $6.57 a share this year, compared with an earlier forecast of $1.07, Hintz said.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">The revised estimate assumes the company generates no earnings in the second half.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Merrill may have to take an additional $10 billion of pre-tax write-downs related to its holdings of mortgage securities, Moody's estimates.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><strong>Huge paper losses<br><br></strong>The disposal leaves Temasek Holdings and the Government Investment Corporation (GIC) still holding substantial parts of big troubled Western banks.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Its remaining investments in UBS (Switzerland), Citigroup, Barclays and Merrill Lynch - at an original cost of US$21.88b - have declined on by some 47 percent in value.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">That is a paper loss of US$10.28b. However, Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew had said these investments were made as a long-term strategy of 30 years.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">But as the Merrill Lynch sale shows, Temasek is not inflexible about cutting losses, if things threaten to get worse.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">The political leadership has defended its investment of these sub-prime banks as “an opportunistic” foray that can happen once in a long while.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">It believes these companies will survive the crisis and emerge stronger.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Some experts believe that Temasek has made an error of judgment.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Investment guru Jim Rogers said in July he believed that US bank stocks could fall further and predicted that Singapore's state investors would lose money on Citigroup and Merrill Lynch.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">"I'm shorting investment banks on Wall Street," the successful investor said. "It grieves me to see what Singapore is doing. They are going to lose money."</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">At the Nomura Dialogue recently, Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew reported to investment mistakes, but that no one had benefited from it.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Singaporeans who want to see greater transparency in the government’s investments in troubled companies are unhappy with this vague answer to a serious problem.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">One writer said, “Should we just move on? I do not think so. The patently huge mistake is not merely the result of recklessness but rather a systemic lack of accountability in making some of our largest investments.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">“Let it be clear, the harm is terminally done. The entire reserves system must be re-examined and audited.”</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Said slohand, "I saw the interview on TV last night and felt shortchanged.</span></span></p>

              Bloomberg said that according to data that it compiles, there were no filings relating to Temasek’s stake in Merrill in the past week. It also said that the New York-based company ranks second behind Citigroup in posting the most amount of writedowns and losses triggered by a global credit contraction.
              <div>.</div>
              Last week, Merrill reported a wider-than-estimated second-quarter loss of US$4.65 billion.

              <p>I am appalled by your concern for Australia, seems like you are more interested in Australian issues than Singaporean issues. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> You can't better yourself as a person if you look outside for other's mistakes and make excuses for your own failure. To better yourself look at your own mistakes and improve on them. Perhaps this advice will give you a new impetus to look at yourself from a new perspective. Take yourself for example, through the years of posting, you still have not made any improvement in your English. A result of your looking for others mistake to put the blame on, thereby elevating yourself. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Don't worry much, I am sure the Australian Banks will do fine if they have the support of the government. ST Telemedia bought over 100% of Global Crossing in 2003, it has been making USD 300 million losses every year, yet it still managed to survive till today. So don't underestimate the prowess of government financing. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #ff0000; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><em><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Temasek</span></em></span> <span style="font-size: x-small; color: #ff0000; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><strong>Selling Merrill Lynch<br></strong>Half or total of 87m shares have been sold off at a loss, according to US recorded filings. By Seah Chiang Nee<br>Jul 24, 2008</span></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Temasek Holdings has sold off half its ill-timed investment in Merrill Lynch - or about 87m shares, according to a mutual funds report on institutional trades on US stocks.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">The online report, MFFAIRS (Mutual Fund Facts About Individual Stocks), reported it sold off 86,949,594 shares (50%), leaving a current holdings of 86,949,594 shares (50%), according to the filings made public.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">The report gave no exact date or price of the sale.<br><br>(Update: Making no reference to Mffairs reported sale, aTemasek source says its ML shareholding has remained unchanged at 86.9m since March. See accompanying story).</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Neither has there been any confirmation from Temasek, which had paid US$48 a share last year. http://www.mffais.com/newsarticles/2008-07-22/2473637-211738.html</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Last week Merrill Lynch was traded at $31.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">At that price Temasek would have suffered a loss of $17 a share - or a total loss of about US$1.48b for the 87mil shares.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Despite massive write-downs and capital injection, Merrill Lynch's outlook remains uncertain, reports Bloomberg.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">The company's equity capital position is weak relative to competitors, said Brad Hintz, a New York-based analyst at Sanford C Bernstein, reports Ambereen Choudhury.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">"With $19.9b in CDOs still frozen on the balance sheet and with counterparty risk rising on the hedges underlying these troubled positions, the potential for additional material write-downs remains a concern,” Hintz said.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">The New York-based firm's credit rating was cut last week by Moody's Investors Service to A2 from A1.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">The third-biggest US securities firm probably will report a loss of $6.57 a share this year, compared with an earlier forecast of $1.07, Hintz said.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">The revised estimate assumes the company generates no earnings in the second half.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Merrill may have to take an additional $10 billion of pre-tax write-downs related to its holdings of mortgage securities, Moody's estimates.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><strong>Huge paper losses<br><br></strong>The disposal leaves Temasek Holdings and the Government Investment Corporation (GIC) still holding substantial parts of big troubled Western banks.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Its remaining investments in UBS (Switzerland), Citigroup, Barclays and Merrill Lynch - at an original cost of US$21.88b - have declined on by some 47 percent in value.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">That is a paper loss of US$10.28b. However, Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew had said these investments were made as a long-term strategy of 30 years.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">But as the Merrill Lynch sale shows, Temasek is not inflexible about cutting losses, if things threaten to get worse.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">The political leadership has defended its investment of these sub-prime banks as “an opportunistic” foray that can happen once in a long while.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">It believes these companies will survive the crisis and emerge stronger.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Some experts believe that Temasek has made an error of judgment.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Investment guru Jim Rogers said in July he believed that US bank stocks could fall further and predicted that Singapore's state investors would lose money on Citigroup and Merrill Lynch.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">"I'm shorting investment banks on Wall Street," the successful investor said. "It grieves me to see what Singapore is doing. They are going to lose money."</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">At the Nomura Dialogue recently, Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew reported to investment mistakes, but that no one had benefited from it.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Singaporeans who want to see greater transparency in the government’s investments in troubled companies are unhappy with this vague answer to a serious problem.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">One writer said, “Should we just move on? I do not think so. The patently huge mistake is not merely the result of recklessness but rather a systemic lack of accountability in making some of our largest investments.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">“Let it be clear, the harm is terminally done. The entire reserves system must be re-examined and audited.”</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Said slohand, "I saw the interview on TV last night and felt shortchanged.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">"He brushed aside the issues with the logic that since the officers who made the decisions were not the beneficiaries in any sense of the word, such lapses are mistakes and are therefore acceptable...</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">"..The size indicates that it can only come from the very top."</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">The skies are dark but the storm has not broke yet.<br></span><strong><strong><span style="font-size: xx-small;">By Seah Chiang Nee</span></strong><br></strong></span></p>

              <p><span>SINGAPORE : The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has urged AIA policyholders not to act hastily to terminate their insurance policies, as queues formed outside AIA's offices on Tuesday, with some clients seeking to end their policies. <br><br>AIA is a subsidiary of New York-based American International Group (AIG) - one of the world's largest insurers - which has been hit by the financial meltdown. Some Singaporeans are concerned that AIG could be the next financial giant to fall after Lehman Brothers. <br><br>With regards to AIG, MAS said: "The value of these assets is not linked to AIA's or AIG's financial condition, but like all investments, their value may be affected by general market conditions." <br><br>The MAS assured the public that "AIA currently has sufficient assets in its insurance funds to meet its liabilities to policyholders". <br><br>It advised policyholders not to act hastily to terminate their insurance policies as they may suffer losses from the premature termination and lose insurance protection. <br><br>MAS explained that there are regulatory requirements, ensuring that all insurance companies maintain statutory insurance funds, including an investment-linked fund. This fund is segregated from its head office and other shareholders' funds. <br><br>Within these funds, insurance companies must maintain sufficient assets to meet all its liabilities to policyholders, which include participating policies and investment-linked policies. <br><br>MAS monitors the situation closely, and requires insurance companies in Singapore to manage their investment risks carefully. <br><br>The MAS will continue to monitor the financial health of AIA. It added that a Policy Owners Protection Fund could also be set up, if necessary. <br><br>Meanwhile, many policyholders waited outside AIA's office to find out if AIA will be among those that will be hit by the credit crisis in the US. A queue started since morning and some had to wait for up to four hours. <br><br>A few long-term AIA policyholders told Channel NewsAsia that they wanted to surrender their policies, despite incurring losses for premature termination. <br><br>One of them, 51-year-old Morgan Krishnan, is not taking any chances. He has decided to terminate three life insurance policies - for himself and his two sons. <br><br>He said: "I have been monitoring this for a few years, and I am giving up right now... I will make some returns, I will not make any loss." <br><br>Meanwhile, another policyholder said: "I just want to cash out the policy, and I have no intention of putting my money here anymore." <br><br>Yet another said: "I contemplated surrendering it a few years ago, so I guess it's about time." <br><br>And another noted: "AIG was mentioned in those reports, so we just wanted to make sure that whatever we have is going to be safe." <br><br>However, some policy holders are optimistic and confident that the MAS has the situation under control. <br><br>AIA has about two million policies which are in force in Singapore. In a statement, AIA said it maintains separate insurance funds for all policies issued by its Singapore arm. <br><br>Despite the short-term liquidity pressures, it assured that the company has sufficient capital to meet its obligations to policyholders. - CNA/ms <br></span></p>

              <p><br>The queues have gone at the AIA customer service centre at Finlayson Green.</p>
              <p>Only a few dozen people were seen inside the customer service area.</p>
              <p>This is in part due to better crowd control measures that saw queue numbers being issued a day ahead of appointment.</p>
              <p>Policyholders who turned up today were told to return on Monday morning.</p>
              <p>But customers still fear the worst, with confidence dropping after AIA announced yesterday the resignation of its General Manager, Mark O' Dell.</p>
              <p>AIA says the departure was "in no way related to the recent developments at parent company AIG."</p>
              <p>Mr O'Dell resigned on the same day he took out a full-page newspaper advertisement to reassure AIA's customers about the company.</p>
              <p>Some customers interviewed by 938LIVE said that Mr O'Dell's resignation cancelled out some of the reassurances given by the Monetary Authority of Singapore.</p>
              <p>A policyholder who only wanted to be known as Alan, said he had cancelled his policy on Monday.</p>
              <p>Following a statement by MAS that asked policyholders not to panic and take flight, Alan had considered reinstating his policy.</p>
              <p>But Mr O'Dell's departure has left him in doubt again.</p>
              <p>"There's a bit of doubt, you see. The worry is there, especially when the top guy himself, left the company. So there's bit of worry."</p>
              <p>Eileen Chua, another client making inquiries, said the news of Mr O' Dell's leaving, has pushed her towards surrendering her policies.</p>
              <p>"Of course I panic. (There's) money concerned. If anything happens, I myself have to bear."</p>
              <p>AIA Singapore said only a fraction of policyholders, some 2,500 had cancelled, and announced measures to woo back their clients.</p>
              <p>Out of this 20 have reinstated their policies.</p>
              <p>AIA has 2.5 million policies in force in Singapore.</p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #ff0000; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>UNCERTAIN FUTURE?</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #ff0000; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>Future of Singapore</strong><br>This is a subject of rising concern despite the media's glowing employment figures. By Derek Wee <br>Oct 12, 2006</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">When I read the Straits Times article (dated 24 Sep) on PM Lee calling the young to be committed and make a difference to Singapore, I have so much thought about the issue.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">I am 35 years old, graduated from University and gainfully employed in a multinational company. But I cannot help but feel insecure over the future of Singapore. Lets face it, it's not uncommon to hear, "when you are above 40, you are over the hill". </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The government has been stressing on re-training, skills upgrading and re-adapt. The fact is, no matter how well qualified or adaptable one is, once you hit the magical 40, employers will say, "you are simply too old".</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">We have been focusing our resources and problem solving on low unskilled labour. But in reality, our managerial positions and skilled labour force are actually fast losing its competitiveness. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">I travel around the region frequently for the past 10 years. It didn't take me long to realise how far our neighbours have come over the past decade. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">They have quality skilled workers, and are less expensive. When I work with them, their analytical skills are equally good, if not better than us.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">It's not new anymore. Taxi drivers are fast becoming "too early to retire, too old to work" segment of the society. I like to talk to taxi drivers whenever I am heading for the airport. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">There was this driver. Eloquent and well read. He was an export manager for 12 years with an MNC. Retrenched at 40 years old. He had been searching for a job since his retrenchment. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Although he was willing to lower his pay expectations, employers were not willing to lower their prejudice. He was deemed too old. I wouldn't be surprised if we have another No. 1; having the most highly educated taxi drivers in the world.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">On PM Lee calling the young to be committed and make a difference. Look around us. How dedicated can we be to Singapore when we can visualise what's in store for us after we turned 40? Then again, how committed are employers to us? But we can't blame them. They have bottom lines &amp; shareholders' gain to answer to. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Onus is really on the government to revamp the society. A society that is not a pressure cooker. A society that does not mirror so perfectly, what survival of the fittest is. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">But a society, where it's people can be committed, do their best and not having to fear whether they will still wake up employed tomorrow. Sadly, Singapore does not offer such luxuries and security anymore.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">On the issue of babies. The government encourages us to pro-create. The next generation is essential in sustaining our competitive edge. Then again, the current market condition is such that our future has become uncertain. There is no more joy in having babies anymore; they have become more of a liability. It's really a chicken and egg issue.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Many of my peers, bright and well educated have packed up and left. It's what MM Goh called "quitters". It's sad but true, Singapore no longer is a place where one can hope to work hard their lives and retire graciously. It's really the push factor. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">A future is something we sweat it out, build and call our own. Unfortunately, people like me, mid 30's going on 40's, staying put by choice or otherwise, we can't help but feel what lies ahead is really a gamble. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">To PM Lee and the Ministers, we are on a different platform. Until you truly understand our insecurity, the future of Singapore to me remains a question mark.<br><em>(SPH rejected this letter - From: LocalSin) </em></span></p>

You write VERY WELL, but I´m surprised reading it, I didn´t know it was so difficult for you to work here when you are 40. In Europe to be in your 40´s mean to be in the perfect age - for business, for teaching, for EVERYTHING… also 50´s coz your experience!<br>Well, you can always have the possibility of moving, right? Although I don´t think a company would tell you to leave if you are doing good. AND YOU LOVE YOUR COUNTRY, YES? So… fight for being the best in your company and you´ll have the support of all your bosses. You are a good writer…<br>(from Spain) </span></p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>Anonymous said, </strong><br>Not only are babies a liability, but any thinking parent would be concerned about putting their kids through the same shitty system and let them suffer the same fate in the future.<br>The pink IC isn't worth much any more. It's sad. It didn't have to be that way. Many people are voting with their feet. The government is only too pleased when it happens - more cheap foreign workers can be imported as replacements. Notice employment stats use the term 'residents' instead of 'citizens', and 'residents' includes the PRs and even certain categories of work visa holders. Simply amazing. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>Anonymous said... </strong><br>I am just over 50. I lost my job arround 50. There is no job available for the last few years searching despite my extensive experience/qualification. Some recruiters even told me I should retire and asked why should I bother to find a job. When I was around 30/40, I was always headhunted for well-paid jobs. But, now there is hardly any call from headhunters. Most companies do not respond to your write-in for job. It seems my skill/experience was highly sought in past years whereas it has suddenly become useless in recent years. Why? If you are still in your 30s or 40s, plan for your future NOW! It may be too late when you are at 50s. Migrating to Europe may be an option according to our friend in spain. Cheers </span></p>

And the implication of this trend is not lost on the young. Already we are seeing rising trends where people just want to make their pot of gold as fast as possible, and by any means necessary. The hit and run mentality, no more morals and ethics. This country treats its people like batteries with short lifespan. Use em, squeeze em and chuck em! </span></p>

              </span></span></p><p>Two groups of people in Singapore have been left fretting over the demise of investment bank Lehman Brothers.</p>
              <p>First, its staff of about 270 based at Suntec City who, industry sources say, should learn of their future today once it had been communicated from the bank's US headquarters overnight.</p>
              <p>The second are investors who bought Lehman products and will now be wondering if they can get their money back.</p>
              <p>Lehman, the fourth largest US investment bank, filed for bankruptcy protection on Monday, finally falling to the United States' sub-prime mortgage crisis.</p>
              <p>When The Straits Times visited the bank's Singapore office Monday, security was tight and the media were refused access by Lehman.</p>
              <p>But a canvass of the cigarette-smoking crowd at Suntec Tower Five painted a picture of gloom and uncertainty.</p>
              <p>'We're prepared for the worst,' said one of Lehman's Singapore-based employees. 'You can imagine the gloom around the office.'</p>
              <p>'It's a really bad time for us, especially when we don't really know what's going to happen to us here,' explained another who also declined to give his name.</p>
              <p>'All we are authorised to say now is that it's still business as usual upstairs,' added a third staff member before stubbing out his cigarette and walking away.</p>
              <p>'I just returned from a holiday and have no clue what's going to happen,' said another staff member who was seen leaving Tower Five with a trolley bag.</p>
              <p>'But I guess I may now have to start looking for a new job - got any vacancies at The Straits Times?' he quipped.</p>
              <p>Judging from the fact that a headhunter from recruitment firm Robert Walters was also spotted in the same lobby, at least some staff may find other work soon.</p>
              <p>But when approached, the headhunter reluctantly said that she was just there for 'a meeting'.</p>
              <p>Local banks here also could not shed more light at press time - most preferring to adopt a wait and see attitude.</p>
              <p>An OCBC spokesman said the bank currently has no updates, but would be 'closely monitoring developments in the US and global financial markets'.</p>
              <p>United Overseas Bank also said it is waiting for further clarification from 'the relevant parties' before it can assess the implications of Lehman's fall.</p>
              <p>But its spokesperson said the bank's exposure to Lehman remains 'very small and insignificant'.</p>
              <p>Although Singapore's largest lender DBS Group Holdings also said its direct exposure to Lehman is 'insignificant', it could not say the same for some of the investment products it used to distribute.</p>
              <p>'On the retail front, some investment products DBS sold in the past, such as High Notes 2 and High Notes 5, have Lehman exposure,' said a DBS spokesperson.</p>
              <p>Other small retail investors holding Lehman's products such as its Minibond series should also brace themselves for a big hit on their wallets, sources say.</p>
              <p>Lehman's Minibond series are structured products widely held by retail investors in Singapore because of its previously high regular payment rate of about 4.8 per cent. But according to industry experts, a Lehman default would result in investors getting back only about 30 US cents for every US$1 invested.</p>

              <div id="newsContent" class="newsContent">
              <p>(BEIJING, August 16) -- <span class="link"><a href="http://results.beijing2008.cn/WRM/ENG/BIO/NOC/SIN.shtml"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #004aaf;">Singapore</span></span></a></span>'s success against the <span class="link"><a href="http://results.beijing2008.cn/WRM/ENG/INF/GL/92A/KOR_T.shtml"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #004aaf;">Republic of Korea</span></span></a></span> in a titanic semifinal struggle that went the maximum five matches, guarantees the tiny city state its first <span class="link"><a href="http://en.beijing2008.cn/spirit/beijing2008/graphic/n214070893.shtml"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #004aaf;">Olympic medal</span></span></a></span> in almost 50 years and will undoubtedly make their lead player, Chinese born Li Jia Wei, the toast of the town.</p>
              <p>Li is already a hero in Singapore after her fourth place finish at the Athens 2004 Olympic Games. If that achievement brought her celebrity status, the team's guaranteed silver must surely have the paddlers looking forward to the feting they will receive on their return.</p>
              <p>The players cannot be looking too far ahead, as they still have work to do in Beijing. It would likely be the biggest upset of the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games if the Singaporeans were to snatch gold from the Chinese team which is made up of the top three women players in the world rankings.</p>
              <p>The Women's Team gold medal contest takes place on Sunday August 17.</p>
              <p>"I feel very honored to get an Olympic medal for Singapore after 48 years of waiting", said Li Jia Wei. "We will give 100 per cent effort against <span class="link"><a href="http://results.beijing2008.cn/WRM/ENG/BIO/NOC/CHN.shtml"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #004aaf;">China</span></span></a></span> in the final but it doesn't matter whether we win or lose; for us it's already a victory, we have achieved our goal and in the final we will be under no pressure."</p>
              <p>The Team silver, or gold, will be Singapore's first Olympic medal since 1960 when Tan Howe-liang won <span class="link"><a href="http://en.beijing2008.cn/cptvenues/sports/weightlifting/index.shtml"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #004aaf;">weightlifting</span></span></a></span> silver in Rome.</p>
              <p>Li is one of more than a dozen Table <span class="link"><a href="http://en.beijing2008.cn/cptvenues/sports/tennis/index.shtml"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #004aaf;">Tennis</span></span></a></span> paddlers who are competing for countries in which they were not born. She is a Beijinger who moved to Singapore in the hope of competing internationally after failing to secure a place on the Chinese national team.</p>
              <p>At the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games eight of the 16 men's teams have at least one player not born in the country. The rate is even higher among women's teams, where 12 of 16 teams are fielding athletes who are naturalized citizens.</p>
              <p>Earlier this year the International <span class="link"><a href="http://en.beijing2008.cn/cptvenues/sports/tabletennis/index.shtml"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #004aaf;">Table Tennis</span></span></a></span> Federation passed a new 'nationality' ruling for world title events, which has yet to be adopted by the <span class="link"><a href="http://en.beijing2008.cn/spirit/movement/organization/index.shtml"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #004aaf;">International Olympic Committee</span></span></a></span>.</p>
              <p>The ITTF ruling requires players under the age of 15 to wait three years before being eligible to compete for their new country; players between 15 and 18 years of age must wait five years and players aged 18 years to 21 years must wait seven years. Players over the age of 21 at the time they emigrate will not be allowed to register to play for the adopted countries.</p>
              <p>The new rule is being 'grandfathered' in, so it will not affect players like Li who are currently registered to play for their new country. However, as these athletes retire, and if the IOC adopts the nationality rule for the London 2012 <span class="link"><a href="http://en.beijing2008.cn/en.shtml"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #004aaf;">Olympics</span></span></a></span> Games, the composition and the fortunes of many countries' teams could change dramatically.</p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Population: A redirection<br>As Singaporeans feel the over-crowdedness, Lee Kuan Yew reduces the optimum size in future to 5.5m. By Seah Chiang Nee.<br>Feb 13, 2008</span></strong> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">SIGNALLING a major redirection, Singapore’s political icon has reduced his own population projection for the future by up to 1.5 million people. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew has scaled down a projected 6.5 million population – mainly through immigration – by some 20% “to preserve a sense of comfort”. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">He now prefers an optimum size of 5 million to 5.5 million, down from the 6 million to 7 million that he wanted two years ago. Currently the population stands at 4.6 million, so expansion has only a little way to go. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">In 2005, he told a surprised nation that he foresaw a thriving global Singapore of 6 million to 7 million people by 2030. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">That would place Singapore’s size just behind major cities like New York (8.2 million) and London (7.6 million). The time span for achieving this was revised from 30 years to 40-50 years. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Lee’s climb-down is as abrupt as his idea was two years ago; none received prior discussion in Parliament. He is now obviously convinced that there is not enough space in Singapore for such large numbers. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The Minister Mentor said last Tuesday: “I have not quite been sold on the idea that we should have 6.5 million. I think there’s an optimum size for the land that we have, to preserve the open spaces and the sense of comfort.” </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Lee told a think tank seminar that he did not want to see Singapore going the way of Hong Kong – “just solid buildings, one blocking the sunlight of the other”. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The revision is more than to keep aesthetic values; it follows the adverse impact of the rapid demographic change in the past few years. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">In some areas, there is serious over-crowding, especially on the roads and in public transport, as well as universities and hospitals (a fourth is being planned), which are straining public tolerance. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">(Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong recently warned of potential friction between newcomers and locals.) </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Singaporeans are fearful of being muscled out by foreigners in their own country. Critics have accused the government of treating them better than citizens on issues such as jobs, national service and education. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Others are worried about the future of this small city-state, which has the fourth densest population in the world. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Concerned at being pushed out of their comfort zone, more Singaporeans now opt to work or settle down abroad. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The brain drain is even hitting close to his family, Lee recently said. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">His grandson Li Hongyi, who is studying economics in America on a government scholarship, recently advised his younger brother not to accept a scholarship. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The advice was apparently aimed at telling brother Hao Yi not to tie himself down by a bond to work for six years in Singapore, which is a condition of the financing. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">It implies that the son of Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong may be planning to work abroad after graduation. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The economy is also declining. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Job creation, which has always determined the rate of immigration here, is expected to slow significantly from almost 200,000 in 2007 to 60,000, a Citigroup research says. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The expected drop in employment this year is bound to slow down the number of foreign arrivals, irrespective of what the government wants. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Meanwhile, the authorities are tackling some of the public woes – packed trains and crowded roads during peak hours. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">From 7.30am-9am and 5.30pm-7.30pm some stations are so packed that commuters are left standing to wait for the second or third train before they can get on board. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">“Going to work every morning is a nightmare. It’s virtually impossible to be able to catch the first train that comes along. There are so many people in it,” said a clerical assistant, who has to start her day half an hour earlier. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Sometimes she would have to join others to make an extra trip upstream in order to make it. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">A S$20bil plan has been announced to double the length of MRT tracks from 138km to 278km by 2020 by building two more lines, one of which will run underground. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Buses are also feeling the strain of the increase in population and a major revamp is under way. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The roads are getting clogged as people withstand some hefty costs (the most expensive in the world) to buy and operate a car. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">To get motorists to use public transport, cars are taxed electronically every time they pass under some 71 gantries built across the island, the costs depending on location and time. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Recently, as the number of cars increased, more and more gantries were built and they moved from crowded highways to some residential neighbours. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">One motorist who lives in non-congested Upper Bukit Timah Road complained that one was erected not far from his house. “This means that every time I drive out of my gate I pay a fee.” </span></p>
