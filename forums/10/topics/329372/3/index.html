              <p>The west's political games with Russia:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>When
                          the US and NATO were methodically killing Serbs in the 1990ies, any
                          attempts to forecast similar developments in Russia on the basis of the
                          understanding of the scenario which materialized in Yugoslavia were
                          blocked by the Russian leadership. The official version was that the
                          troubles of the Balkan peoples were their own problems, while Russia's
                          relations with Washington and Brussels were an example of mutually
                          beneficial cooperation. The vision even survived the 1999 NATO
                          airstrikes. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>It took Georgia's aggression against Russian citizens
                          and peacekeepers in South Ossetia to finally wake Russia up after 20
                          years of sleep and to make it realize that the forces of the West are
                          playing a global geopolitical game against it.</em> </span></strong> </em></p>

              <p>It appears that the western powers since collapse of USSR  in 1992 had only one agenda towards Russia.</p>
              <p>Dismember it and neutralise it as a factor in global politics.</p>
              <p>This is similar to the political games played by Britain in the 1930s to push Germany eastwards to dismember Russia:</p>
              <p><em> </em></p>
              <p><em><em>Beijing, February 18, 1973, 2:43–7:15 p.m.<br><br>Talks between Chou En-lai, Premier of China and Dr. Henry A. Kissinger, Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs:<br><br>PM Chou: <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Originally Western Europe had hoped that Germany would go eastwards.</strong></span><br><br>Dr. Kissinger: Western Europe.<br><br>PM Chou: <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>At Munich.</strong></span><br><br>Dr. Kissinger: <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Yes, at Munich.</strong></span> Western Europe had very superficial leaders. They didn’t have the courage to pursue any policy towards a conclusion. Once they had done Munich it made no sense to fight for Poland. But that is a different issue. And I don’t blame Stalin, because from his point of view he gained himself the essential time.<br><br>PM Chou: But there was one weak point, that they were not sufficiently prepared.<br><br>Dr. Kissinger: That is right.<br><br>PM Chou: They did make preparations but they were not entirely sufficient. And in Zhukov’s memoirs he also touched upon this. Have you read this?<br><br>Dr. Kissinger: Yes. And they deployed their forces too far forward.<br><br>PM Chou: Also scattered in three directions.<br><br>Dr. Kissinger: So, but the basic point that I want to make is not to debate history but to say the lessons of both wars are that once a big war starts its consequences are unpredictable, and a country which encourages a big war in the hope that it can calculate its consequences is likely to produce a disaster for itself. The Germans had made very careful plans in World War I, and they had exercised them for 30 years, but when the war . . .<br><br>PM Chou: You mean after the Pact of Berlin?<br><br>Dr. Kissinger: World War I—1914—the Schlieffen Plan.<br><br>PM Chou: You mean after the Treaty of Berlin.<br><br>Dr. Kissinger: Oh, after 1878, yes, that’s right. But they had exercised the Schlieffen Plan every year after 1893, for 21 years, and they had calculated everything except the psychological strain on a commander under battle conditions. So they thought they were starting a 6-months war and they wound up with a 4-year war. Not one European leader in 1914, if he had known what the world would look like in 1918, would have gone to war. And nor would Hitler in 1939. Let us apply it to the current situation, these observations. If one analyzes the problem of pushing the Soviet Union toward the East, or maybe you trying to push it towards the West . . .</em></em></p>

Kissinger, Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs:<br><br>...Chairman Mao: (Pointing at Dr. Kissinger) They are uniting and the Soviet Union wants the Communist Party to get into office. I don’t like their Communist party, just like I don’t like your Communist party. I like you, but not your Communist party. (Laughter)<br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br>In the West you always historically had a policy, for example, in both World Wars you always began by pushing Germany to fight against Russia.</strong></span><br><br>Dr. Kissinger: But it is not our policy to push Russia to fight against China, because the danger to us of a war in China is as great as a war in Europe.<br><br>Chairman Mao: (Before Dr. Kissinger’s remarks are translated, he makes remarks in Chinese and counts on his fingers. Miss Tang then translates Dr. Kissinger’s remarks and after that Chairman Mao’s remarks.)<br><br>What I wanted to say is whether or not you are now pushing West Germany to make peace with Russia and then push Russia eastward. I suspect the whole of the West has such an idea, that is to push Russia eastward, mainly against us and also Japan. Also probably towards you, in the Pacific Ocean and the Indian Ocean.<br><br>Dr. Kissinger: We did not favor this policy. We preferred the German opposition party which did not pursue this policy.

              <p>Then in July 1936 the Spanish civil war began. Tory ideological dread was brought to a fine edge. The Spanish civil war could lead to a European conflict between ideological blocs; and war could provoke the spread of communist revolution or Soviet influence.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> It was better, a lot of Tories thought, to turn Germany eastward against the USSR. "Let gallant little Germany glut her fill of reds in the East...," suggested one Tory M.P. </strong></span>(Henry Channon, September 1936). Even the British prime minister, Stanley Baldwin was attracted by the idea.</p>

                  thanks for letter on the European political situation. Commenting that
                  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">a strong and growing section of Conservative opinion agreed with <span class="highlight"><span class="highlight">Tudor</span></span> that Britain should form a strong Western Alliance with France and

              <p>And by this date, certain members of the Milner Group<strong> and of the
                  British Conservative government had reached the fantastic idea that
                  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">they could kill two birds with one stone by setting Germany and Russia
                  against one another in Eastern Europe. </span></strong></p>
              <p>In this way<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> they felt that the
                  two enemies would stalemate one another</strong></span>, or that Germany would become
                  satisfied with the oil of Rumania and the wheat of the Ukraine. </p>
              <p>It
                  never occurred to anyone in a responsible position that Germany and
                  Russia might make common cause, even temporarily, against the West. 
                  Even less did it occur to them that Russia might beat Germany and thus
                  open all Central Europe to Bolshevism...</p>

              <p>Britain's agenda in the 1930s with the Nazi regime was to push it eastwards to destroy Russia.</p>
              <p>USA's agenda since end of cold war is to encircle Russia, dismember it and remove it as a rival to its global hegemony once and for all.</p>

              <p><em>...For obvious military and
                  political reasons, Washington could not admit openly that its strategic
                  focus, since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, had been the
                  dismemberment or de-construction of Russia, and gaining effective
                  control of its huge oil and gas resources, the ‘ultimate prize.’ The
                  Russian Bear still had formidable military means, however dilapidated,

                  European Union, but into the Washington-dominated NATO. By 2004 Poland,
                  the Czech Republic, Hungary, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Bulgaria,

              <p>Interesting, though I fail to see how their plan is going to work, unless you mean that by inciting Georgia to invade S.Ossetia, which they knew Russia couldn't ignore and would retaliate, and in doing so earn the displeasure of everyone in the western world, thus making it a replay of "Allies and commies" era again. With people afraid of Russia, especially with it's monopoly on natural resources, and a rather lethal military under it's command, as well as nuclear technology at it's fingertips. The world might just declare a cold war on Russia and bring it crashing down on it's knees again. Sanctions and mobilisations of military forces to the Russian border, and tough diplomatic policies  by the western world would put Russia in a tight spot, perhaps luring Russia into making a wrong step, and "Wham!" the whole world jumps at Russia...America laughs away over half way across the world without ever having had to lift a finger.</p>

              <p>Important for USA is to expand NATO to the borders of Russia.</p>
              <p>They will bring all the states in europe, one by one into NATO so as to surround Russia.</p>

              <p>Russia, China had already foreseen USA's agenda and is building up an alliance to counter USA's global hegemony.</p>
              <p>International politics in the next decade will be centered on the rivalry between these two blocs, one dominanted by USA/NATO and the other by Russia/China.</p>
              <p>My sadness is that Singapore is pro-western and not with the bloc that I support, which is the Russian/China bloc.</p>
              <p>PAP regime is with the USA bloc.</p>
              <p>This is the group that I oppose.</p>

              <p>What our dear Kuali Baba is trying to say is that neither side cares for your nation's agenda, it only cares for it's own agenda, even at the cost of sacrifising your your nation. So your theory of joining the Russian-chinese leauge in hopes of using them against the USA, thus your enemy's enemy is your friend, won't work because be it  Russia and china, or USA and NATO don't give a rats ass about Singapore's interest, so long as we don't oppose them.</p>
              <p>I understand your worries, but I don't really see how whether USA or Russia wins would help us. There is a saying "It doesn't matter if the wolf beats the bear, or the bear beats the wolf, the rabbit loses in any case.  *Grins*</p>

              <p><strong>Coming collapse of the hegemonic world</strong></p>
              <p>With the clout of China and India rising on the international arena,
                  some people in the West, who are concerned over the already fragile,
                  US-dominated unipolar world political structure or the Western
                  hegemony, have rushed to offer a variety of recipes for inter-power
                  relations in the 21st century and for the world's new power structure.</p>
              <p>These recipes include multi-polar, non-polar or collective power
                  models, a "democracy value alliance", a new trans-Atlantic union, and
                  even a joint China-US governance idea.</p>
              <p>All these concepts are in essence changed versions of the new US or
                  Western hegemonic model that proposes maintaining the world's
                  established power structure through absorbing some emerging powers. The
                  model also proposes carrying out reforms of the new power structure. In
                  all this the idea is to keep the US and Western hegemonic position
                  intact as much as possible. The new situation emerging from the very
                  beginning of the 21st century indicates that neither the US nor the
                  Western hegemony will last for ever, and there will not be a transfer
                  of the old hegemony to a new one. In the 21st century, the world will
                  see the end of not only the US-dominated hegemony, but also of the
                  hegemonic model that allows a few world powers to control global
                  affairs.</p>
              <p> The decease of the US and Western hegemony will not be caused by the
                  challenge from such rising powers as China or other countries. It will
                  be caused by the world's irreversible efforts for a hegemony-free
                  political structure. As the result of this situation, we can expect a
                  hegemony-free and harmonious world in the 21st century in which big
                  countries will fulfill their responsibilities and obligations and small
                  ones can enjoy equality, democracy and assistance from each other.</p>
              <p>In the 21st century, the United States, the protagonist of the
                  current unipolar world, will gradually evolve into a common power
                  because of accelerated efforts of many countries which will advocate an
                  end to the unipolar power pattern. Since the US invasion of Iraq in
                  2003, a "balance of power" has come into being among the major
                  countries. Despite its sole superpower status, the United States cannot
                  always succeed in solving some global issues. It is even incapable of
                  handling some domestic issues such as the subprime crisis. All these
                  transmit to the world a strong signal that the US hegemony and Western
                  dominance are now in an irreversible process of decline and final
                  disappearance.</p>
              <p>In dealing with some global issues, today's United States not only
                  needs substantial support from staunch allies, but also needs
                  understanding, participation and cooperation from other key world or
                  regional players. Sometimes, it even has to give up its leading role to
                  other big powers in finding settlements of some intractable issues.</p>
              <p>With the spirit of peace and democracy exercising strong restraint
                  within their boundaries, European countries have lost the basic driving
                  force for hegemonic wars against other countries. On the other hand,
                  economic globalization and marketization of the world since the end of
                  the Cold War have activated the urge for peace and development among a
                  number of developing countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America.
                  Especially the peaceful rise of some powers, such as China, India,
                  Russia, Brazil, Mexico and South Africa, has prompted some Western
                  countries to join the resistance to hegemonism.</p>
              <p>Some new-generation European leaders, though, still want to maintain
                  the Western hegemony with the US at its core. They want to do so by
                  advocating the "values diplomacy" and setting up the so-called
                  democracy and values alliance or by forming a new trans-Atlantic union.
                  But all these wishes will be difficult to fulfill.</p>
              <p>The emergence of some peace-promoting powers will be an irresistible
                  historical tide in the 21st century. Their rise will lay a solid
                  groundwork for the final end of the long-standing hegemonism in world
                  politics.</p>
              <p>New Delhi has generally chosen a path of peaceful development in
                  South Asia despite its position of supremacy in the sub-continent.
                  China has been even more committed to a peaceful development and always
                  condemns any use of force in solving international disputes.</p>
              <p>The strong efforts and calls for a hegemony-free world from these
                  new emerging powers and the massive populations of Asian, African and
                  Latin American countries have exerted a huge pressure on hegemonic
                  countries, prompting them to deal with others on an equal footing.</p>
              <p>The change of the world's hegemonic pattern pushed by newly emerging
                  powers serves the basic interest of the whole world, including the
                  West. It will also act as the main impulse to build a conflict-free and
                  harmonious world in the new century.</p>

              <p>Noticed that you have been quoting lots of articles to? I agree with Tenebrae that China or Russia won't really care much about Singapore. Of course, U.S isn't all its cut out to be either.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But I think Singapore supports U.S because it does things legally and through legal means. Look at the way Russia is behaving!!! Do you think they have any respect for the international law!!? Also one <strong>very important point I would like to STRESS</strong>, <strong>The U.S (Republicans) look out and watch over countries smaller than ourselves.</strong> Do you think China or Russia cares? Lets face it. Who do you think will come to Singapore aid first in the event of trouble. China or Russia? Ha ha.Ever wondered what the U.S submarine stopover in Singapore are build for?? So I hope the Republicans win the election. If the Democrats win, they will focus more on their internal affairs!</p>

              <p>No doubt starting a war is alway wrong, but then like it or not, it is  peoples who started the war. And the peoples are within that society, yes, there will be innocent, but their elder and leader dun look that way, so, too bad.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Yes the US of A is alway using legal aspect to get thing done, but when it cannot be done, they change the rules of the game and still get it done. It is the same game as Russia and China, just the US of A provide the black and white whereas Russia and china use verbal instructions. I dun see any different in US of A policies with RUssia, both want to gobble small states, states that are worth grobble up, either it had resources or oil, that is most wanted.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The US of A submarine is here only to release their shit and rubbish in singapore, nothing else except maybe drop a few nuclear radiation into our water that you and i eat our seafoods from.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I dun see USA as good as China or Russia, they are just playing Godfather to all the nations, and rule with a velvet gloved hand of nice to look from outside and damn dirty play on the inside</p>
