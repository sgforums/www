            <div class='col-md body'>This is a 1999 report on New water technology used in US. Nope. They are not ready to drink directly from reclaimed shit water, as many pro-New Water people are suggesting.<br><br>http://www.waterindustry.org/New%20Projects/drink-flush.htm<br><br>Flush with water:<br>An unusual recycling project is sure to raise eyebrows in Centre County<br>Monday, May 31, 1999<br>By Don Hopey, Post-Gazette Staff Writer<br><br>The sewage authority for five fast-growing Centre County communities and part of Penn State's main campus plans to recycle water from the toilet to the tap. It will be the first large-scale municipal project in the state to turn wastewater into drinking water. As such, it will have to suppress the public gag reflex.<br><br>Dubbed "Beneficial Reuse," the $20 million waste water recirculation project floated last month by the University Area Joint Authority was prompted by discharge restrictions into Spring Creek, a nationally famous, cold-water trout stream.<br>"Waste water is always looked at as a disposal problem, but we're treating it as a resource," said Cory Miller, authority executive director. "We're going to treat it to drinking water standards -- beyond clean -- so we can do anything with it."<br>Other locales -- Centerville, Va.; El Paso, Texas; and six California communities including San Diego and Orange County -- recycle waste water to supplement scarce drinking water supplies.<br><br>State College has plenty of drinking water, but is facing restrictions at the other end of the water pipe. The solution is the same, however, and that may be hard for some Happy Valley residents to swallow.<br>"We've done enough research to know it can work here, but we're at the beginning of what we expect will be a rather intensive public process," Miller said. "When you're doing something this different, it's important to get citizens involved early."<br>The proposal is to process the water using new membrane technology -- microfiltration and ultra-filtration -- possibly in combination with reverse osmosis units that operate like kidney dialysis machines. Ultraviolet or ozone treatment will be used to disinfect the treated waste water.<br><br>The authority won't pipe the ultrafiltered waste water directly into the communities' water lines, even though it would meet federal drinking water standards. Instead, the water will be pumped seven miles up into the hills and discharged into Slab Cabin Run, a tributary of trout-rich Spring Creek, and into a nearby wetland, recharging both surface water and the underground aquifer.<br><br>The discharge location is one mile from the State College Water Authority drinking water wells. Such indirect recirculation is common among all the communities reusing waste water.<br><br>"I don't think there's any community in Pennsylvania that's ready to say 'Let's drink the water that was yesterday's sewage,' until we prove we can make the water that clean," Miller said. "So we'll pump it up into the watershed and establish a history."<br>A direct connection to the drinking water supply would be possible after several years, he added.<br>The authority, which serves a growing population of 38,000 people, discharges 5 million gallons of treated sewer water into Spring Creek every day and is limited to 6 million gallons a day. Any more would warm the creek water, harming the trout population and, in turn, the thriving local sport-fishing economy.<br><br>"Our disposal options are to pipe the discharge seven miles downstream, out of the High Quality fishery section and discharge there, or go seven miles upstream so we get to use the water again," Miller said.<br><br>Miller said the authority chose the reuse option even though it will cost $6 million more over the project's 20-year life span.<br>"This will extend our water resources. Every drop we reuse is one more drop we're not taking out of the ground," Miller explained. "It's drought-proofing even though we've never come close to running out."<br><br>But Slab Cabin Run has. Last summer, the combination of a statewide drought and the pumping of 2.5 million gallons a day from wells caused the creek to run dry. Local sportsmen rescued trout from shrinking pools in the drying creek bed and carried them to streams that contained flowing water.<br><br>"It should ease the depletion of Slab Cabin Run's base flow. By keeping 2 or 3 million gallons a day in the loop, that much doesn't have to come from the creek," said Richard Adams, state Department of Environmental Protection regional water management program permit chief.<br><br>The major impact, however, will be on the Spring Creek trout, which require cool water to thrive. The authority's warm discharges into Spring Creek at last September's low flow were almost equal to the volume of water in the creek.<br>"Trout are uncommonly prolific in that creek, and preserving their habitat is important to the economy of the area, as well as a cultural issue," Adams said. Spring Creek's trout fishery, which includes a special regulation area known as "Fisherman's Paradise," is important as a regional, state, even a national, resource.<br><br>The project is so cutting-edge that the DEP doesn't have rules to regulate it.<br>Similar recirculation projects have been done by some private industries and businesses in Pennsylvania -- Knoebel's Amusement Park in Northumberland County heavily chlorinates its waste water for reuse in park bathrooms -- but those are much smaller and don't involved reuse as tap water.<br><br>"Only a few states -- California, Texas -- actually have regulations for this type of thing," Adams said. "As we review the project with the authority, the standards we develop will become stepping stones for new state regulations."<br>He said those waste water reuse regulations could also be applied to the state's new anti-degradation rules for rivers and streams, which require that industries and businesses must consider all alternative treatment methods before they can get a permit to discharge wastewater into protected streams. "DEP is very high on this project," Adams said.<br>"If this project proves feasible, it would be my hope that it could be used in other situations to reduce stream discharges."<br>The authority kicked off its public education and comment period for the waste water project last month on Earth Day. Local officials will review and vote on it by February. Miller said approval is expected, with construction to begin next May. Target date to open the first valve is March 2004.<br><br>Initially, 3 million gallons will be sent through the advanced treatment process and then through twin 15-inch pipes to the Slab Cabin Run discharge location. The authority will continue to discharge the remainder of its flow as it always has, directly into Spring Creek. When the Spring Creek discharge grows toward the 6 million gallon a day limit again, the authority will expand the amount it sends through the advanced treatment system. "In 20 years I believe we will be discharging little or none into Spring Creek," Miller said. "I fully expect 100 percent of our discharge will be reused." He also expects acceptance of the water reuse plan to follow the example set when the authority began marketing compost made from sewage bio-solids-human waste. "At first people didn't want it. Now we can't keep enough around to fill all our orders," he said. "In Central Pennsylvania, once something is proven to work and it's economical, people will latch on to it and not let go."<br><br>And once State College proves the water conservation technology will work, Miller believes other places around the state will use it too. "I don't see it used in the Ohio River valley. Pittsburgh or Philadelphia won't do it because they have big rivers to discharge into," Miller said. But some smaller cities that want to grow and don't have the luxury of a big river running through them will find it useful. "Some of those smaller cities in the interior of the state are not growing because they're strapped by discharge limitations," Miller said. "For them, this approach will be useful. "And once we show it can be done, other communities will latch on and use it as an economical tool to attract industries. If this can provide clean, cheap water, I'm sure they will use it."<br><br></div>

Water supplies have been a strategic issue closely related to our survival. Search for alternative started long long time ago but nothing came to surface until 2003 when relationship with malaysia soured and looks like we must have additional sources of supplies by 2011 and be completely self reliance by 2065. It was then the new water came on stage, more a morale booster for singaporean than anything else. Alternative water supplies were extensively discussed in all media. Apparently Mr. Goh was not in singapore or he cannot recall some of the facts that were revealed.<br><br>1. NewWater is the recycled water, from sewage system. Water from the sea, longkang and canal are reclaimed (not recycled, its not been used yet.) The difference is both technical and psychological. Water from longkang, canal and reservoirs comes from collection of rain water. It has no salt content and no (supposed to be) contaminated, treated in the normal way and is what we have been using, no technology needed and no psychological effect. Sea water requires filtration and desalination to get rid of salt, technology available but very high energy costs, no psychological effect. Newwater is recycled from sewage, water used by human, technology is available and costs have come down below desalination process but very high psychological factor, "you drink your urine." All these processes are being used in singapore. I don't know where but there are 3 newwater plants now and the first of 5 desalination plants contract has been awarded.<br><br>2. Some facts about newwater:<br>a. it is actually very pure water. The process of microfiltration, reverse osmosis and UV light treatment actually get rid of the minerals needed for our body, giving it a different taste from what we are used to. Besides averting the psychological effect, this is the reason why it needs to be pumped into the reservoir before sending to households.<br>b. Many commercial water filteration and desalination systems, used for expedition, military...use similar technologies such as 0.2 micron ceramic microfilter and reverse osmosis. Such systems were proven effective for many years, approved by NATO.....<br>c.  Because it is pure, it is most suitable for use in aircon system and in wafer plants, and this is its main usage now, leaving the water from reservoir for human consumption.<br><br>3. If I am not wrong, there is no separate piping systems to bring recycled newwater or reclaimed or desalinated water directly to household for human consumption. I read that all such water, recycled or reclaimed will go straight to the reservoirs and from the reservoirs, after further but normal treatment, the water then goes to household. So, I never heard that newwater is likely to be used for direct consumption.<br><br>4. All rivers in singapore will finally become reservoirs and all water from longkang will be directed there, and there is a strict rule about discharging dirty water into drainage system. All water from dish washing and laundry must go into the sewage and not the drain. The final processes for treating these water are different. Understand pipes will be built to link all the reservoirs to pump water from the high water level reservoir to those with lower water level, don have to pump into the sea. Collection of sewage water started years ago but it was only in 1999 that contract was awarded to a French company to build a 70 kilometer underground sewage system!! Details i don know.<br><br>5. Ultimately, Singapore will have 4 main water supplies, the new water (recycled water), the desalinated water (from the sea), own reservoir and from malaysia. Future price of water, raw or treated that we buy from malaysia, must not be more expensive than our costs of recycling or reclaiming water. With time, technologies improve, our costs of water will come down. The microfilter membrane today costs less than 10% of what it used to be! If malaysia don take care of their water resources, we may sell them water next time. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>6. Chlorine is added to kill bacteria and/or germs. It makes no sense to get rid of it before pumping through the pipes to households. If water is contaminated along the way, whose problem?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> Water without cholrine is plentiful. You can buy mineral water or distilled water from supermarket or the friendly 7 11 stores. you can also boil the water before drinking, chlorine is dissolved so it evaporate when water is boiled. Very health conscious people have no problem with portable water in singapore.<br><br>7. You can also buy water filter systems like ALL ,yes ALL my friends in KL do, in order to get clean water from their taps. AMWAY has a very effective system and is selling like hot cake. In KL, Klang area, you clean the filter once every 2 weeks and change every 3 months. You can also buy those systems to magnetise your water before you drink, for the comfort of your mind, another psychological effect. To me, those are all waste of money. I have not found how cancer is linked to drinking water.<br><br>So far, me and my family, drink straight from the taps. I don't work for newwater, no share in HYFLUX!<br><br>Happy drinking!!<br></div>
