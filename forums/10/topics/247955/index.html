            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Next PM should be ready in 10 years: PM Lee </strong><br>Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said the hunt is on to groom his potential successor before 2011, when the next General Election must be held.<br>.<br>Mr Lee hopes that in 10 years' time Â— once he has pieced together the best possible team, who are now in their late 30s or early 40s Â– "one of them should be ready to take over as Prime Minister".<br>.<br>Mr Lee, who turned 55 this year, told the House that "Singapore should not have a 70-year-old PM".<br>.<br>In his speech, Mr Lee noted that Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew retired from the top post when he was 67 and Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong stepped down at 63.<br>.<br>The Prime Minister said building the next team of capable MPs and political office-holders is now his "most important task".<br>.<br>Mr Lee related how current Law Minister Professor S Jayakumar (left), who is now 67 and will mark his 20th year on the job next year, is "anxious" that his successor be found soon.<br>.<br>Mr Lee said that he must have that person ready to step into Prof Jayakumar's shoes before the next polls.<br>.<br>On Tuesday, another minister, Mr Lim Swee Say, who is also secretary-general of the National Trade Unions Congress (right), also indicated that he was ready to make way for new blood.<br>.<br>Mr Lim, the Minister in the Prime Minister's Office, said that come the next election, he will be 57, and by 2016, 62.<br>.<br>By then, the Government has to find a new labour chief, Mr Lim said.<br>.<br>If such efforts fail, Mr Lim said it would mean the ability to attract the best people to form the best team had run into difficulty. Â— Lee U-Wen<br>Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said the hunt is on to groom his potential successor before 2011, when the next General Election must be held.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>More young here hit by Parkinson's<br>Gracia Chiang<br>gracia@mediacorp.com.sg<br><br>DOCTORS are seeing more young people diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, a degenerative disease usually associated with ageing.<br>.<br>In fact, of the 5,000 to 7,000 cases diagnosed in Singapore, 15 to 20 per cent are patients below the age of 40, said senior consultant neurologist Dr Tan Eng King at a press conference yesterday on World Parkinson's Disease Day.<br>.<br>He told Today he has seen a 10-to-20-per-cent jump in the number of new diagnoses in that age group over the last two years at the Singapore General Hospital.<br>.<br>Why this is happening is unclear, but Dr Tan said this makes early diagnosis and treatment even more important.<br>.<br>"A young student might think it is just their nature to be slow in their movement, or someone who has tremors may think it is because of anxiety," he said.<br>.<br>Parkinson's is a brain disorder that manifests itself in uncontrollable shaking, stiffness in the limbs and slowness of movement. There is currently no cure but the symptoms can be managed through medication and surgery.<br>.<br>Another consultant neurologist at Tan Tock Seng Hospital also said he was "beginning to see more cases of younger patients".<br>.<br>However, Dr Au Wing Lok noted that this could be because "more of them are aware (of the condition) and are coming forward".<br>.<br>A local study in 2004 found that the disease affects three out of every 1,000 Singaporeans aged 50 and above. While there has not been a similar study done among younger Singaporeans, Dr Louis Tan from the National Neuroscience Institute (NNI) suggested that research could focus instead on the genetic causes of the disease Â— as it has been found that a greater proportion of younger people with Parkinson's carry gene mutations.<br>.<br>Last year, Singapore and Taiwan researchers identified a mutated gene that doubles the chance of developing the disease and, interestingly, is found in people of Chinese descent.<br>.<br>More genetic information will "allow doctors to confirm the diagnosis in some patients earlier" and to counsel patients on the risks of their children having the disease, said Dr Tan Eng King.<br>.<br>Meanwhile, a three-day international symposium on the disease will be held here in October. It will include workshops on rehabilitation therapy and nursing.<br>Gracia Chiang<br>gracia@mediacorp.com.sg</div>

He has that sort of air and . . . . . .  .   the best is he goes back to SGH and be doctor and live happily ever after.  Don't think he is suitable to be in politics.   He has no fighting spirit.   payand pay very fond of getting doctors to be in politics.  Yucks, doctors!!!  Come across many who are not credible and professional.<br><br>In the beginning I kind of like the way he looks, now no more.  I can't stand the sight of him after I watched the interview.  yucks!!!</div>
