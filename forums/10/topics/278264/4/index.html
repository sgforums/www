            <div class='col-md body'>I think many should thank you for the  field report which is very detailed and<br>interesting. This should in no way indicate if I support or disapprove such events. (selfpreservation)<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by Jontst78:<br>So I thought, ok walk through the mall one last time to add my presence. l went through the basement, saw the <strong>CNA</strong> female reporter, looking somewhat exasperated. Hopefully she did get something to publish......<br><br>................<br>When the performance ended, I proceeded to Macs to get a drink, saw a group of like 5-6 black at Macs, thought of taking a photo, but then thought better of it. I then departed CP after that with my date for dinner. All in all, I think, it felt good. <strong>Hopefully the press did get something</strong>.<br></blockquote>CNA so far have not reported it today, Sunday. I think they will not report it for whatever reason.<br><br>It would be interesting to know if ANY news, local or foreign has reported it.<br>Anyone seen any reports?<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by Jontst78:<br>In my opinion, this event is just another milestone in the political maturity of Citizens here in Singapore, where people who actually disagree but more than often, end up saying : "<strong>Aiyah</strong>, protest also <strong>no use</strong>. Its the Government leh".<br></blockquote>Does anyone know around how many knew of the event at least 1 day in advance?  I think only a few hundred to a couple of thousand people were aware. dioboh?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"><br>Many who are on one forum may also be on other forums and talk the same things. Thus, it is unknown how many actually aware beforehand. make sense boh?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"><br><br>The 'Say No' petition only registered a low 600 odd sigs (as of yesterday).

I dunno <strong><span class="large">since there is no figures to indicate how many are really aware of anything.</span></strong><br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by Jontst78:<br>A message of disagreement or objection to a policy or Government decision, does not have to end in violence, or even breaking the Law.<br></blockquote>You mean it is ok to disagree? I am kind of surprised.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by Jontst78:<br>I hope this even will build in momentum, generate more awareness that Singaporeans actually have a say, and can say something, other than Â“YesÂ” to the Government, in an ever so slightly more assertive manner.<br></blockquote>Who actually invented this kind of event?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"> I got a suspicion it came from down under as I have heard it was practised there before??? can be wrong of course.<br><br>I am also curious to know if anyone would have broken any (Singapore!) law for wearing a particular color of t-shirt and did not form in groups of &gt;=5 ?<br><br>If not one can get in trouble in this case, then is this not a 'loophole' that the people concerned would find ways to plug it?  I have no idea. I doubt so since I cracked my head and cannot find any reason that can land such event people into trouble, as long as they observe the 'safe practise guidelines'.<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by Jontst78:<br>I propose the same thing, same time, same place, same colour on 15/09. Hopefully we Singaporeans can get things moving, and keep the momemtun building.<br></blockquote>I am Not saying I would participate (selfpreservation), but how many really will be aware, once again?  I did made a small field survey yeasterday at CP and of the 5 stranger singaporeans I spoke to, none was aware. I bet it is so even if you asked them again today.<br></div>
