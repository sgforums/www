It is YOU who choose to be single. Personally I think it is better for you to stop posting topic about racism because that is not going to make the society any better.<br><br>For your own good, I think you should just cut all that bullshit about racism cause singapore government will not tolerate people like you who like to talk about racism in singapore.

Look at Xiang Yun, Huang Biren &amp; Zoe.<br>All married but still win awards every yr.<br><br>If u wait too long, very few eligible guys left. Only those widowers/ divorced.<br>For the guys, the older they are, they are still able to attract young girls.<br><br>Not everyone is lucky to find that special person.<br>Don't fret  if unable to find a partner,   better  to remain single &amp; be worry free than to settle for a freeloader. I have single 40+ relatives who lead active life. They enjoy their independence. In fact many single women are the ones we have to thank for looking after their aged parents</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well, its sad that in our society nowadays it is increasing uncertainty in everything not to say about relationships....men and women all allike always thinking of fun , interesting. We got gfs or bfs and when we get sick of them we go for someone else more exciting more shapely more handsome(whether we r married or not). This cycle will never ceased because we are always not satisfied with what we have. We will forever be a slave to our desires till you learn to curb it.</div>
