I think the relationship is more mature and based on better grounding (not always so but at least the person would not be choosing based on looks or cash but I must qualify there are exceptions).  Its not always that a person past her 30s is expired and therefore must settle to a house full of cats or for a lousy, unsuitable person just for companionship. Some older people do find a second spring, its just that for asia, there is a lot of stygma and shallow thinking in general. Additionally, relationships are changing and it is not necessarily true that people need to get married to have a fulfilling life as some like to advertise. Its just bad taste to keep pushing that a single ideal should be everyone's ideal.<br><br>The thing about sumiko is that she comes across as somewhat less than hopeful and from many years back, I read her article (of whining as I like to call it), I find that she is unhappy with herself and lots of things. This comes across in many aspects of life.  There's more to life than marriage and there is more to life than letting people tell you otherwise.<br><br></div>

Isn't it sad to know that we are having a hugh population of Singaporean women still single after 30s. Shouldn't it be consider as a nation problem?? Why is there such low birth rate?

I think the relationship is more mature and based on better grounding (not always so but at least the person would not be choosing based on looks or cash but I must qualify there are exceptions). Its not always that a person past her 30s is expired and therefore must settle to a house full of cats or for a lousy, unsuitable person just for companionship</blockquote>The older one get, the more available get hitched and married leaving either the one who do not want to get attached or ones who cannot find his desired partner. Out of the ones who do not want to get attached, most of them want to find a younger wife than one their age. There r exception but trust me such men r very very very few and the problem of age is really true. U look uglier, get tired easier and physically u r harder to conceive if he was a family man. If u talk about getting smarter or more experienced, frankly younger women may be pretty smart as well. If it was a person looking for a spouse and cannot find one, then it means u really need to compromise a lot since he must have some pretty fatal weaknesses. So the older a woman get, the harder was it for him to find a partner. The option of getting into a house full of cats may become viable if they can't find a suitable partner... so do't give up and start to look around for a suitable spouse... no one can say tat marriage = hapiness , but no marriage will certainly lead to lonliness which is unhappy.</div>
