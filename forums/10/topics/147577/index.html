            <div class='col-md body'>Right now, decision making in Parliament is undemocratic. Take for instance, the issue of the casino. The Cabinet is making many decisions without submitting them to parliamentary voting where the PAP Whip is lifted. Neither do they use a public referendum to decide issues like the casino. If there is a strong opposition in Parliament, then perhaps the decisions being made would be more reflective of the majority of the public's sentiments.<br><br>Because of the PAP's Whip, the MPs are not voting based on the public's interests, but based on their political party's interests which might not be aligned with the public majority.</div>
