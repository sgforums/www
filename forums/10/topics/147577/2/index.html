            <div class='col-md body'>Ask Mr Andrew Kuan to join the opposition forces as during the period of the presidential application many people crticised him including PM Lee but he had press conference and told the media that he is not in the wrong and defended himself and even praising himself. If he joins, he will be just like Chee Soon Juan being a dare-devil to challenge the government but sometime will spoil the opposition face maybe???</div>
