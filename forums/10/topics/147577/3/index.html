In the end, people like myself would end up risking grey areas because of these pests in society. You probably don't know the <span style="font-style: italic;">self-proclaimed white knight</span> who claimed all th big sh!ts whom I went sought help from threatened me.<br><br>Put it this way, nowhere is safe. If PAP ain't ruling, these people'd probably fund WP or SPP or SDP or what pee and end up <span style="font-style: italic;">friends</span> of other Pees. It's all the same. The problem is, how come it's getting harder for the PAP to absorb good leaders and maintain a good world? Getting rid of PAP isn't necessarily going to help. Getting rid of Sgforum or YP forum ain't gonna stop people from being angry with PAP, isn't it? People'd just migrate to some foreign forums or what and regroup.<br><br>So now, the critical issue is about PAP getting good elements to glow in the party and clean up things. Maybe... there could be something missing or wrong that the party is doing. So any comment to offer? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Feel free.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Why don't ask how you can make the "opposition party" better? And before one answers that, they should be very clear about their intent and purpose/ E.g. to provide an alternative voice, better serve the people, better balance, to challenge the incumbent party, because it is cool,? a It is because we are so saturated with this dependence mentality that we just hope the opposition party will spring up somehow with miracles to fight the stranglehold of the ruling party.  otherwise, we just complain about being oppressed or compare to one living in some fascist country.  could it be that many enjoy the willing victim statushood or is it pure indifference and ignorance? It is as good as saying, I dont care but I just wish to see some change, whatever. because as always, it is far easier to talk than to act...as past precedence have shown,  the most voracious criticisms can be raised of the current system, then when election comes and some goodies are dispensed to one's pocket, you find all the noises subside, every qualm disappears and finally the taxi driver actually concentrates on his driving.  but it cannot be blamed because of the nature of politics. There is one common feature present in all these election processes. that is, each one will try so hard to dig up enough dirt and whatever private vice and folly with the intention to taint the other's image. one begins to harp so much about integrity, credibility, ability etc and question if someone is capable in doing a certain job, nevermind about their good intentions. the fact is,  it may not matter sometimes. for can anyone claim they are holier than thy neigbour? Choices comes with risks and before someone is given a chance to prove himself/herself, they could be slammed so hard and be branded a cheat, communist or something nasty and be forced to leave the country.  what about those that escaped such scrutiny, could they have been such great masters of disguise or shielded by some invisible force field until later discovered? e.g. you can paint someone as a saint, then it so happens they are drunkards or maid abusers. I wonder. in trying to use these tactic, it is dirty in itself and really a shame but it is framed up in such a pretty way that tells everybody, these are the rules of the game.  so, why should you wait for others to answer you? when you are given the opportunity to cast your vote,  ask yourself what criterias am I judging the person, do I believe in his/her visions  to make things better, more voices be heard, the common good or because plenty $ is lining my pocket, nice upgradings to the gracious hdb and the list goes on...the answer lies within.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by ndsef:</div><div class="quote_body">Yep, that is the question... that I hope forum members here can answer...<br><br>I am waiting...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> </div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think the best way to make the opposition parties better is to form a coalition and pool all their resources together. Then, hire publicist and put up advertisements in television and hire economists to come up with a good economic plan to rival that of the PAP. This will convince the people to vote for the opposition without worrying that their rice bowls will be affected. Most importantly, elect a leader who is a good orator,( someone like Winston Churchill) and promise the people political reforms.<br><br>The point is to increase the awareness of Sinagpore's political problems.Moreover, the opposition should not try to gain support by visiting the residents all the time because it is a waste of time as it ultimately comes down to their ricebowls.</div>
