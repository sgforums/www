            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Gedanken:</div><div class="quote_body">By and large, there's little difference between Rudd and Howard's stance.  The key things that worked against Howard were Iraq, Work Choices and climate change.  The Libs' campaign was not helped by the fact that Howard was running in the full knowledge that he would not complete the term.<br><br>I'm pretty ambivalent about Labor taking power.  Given their track record, the economy could take a dip and the pesky unions could rear their ugly heads again.  That said, Rudd doesn't seem to be a rabid Labor man, and hopefully he can keep his pets under control so that we don't have too much of a headache.  If Rudd keeps his word about Iraq and climate change (but not necessarily Kyoto which is a load of BS anyway) it'll be good, but he'd be a damn fool to dismantle Work Choices because the alternative would bring us back to the sheep-shearing days.<br><br>Ultimately, the one thing that worked in Howard's favour was continuity - he was in office long enough for his policies to take effect.  Love him or hate him, it's true that the country's in better shape than when he took office, and hopefully Rudd's not stupid enough to go trying to fix things that aren't broken.</div></blockquote>Rudd is not dumb.  I wonder why the Tasmanians voted for him since he supported the pulp mill there.<br><br>He isn't going to pull Australian Troops out .<br><br>He is going to keep "elements" of the Workchoices legislation ( which are actually the backbone of the Workchoice legislation)  and add some criteria for dismissals.<br><br>He is keeping the illegal immigrant policies.<br><br>He is going to sign the Kyoto protocol ONLY IF AND IF the developing countries are bounded to it as equally as Australia is. Which means that Kyoto protocol might not be signed if developing countries are given an unequal quota to Australia. I think if I am not wrong , he will sign only if India and China signs it. So for him to renegotiate the Kyoto protocol and ratify it.<br><br>He is going to fund alot of things but I don't see how the money is coming when he is going to cut down the taxes of foreign investors.<br><br>So basically if he does not deliver in 3 years some of his promises , he is in deep trouble.<br><br>The only thing he got going for him is that he is new and he has to prove himself.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="font-style: italic;">An original editorial written by me:</span><br><br>Finally, the curtain on John HowardÂ’s political career has been called. After more than 11 years as Prime Minister and 33 years as a parliamentarian, Mr Howard looks finished as the votes have shown in last weekÂ’s exit polls.<br><br>Kudos to Maxine McKew for daring to stand against the outgoing Prime Minister in his Bennelong constituency, which he has held since 1974 and a traditional Liberal seat.<br><br>Of course, the Chinese community in Bennelong appeared to have matured, if it is true that they deserted Mr Howard in droves. Not forgetting the resentment the Indians in his electorate feel about the Haneef case worked against the Coalition.<br><br>Overall, Mr Howard got done in by his focus on the past. It seems likely that the Coalition got a little bit cocky this time round, thinking old tactics could still work. It did not. Save for WA, the swing to the Labor Party elsewhere was significant. So significant that nothing could save Bennelong from falling into Ms McKewÂ’s hands, if the figures are anything to go by.<br><br>There were analysts who felt that single mothers felt most alienated by the Howard governmentÂ’s policies. I am sure the East Fremantle single mother pursuing an education degree could not agree more. She might have to put her studies on hold due to the lack of childcare grants available. Ironically, the nation faces a shortage of teachers, particularly in the West. This brings to mind Kevin RuddÂ’s so-called educational revolution. Hopefully, he can work more closely with Alan Carpenter to fix the problems in WA schools.<br><br>The battle in WA seemed to be fought more on local issues on the whole. The CoalitionÂ’s Luke Simpkins managed to snare Cowan following Labor member Graham EdwardsÂ’ retirement, but it is just a hollow victory if the big picture is examined. The booming economy in WA meant voters over here were more likely to support incumbent parties, but there are also a significant number of disadvantaged families in the West, like it is nationwide. These people may have played their part in bringing back Sharryn Jackson in Hasluck.<br><br>However, I believe in giving credit when it is due. John Howard has presided over some difficult times. He steered Australia out of recession in the late 1990s, only for 9/11 to rock the world economy again in 2001. He has endured the pain of seeing his compatriots die in two terrorist strikes in Bali, as well as the 2004 attack on the Australian embassy in Jakarta. Mr Howard has seen tough times and shared the ups and downs with the rest of the nation. Yet, as the Nelly Furtado song goes, all good things must come to an end. The Coalition has shown to be past its time. Now it is time for Labor to step in and apply some new and better ideas.<br><br>I hope for a bright future under Labor and Kevin Rudd. But it is hard not to feel sorry for Mr Howard at times, though. In addition, the Liberals seem to be a fractured lot following their crushing defeat. Hopefully they can get their act together and elect a credible leader for the next election.<br></div>

For myself i do not take a personal stand unless i seriously have to. A politician can say so much but realities are such. The Labour Party can say so much about workchoices but i'm sure they appreciate its merits. As much as they would like to do more about super contribution, they would do well to appreciate the impact on businesses...that is the reality..they can promise so much and they can only do so much...</div>

I really don't know much about oz politics. But what Rudd said he would do to improve the infant mortality rate for the aboriginals would take years if not decades to see results. For the time being, everybody is just watching what the new government would do.<br><br>After opposition party took over the KMT in Taiwan, nothing of what they said would do could be done. Can Rudd do what Howard could not do? can Singapore oppositions do what the PAP could not do? Singaporeans are also watching.<br><br>Politics are the same everywhere. To be excited over a new government is simply naive.<br><br>To those who are interested in migrating, Rudd said that Â“his compassion did not stretch to an overhaul of Australia's migration system which includes turning away illegal asylum seekers.Â”  I guess his message is that anyone who feel persecuted politically by the PAP has no ground to migrate, at least not to australia.<br></div>
