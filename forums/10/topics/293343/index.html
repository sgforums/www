The key things that worked against Howard were Iraq, Work Choices and climate change.  The Libs' campaign was not helped by the fact that Howard was running in the full knowledge that he would not complete the term.<br><br>I'm pretty ambivalent about Labor taking power.  Given their track record, the economy could take a dip and the pesky unions could rear their ugly heads again.  That said, Rudd doesn't seem to be a rabid Labor man, and hopefully he can keep his pets under control so that we don't have too much of a headache.  If Rudd keeps his word about Iraq and climate change (but not necessarily Kyoto which is a load of BS anyway) it'll be good, but he'd be a damn fool to dismantle Work Choices because the alternative would bring us back to the sheep-shearing days.<br><br>Ultimately, the one thing that worked in Howard's favour was continuity - he was in office long enough for his policies to take effect.  Love him or hate him, it's true that the country's in better shape than when he took office, and hopefully Rudd's not stupid enough to go trying to fix things that aren't broken.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Australian voters speak to WSWS on polling day</strong><br><br>The overwhelming sentiment among people who spoke to the World Socialist Web Site at the polling booths on Saturday was a deeply-felt hostility to the Howard government over a broad range of issues: from its support for the war in Iraq to its imposition of draconian WorkChoices industrial laws, its treatment of immigrants and Aborigines and the continuing deterioration of living standards.<br><br>Many explained that they had just voted Â“to get rid of HowardÂ” or regarded Labor as the Â“lesser evilÂ”. Others expressed the hope that Labor would not be as bad as the Coalition, but most had no confidence that the new Prime Minister Kevin Rudd would address their needs and concerns.
