Anyways, my plan is to finish BMT and see how i like unit/NS life before I sign anything. Think thrice, you are signing on for life. If you are fit enough, then all I can say is "Why not?". However about getting into CDOs, I am not sure of the process.</div>

The rest, I recommend you go down and talk to the mindef recruitment office...as my info may not be as updated...(also I am not sure what i can say safely).<br><br>Let's just say the life in green is not as glamourous as it looks on TV or cinema....the hardship behind it...nobody knows. I strongly recommend you decide after you finish your BMT. You should have a more better idea of SAF then. Life in green is not suitable for everybody.<br><br>But a word of advice, with a poly cert, you wun advance far in your rank...you need more "paper". Do think abt that.<br><br></div>

It will make thing things worse in u are on the wrong ball. To be able to lead is the most important factor<br>To be a commando officer would require u to excel not only in BMT, but also in commando section leader course. Only then will u be selected for OCS.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>once u get in there, this is the procedure:<br><br>BMT - 3 months promote to PTE<br>BCT basic commando training - 3 months then promote to CPL<br>Airborne Course - earn ur wings after 5 jumps. 2 CF(clean fatigue), 2 CE(combat equipment), 1 NCE (night combat equipment).<br>VT vocational training: you have to go for "leader course" to be a 3SG b4 u can be selected to go for OCS.<br><br>for officers, they will leave after these nine months and go to OCS without the triservice term. so i guess that leaves 6 more months b4 they become a cdo 2LT. somewhere in between i think u will have to do the 72 click route march like the rest of them. can't remember if our officer cadets joined us.<br><br>after that i think it's much the same as any other place. come back with a chocolate bar, do your PC tour, then the rest is see how..<br><br>this is quite old information tho... things might have changed by now, and i dun even remember a few things.. so this might not be the most accurate info.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>basically the life of a cdo is combat all the way. mission after mission after mission. jump after jump after jump. not to mention 5 or 10 click SOCs and yearly 5km vest and slack runs, and of course IPPT which is the least of our problems. if not then it's parade. if get BCU then have to march in NPD... usually they get the BCU. and marching in NDP is cool, it's the bloody rehearsals that drive us nuts. on SUNDAYS.<br><br>most regular CDOs have no life. they are really that passionate and those with the passion and they ability go on to be rangers or even SOF. some even come back from overseas with a yellow ranger tag on the right sleeve (US trained)<br><br>i never did understand their passion but i do respect them for it.</div>
