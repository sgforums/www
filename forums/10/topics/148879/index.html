In the next 40 years, the technology and others in Singapore will change rapidly. But will politics in Singapore will change?

One super market operator is call ''Singapore LandMark'' They were asking tony tan to let SAF on UN Mission there longer because the locals have <span class="large"><span style="color: red;"><strong>no</strong></span></span><br>spending power.  I was in East Timor for 2 years and lost nearly 2 hundred thousand sing dollars investing in petrol station.<br><br>If tony tan had allowed SAF and UN mission to stay longer; this means singapore gov is assisting singaporeans in east timor.<br><br>I wouldn't want to be there if I hadn't know the president Mr Xanana Gusmao and other ministers.  Forget it, give them other ten years it will still be the same.<br><br>I was there when riot broke out in East Timor on 04 December 2002, my Singaporean friend was stuck in one of the hotel while the locals were creating havoc and throwing stone into the hotel; I was lucky enough to be accepted by the Thai embassy in the Central Marinetime vessel and met a Singapore SAF's Major.  I asked him to help to fetch my friend to the vessel and the Major was reluctant; eventually I had to beg him and he did it with a long face.<br><br>Let me ask the LHL.  What can singapore government assist them there?</div>

But seriouly speaking PM Lee jokes are quite funny for some and better than SM Goh. Maybe he could be a comedian when he retired?? </div></blockquote>I remember a "joke" made by the then PM Goh. It went something like this:<br><br>"SARS means Schools Are Really Shut"<br><br>*cue*<br><br>- Ha Ha Ha Ha - Clap Clap Clap Clap clap... -<br><br>That was when i swore off govt speeches forever.<br><br>TBH, i think we shoudn't read too much into these speeches. Yes, in broad terms, they may very well give an insight into the character of the talking head. However, bear in mind that these speeches are just as likely to have been written by a dedicated speech writer. Hence, all these "jokes" might have been written by the same pencil pusher.<br><br></div>
