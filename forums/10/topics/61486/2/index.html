            <div class='col-md body'>To CX,<br><br>I may not as articulate as you in putting the message across. Upon reading your thread, i agree with you so truly. Singaporeans are made to be drones, in turn, the lack of humanity kicks in. And yes, there are people who ae just plain arrogant and ignorant when they are so able to embrace the "truth" freely, but never stop to consider the others on the receiving end. Take for example, students here in Singapore. Although i applaud the Government for inplementing different classes of study systems(eg:ITE, poly), but however, the way the implemented it was wrong in a way, over the years, those who do not make it to the well trodden path, they are made to feel stupid and useless. The Government or people who are ignorant will say these people(those who do not make it) brought it upon themselves by thinking that way. But did they ever think what it's like to be in their shoes? Singapore has a long way to go in more than just breeding "entrepreneurs" and "scholars". If the attitude is all wrong, no amount of "scholars" will bring this country to great heights. We will all be mainly money-generating machines and the people in the top class of the working hierarchy will enjoy the benefits of prestige and wealth, while the middle and working class will just work their way to their grave.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i'm just wondering,  i think it would be more accurate to see the percentage of population in the top quartile and lowest quartile of the range of income rather than just looking at the average income.  for all u know, singapore might have a pretty large number of rather well off people and also a large number of poor in the country.  this would then account for the large number of people facing hardships everytime theres a jack up in prices.  i mean, if u increase things like public transport prices, obviously u are getting more cash from the people who can't afford private transport or people who do not have an income, like students.<br><br>also, as a point of personal interest, besides posting on this forum, what are the alternative courses of civic action available to me as an individual? i doubt people actually bother going to speakers corner to listen, but i've never been there, so i'm not sure.  i haven't heard a squeak from there in the news or among friends since the hype during its launch.<br><br>I think if anyone here considers anything less than forming our own political party to fight the PAP to be mere barking, then he or she should seriously consider the risks involved, funding, etc.  Many disgruntled ones are poor or earning an average income, how do we go about getting these people to form their own parties?  those with enough cash can thrive in singapore and would see little reason or incentive to go throw their money in forming a political party with little or no potential gains involved and confirmed losses from the beginning.<br><br>besides that, how many of us here knows how to go about forming a political party or getting support from the masses or registering as a candidate for elections etc, all these information isn't exactly very well publicised, u gotta go dig around, spending much time and effort for something with little potential gain, once again, there is just no incentive of doing it after the countless defamation suits filed, however i do believe that the suits were justified in most cases.  i prefer to still believe in the judicial system in singapore... even if the politics isn't da best.<br><br>and i'm born in 1988, what does that make me?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I am back after these few days..<br><br>Just wanna ask, do u think the best politcal system is  to follow the Western political system ?<br><br>If u ask me, when they start implementing their political system they r already rich and powerful. When the public has too much powers, politician do not make decisions tat will be good for the nation in general. For example the French. They made many policies, like lower working hours etc  to lure the people into voting for them. Tat is a popular policy, but is it good for the nation ? Now they r facing economy problems because they lack competitiveness compared to other countries.<br><br><blockquote>Taiwan and South Korea have both experienced tough military dictatorial governments respectively under Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang and the strong arm rule of Park Jung Hee Military. </blockquote>Look at Taiwan, SIngapore and South Korea, and u will realise one thing. They r in bad shape when the military dictatorial political party take office. These 3 countries face something of a <span style="font-style: italic;">civil</span> war. Korea and Taiwan is really in it while Singapore is mostly an idealogy war with Malaysia. Yet in the end, these 3 countries perform better than most neighbours. Why ?<br><br>Because at tough times, survival is more important than ideology. We need tough rules, which only a party tat does not fear of backlash can make. In fact, the governing system of Singapore had formed up to be a new political system tat made other countries wanna follow.<br><br>A question to ask, now Taiwan is under the rule of Ming Jing Tang. How different is it from before, other than they being more "free"  ?<br><br></div>
