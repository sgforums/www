            <div class='col-md body'>It is a wonderful co-incidence to read your article, after posting my thread:-<br><br>"The 'Virtual World' of Swiss Standard of Living' -  Crashed ? "<br><br>The cause of the problems encountered by the complainant in your post is due largely to the UNREALISTIC ASPIRATIONS of the Government to transplant a 'Swiss Standard of Living' onto Singapore.<br><br>This politically inspired vision of a 'Swiss Standard of Living' has been sold to Singaporeans to win votes, which on the one hand was supposed to create a Lifestyle similar to the Swiss - ( with all the refinements and trappings of a modern metropolis that covers first class housing, transport, arts and entertainment ); and expecting the Lifestyle to be supported by wage levels that are artificially pushed up; but without the substance nor tangible productive and creative output found in the Swiss.<br><br>If we use the HDB criteria in determining which income bracket can buy which types of HDB homes, we can safely assume that about 40% of the Singapore population are living in 3-Room Flats, about 35% live in 4-Room Flats, 15% live in 5-Room Flats, and 5% live in Executive Masonettes.<br><br>The remaining 5% live in Private Homes.<br><br>With the meticulous manner in which HDB ensure that the home buyers' income can meet monthly instalment payment for the homes purchased, one can safely assume that almost 40% of Singaporeans have a monthly family income not exceeding $2000, 35% not exceeding $4000, 15% not exceeding $6000, and 5% of HDB Executive Maisonettes dwellers have an income not exceeding $9000.<br><br>A large portion of the CPF money saved over the working life of a Singaporean will go into the purchase of an HDB or Private Home, and the remaining cash portion of the wage will pay for either car finance instalments and its operation-maintenance, or for Public Transport.<br><br>Is there anything left in Cash after paying for other expenses that include child or self improvement education and tuition, food, clothing, utilities, and telephone ?<br><br></div>

After all empty vessels make the most noise, and u seem to be the epitome of NATO aka No Action Talk Only.<br><br>And before we applaud u for at least making the effort to speak out, i do wonder if u are one of those who meekly tick the PAP's box when it comes to voting time. After all, German Shephards are rather smart animals, they do know something besides barking away.<br><br>"Dude, where's the action?"  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> </div></blockquote>One:<br><br>This article came in my email. I read it and was amazed that someone could easily sum up her disappointments in so short a passage.<br><br>Two:<br><br>There is no need to applaud anything i do since i, like the rest of my kind in here, live behind a pen name and write ( at least try to write) convincing arguments in the hopes that eventually one day the readers make something outta it and do (like you so affectionally request for) take some kind of action.<br><br>btw, unfortunately, my constituency does not allow me to vote since no one dares challenge the incumbent and is unlikely to do so for another 20 years or so...(maybe i should make that 50 years)<br><br>Oh and i don't fancy german shephards. They do (like you have already mentioned) bark rather unnecessarily to get your attention. But at least they do bark.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Let's put it this way, the opposition parties we have in Singapore are a bunch of jokers. I wouldn't even dream of putting a tick in their boxes in a drunken state. They can't get even get their facts right and gets into trouble all the time. The sight of them selling their so called 'books' at City Hall Mrt are laughable to say the least. If this is the type of action you guys want, i can only say a silent prayer and hope for the best.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>First of all, get the facts right before u start barking away, literally speaking.<br><br>One, I did not try to potray myself as a pathetic Singaporean who can barely make ends meet by emailing everyone about it.<br><br>Two, I do not go to the forums and speak out loud or shall i say 'bark' and proclaim to be a leader  just by speaking out - the German Sherphard leading the sheep. And since you wanna criticise the others for being sheep, then u jolly well be a 'doer' instead of a 'barker'. If i yearn to hear some barking, i will prefer to visit the SPCA.<br><br>Three, what i said were facts. It is true that they are pathetic. To put it bluntly, i can't even remember who is the opposition party member in my constituency. The only time i've seen this joker is during voting time.

I find that amusing, considering the fact that the opposition has been barking alot, but when it comes to crunch time, i got to ask my golden question "Dude, where's the action?" </blockquote>there are very good reasons for pple to be discontented with the PAP... don't be presumptuous. just because u joined their fan club doesn't mean everyone should as well.<br><br>lets not forget that not many get to vote as well... some democracy this is turning out to be...<br><br><blockquote>Is it PAP's fault that the opposition parties are weak? No.</blockquote>YES it is. u just don't know enough history to know it. the opposition wasn't always weak and the PAP wasn't always strong.<br><br>the fact is, the PAP has actively made sure that the opposition can never have a chance to challenge PAP dominance:<br><br>1)by constantly re-drawing electoral boundaries<br><br>2)by making sure that the minimum amount of time is allowed for campaigning between the announcement of election dates and the elections itself<br><br>3)by implementing the GRC to make sure that the weakened opposition can never garner enough candidates to contest<br><br>4)by coming down hard on all dissenting voices to further discourage pple from participating in the opposition<br><br>5)by actively recruiting candidates from the bureaucracy and the military to renew itself thereby binding both organisations to their loyalty<br><br>that the PAP has achieved much during its year in power is beyond question.<br><br>that its methods were heavy-handed, undemocratic and in many cases, rather objectionable, is also very much true.<br><br><blockquote>Is it PAP's fault that opposition parties screw up their facts and get into trouble? No.</blockquote>yes. think about something that happened just a few months ago: the two economists from NTU who got their figures wrong because some of the data were 'classified'.<br><br>there is an obvious lack of transparency in what goes on in the 'black-box' ... we, the little man can only hope that what goes on is truly, to our interest, as the govt claims.<br><br>there are always two sides to every coin.<br><br><blockquote>Is it PAP's fault that opposition parties fail to get enough votes to secure seats? No.</blockquote>yes. because they have resorted to the underhand method of tying in HDB upgrading to win votes.<br><br>this says a lot about the political maturity of the average singaporean, but thats the way the cookie crumbles when u just sit tight and not talk about pertinent issues because u don't think your views matter: u get selfish, self-centered and apathetic.<br><br>and because the oppostion has been so badly weakened by the PAP becoming stronger at its expense. we no longer question PAP dominance.<br><br><blockquote>PAP is not perfect, but given the choice between PAP and the opposition parties with the likes of Dr Chee and Co, the choice is clear as daylight. </blockquote>is it? chee is the caricature of a bad opposition figure. he does not equate all opposition figures. in the same way that the PAP is not all good, nor all bad. but a PAP that is all powerful, without any checks, balance and restraint is a BAD thing!<br><br>we need to have a balanced view with regards to political awareness and this can only come about through active discussion.<br><br><blockquote>"Dude, where are the German Shephards that really know how to 'bite'?"  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> </blockquote>it got mauled by the PAP to the extent that it is now bleeding, wimpering and couched in a fetal position. it is up to all singaporeans who care about their future to nurse it, nurture it, talk to it, engage it and understand it. so that it can get back on its feet and start speaking for us, the people, again.<br><br>an effective opposition does not just appear out of nowhere. the PAP even has to 'pretend' to have an opposition by having NMPs...<br><br>there IS something wrong with our political system. and we need to talk about it to address it by thinking about it, talking about it and understanding it.<br><br>try to be open minded. life is complex beyond your limited understanding...<br></div>
