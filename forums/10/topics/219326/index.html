Yes, there may be difficulties in the area of enforcement but it's no different from any other area of criminal law. It's difficult to prove but we'll leave it to the criminal system.<br><br>"If we have a good prosecutor and good judicial system, then the truth should surface. And I don't think we need to maintain this immunity.<br><br>"One example of domestic violence is sexual abuse of the spouse. And to deny the spouse of prosecution of rape seems to be a fundamental violation of the person's rights. Marital rape cannot be condoned, and there should not be an immunity. What the government is doing now is a welcoming step but I think it can go a little bit further."<br><br>On sex between homosexuals, the Ministry has plans to keep the status quo.<br><br>"These should essentially be seen as private matters within the home. One of the bigger issues is whether this is a signal by the government of greater acceptance of homosexuality in Singapore," says Associate Prof Kumaralingam Amirthalingam.<br><br>"I don't think the government is prepared to make a statement on this. But if you look at the history of prosecution under Section 377, which is the relevant provision here, I don't think you'll find any prosecutions of homosexual sexual activity between consenting adults within the home."<br><br>"So in that sense, it's a typical Singapore way of managing this issue without getting embroiled in the political and social problems that we're not ready to face," adds the law lecturer.<br><br>"I think the general feel is that we're still not ready to introduce major changes in these areas. I think the major changes would be what the government has said a few years ago, that it's all right to have homosexuals working in government departments. I think that's the major change," says Ellen Lee, member of the Government Parliamentary Committee for Home Affairs and Law. She is also the former president of Singapore Association of Women Lawyers.<br><br>Still, not everyone agrees.<br><br>"If you are a homosexual or a lesbian, I think you can get into trouble. We are talking about an inclusive society and being more broad-minded. Why do we want to keep these people away, out of the circle? I think we should be more broad-minded, more sympathetic and allow these people to be included in our society," says Subhas Anandan, president of the Association of Criminal Lawyers in Singapore.<br><br>"It's not necessarily for major legislative change to signal changes. But the legislation will only be changed when there is sufficient justification to warrant it, because the larger section of society think that it's time for those changes to take place," says Ellen Lee.<br><br>"With the introduction of the changes, we can expect that judges will be given more leeway. And taking into account the changes of people's behaviour, the different situations, I think now we've got a wider range of circumstances that may justify a more lenient sentence, a more community-based approach that we may really be in sync with society."<br><br>The Ministry is also proposing to repeal four laws which have become irrelevant or archaic.<br><br>It's also re-defining words like 'sexual', 'touching', 'penetration', and 'obscene' and elaborate on the concept of consent.<br><br>Lawyers say the proposed changes are in line with Singapore's push for a more open, compassionate society. - CNA /ls</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>More protection against rape for wives in future?</strong><br>TODAYonline<br>Thursday Â• November 9, 2006<br><br>AT PRESENT, a woman cannot cry rape if the man who forces himself on her is her husband. This is because men have marital immunity and cannot be charged with raping their spouses.<br><br>But if an amendment in the Penal Code is passed, husbands will no longer be immune under three circumstances. And, if convicted, they will face the same charges as anyone else found guilty of rape Â— up to 20 years in jail and a caning or fine.<br><br>The three circumstances under which marital immunity can be withdrawn are: If a couple is waiting for their divorce to be finalised; if a woman has taken out a court injunction to restrain her husband from having sex with her; or if a woman has taken up a protection order against her husband.<br><br>If this protection order is breached, husbands can be fined or jailed up to six months Â— a much lighter penalty than a rape conviction.<br><br>Those who breach a court injunction order face a fine and/or jail term that will also be a mere slap on the wrist, even though the maximum sentence would depend on the nature of the injunction.<br><br>Describing non-consensual sexual intercourse in a marriage as a "sensitive issue", the Home Affairs Ministry said it has adopted a "calibrated approach" to protect women whose marriages are on the verge of breaking down or have broken down, rather than abolish marital immunity altogether. "While we do not condone the abuse of women, we have to find a balance between the needs of women who require protection and the general concerns about conjugal rights and the expression of intimacy in a marriage," it said.<br><br>Senior lawyer Peter Low said the proposed law will provide much-needed protection for women between a marriage breakdown and an official court pronouncement of divorce, since divorce is not an instantaneous procedure.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Child-sex hunters in law's crosshairs</strong><br>Overseas jaunts could result in stiff jail sentences<br>TODAYonline<br>Thursday Â• November 9, 2006<br><br>Ansley Ng<br>ansley@mediacorp.com.sg<br><br>SINGAPOREANS who go overseas to have sex with children could soon face the music at home after their jaunt.<br><br>In its current review of the Penal Code, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has recommended that any Singaporean or permanent resident who buys sexual services from a minor under the age of 18 in another country be prosecuted in Singapore, regardless of whether the act is legal in that country.<br><br>The proposed law will have sex-tour organisers on its radar as well.<br><br>"Apprehending a sex tourist removes only one person from the industry," said the MHA. "Shutting down a child-sex tourism agency can block a far greater number of sex tourists."<br><br>Under the proposed law, those found guilty of buying sex from under-18s abroad face up to seven years in jail and a fine with no limit. Those convicted of organising child sex tours could face a similar fine and be jailed up to 10 years.<br><br>The new laws, if approved, will see Singapore join more than 30 countries that have similar laws.<br><br>The calls for child-sex tourism to be criminalised in Singapore have heightened over the past year. MPs raised the issue in the last Parliament, and non-governmental organisations have lobbied for it.<br><br>A Johns Hopkins University study released last year found that Singaporean men form the largest group of those who visit the Indonesian Riau Islands for sex with prostitutes, many of whom are under the age of 18.<br><br>Last April, polytechnic lecturer Darwis Rianto Lim was arrested by Thai police after he placed offers on the Internet to buy sex with teenaged boys in Thailand. Lim subsequently jumped bail and is now on the run.<br><br>But the MHA acknowledges there are constraints that come with the enforcement of extra-territorial laws. Language barriers and different local conditions can make it difficult to trace and interview foreign witnesses and gather evidence.<br><br>Ms Braema Mathi, chairperson of the women and children trafficking sub-committee at the Association of Women for Action and Research, suggested that a taskforce be set up within the Association of Southeast Asian Nations to tackle this "borderless phenomena". She also proposed a hotline be set up to encourage Singaporeans to report such matters to authorities.<br><br>"For this to be effective, all Singaporeans have to keep our eyes wide open to help," said Ms Mathi.<br><br>What's significant, said Unifem Singapore's Saleemah Ismail, is that the country is taking a stand. The proposed law "sends a clear signal that such behaviour is unacceptable in our society. It represents where the nation stands on this issue", she said.<br><br><a href="http://www.todayonline.com/pda/153494ag.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.todayonline.com/pda/153494ag.htm</a></div>
