            <div class='col-md body'>Most Singaporeans have the entitlement attitude as if the world owes them a living.<br><br>there are lots of old folks who would not sit, there are also preggies who do not ask for seat. There are lots of youngsters who fight for a seat with people who need them. There are lots of younsters who would turn a blind eye and play with their toys when lots of tired, worn out, people old, pregnant or whatever stand around them. Well, expect more of these kind of pictures in STOMP in future.<br><br>Seriously, If she is so in need of a seat, she can lift the bag off and put it on the floor. She didn't do anything to help herself beyond asking and expecting people to give way. Anyways, the old guy is entitled to ignore her.<br><br>Just met a aunty, saw me coming towards the lift athough she's already there. She rather not lift her hand and press for the lift. She waited for me to press for her as if I am the lift operator. She got in and expected me to ask her for her floor and proceeded to stand at one corner until she saw I was not going to bother. Then she come forward to press it herself.<br><br>TIS: this is singapore. What did anyone of you expect?</div>

If fact, they had rudly throw other people's packages on the floor.  Is the aunty wrong or is the person who left his stuff on the seat wrong?<br>Its just is. People react differently why do people always expect other people to react/know according to some unwritten 'rules'. Besides, the train does not look too packed. The girl don't have to get all worked up over one old person who didn't give up the seat. Move on to look for the next empty seat lah. By hanging around there and taking pictures just tell me that the woman also cannot let go. You mean in a day, you do not meet any transgressions.<br><br>Nowadays, Singapore people just must win at all cost, feels that they are better than the next person and cannot let go and move on. Is not giving a seat, even to a preggie such a big deal that a picture is taken and posted?<br>Such a lack of grace.<br></div>
