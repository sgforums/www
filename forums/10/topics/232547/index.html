If you are willing to give up your seat on public transport, then our argument here is moot.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Cool it people.<br><br>In my opinion, the blame cannot be placed all on the government. The government policies may be linked (and disliked by me) but it does not present a direct causal effect on the outcome. It can also be argued that there were courtesy campaigns during my time ( anyone remember that smile campaign with that silly looking lion?)<br><br>It is the society's fault and the failure of parents to bring up a civil minded person. Societal norms dictate that if it is not your business, you just turn and look the other way - so people don't bother unless it is an accident and they want to buy 4D numbers off the carplate then it becomes their business to be busy bodies. Another norm involves expecting someone to take the initiative instead of asking directly for something because the person did not want to seem rude. But if they expect and their expectations fall short even though THEY NEVER BOTHER TO ASK-- they will whine like this woman did.<br><br>However the fault cannot be laid totally on the society because you still have considerate Singaporeans around who would gladly do the right thing when it happens in front of them.<br><br>So we can only conclude that it is more of the result of the upbringing and societal norms. People who don't ask and expect to be given something ,as well as People who just look the other way.</div>
