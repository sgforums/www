            <div class='col-md body'>Enough said about Foreign Talents - particularly China ones.<br><br>I feel that our government should put a cap or limit ceiling on the number and types of Foreign Talents coming into Singapore. Look at the number of non-skilled workers, and the multitude of fraudsters and con-artists coming in from China! Some, or rather, quite a number of them are here for jobs that didn't last, and they resort to either overstaying, or compete in our already "sick" employment scene.<br><br>Personally, while some Singaporeans may be choosy, but I strongly believe that most aren't choosy - they simply could not accept low paying jobs BECAUSE of Singapore's High Cost of Living!<br><br>How could anyone, ever hope to support a family (children, aged parents, and household) with S$1500 salary??? EVen if you cut down to just bread and water, it is still barely sufficient!<br><br>And so because our locals aren't having enough babies, the government now encourages and welcomes foreigners to "integrate" and generally boost population. So, from Foreign Talents, we now also have Foreign Babies. And to show that our government have become "flexible", they have opened their sights on Casinos in SIngapore - as this brings in the tourist dollars, but considers the social ills that gambling brings to society here as insignificant, because other countries like the UK, are precieved to have been coping "reasonably well".<br><br>It's all revenue centered. Not people centered. Money first, people take the back seat.<br><br>As such, how do we retain capable Singaporeans who have the means and abilities to fly elsewhere for bigger, better, greener pastures? When will THEY listen to us all??? When it's all too late perhaps??</div>
