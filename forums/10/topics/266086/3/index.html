HK is today in fact very american rather than british.  the success of HK is very much due to HK people, not british.  remember the Peak at central hk?  it was exclusive only to the colonial masters.  li ka shing would have no chance.</div></blockquote>The response was a reply to your so called squandering of wealth passed on from the past generation to the future generation. Don't see any relevance of your reply to my points.<br><br>Something is lacking here, there seems to be a disjunction between knowledge and thought. To the best of my knowledge, Singapore was not yet discovered at the 9th to 15th century.<br><br>Feudalism:<br><br>1) A political and economic system of Europe from the 9th to about the 15th century, based on the holding of all land in fief or fee and the resulting relation of lord to vassal and characterized by homage, legal and military service of tenants, and forfeiture.<br><br>2) A political, economic, or social order resembling this medieval system.<br></div>

It could be conveniently said that the british system was a drag on ireland.<br><br></div></blockquote>What bollocks are you on about?<br><br>The US doesn't "rule" the world, much as its influence in various facets of life are inevitable. As a matter of fact, North Korea is hardly subjected to American influence, nevermind American "rule". Colonial masters like Britain did indeed exercise jurisdiction over their colonies and were therefore legitimate rulers of such lands - now, will you start talking sense and distinguish the roles played by Britain as colonial masters and the US as a dominant superpower?<br><br>And what are you trying to prove besides shooting yourself in the foot about the whole Li Ka Shing story? The fact of the matter is HK remained a British colony until 30th June 1997 and Li Ka Shing was already a prominent (and rather opulent) chap then. And you're suggesting Li Ka Shing would have had no chance of excelling in life under the Brits when the fact clearly contradicts your warped opinion?<br><br>Don't even get started on Ireland, given your limited knowledge on the background behind the Irish political history and its economic development.</div>
