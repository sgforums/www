So your scenario is not valid. </span><br><br>The 1955 election was the first lively political contest in Singapore's history. Automatic registration expanded the register of voters from 75,000 to over 300,000, and for the first time, it included large numbers of Chinese, who had manifested political apathy in previous elections. The Labor Front won 10 seats. The Peoples Action Party (PAP), which fielded four candidates, won three seats. David Marshall became Singapore's first Chief Minister on 6 April 1955, with a coalition government made up of his own Labor Front, the United Malays National Organization and the Malayan Chinese Association .<br><br>Marshall resigned on 6 June 1956, after the breakdown of constitutional talks in London on attaining full internal self government. Lim Yew Hock, Marshall's deputy and minister for Labor became the Chief Minister. The March 1957 constitutional mission to London led by Lim Yew Hock was successful in negotiating the main terms of a new Singapore Constitution. On 28 May 1958, the Constitutional Agreement was signed in London.<br><br><strong>Self-government was attained in 1959.</strong> In May that year Singapore's first general election was held to choose 51 representatives to the first fully elected Legislative Assembly. The PAP won 43 seats, gleaning 53.4 percent of the total votes. On June 3, the new Constitution confirming Singapore as a self-governing state was brought into force by the proclamation of the Governor, Sir William Goode, who became the first Yang di-Pertuan Negara (Head of State). The first Government of the State of Singapore was sworn in on June 5, with Lee Kuan Yew as Singapore's first Prime Minister.<br><br>The PAP had come to power in a united front with the communists to fight British colonialism. The communists controlled many mass organizations, especially of workers and students. It was an uneasy alliance between the PAP moderates and the pro communists, with each side trying to use the other for its own ultimate objective--in the case of the moderates, to obtain full independence for Singapore as part of a non-communist Malaya; in the case of the communists, to work towards a communist take-over.<br><br>The tension between the two factions worsened from 1960 and led to an open split in l961, with the pro-communists subsequently forming a new political party, the Barisan Sosialis. The other main players in this drama were the Malayans, who, in 1961, agreed to Singapore's merger with Malaya as part of a larger federation. This was also to include British territories in Borneo, with the British controlling the foreign affairs, defense and internal security of Singapore.<br><br>The Malaysia Proposal<br><br><strong>On 27 May 1961, the Malayan Prime Minister, Tunku Abdul Rahman, proposed closer political and economic co-operation between the Federation of Malaya, Singapore, Sarawak, North Borneo and Brunei in the form of a merger.</strong> The main terms of the merger, agreed on by him and Lee Kuan Yew, were to have central government responsibility for defense, foreign affairs and internal security, but local autonomy in matters pertaining to education and labor. A referendum on the terms of the merger held in Singapore on 1 September 1962 showed the people's overwhelming support for PAP's plan to go ahead with the merger.<br><br>Malaysia was formed on 16 September 1963, and consisted of the Federation of Malaya, Singapore, Sarawak and North Borneo (now Sabah). Brunei opted out. Indonesia and the Philippines opposed the merger. President Sukarno of Indonesia worked actively against it during the three years of Indonesian confrontation.<br><br>Independence<br><br>The merger proved to be short-lived. Singapore was separated from the rest of Malaysia on 9 August 1965, and became a sovereign, democratic and independent nation.<br><br>Independent Singapore was admitted to the United Nations on 21 September 1965, and became a member of the Common wealth of Nations on 15 October 1965. On 22 December 1965, it became a republic, with Yusof bin Ishak as the republic's first President.<br><br>Thereafter commenced Singapore's struggle to survive and prosper on its own. It also had to create a sense of national identity and consciousness among a disparate population of immigrants. Singapore's strategy for survival and development was essentially to take advantage of its strategic location and the favourable world economy.<br><br><a href="http://inic.utexas.edu/asnic/countries/singapore/Singapore-History.html" rel="nofollow">Source: University of Texas</a><br><br></div>

Nuisance in the neighborhood can be a noisy dog, or dirty c o ckcroaches, the Chan family just happens to be a human nuisance. Applying your logic or mentality, nuisance such as dogs and c o ckcroaches are small problem, can handle, human is big problem, cannot handle, so quit. To the families in Joo Chiat, "this is my home, no quitting! we join force, we cooperate, want to make monkey faces, want to fight in court, we fong bei." See the difference?<br><br></div></blockquote><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by maurizio13:</div><div class="quote_body"><span style="color: darkred;">Secondly, don't make wide sweeping statements like "None of the families involved in the Joo Chiat families moves away". Have you done any research on this topic or have you any proof that none of them moved away.</span> The houses in that particular enclave ranges from unit 130 to 152, with alphabets from "a" to "c "suffixing the numerical units. There could be 30 to 40 families living there. Can you say that Mr. Chan only offended 7 families? Is it not possible that there could be families not wanting to pursue due process chose to relocate instead? Can you say that no families relocated from that enclave within that 10 years time span? So unless you have conducted interviews with all the families there and provide reasonable proof that nobody relocated within that 10 years time frame, then you can proceed to make such sweeping statement. You can only say, 7 families decide to take legal action against Mr. Chan.<br><br></div></blockquote><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by sgdiehard:</div><div class="quote_body"><span style="color: blue;">You prove to me that families have moved out</span> because "all else fails, the only other alternative is to move away from him".
