            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><strong>Originally posted by maurizio13:</strong><br><br><span style="color: darkred;">If Singapore was still under British rule, Singapore will have never been a state under Malaysia. So your scenario is not valid. </span><br><br>The 1955 election was the first lively political contest in Singapore's history. Automatic registration expanded the register of voters from 75,000 to over 300,000, and for the first time, it included large numbers of Chinese, who had manifested political apathy in previous elections. The Labor Front won 10 seats. The Peoples Action Party (PAP), which fielded four candidates, won three seats. David Marshall became Singapore's first Chief Minister on 6 April 1955, with a coalition government made up of his own Labor Front, the United Malays National Organization and the Malayan Chinese Association .<br><br>Marshall resigned on 6 June 1956, after the breakdown of constitutional talks in London on attaining full internal self government. Lim Yew Hock, Marshall's deputy and minister for Labor became the Chief Minister. The March 1957 constitutional mission to London led by Lim Yew Hock was successful in negotiating the main terms of a new Singapore Constitution. On 28 May 1958, the Constitutional Agreement was signed in London.<br><br><strong>Self-government was attained in 1959.</strong> In May that year Singapore's first general election was held to choose 51 representatives to the first fully elected Legislative Assembly. The PAP won 43 seats, gleaning 53.4 percent of the total votes. On June 3, the new Constitution confirming Singapore as a self-governing state was brought into force by the proclamation of the Governor, Sir William Goode, who became the first Yang di-Pertuan Negara (Head of State). The first Government of the State of Singapore was sworn in on June 5, with Lee Kuan Yew as Singapore's first Prime Minister.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="color: red;">The PAP had come to power in a united front with the communists to fight British colonialism. The communists controlled many mass organizations, especially of workers and students</span></span>. It was an uneasy alliance between the PAP moderates and the pro communists, with each side trying to use the other for its own ultimate objective--in the case of the moderates, to obtain full independence for Singapore as part of a non-communist Malaya; in the case of the communists, to work towards a communist take-over.<br><br>The tension between the two factions worsened from 1960 and led to an open split in l961, with the pro-communists subsequently forming a new political party, the Barisan Sosialis. The other main players in this drama were the Malayans, who, in 1961, agreed to Singapore's merger with Malaya as part of a larger federation. This was also to include British territories in Borneo, with the British controlling the foreign affairs, defense and internal security of Singapore.<br><br></blockquote><span style="color: darkred;">My compliments for your very mature posts and analysis with substantial supporting information to back-up your position.<br><br>On the point above concerning the <span style="font-style: italic;">''coalition of the PAP in a united front with communists''</span> - it is common view and opinion of the British Colonial Office that anyone engaged in Worker's Rights, Union Activism, Student Agitation are all labelled as <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>'Communists'</strong></span>.<br><br>It was during a period when <span style="font-style: italic;">'Socialism'</span> was portrayed as synonymous with <span style="font-style: italic;">'Communism'</span>, as it was <span style="font-style: italic;">'common'</span> for the <span style="font-style: italic;">'Communists'</span> to have taken serious interests in the welfare of the common people - <span style="font-style: italic;">'the Proletariat'</span> in its <span style="font-style: italic;">'perceived Class struggle'</span>.<br><br>Is it not surprising that with growing social awareness and activism during the 1960s, university student agitation in the USA, Europe and even in UK is no longer associated with <span style="font-style: italic;">'Communism'</span>; and even more so today in the 21st Century - with the collapse of Communism that resulted in the death of a convenient <span style="font-style: italic;">''Whipping Boy''</span> for the <span style="font-style: italic;">'Autocrats'</span> ?<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">''Unionism''</span> has loss its synonymous link with <span style="font-style: italic;">'Communism'</span>, and <span style="font-style: italic;">''Socialism''</span> for the welfare of the common people has been derided as <span style="font-style: italic;">''Welfarism''</span> that weakens the human energy to work for itself, and the Communist inspired term <span style="font-style: italic;">''Proletariat'</span> is no longer politically fashionable.<br><br>With the present day opening of the Colonial Records Office in London, which maintained all records in secrecy for over forty years, this event allow us a look back in time to the period of early Political History of Singapore.<br><br>The question that must be asked is how valid are the views that <span style="font-style: italic;">''communism and communist activities''</span> is strife in Singapore, and that the PAP had made a pact with <span style="font-style: italic;">''the devils''</span> (those supposedly <span style="font-style: italic;">''Communists''</span>) ?<br><br>From the Colonial archives, it has been revealed that the British Special Branch had investigated LKY - as a young 25 year old activist trained in Law, and representing the Trade Unions - and found him <span style="font-style: italic;">''not''</span> a Communist.<br><br>The similar archives now has also revealed that <strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Lim Chin Siong has no Communist links too</span></strong> - and was even introduced by LKY to Chief Minister David Marshall as the <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>'Future Prime Minister of Singapore''</strong></span> for the supposed reknown <span style="font-style: italic;">'oratory skills in public'</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">'the mass grass root support'</span> that Lim Chin Siong has.<br><br>Yet, Lim Chin Siong was incarcerated by LKY for being a Communist, as Chia Thye Poh was also incarcerated for 32 years, while Lim Chin Siong had a mental breakdown and decided to exile himself in UK - without signing any papers admitting to be a Communist (as was a condition imposed on Chia Thye Poh, who refused to sign any forced admission till this day).<br><br>Were there so many Communists in Singapore's early political history, or was there a similar <span style="font-style: italic;"><a href="http://www.learnhistory.org.uk/usa/mccarthy.htm" rel="nofollow">''McCarthy Witch Hunt''</a></span> similar to that in the USA during the same 1950s period, and which trifled on the Individual Rights and damaging reputations ?<br><br>The Republican <span style="font-style: italic;"><a href="http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/USAmccarthy.htm" rel="nofollow">Joseph McCarthy</a></span> used his infamous <span style="font-style: italic;">''Witch Hunt Strategy''</span> against his political Democrat opponents, whom he viewed as liberals and easily labelled as <span style="font-style: italic;">'Communist'</span> - a strategy not unfamiliar in the politics of Singapore.<br><br>The <span style="font-style: italic;">''checks and balance''</span> and magnanimity of the People and Political System of the US allowed the truth to surface and acknowledged those wrongly accused in the <span style="font-style: italic;">''McCarthy Witch Hunt''</span>.<br><br>Could we see a similar Singapore apology given to those who have been wrongly accused - from those whose power remained unchecked for the last 52 years ?<br><br>This is unlikely to happen, as the entire credibility structure will start to loosen, and in any case there is no political pressure to do so, as unlike the US Citizens - Singaporeans have no political voice, and are less magnanimous in our political culture as purposefully nurtured by those in Power.<br><br>Singapore - a gracious society ?<br><br>It probably could happen under British Rule and nuture.<br></span><br></div>
