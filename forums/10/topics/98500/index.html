            <div class='col-md body'>Do comment, but I am not here for a heated argument or engage new enemies or whatsoever.  Kinda of long passage but enjoy reading!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised"><br><br>My 2-centsÂ…<br><br>Every time when we try exploring why terrorist exist in this world, maybe we should try understanding psychology regarding this issue first. Regardless of whether what oneÂ’s doing is fanatics or whatsoever, that particular kind of actions or behaviour can be classified as Â‘psychotic actsÂ’ - agree? This does not only exist in international level, but I could say that a Â‘terroristÂ’ exist in most of us. Why? Just take a look around our neighbourhood and closely our daily lives, it is there, every moment, everywhere.<br><br>Let me relate a true incident to you and let you reader to judge. What I am going to write here involves a motorcyclist and a motor-vehicle i.e myself.<br><br>In order to travel to work, I always need to turn into the main Choa Chu Kang Road near the future Police Academy facility. Usually the traffic will be rather busy as the road is a single lane road and the road gets jammed up due to the security checks new the TAB. Normally I would have a hard time getting into the traffic. Not much different today as well  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>Today, I went thru the same procedure, waiting for my opportunity to turn into the main road. I notice afar there were 3 motorcycles headed my way; I suppose that they are approximately 150 metres or more away from where I was, so I went ahead and make my turn into the main road. Everything was fined, a check on my rear view mirror and turns out that the bikes were still some distance away from me - good clearance I should say. Standard legal speed, but wait! There was one particular bike that seems to be accelerating rather fast come towards my rear. It tail gated me, and then move to my right, getting extremely close to my vehicle. I could have knocked him down with just a accidental twitch on my steering wheel.<br><br>I thought of this as nothing initially, but I was wrong. The motorbike proceeds to overtake my vehicle and remain a slow moving pace in the middle of the lane. And I thought he was in a hurry? Not so, he just wants to get in front of me, but then again? Motorcycles have the ability to zip in and out of narrow traffic and move on faster than other vehicles. So whatÂ’s the problem with this bike? I am not sure. Perhaps, his Â‘heartÂ’ cannot accept another vehicle that joins Â‘hisÂ’ traffic - when it is in front of his way? Anyway, he continues to go on a rather slow pace hogging the road for like 5 minutes or more. As we are heading towards the Lim Chu Kang direction, this hogging did not stop until we almost reach Teen Challenge compound. The reason I put it as hogging is that this motorbike is travelling like as if it is a car, leading slow pace and yet staying in the middle of lane all this while. I am sure you see don't this often. It didnÂ’t occur to me that he was up to something.<br><br>As I said, it was until we reached Teen Challenge that he finally, following a Nissan, he impatiently overtook some 5 vehicles, including a TIBS/SMART bus, with another vehicle heading towards them in the opposite direction (on the opposite lane) and all this was done when the road begins to slope up (huge blind spot!). This is not all. Everything makes sense (the hogging, the close brush with my vehicle, the overtaking though he only travel slowly etc), when he finally reached the cross junction at the end of the TAB. I was going to turn left into the slip road for Jurong; I think he was heading towards Lim Chu Kang area - who the hell knows as he never signals. When he stopped at the junctions waiting the traffic light to turn green, he yanked up his helmetÂ’s visor, and turns around and stared at me while I was reaching the junction and readying to turn into the slip road into Jalan Bahar. His eyes were virtually glued to my vehicle and me! As my sister was lo-panging my car, we were both rather taken aback as this motorcyclist is not young but at least in his 60s already and yet, he his behaving like a immature adult. Unbelievable. I have been driving for 8 years now and never had I single problem with motorcyclist. At least not with this kind of species... For those who drives, you know how motorcyclist manages to get pass you whenever he had been overtaken and if you're slow and almost 90% of them always travel on either side of the lane, never in the middle. Anyway, I did a check on my rear-view mirror again and he was pointing and talking to the motorcycle behind him, properly complaining about me...*sigh* when can people start growing up and what the h*** did I do wrong?<br><br>Today incident reminds me of a similar event some 3-4 months ago. It was an exact scenario (and the same area) and that time I was horned by the motorcycle. The thing, he wasn't even close when I turned into the main road! It was memorable, because I never hear any motorcycles horned at any vehicle before. They always manage to get past any Â‘obstaclesÂ’ that Â‘gets in their wayÂ’.  Could it be the same person? I am not sure, but most probably.<br><br>Maybe it is the Â‘psychotic mindÂ’ that we have in us that makes always feel Â‘unfairÂ’? Unfair even though fellow beings have signalled their intention to change lane? Unfair because there was traffic jam and you cannot wait but others can should and can wait? So we jumped queue, because the traffic jam is causing unfairness in you (but not to others?)? In this case, we shouldnÂ’t be complaining or commenting about things like youth robbing, raping and causing mischiefs, IF we think this form of Â‘psychoticÂ’ behaviour is rightful just  because we are treated unfairly. Why? Because the youth in question could be thinking the same too. They will think that it is unfair for them to be deprived of something in their life that they have to resort to crime in order bring a balance to this unfairness. Is this the case? I not sure this should be. YouÂ’ll be the judge.<br><br>Everyone has their own selfish reasons and itÂ’s always about me, me and me. Most of us have a fanaticÂ’s side in us. We held on to things and would do almost everything for it (our believes), this include hobbies or causes (protecting the sharks? the trees etc, but I'm not saying this is wrong) that we believe in so dearly. In the process of doing so, we never bother to think what will happen as consequence of our actions. Just like the saying goes: "one man's pain is another man gain."<br><br>I am not sure whatÂ’s the professional term for this Â‘psychoticÂ’ behaviour or strange phenomenon in us, but most vengeances are the results of this behavior. We envy, we jealous and we hate and usually extreme hatred turns in violence. We envy what others have achieves, envy that they can make such a progress. We are jealous of their achievement, we are jealous that they can achieve more than us. Finally we hate them for what they are Â– for being our perceived Â‘achieverÂ’.<br><br>To be continuedÂ…<br></div>
