              <p>Must say thank you to lee hsien loong the very "compassionate" and "kind" pm of singapore.  This time the percentage of the price hike is more than before.    During good times, keep increasing, during bad times continue to increase but increase even more to "help" people cope.   </p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Beating Inflation.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hang on there and lets get some facts straight, before we make a mountain out of a molehill.</p>
              <p><br>Currently, inflation is hovering around 6-7%, which means for every $100 you spent for household essential goods as per CPI basket of products, yesterday or last 3mths ago, now you have to spend $106.<br>If you have 2 kids, wife and a HDB, you would probably spend an average of $800/mth on CPI goods.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thus at the current rate of inflation, it means you will spend $848/mth or $48 more this month.<br>So, how can a household beat inflation?</p>
              <p><br>Simple measures, for example, just an example - you take feeder bus to MRT, 500-1000 metres from your home. It would cost you $2 per day through and fro journeys, totalling $60/mth. Should you take a short slow 15 min excersing walk to the MRT or back home, you would save $60. Viola! you beat inflation, and need not dump money into investments to match inflation.</p>
              <p><br>Even if you are too tired after work to walk home, you would have only $18 more to beat.</p>
              <p><br>If you are driving, then you must have needed a car in your work and would be either paid as expenses by the company, or if not, you would be making enough profits to cover the cost and maintenance of the car. Inflation too, will affect you, but at only $48, plan your trips properly and you would have easily beaten inflation.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However, the truth of the matter about grouses and complain is not about inflation, but rather, the high cost of luxury good we aspire to have.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I too am human and understand the need for luxuries, but am sane enough to realize that i must spend on only what i can afford, for such products are expensive and are not essential to my life. I can live without it, and it is not a daily item i buy regularly such as TVs, Mps, sound systems, etc. It is a big ticket item, so we must save up for that one-time purchase.</p>
              <p><br>Should inflationary makes such items more expensive, then we must look for alternatives - different competitive brands, or even second hand, afterall, what we want that product for is the happiness it can bring to us momentarily. New or used, no one knows except yourself, even for a prada bag.</p>
              <p><br>So do get it straight - <strong>its not the high cost of living that we are suffering, but the high cost of our aspirations</strong>.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>No one, no society or govt has that kind of money to fund our dreams, except we individually by ourselves. Society and govts can only provide opportunities - education, social equality and business ease.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Daily essential material goods are still within reach in Singapore. No one dies of hunger or don't have a roof over his/her head unless he/she stubbornly wants it that way for his/her life. So don't let that 6% inflation rate or recession scare you numb. It is not an unsurmountable figure or term as long as you have brains, hands and legs. </p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Beating Inflation.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hang on there and lets get some facts straight, before we make a
                      mountain out of a molehill.</p>
              <p><br> Currently, inflation is hovering around 6-7%, which means for every
                      $100 you spent for household essential goods as per CPI basket of
                      products, yesterday or last 3mths ago, now you have to spend
                      $106.<br> If you have 2 kids, wife and a HDB, you would probably spend an
                      average of $800/mth on CPI goods.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thus at the current rate of inflation, it means you will spend
                      $848/mth or $48 more this month.<br> So, how can a household beat inflation?</p>
              <p><br> Simple measures, for example, just an example - you take feeder bus
                      to MRT, 500-1000 metres from your home. It would cost you $2 per
                      day through and fro journeys, totalling $60/mth. Should you take a
                      short slow 15 min excersing walk to the MRT or back home, you would
                      save $60. Viola! you beat inflation, and need not dump money into
                      investments to match inflation.</p>
              <p><br> Even if you are too tired after work to walk home, you would have
                      only $18 more to beat.</p>
              <p><br> If you are driving, then you must have needed a car in your work
                      and would be either paid as expenses by the company, or if not, you
                      would be making enough profits to cover the cost and maintenance of
                      the car. Inflation too, will affect you, but at only $48, plan your
                      trips properly and you would have easily beaten inflation.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However, the truth of the matter about grouses and complain is
                      not about inflation, but rather, the high cost of luxury good we
                      aspire to have.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I too am human and understand the need for luxuries, but am sane
                      enough to realize that i must spend on only what i can afford, for
                      such products are expensive and are not essential to my life. I can
                      live without it, and it is not a daily item i buy regularly such as
                      TVs, Mps, sound systems, etc. It is a big ticket item, so we must
                      save up for that one-time purchase.</p>
              <p><br> Should inflationary makes such items more expensive, then we must
                      look for alternatives - different competitive brands, or even
                      second hand, afterall, what we want that product for is the
                      happiness it can bring to us momentarily. New or used, no one knows
                      except yourself, even for a prada bag.</p>
              <p><br> So do get it straight - <strong>its not the high cost of living
                      that we are suffering, but the high cost of our
                      aspirations</strong>.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>No one, no society or govt has that kind of money to fund our
                      dreams, except we individually by ourselves. Society and govts can
                      only provide opportunities - education, social equality and

If we spend it on gasoline, it goes to the Arabs. If we buy a computer, it will go to India. If we purchase fruit and vegetables, it will go to Mexico, Honduras, and Guatemala. If we purchase a good car, it will go to Germany. If we purchase useless crap, it will go to Taiwan and none of it will help the American economy.

If we purchase a HDB flat, it goes back to them. If we buy a pack of cigarette or a beer most of the money goes back to them. if we hire a maid, half the money goes back to them, If we eat at a coffee shop, the rental goes back to them, if we visit prostitutes in geyland, the licensing fees goes back to them.<br><br>AND<br><br>Water and electricity bill will go up.

              <p>Marc Faber comment on US economy - TOO GOOD<br> <br> Investment analyst and entrepreneur Dr. Marc Faber concluded his
              monthly bulletin (June 2008) with the Following:<br> <br> ''The federal government is sending each of us a $600 rebate.<br> <br> If we spend that money at Wal-Mart, the money goes to China. If we
              spend it on gasoline, it goes to the Arabs. If we buy a computer,
              it will go to India. If we purchase fruit and vegetables, it will
              go to Mexico, Honduras, and Guatemala. If we purchase a good car,
              it will go to Germany. If we purchase useless crap, it will go to
              Taiwan and none of it will help the American economy. The only way
              to keep that money here at home is to spend it on prostitutes and
              beer, since these are the only products still produced in US. I've
              been doing my part.'<br> <br> At least he has the choice of spending that money<br> <br> If our government is sending each of us a $600 rebate<br> <br> If we spend that money at NTUC, the money goes to back to them. If
              we spend it on Toto &amp; 4D, it goes back to them. If we buy a
              car, the COE money goes back to them. If our cars travel on the
              road, the money goes back to them. If we purchase a HDB flat, it
              goes back to them. If we buy a pack of cigarette or a beer most of
              the money goes back to them. if we hire a maid, half the money goes
              back to them, If we eat at a coffee shop, the rental goes back to
              them, if we visit prostitutes in geyland, the licensing fees goes
              back to them.<br> <br> AND<br> <br> Water and electricity bill will go up. Hospital Bill will go up.
              Telephone bill will go up. ERP will go up. Car park fee will go up.
              Petrol price will go up. Service charge will go up. GST will go up.
              Bus &amp; MRT Fare will go up. Taxi fare will go up. Kopi O will go
              up. Chicken rice will go up. - only our pay didnt go up?<br> <br> In our case they are taking back much more</p>

              <p>hmm..visiting a crack whore will be indirectly giving money to the columbians. Visiting a normal prostitute would be giving money to the mexicans. Else he is just patronising a foreign prostitute.</p>
