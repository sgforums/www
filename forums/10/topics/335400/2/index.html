              <p>Marc Faber comment on US economy - TOO GOOD<br><br>Investment analyst and entrepreneur Dr. Marc Faber concluded his monthly bulletin (June 2008) with the Following:<br><br>''The federal government is sending each of us a $600 rebate.<br><br>If we spend that money at Wal-Mart, the money goes to China. If we spend it on gasoline, it goes to the Arabs. If we buy a computer, it will go to India. If we purchase fruit and vegetables, it will go to Mexico, Honduras, and Guatemala. If we purchase a good car, it will go to Germany. If we purchase useless crap, it will go to Taiwan and none of it will help the American economy. The only way to keep that money here at home is to spend it on prostitutes and beer, since these are the only products still produced in US. I've been doing my part.'<br><br>At least he has the choice of spending that money<br><br>If our government is sending each of us a $600 rebate<br><br>If we spend that money at NTUC, the money goes to back to them. If we spend it on Toto &amp; 4D, it goes back to them. If we buy a car, the COE money goes back to them. If our cars travel on the road, the money goes back to them. If we purchase a HDB flat, it goes back to them. If we buy a pack of cigarette or a beer most of the money goes back to them. if we hire a maid, half the money goes back to them, If we eat at a coffee shop, the rental goes back to them, if we visit prostitutes in geyland, the licensing fees goes back to them.<br><br>AND<br><br>Water and electricity bill will go up. Hospital Bill will go up. Telephone bill will go up. ERP will go up. Car park fee will go up. Petrol price will go up. Service charge will go up. GST will go up. Bus &amp; MRT Fare will go up. Taxi fare will go up. Kopi O will go up. Chicken rice will go up. - only our pay didnt go up?<br><br>In our case they are taking back much more</p>

              <p><br>And who are the 'they' you are alluding to? None other than society - us. The money doesnt go into any single individual, but are used for the common good through social spending for this generation and the next.</p>
              <p><br>And it was these funds that help prop up our financial market to restore confidence. Without it, life would be tougher for us all.</p>
              <p> <br>Many often complain about the govt and the cpf system. Some gulliable ones believed such grouses and withdrew their monies to invest on their own - and lost big time. Hurting not only themselves, but our society - $500 million sing dollars out of our shores.</p>
              <p><br>If they had only left in their CPF, they would have had something to look forward to later in life. Fortunately, some of them will getting money back. May they learn their lesson. Our society may not be so kind and generous the next time.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And may those who complain and attempt to tear down our society's institutions be more circumspect next time. People do get burn listening to wrong advices.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><br>If one's pay is not enough, one is free to quit and look for another job that pays well, or even form his/her own company and earn salaries more than minister. No one can complain about that. Ability and talent is what one needs. only losers compain, whine, bitch and moan.</p>
              <p><br>There is only so much society can do. We are only a small fish in the deep ocean of living organisms. There are issues of which we have no control of, and have to seek the best solution or option to overcome obstacles, at times not neccessarily populistic moves, that will arouse the anger of bums and loafers. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>That we could survive till today is due to the hardwork, character and mental strength of our forefathers. It is in our genes to survive and succeed, but the choice to do so lies within yourself. Sympathy and empathy will get us nowhere.</p>
