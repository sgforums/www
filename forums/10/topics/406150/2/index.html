              <p>it's the norm for slashings, fightings in a country. There are countries that are poorer than Singapore, those countries are still surviving now. Again, I'm referring to '<strong>country</strong>'; it's useless to say that poor countries have<strong> people</strong> who are earning big bucks.</p>

              <p>there are countries where the severity of the incidents in point 1-9 are much higher compared to Singapore. Those countries are still surviving..again, I'm comparing<strong> countries</strong>. I didn't state that the <strong>people</strong> in those countries are still 'surviving'..anyway, surviving means 'not dead'. Hence, those people are still surviving (without '')</p>

              <p>Despite being paid so much, they are simply useless and irresponsible and even trying to push the arrow to a organisation.</p>
              <p>The only thing that they are good at the moment are to claim shamelessly for credits they dun deserved, to look impressive on camera, dance hip hop, use a facebook and publicise their recovery after a operation in which they failed to notice that there are insufficient hospital beds.</p>

              <p>Not everything is about Singapore, not everything is about the Singaporeans...</p>
              <p>Who are our feverish nationalists here referring to as "us," "Singaporeans," "we," "local," and "native?</p>
              <p>Chinese, Malay, Indian? or the Tangren only?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The understanding of our initial poster is flawed regarding LKY's comment--you see, you do not take everything as stated in English, it goes for other languages as well. Every language is capable of its own humor, nuances, sarcasm, maybe you should ask LKY himself or more native speakers of English to get what LKY meant with his statement.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Personal industry and virtue may have brought us into better life circumstances, but is it all our own? Maybe we should look at what others before us have done for us. Consider yourself being born in Myanmar, the Philippines, Bangladesh, would you attain the status you have today? In such circumstances, individuals would have to work hard, twice, thrice, a hundred times even in order to equal the "Singapore lifestyle." Human beings are not equal in the same way that opportunities in life aren't.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It has been a cause for concern among the Americans and Europeans (Ang Mohs) that the rapid increase in China's wealth is somewhat unhealthy for the Chinese people. Who can blame them? Forty years of economic progress in Singapore and yet its people are not showing modest signs of emotional maturity. It is never enough to earn the buck, one also needs to know how to 1) use it, 2) keep some of it, 3) make it grow, 4) realize its true value--economically and socially. Europe with all its sensibilities is aghast with the behavior of Singaporeans,  because the latter are disproving one important direct linear relationship: as living conditions improve to be more conducive for human living, so must our behavior  be. A sense of humanity may be lacking in Singapore, and who is most guilty? I don't know, we should ask our nationalists here, is it across all lines or is it particular to one?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You may talk like the financiers, economic geniuses that you are, good schooling, good teachers, but realize that even economics is a social science. Discussions on human populations, their different qualities and subsequent interactions started the ball rolling, even before stocks and derivatives came into the picture. Do we really need a gargantuan GDP for so few people? Apparently yes, because it is what the current [global economic] system dictates, even if the wealth is more ephemereal than physical. Singapore does not need the foreigners? Hmmmmm... let me paint a picture:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>you feel disadvantaged now, maybe in a few years that break will come for you (don't be bored waiting, you're a Singaporean, your chances are way better than a Myanmarese, Filipino, or Bangladeshi)</p>
              <p>congratulations Mr. Manager, so your wife wants to eat at that swanky restaurant, who's going to serve her? the Singaporean not that better off</p>
              <p>wow that food attendant made it to branch manager, no matter there are disadvantaged populations, still Singapore citizens though</p>
              <p>shiok! Singapore is filled to the brim with opportunities, even that one has made it to manager, maybe we should make robots or train monkeys to serve all of us?</p>
              <p>now multiply this situation to the one selling your wife a handbag in the future, cleaning your house, parking your car, servicing your utilities, accepting your huge bank deposits, advicing you on your investments, refining the petrol for your benz, cleaning up the air after you. consulting you on your appearance so it actually reflects your net worth...</p>
              <p>Singapore is not the Philippines, it's not Indonesia, it's not Cambodia, it cannot sustain 70 years serving you and the economy with pure blooded Singaporeans, if there is one; especially since everyone wants to be the "boss."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You say the government is unfair, favoring cheap and unskilled (how sure are you about this?) labor. Prioritizing this and that, what about the beggars, the Singaporeans who are still poor, and you say you want real democracy? Give me a democratic society without a poor individual, without a disadvantaged citizen. Equality is never the right course for any form of society simply because it is impractical, even abstract. Egalitarian? maybe. Equitable? yes. TO EACH WHAT IS APPROPRIATE FOR HIM/HERSELF. Your Singapore government has given you half of the silver spoon dear nationalists, it is up to you to forge the other half. The foundations and scaffolding have been made for you, it's up to you to finish up the house. Don't make me give another analogy.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The early philosopher talked of men of gold, men of lead, men of iron, that everyone must fulfill the role their substance dictated in order to create a harmonious society. Now this goes against self-determination and the Americans and atheists won't like that. So let us modify it in such a way that an individual determines for himself his own substance. One thing is certain, not everyone will be made of gold or make himself out of gold. No matter the arrogance, a person is still capable of self-realization, he/she knows what he/she is really made of.</p>
              <p><br>Try to be more abstract, foreigners outnumbering you on the bus? Imagine them taking over the government and subjugating you, not competing for that job and that salary because it automatically goes to them. I can forgive you for the lapses in understanding English ( which somehow is still foreign in this country), but to see things with no insight whatsoever, no empathy, no deeper understanding--a chastising you are not in for, but lamenting for your immaturity, ignorance, and hubris for the welfare of other people.</p>
