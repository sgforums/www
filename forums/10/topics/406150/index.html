              <p>The end of singapore is coming soon as we can see from these signs.</p>
              <p>1. Population of singaporeans getting lesser while foreigners keep on increasing.</p>
              <p>2. Wages remain the same while prices and taxes keep increasing.</p>
              <p>3. PAP Ministers salary keep increasing but ordinary people salary remains stagnant.</p>
              <p>4. Prices of HDB flats keep rising until we can no longer afford to buy a house to stay.</p>
              <p>5. PAP keep on losing billions of dollars in investment.</p>
              <p>6. The old man Lee seems to be an immortal that never dies. He will reign singapore forever.</p>
              <p>7. Foreigners keep on going around slashing and killing singaporeans while the stupid police can even let the handicap Mas Selamat escape.</p>
              <p>8. More trees are falling down and soon there will be no more trees in singapore left.</p>
              <p>9. More floods are happening in singapore and soon singapore will become just an ocean.</p>

              <p>but frankly, the defeatist hope that singapore will come to and end just to prove themselves correct is kinda sick don't you think?</p>
              <p>it's like.. i declare that your mom is going to die a horrible death of terrible diseases and here are the reasons.. and i'm right so you can suck your thumb coz i'm making these statements out of contempt for you...</p>
              <p>it's despicable and shows that their parents didn't bring them up right...</p>

              <p>1. This was what happened in 1900s. Those immigrants stayed in Singapore and produced children. Hmmm.... I wondered where you came from. </p>
              <p>4. Prices rise because people can afford to pay the higher price. So it's not "we" can't afford to buy, it's just "you". </p>
              <p>5. So Temasek Holdings only made S$4.6 billion in net profits...</p>
              <p>6. He is going to die someday. Probably outlive me, but he will probably be gone by 3000.</p>
              <p>7. Mas Selamat is old news. At least bash the train graffiti thing. </p>
              <p>8. What has trees got to do with the end of Singapore? Are trees anchoring Singapore to the ground or something?</p>
              <p>9. China is flooding. Malaysia is flooding. Pakistan is flooding. USA is flooding. Everywhere else is flooding. </p>

              <p>The end of Gracehp is coming soon as we can see from these signs.</p>
              <p>1. He fears for his life when he sees unfamiliar faces.</p>
              <p>2. He is running out of money to cope with new prices and taxes.</p>
              <p>3. His salary is stagnant while all others are getting pay rise.</p>
              <p>5. He no longer afford to buy a house to stay.</p>
              <p>6. Seeing end of his day coming, old man Lee does seem immortal .</p>
              <p>6. He fears everything, from robbers to falling trees, water, and probably falling leaves in the night.</p>
              <p>sigh.... why were you even born at all?</p>

              <p>I think number 6 is the ruddest thing one can say. True there are some things we do not like on his implementation. But do you know, just because of this 1 person, the Singapore economy can still float? I can bet every cent in my bank that all stocks and economy in Singapore is going to drop because of his leaving. Ever consider the reason why is there PM, MM, and SM? Putting aside more income, it could be more due to the fact that Singapore cannot survive without him (but I would raise an eyebrow on his recently speeches). An old man with enough fortune to last 10 generations still work generally means something is wrong with the whole system.</p>

              <p>The recent spate of events have clearly prove that we are paying millions to a bunch of incompetent fools who are not willing to take responsibility and provide solutions when going get tough.</p>
              <p>What was shown is the guy in charge is hiding behind the god grand father and not coming forward to solve the issues.</p>
              <p>Instead, a certain organisation was blamed for not informing the public and not solving the issues.</p>
              <p>There is not enough proof to show that a certain white elephant barrage is NOT  the cause.</p>
              <p>End of the day is that the old man have to blame it to the weather.</p>
              <p>This clearly shown that the existing bunch of croonies are not looking forward and waiting for things to happen and take cover.</p>
              <p>That is why old man still have to come over to defend these croonies.</p>
              <p>But, he is actually the cause of the pathetic situation now as he wanted his prince to become the eventual king.</p>
              <p>The end result is a bunch of wayang and merry making monkeys who are good at putting on show and looking good in front of the camera but in real essence cannot do any real work.</p>
              <p>It is not wrong to say that Singapore will come to the end with these croonies in power and wasting future and past reserves that we and our forefathers have contributed.</p>
              <p>Most recent example is the hao lian event in august which was over spend 3 times with no one questioning and checking why the extra money was wasted on.</p>
              <p>My sad observations is that at the end of the day, the foreign trash are not going to defend your country so stop wasting our money to suck up to them.</p>

              <p>another naive post...is singapore a country?</p>
              <p>it's natural for a  country to have floods, slashings, crimes etc.</p>
              <p>This is how a country should be.</p>
              <p>This is normal..welcome to the real world...welcome to reality  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="icon_twisted.gif"></p>
              <p>There are floods in China, the housing in Shanghai and Hong Kong are expensive. China is   still prospering.</p>
              <p>There are floods in USA, yearly typhoon, gang fights, criminal acts; USA's still a super power.</p>
              <p>There are unrest in Thailand, gangs, tourists still visit Thailand yearly</p>
              <p>you've lived in a complacent environment. It's time to face reality.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="icon_twisted.gif"> It's time to accept that such acts are normal</p>
              </div>
              <p><br>Foreigners are welcome to Singapore but they must respect our culture and way of living. There are fault with 'PR' or 'FT' policy, these people will not pledge allegiance to this country but merely to benefit from our economy prosperity and they fill flee at first sign when Siingapore is in danger.</p>
              <p>There heart belongs to their first country, otherwise proof it by exchanging their citizenship!!!</p>
