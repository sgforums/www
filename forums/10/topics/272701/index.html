            <div class='col-md body'>i have an observation, but i am not sure they are factual, or i could not explain clearly in factual ways yet. Pls enlighten, or rebut if my writing i not right.<br><br>Winners in singapore gets monetary benefits faster than the losers.<br><br>[observation_1]<br>when economy became more optimistic in yr2006, but it's benefits has not yet trickled down to the bottom, the winners already know the economy forecast better, and GST was increased, corporate tax decreased, and the GST amount is realized immediately on 1July2007. Also, the salaries of top-mgmt increased.<br><br>[observation_2]<br>Property and rental prices were increasing in yr2006, many losers like small businesses were forced to move or closed, but the winners already benefited from the it, e.g. properties sold, or higher rental rates collected.<br><br>[observation_3]<br>By the time property prices come to too high, the government comes in to moderate, but the winners already benefited and the losers already burnt, while the survivors still managing.<br><br>[observation_4]<br>When economy becomes good, in yr2007, but not all benefits have trickled down to the bottom. In yr2007-07, ST reports of cleaners taking basic pay $500 per month is reported, showing their lower salary. Maybe or maybe not, help will come to provide minimum wage soon, but the losers will benefit later or slower.<br><br>[Summary/Deduction]<br>There is usually a delay or a time-gap, e.g. when economy is going up, with everyone doing nothing. When not doing anything, the winners reaps the benefits, and the losers get burnt. When something needs to be done, the losers benefits a bit, but later, and the winners already benefited.<br><br>[Conclustion]<br>This is still a top-down approach in reaping benefits, when economy is good.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>So is it not realistic to advocate for the bottom-up approach ?<br><br>The winners will still win as much, the losers will still meet failures. But at least, the survivors get the smaller benefts as timely as the winners ?<br><br>For e.g., i know the economy may become better, so when the top mgmt salaries increases, but why cannot GST not increased ? Becos the survivors may not get the benefits as fast as the winners, so an increase in GST is a cost-incurrence to the survivors. And what about the cleaners, are they survivors still ?<br><br>Just an example for thoughts.</div>
