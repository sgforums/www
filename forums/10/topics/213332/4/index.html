I find that parents today, are ONLY dead set focused on their child's educational progress and thought nothing of the child's manners and sense of courtesy. If this issue of courtesy goes ignored any longer, the newer generation of parents are going to pass on this "me first" mentality into the next decade and beyond.<br><br>Courtesy Campagne must go on, while schools of all levels must inculcate a strong sense of courtesy in all students.<br><br>Yes, being courteous is part of any culture, but if left unpracticed and allowing only commercial &amp; economic progress to over rule, then one ugly nation of people will surely to become.<br><br></div>
