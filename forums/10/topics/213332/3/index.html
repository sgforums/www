            <div class='col-md body'>Just recalled something.  A pretty girl friend of mine is 6 mths pregnant, has a significant baby bump.  She's 25, but easily looks 18 or younger..she's petite, but her tummy protrudes significantly from the baby doll dresses she wears.<br><br>Unforunately, she's not too well-off, so she has to take the MRT everyday incl peak periods.<br><br>- <strong>In the past 4 mths, she has only been offered a seat twice</strong>.  Those seated usually pretend to sleep or read ESPECIALLY right after they spot her.  She recalled how 1 kind woman spotted her thru the crowd, stood up to give her a seat, and beckoned her to come over.  A fit-looking chinese man in his 20s saw this and tried to squeeze past the woman, but the woman gamely blocked him using her body so my friend could sit!  There were curious/disgusted stares but nothing else.<br><br>- <strong>During peak periods, people often push her baby bump with their bodies or bags to get past her without bothering to offer a simple "excuse me". </strong> She tries to stand further away from the door to avoid this, but it's not always possible.<br><br>- When the train is super packed, kiasu commuters sometimes push the passengers at the door to squeeze in.. this often means that <strong>the person in front of her will suddenly step back and apply vaiying degrees of pressure on her stomach</strong> (sometimes they don't apologize..some don't even notice)<br><br>- Once, this "uncle" practically <strong>body-slammed</strong> his way into the sardine-packed carriage.  (There were people who couldn't board and were waiting around for the next train)  In doing so, the front rows of people fell on each other like dominos.. my gal fren was standing in the middle.. <strong>she got hit so hard in the stomach that her vision whited out for a few secs.
