              <p>Was watching the chinese programme å‰�çº¿è¿½è¸ª just now.</p>
              <p>In it, it was reported that rental costs of a hawker stall of a certain hawker centre has been raised from $800-$900 per month, to $1700 per month. This is almost double. The reason for the raise is the most frustrating. There is no other reason, according to the authorities, but only because they did a market survey, and determined the market rate to be $1700.</p>
              <p>My issue with the government is, why must everything be about market rate? Hawker food is one of the main methods to keep living costs affordable in Singapore. By doing this, they are causing a pressure to the hawkers to up their prices of food. This affects normal Singaporeans, like you and I. And the only reason for such an increase is market rate.</p>
              <p>Why can't our government be more caring, and keep rental costs low, so long as their own costs are covered? I don't see why they need to raise to market rates, except for earning a profit out of it.</p>
              <p>It's very saddening, that they are doing this now, when the economy is so bad...</p>
              <p>Anyway, have written an enquiry to young PAPs, I know my views will probably be ignored, but, well, I just wanted to give it a try...</p>

              <p>I know. Everything they do, their minimum boundary is $0 cost (ie the thing they are working on must be self-sustainable and should not cost extra burden to their coffers)</p>

              <p>But this case really irks me. For certain things, such as basic necessities, why can't they just give up on profits and really just focus on $0 cost? The worst thing was that the only reason they are upping the rental was due to market rate.</p>

              <p>the govt dowan to slash rental for hawker centres cos it's tough to raise it back when times become good again i guess.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>They should really slash the rental and make it compulsory for every hawker to reduce the price by 30-50 cents, depending on the food they sell. A study should be done on this, feedback taken from hawkers and suppliers before they decide on the price reduction for the various stalls.</p>

              <p>Yea, in the programme, they said the authorities initially calculated the market rate to be $2000 a month, but have reduced it to $1700 due to 'feedback'</p>
