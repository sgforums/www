              <p>From ST website.. Posted on 29 March.</p>
              <p>SINGAPOREANS need not worry about that next bowl of rice despite export cutbacks amid a global shortage and demand spike.</p>
              <p>The country's rice supply is adequate, newly promoted Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry S. Iswaran said on Saturday night.</p>
              <p>Rice importers have enough in their inventories to ensure that there is no disruption in rice supply here.</p>
              <p>Moreover, Singapore gets its rice from various countries. This diversification policy ensures that even if any one source is affected, there will be alternatives.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans 'should not be unduly concerned.... The main thing for us is to just carry on with life as normal', Mr Iswaran told reporters at a lighting demonstration for the Formula One night race near the Padang.</p>
              <p>
              <table border="0" width="200" align="left">
              <tbody>
              <tr>
              <td class="padr8"></td>
              </tr>
              </tbody>
              </table>
              His assurance came after the island's largest supermarket chain, NTUC FairPrice, raised prices of rice for three of its house brands last Friday.</p>
              <p>The supermarket chain has held back on raising its prices since the middle of last year, when the goods and services tax went up.</p>
              <p>But world prices have jumped 50 per cent over the past two months and at least doubled since 2004.</p>
              <p>Recent global grain prices have shot up 30 per cent but FairPrice is only increasing its rice prices by 10 to 15 per cent.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Your reply confirms the present precarious position that Singapore is in, yet your solution seems to be heavily colored by the historical events that led to WW1 and WW2 - have you not learnt from the foolishness of those past colonial wars of economic hegemony ?</span></p>
              <p><strong>Originally posted by tripwire:</strong></p>
              <p><strong>singapore isnt entirely totally dependent on food import....we do have a small food production capability despite our minute land size..... unfortunately... its little comfort to go around telling singaporeans that we can produce some food.. but not enough to be self sufficient.</strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">From the available statistics for 2007 { </span><a href="http://www.singstat.gov.sg/pubn/reference/sif2007.pdf"><span style="color: #0000ff;">http://www.singstat.gov.sg/pubn/reference/sif2007.pdf</span></a><span style="color: #0000ff;"> } Singapore's food output can be found in the statistics for Manufacturing - the first item in the list being ''Food, Beverage &amp; Tobacco'' - producing an Annual Value of S$5,223.5 million - that is only 2.226 percent from an Annual Total Manufacturing Output of S$234,609.3 Million.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The labor employed for this Manufacturing sector is 301.7 Thousands from a total labor force of 1,796.7 Thousand, or 16.79 percent of the labor force.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The food manufactured in Singapore will probably be the processed food, and the small but concentrated high rise agriculture in the Lim Chu Kang area.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Given the size of the labor force employed in this sector, and the dismal productivity compared with the numbers available from the other sector - surely more support can be given to increase the productivity levels ?</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>we have a very limited land size... short of throwing  millions of our citizens into the sea... there is not enough arable land in singapore to feed every one of us.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>the alternative to throwing millions of our people into the sea... is to obtain more land... land which are presently owned by our neighbours... you gonna ask us to go war?</strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Have I hinted anywhere in my postings about going to war, or has it been your position to seek war to grab our neighbor's land so as to maintain our own survival ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">What is the purpose and direction of your shock approach that is nothing more then sensationalising your own assumed speculative position than put any effort to take any position to address the situation ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Are you certain that more land cannot be given for the purpose of achieving some degree of being less reliant on food imports - at least for certain essential foodstuff ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Could we not do something for the Food Manufacturing Sector in the same manner as we have managed to produce NuWater to reduce the volume of water that need to be imported from Malaysia ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Even in Japan, where land is more expensive and scarce, the Japanese Government has never attempted to remove the rice farms nor reduce available land for agricultural unless it has to give way to infrastructure - as in the construction of Narita Airport.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>if push come to shoves... i wont be surprised if countries do go to war over resources such as arable land... but its kinda extreme...</strong></p>
              <p><strong>and if the cause of the global food shortage was nature... it makes even less sense to grab land that is no longer able to produce food due to other factors... though war could still be on the table due to the need to defend or rob food/weapon/energy stockpiles.</strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Are you still living in the 1900s, when it is common for countries to make land grabs to extend their own economic control over raw materials and markets ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">It is little comfort in your belief that ''it is kinda extreme'' - but what solution do you have to address the food shortage besides all the shocking sensational statements ?</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>not many nations are able to self sufficient in food production... even countries the size of indonesia is dependent on imports of rice ,soya beans... during the asian financial crisis... singapore actually help to foot part of their bills for their food imports...</strong></p>
              <p><strong>recent droughts in australia... also proves... that weather can seriously curtain food production irreguardless the size of your land...</strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Australia and Indonesia are two different basket cases - even as Australia had encountered problems with drought, it remains self-sufficient to feed its own population living in the limited areas that can accomodate people along the West Coast, North-eastern, Eastern and South-eastern areas of the Australian land mass that remains largely uninhabitable.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The inability of Indonesia to feed its own is due very much to its own politics, social and cultural aptitudes; and the corruption that is endemic within its system that lock them in a perpetual path towards poverty.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Philippines used to be the leading rice exporting countries in the 1950s through the 1960s, but through decades of corruption and inaction during the Marcos rule, its position was overtaken by Thailand and Vietnam. Its present position is no different from Indonesia, with both countries having an inefficient production management system, and a non-existent or ineffective birth control program.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">China and Korea - as well as the USA - have been self-sufficient in most of their essential foodstuff, and importing little to meet domestic needs for those essential foodstuff, and this ability to meet their own needs remains consistent despite the natures rough abuses on their respective territories.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>so... the bottom line is... before you demand the govt to do something... at least ask yourself... if you are in their shoes.. what can you do about it? change the weather?</strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">If you had carefully considered what you have read in my post dated 29 March 2008 at 10.19 P.M - on Page 4 of this thread, before making your first response to this topic that came immediately below my post - perhaps you would not have asked what can I do about it if I were in the shoes of this Government.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The answers to your question were already given.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">While we may not directly affect the weather, surely you will be able to apply some of your creative speculative skills in artificially creating and controlling the needed climate for our own comfort and security levels ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">With the advancement in science and technology, you may have a role to be a ''mini-God'' and control your own weather.</span></p>

              <p>Who is seriously worried about rice shortage other than the economic effect on inflation? Its not a FOOD shortage. Problem is Asians love rice. Suprisingly Jap rice price supposedly go down in Japan; dont know about import price. Personally like Jap short grain rice.</p>

              <p>On 27th February, an alleged JI leader escaped from the Whitley detention centre, leading to the largest manhunt in Singapore. Wong apologised in Parliament for the escape on the next day after the occurence. He revealed that Mas Selamat escaped when he was being taken to the toilet before a meeting at the Family Visit Room<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="http://politics.sgforums.com/forums/10/topics/#cite_note-4"><span style="color: #0000ff;">[5]</span></a></sup>.</p>
              <p>Criticism has been directed towards Wong Kan Seng, the Minister of Home Affairs in Singapore, with regards to the fact that news of Mas Selamat's escape was not disseminated to the public until 4 hours after its occurrence<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="http://politics.sgforums.com/forums/10/topics/#cite_note-5"><span style="color: #0000ff;">[6]</span></a></sup>. There have been calls for Wong to step down, given the severity of the security lapse. The fallout has also been exacerbated over the public's outrage over the major pay hike for MPs in Singapore.</p>

              <p>To be frank, I think to make singapore not reliant on food from other sources is impossible.</p>
              <p>It is not like like making Japan not reliant on food from outside (they need to import food heavily too) They r much bigger and less densely populated than singapore in tis case.</p>
              <p>Asking singapore to be self reliant on food is as difficult as making the city of Tokyo self reliant on food.</p>
              <p>Which major city in tis world can actually be self reliant on the city itself on food ? It is impossible. No one even wanna try. Even if u use up some land to make agriculture, the land price is too expensive and the food is not gonna be cheaper than buying from other sources. Even if we bulldoze all the buildings down, the land size if not enough for us to be self reliant anyway and we still starve to dead if other sources of food stop their import. So wat is the point ?</p>
              <p>R&amp;D have its limit as well. Food need land, time, sunlight and manpower. We do not have land. Then it is game over. If u compare with water, it just need a water sources. Even if u can make food out of no land, it will be so heavily modified and chemically laden tat it is not popular nor healthy to eat. People r going for organic food now, not chemical food.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, research in agriculture have gone for centuries and even if u give it another 10 years, there will be little improvements to it. It is already a matured field of science. U want tomato to look redder it is redder. U want mushrooms to be bigger it is bigger. U want chicken wings the size of your fist it is already done. Do u wanna pump in billions of dollars of tax money into something which have no outcome ? I think it is futile.</p>
              <p>Asking singapore gov, who have totally no experience in agriculture and food to take a world leader role and pro active role in argiculture and food issue, is like asking babies to teach their grandmother how to plant rice. To be frank, most countries in the world have more qualification than singapore.</p>

              <p><br>lets be honest... food is a low price goods compare to the price of a PC chip... one laptop computer is easily worth 1500 plates of chicken rice. thus its no surprise to the learned minds that the value of singapore food output could not possibly constitute a major proportion in the overall GDP.</p>
              <p>to produce sufficient output in food production to match the output value of other manufacturing sectors requires massive amount of land... a luxury that singapore do not have.</p>
              <p>considering the high opportunity cost of farming in singapore due to our lack of arable land... its insane to put food production above that of other more high value goods production.</p>

                                      to remove the rice farms nor reduce available land for
                                      agricultural unless it has to give way to infrastructure - as in

              <p>for your information... even japan have grudgeingly accepted the fact that they have become more and more dependent on food import to meet demand... the recent food poisoning has brought that much to light if you have follow the news...</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Are you still living in the 1900s,
                                      when it is common for countries to make land grabs to extend
                                      their own economic control over raw materials and markets
                                      ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">It is little comfort in your
                                      belief that ''it is kinda extreme'' - but what solution do you have
                                      to address the food shortage besides all the shocking sensational
                                      statements ?</span></p>
              <p>ask the lion if he will starve his cubs to preserve the lives of his preys.... we live in a finite world with limited resources... with an exploding population... its a matter of time before one side must give... which side would you sacrifice? yours or others?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Australia and Indonesia are two
                                      different basket cases - even as Australia had encountered problems
                                      with drought, it remains self-sufficient to feed its own population
                                      living in the limited areas that can accomodate people along the
                                      West Coast, North-eastern, Eastern and South-eastern areas of the
                                      Australian land mass that remains largely uninhabitable.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The inability of Indonesia to feed
                                      its own is due very much to its own politics, social and cultural
                                      aptitudes; and the corruption that is endemic within its system
                                      that lock them in a perpetual path towards poverty.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Philippines used to be the leading
                                      rice exporting countries in the 1950s through the 1960s, but
                                      through decades of corruption and inaction during the Marcos rule,
                                      its position was overtaken by Thailand and Vietnam. Its present
                                      position is no different from Indonesia, with both countries having
                                      an inefficient production management system, and a non-existent or
                                      ineffective birth control program.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">China and Korea - as well as
                                      the USA - have been self-sufficient in most of their essential
                                      foodstuff, and importing little to meet domestic needs for those
                                      essential foodstuff, and this ability to meet their own needs
                                      remains consistent despite the natures rough abuses on their
                                      respective territories.</span></p>
              <p><br>and wat is holding back singapore from being self sufficient? where is our massive INVISIBLE chunk of arable land may i ask that i kept failing to notice?</p>

              <p>To be frank, I think to make singapore not reliant on food
              from other sources is impossible.</p>
              <p>It is not like like making Japan not reliant on food from
              outside (they need to import food heavily too) They r much bigger
              and less densely populated than singapore in tis case.</p>
              <p>Asking singapore to be self reliant on food is as difficult
              as making the city of Tokyo self reliant on food.</p>
              <p>Which major city in tis world can actually be self reliant on
              the city itself on food ? It is impossible. No one even wanna try.
              Even if u use up some land to make agriculture, the land price is
              too expensive and the food is not gonna be cheaper than buying from
              other sources. Even if we bulldoze all the buildings down, the land
              size if not enough for us to be self reliant anyway and we
              still starve to dead if other sources of food stop their import. So
              wat is the point ?</p>
              <p>R&amp;D have its limit as well. Food need land, time,
              sunlight and manpower. We do not have land. Then it is game
              over. If u compare with water, it just need a water sources. Even
              if u can make food out of no land, it will be so heavily modified
              and chemically laden tat it is not popular nor healthy to eat.
              People r going for organic food now, not chemical food.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, research in agriculture have gone for centuries and
              even if u give it another 10 years, there will be little
              improvements to it. It is already a matured field of science. U
              want tomato to look redder it is redder. U want mushrooms to be
              bigger it is bigger. U want chicken wings the size of your
              fist it is already done. Do u wanna pump in billions of dollars of
              tax money into something which have no outcome ? I think it is
              futile.</p>
              <p>Asking singapore gov, who have totally no experience in
              agriculture and food to take a world leader role and pro active
              role in argiculture and food issue, is like asking babies to
              teach their grandmother how to plant rice. To be frank, most
              countries in the world have more qualification than singapore.</p>
