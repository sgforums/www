              <p>For rice, there's brown rice and white rice. White rice is less healthy than brown rice, but it tastes nicer and is more commonly eaten.</p>
              <p>And ya, sweet potatoes, brown rice, and oats are healthier source of carbs. So is whole grain bread and multi grain bread... But then... govt tell us don't go for better quality bread wor...</p>

              <p>which is why I suggest using the top of every HDB flat. And maybe top govt buildings... Can harvest free solar energy... It is something natural and more efficient than solar panels... Most likely not enough to feed the population, but it serves a little to help reduce the reliance on external sources... labour wise, there's always cheap foreign workers for this type of labourious job.</p>

              <p>That's very true too... I think you are very right here... 1 sq m of water 40 cm deep will weigh about 400kg...</p>
              <p>Perhaps not the whole rooftop then, but instead, 1/4 of it... Or something similar... Of course after consulting a professional engineer for approval. Afterall, people do have huge fish tanks or similar heavy things in their home, no matter which floor they stay at.</p>

              <p>Generally singapore is not hit by the food rising price because singaporean r generally not poor enough to be literally left hungry. Is the gov preparing for the world food shortages ? I think we r better off than most countries since everybody here r metropolitan and can afford food.</p>
              <p>And my impression is ALL countries at peace stockpile food for a period of time from a long history till now. Why ? They r worried when war occurs then the country immediately goes hungry and lose the war before it started.</p>
              <p>10 million bags of rice seems a lot when u buy from NTUC but it may be simply translated to 100 of the metal containers u see in the harbour.</p>

              <p>I do a rough estimation.</p>
              <p>A container is 40 feet by 8 feet by 9.5 feet. I round it smaller to be 12m by 2.4m by 2.8m to account for inner diameter. The total volume is calculated as 80.64m cube.</p>

              <p>I roughly measure a packet of 1 kg rice to be 18cm by 12 cm by 3cm. The total volume is 0.000648m cube.</p>
              <p>I use the NTUC Gold Thai Hom Mali Superior Fragrant rice as the sample</p>
              <p>If we squeeze all the rice into the above mentioned container, we can put 124444.4 packets, which is 124444.4kg of rice. 100 container will make it 12.4 million kg of rice.</p>
              <p>This is already close to your estimation of rice required to feed the nation for 3 months.</p>

              <p>Ok lor... so u believe contries like zimbabwe or malaysia or venuezela or china do stockpile food, but our country leader r so stupid they keep 0 food in singapore, and spend so much money on defense etc, and preparing for war anytime yet without preparing any food which is known to make or break the outcome of a war, when singapore population is small and trade is abundant, and when a lot of people do certify tat singapore had promise to stockpile food yet they actually don't...</p>
              <p>then i rest my case</p>
              <p>I don't think tis is a question whether does singapore stockpile food at all.</p>
              <p>I think the question is, does any country at peace don't stockpile food at all ?</p>

              <p>For weight cargo like rice, you will have to ship them in 20ft FCL and the weight limit is about 27,000kg per FCL, depending on the tare weight of the container.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For 40ft FCL, the weight will be lesser because the tare weight is higher.</p>
