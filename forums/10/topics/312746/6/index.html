              <p>"As a smart exporter, Thailand should form an alliance with major rice-exporting countries such as India and Vietnam to strengthen their collective bargaining power in the international market.</p>
              <p>Export prices should be set by exporting countries rather than at the demand of importing countries as in the past.</p>
              <p>However, this does not mean that rice-exporting countries want to create a cartel. They only hope to stabilise rice prices through management of the market mechanism.</p>
              <p>Rice-exporting countries should jointly set up an "ideal price" or "benchmark", based mainly on the same fixed costs of oil, fertiliser and other key factors of production. The strategy would provide security for both rice production and prices in the long run."</p>

              <p>"Chookiat criticised Thai Commerce Minister Mingkwan Sangsuwan for encouraging Thai farmers to hoard their rice in order to fetch better prices for it. Not only farmers, but millers and local businessmen have started hording and speculating on Thai rice, creating an artificial shortage for exports.</p>
              <p>The government currently has a 2.1-million-ton stockpile that it has promised to distribute to the poor to alleviate high rice prices.</p>
              <p>The stock is expected to last about three months, after which the government will need to go to the market to replenish their stocks, predicted Chookiat."</p>

              <p>"Malaysia has no plans to raise the retail price of rice but efforts are under way to ensure adequate rice stockpiles in case of a shortage of supply, Deputy Prime Minister Najib Razak said Monday.</p>
              <p>The government regulates the price of rice, which is one of the essential items it subsidizes. It also gives financial aid to rice farmers, who produce about 70 percent of the country's rice needs."</p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">mankind has been fighting for resources since recorded times.... and last i check... its still the same in this modern day and time... as nations jeolously guards their border and their resources within.''</span></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Do you seriously believe that nations jealously guard their border merely for the resources only ? </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">If your assumption is true, what worth is there to guard the borders of nations without any natural resources - such as Singapore ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Do you not consider that it is also for reason of POLITICS - that include national sovereignty, independence, and all the other nationalistic hullabaloo that accompanies it.</span> </p>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong>''the only reason that is holding back every nation from conquering their neighbours is simply because its cheaper to trade than going to war.... when there are excess resources for sale.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>wat if there is a global shortage??? are we suppose to believe that you will gladly see your family starve or thirst to death because its "smarter" than going to war to obtain those resources your family needs like those past colonial wars of economic hegemony?''</strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Thank god that the Singapore Ministers that are paid Million Dollar wages are not similar war-mongers that harbor similar thinking as you  have articulated.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Is there anything to fight for when - as you have said - the shortage is global, and is there any worth to fight for what little that is left in the neighboring country or countries ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Is there any morality to charge into someone else's home, to steal what rightfully belong to others, simply to keep yourself alive ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Is human death worth paying for the value of the low price food - as you have so cleverly articulated below ?</span></p>
              <p><br><strong>lets be honest... food is a low price goods compare to the price of a PC chip... one laptop computer is easily worth 1500 plates of chicken rice. thus its no surprise to the learned minds that the value of singapore food output could not possibly constitute a major proportion in the overall GDP.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>to produce sufficient output in food production to match the output value of other manufacturing sectors requires massive amount of land... a luxury that singapore do not have.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>considering the high opportunity cost of farming in singapore due to our lack of arable land... its insane to put food production above that of other more high value goods production.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>just in case you have not realised... let me remind you that food production requires land... lots of fine arable land... do you see that in singapore? ''</strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">You prefer to lock your imagination to the high cost of traditional forms of food production that require large tracts of arable land. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Have you not heard of hydroponics and agro-culture - in which higher yield of food production can be extracted from a similar plot of land that allow vertical farming to take place ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Look again at the price of a laptop or PC that is tumbling as the unit cost of each chip fall when it enter a mature phase after its initial launch, and newer chip design is introduced. Have you appreciated the short life cycle of each laptop model that is introduced ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The same cannot be said about agriculture, when the unit cost remains quite stable until over production occurs, or when scarcity will push the price of the agricultural products even higher - as will also happen to the production of computer chips.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Surely you do not take yourself so seriously to believe your own imagination that one highly overpriced laptop can fetch 1500 plates of chicken rice - at $2.00 per plate or $4.50 ? Your statement seem to scorn the lowly chicken rice trade compared to your bias towards the high tech product of the laptop.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">You will be surprised to learn that the profit margins of the chicken rice seller maybe higher then the laptop retailer - at the exchange rate of ONE laptop to 1500 plates of chicken rice.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Show more respect for a plate of chicken rice.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>sure we can give abit more land to the agriculture sector... but as we face ever rising opportunity cost... we would not be even one step closer to self sufficiency... at least realise that part.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>with regard to water from malaysia... we were blessed with access to unlimited water from the sea and the sky... tell me friend.. where can i find unlimited land in singapore?</strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Have you tried vertical thinking, if your mind find limitation on the horizontal plane ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">If you want to allow yourself to be locked into the Government propaganda about the limited land space for Singaporeans, no one can help you to think the manner in which you allow yourself to be locked in.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Try to give yourself more space and look at the large tracts of land that the government has hoarded, and releasing the various parcels of land to drive the speculative prices upwards.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">If land is as limited as the Government has claimed, do you not find it contradictory that it will plan for the population numbers to grow to 6 million from the present level - by way of accepting more foreigners into our midst ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Where do you think this Government is finding the scarce land to accomodate the large number of new arrivals ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">It seems that your alarmist methods at arguing your position resemble the same scare tactics of the Government.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>for your information... even japan have grudgeingly accepted the fact that they have become more and more dependent on food import to meet demand... the recent food poisoning has brought that much to light if you have follow the news...</strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Japan has always accepted the fact that it is not rich in resources, and it has limited land space - was this fact disputed ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">It was mentioned in my last post, that despite this fact - the Japanese Government has not insisted on any deliberate decision to sacrifice its agricultural sector to make way for the industries - to use your preferred analogy :- giving up the selling of chickens or chicken rice to concentrate entirely on manufacturing computer chips and laptops.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>ask the lion if he will starve his cubs to preserve the lives of his preys.... we live in a finite world with limited resources... with an exploding population... its a matter of time before one side must give... which side would you sacrifice? yours or others?</strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Why will you want to wait until it becomes ''a matter of time before one side must give....'' ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Why will this highly paid Ministers remain inattentive to the present situation that is becoming globally desperate, and leave matters to time that will force any one of us to make a decision as to which side to sacrifice ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">As I have mentioned in my earlier post on Page 4 of this topic, our highly paid Ministers should take on the lead role to mobilise the Regional and Global Governments into action, and address this problem - in the same manner that it had taken the lead role to push for the Law of the Sea Convention to protect the interests of small nations, as much as it protects the interests of the large ones.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <span style="color: #0000ff;">
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">and thus i ask you my martian friend... how is the weather back on mars?</span></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">For one who reflect the ideology of a war monger - by advocating the morality of force to take from others in order to keep oneself alive - should you not know the Martian weather better than anyone else ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Have you given up the opportunity to be a ''mini-God'' to control even the weather in your little room ?</span></p>

              <p>Its just a RICE short term price surge only not Global starvation. Agriculture business for the moment still dont produce that good profits (except for biofuel) otherwise everyone would want a slice of it. I agree electronics margins continue to be reduced daily though.</p>

              <p>Fortunately, for you and I - and every NSF guys - the million $ ministers prefer to keep us all alive so that they can continue to milk our pockets rather than go to war.</p>
              <p>They feed everyone in the SAF with the cheapest but most nutritious rice so that we continue to work for the money - so that they can collect 7 percent on every cent that is spent.</p>
              <p>Without us around can this Government gloat about the success that they claim for themselves ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Do you seriously doubt the ability of the SAF over the ''Professional Armies'' around this Little Red Dot ?</p>
              <p>A ''professional'' armed force may not necessarily have a critical mass of soldiers who are professional - even as they lean to the military for a profession simply to bring home some bread and butter - or rice and vegetable - to feed their families.</p>
              <p>Have you forgotten the potency of the small Israeli Defence Force - that is similar to our SAF - and which fought against the largely ''professional'' Arab armies that were raised to exterminater the artificially created country of Israel ?</p>
              <p> I believe in our individual fighting ability that make up the sum total of the fighting ability and contributing to the potency of the SAF.</p>
              <p>Our equipment and training is superior, the leadership is clear in their strategies and operation plans, and the drive of an NSF force is consistent.</p>

              <p>Excuse me arent they bolstered by American/Western Jewish unofficial forces. In case they lost they still had the nuke. Moreover if I am not wrong, the Arab armies comprise mainly of CONSCRIPTS.</p>
              <p>"Do you seriously doubt the ability of the SAF over the Professional Armies around this Little Red Dot ?"</p>
              <p>Yes I do. Ask yourself if your unit is prepared to go to WAR at a moment's notice like a professional army. War would include non-conventional warfare nowdays. Your equipment may be superior but training please lah. NSF is WORKING civilian in uniform, playing soldier for a day. You free everyday go to range is it? The Leadership is part of the PAP mindset, scholars planted to pose no threat to the ruling party.</p>
              <p>More importantly you mentioned the drive. I am not Jewish, Singapore is not Israel its a ridiculous comparison. Is there such a thing as a powerful American Singaporean lobby or Chinese Singaporean lobby in China for that matter? I cant say the same about you but fighting for PAP / LKY legacy is not what I want to do.</p>
              <p>Since you are talking about Middle East comparison, I rather have <strong>Hamas</strong> rather than SAF soldiers.</p>

              <p>"Have you forgotten the potency of the small Israeli Defence Force - that is similar to our SAF - and which fought against the largely ''professional'' Arab armies that were raised to exterminater the artificially created country of Israel ?"</p>
              <p><strong>Excuse me arent they bolstered by American/Western Jewish unofficial forces. In case they lost they still had the nuke.</strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Excuse me, if the nuke is ever used - is there anything left that is worth fighting for ?</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Do you seriously doubt the ability of the SAF over the Professional Armies around this Little Red Dot ?"</p>
              <p><strong>Yes I do. Ask yourself if your unit is prepared to go to WAR at a moment's notice like a professional army. War would include non-conventional warfare nowdays. Your equipment may be superior but training please lah. NSF is WORKING civilian in uniform, playing soldier for a day. You free everyday go to range is it? The Leadership is part of the PAP mindset, scholars planted to pose no threat to the ruling party.</strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">War is not entirely about non-conventional warfare - even if it begin or develop into one.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">In any profession, it is the commitment and dedication that an individual will give to his assigned task that make the sum total of the efforts applied, so as to make the outcome a success.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">If you believe that Singapore is what it is today - is entirely due to the sum total efforts of every Singaporean since the past generations - and NOT due to the singular efforts of LKY and his Political Party - and despite all the difficulties that he has brought onto Singaporean lives - then why will you doubt the ability of Singaporeans to defend what has been their own creation ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Excuse me, we do not return to NSF training for just a day - if you have ever returned for your NS Reservist Training.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The short 2 to 3 weeks of In-camp training is to refresh and maintain the ''military skills'' that were first planted during the 2 to 3 years of Full Time National Service.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">There seem to be a trend to deride NS and to doubt the ability of the SAF.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">You should be rest assured that you are in good company since NS was introduced in 1967 - as every batch of NSF will curse and swear about NS; yet whenever they ever regroup either during Reserve Training or during informal gatherings - the camaradie is not lost. The essence of that unit remains bonded.</span></p>
              <p><strong> More importantly you mentioned the drive. I am not Jewish, Singapore is not Israel its a ridiculous comparison. Is there such a thing as a powerful American Singaporean lobby or Chinese Singaporean lobby in China for that matter? I cant say the same about you but fighting for PAP / LKY legacy is not what I want to do.</strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Is there any marked difference between a Jew or a Chinese - an Israeli or a Singaporean - other then the colors, the cultural and religious differences ? </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The industry, intelligence, dedication and sense of commitment and pride remains at about the same quotient of efficiency between the two races.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">No two countries are ever alike - yet given the circumstances, there are parallel similarities between Singapore and Israel that are not so ridiculous.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Do the Chinese ever depended on lobbying for their survival - as an individual or as a community ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Through the centuries, migrant Chinese have toiled and depended on themselves, their clans and their own communities, and family ties to survive. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Has the overseas Chinese in Australia, Europe, UK or the USA depended on China to survive in their chosen countries ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Yet, we find overseas Chinese taking up high political office in the countries that they adopted - and all based on their personal merits.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Does the Chinese ever depended on the charity of others to survive in this World ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Perhaps you have been living in Singapore for too long - tied to some apron strings as well ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Singapore is created by generations of Singaporeans - including you and I, and perhaps our children as well in the future. This Island maybe controlled by LKY, his Family, and his Political Party - at the end of the day, he and his creation will evaporate into the pages of history. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Time and tide will wash away old events, and bring in fresh experiences - as we have seen the events in China - from Mao's disastrous Cultural Revolution that brought hardship and tears to millions of Chinese, and to the present positive events under the present President Hu and Premier Wen.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Singapore's future is in the hands of Singaporeans - and if you persist to be pesimistic about the individual abilities of your generation, you will need to ask how much are you willing to give and shake the trees around you, so as to make some impact in the space around you, and how big a space you intend to take responsibility for yourself to grow in.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">If you prefer to be inactive about your established pessimistic views, it will be left in the hands of LKY, his Family, and his Political Party to ride on this wave on inaction and resigned pessimism - as they will find the many niches of positivism to grow their own space.</span></p>

              </strong><p></p>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The 2-3 weeks / year of training is more then sufficient and is typical of armies built on conscription - as seen in South Korea and Israel, both being in a constant state of war.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The camaradie is the beginning of the building blocks to establish a unit. If you cannot find any camaradie or bonding with any of your platoon mates - despite the common spite towards the NS concept - then you must be loner.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The HAMAS in the Gaza fought together for a common cause - and Singaporeans will similarly stand up like the Palestinians for a common cause against the injustices and threats to our common well being and survival.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The intensity and passion that you have placed in your expressed words reveal the potential in you through the emotional reactions about events in Singapore.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">How much will you give to translate that passion into action when you are pushed by events to defend your space when someone threaten you or your family ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Surely, you do not expect me to doubt that you will not defend yourself and your family from some bully ?</span> </p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The coffee or tea, ''kopi-O'' and ''teh-tarek'' - smell about the same time here and anywhere else where you happen to wake up, and they all have their characteristic differences in flavor and fragrance. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">How will you judge them by ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">It depends on which brand we have been brought up with, resulting in the preferences and personal attitudes to the differences in the smells.</span></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Gaza strip is a scene of civil strife, not a war zone. It hardly resemble anything like the various cities in Iraq, where the people suffer daily threats of sudden death from IEDs and assassination by insurgents who erroneously and mistakenly believe that you are a threat to their cause.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">It was not the PAP who wanted Singapore to be independent.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">It was David Marshall that planted the seed of independence for Singapore, but his ideas and his cause was untimely, and did not match with the Colonial Government agenda for that period in time.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">PAP under LKY sought independence by bonding Singaporean's future with Malaysia - against the warnings from the the various Opposition Leaders supported by the larger Chinese business community who are familiar with the political culture in Malaya.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Singapore found real independence and total relief when Malaysia kicked Singapore out - nobody cried, except for LKY over his broken dream of a larger political stage.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Each of us have our ways to support and grow the Alternative Parties, and in many forms.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">For you to contribute positively, you have to be less pessimistic, even if you continue to be a strong cynic.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">If need be, drink the coffee and not just smell it - I prefer tea.</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>"The camaradie is the beginning of the building blocks to establish a unit. If you cannot find any camaradie or bonding with any of your platoon mates - despite the common spite towards the NS concept - then you must be loner."</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Actually I am a loner who had friends with the other people who are also loners . Like in any other organization, there are always cliques vying for power. I wonder how old are you Atobe, your response indicate you must be relatively young to believe that camadrie is determining the fighting effectiveness of a unit. You want to know why Hamas are so effective in willing to die for their cause, they are bound by a common HATRED of an enemy who constantly kill their people. Does such a cause exist for SAF?</span></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">At this point in time, there is nothing that is threatening Singapore on the same scale as the ''HATRED'' that the Palestinians have towards the Israelis.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Except for the looming Global Food shortage that will threaten the future of Singapore - there is little that the SAF can do to help alleviate this potential threat that is looming.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Even amongst the loners, whom you have found some solace and comfort in association - surely there is some sense of friendship, camaradie in common ground to fret and wallow in the same mud pool ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Surely, amongst the group of loners that you have ''cliqued with'' - there will some degree of bonding of a common cause and identity - much like some of the Palestinians with the HAMAS cause ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Will it not be logical to expect that you may respond to protect or warn your 'loner' friends to any imminent danger even as it expose yourself to some lesser degree of the same danger ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Or should I be disappointed to a negative response from someone who express some higher values in his views ?</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">"Surely, you do not expect me to doubt that you will not defend yourself and your family from some bully ?</span><span style="color: #000000;"> "</span></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The "bully" is the Singaporean government and my friends are all that oppose the PAP and the need for a wayang NSF.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">When the SAF was feverishly expanded through National Service conscription, despite the apprehensions and gripes from the parents of that generation in 1967-68, they all realised the danger of Singapore standing exposed without any means to protect ourselves after being thrown out of the comfort zone of a large Malaysian home.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Singapore was still threatened by Konfrontasi from an charamastic Indonesia President Sukarno, and the Malay Ultra Politicians were eyeing Singapore for their own personal ambitions.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">The built-up of the SAF was at a very high tempo, and despite the tough training by the Israeli - the first batch of trainees were not entirely from the 1949 generation. Many were drawn from earlier generations, and despite their grouses, they gave their very best, and were the back bones in establishing and revising the newer doctrines that were first initiated by the Israelis.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">It has been 40 years since the first batch of NS men were called up, the threats today are lesser as the potency of the SAF is known - and those within the region that bear us ill will can only make life as difficult as they can without resorting to the military option, as they know that they cannot match us in equipment, and they have seen the commitment from the earlier generations that build up the SAF.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">While there is no external ''bully'', there remains one obnoxious one internally.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">I hope that your new found camaradie in your common cause with a group of ''loners'' - and can find the means to defeat the ''bully''.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong></strong></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>"Gaza strip is a scene of civil strife"</strong></span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">I forgot the West Bank, Lebanon and Iraq. Its hardly civil strife when Israelis are fighting against Palestineans.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">As much as you can add more regions into the list - civil strife will always continue where the theatre war ends and do not clearly resolve the issues at hand.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The main wars in Afghanistan and Iraq maybe over, but civil strife in its different intensity and violence will continue when the outcome is not resolutely established with a clear plan to manage the events after the main campaign.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">This has been the problems in the Middle-east with the Israeli military victory, also with the US supposed victory in overthrowing Saddam in Iraq; and also with the US victory in Afghanistan over the Talebans.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">All three area of conflict reflected a lack of clear plan in handling the politics of the respective regions.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The difference between civil strife and wars - is in the intensity, the theatre size and resources mobilized.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The fight between the Israelis and the Hizzbolah in Lebanon was a short war, and do not come close to the daily civilian Hamas led armed uprising in the Gaza Strip that resulted in the heavy but limited use of deadly response from the Israeli military.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">It is like coffee and tea - and the smell is as different as the taste.</span></p>

              <p>The Straits Times - Tuesday edition - reported that a lowly paid Thai Minister had taken the initiative to call for a meeting of Ministers from the oil producing countries in the Middle-east and rice / food growing countries in Asia , to jointly tackle the challenges of rising demand to a limited supply of oil and food from an ever growing world population.</p>
              <p>This Wednesday evening ChannelnewsAsia had reported that an average salaried A/Professor from the local NTU had suggested that the Singapore Government should invest some funds to help in the research for new breeds of high yield seedling to assist our agricultural neighbors to increase food production to everyone's benefit.</p>
              <p>What is the overpaid Singapore Ministers doing to show at least some initiative and imagination in facing the growing challenges that will surely overwhelm us ?</p>
              <p>Other then depending on diversifying our sources of food supply for the present, can we depend on these different sources over the longer term, when these will also surely face the same diminishing problems in the long term ?</p>
