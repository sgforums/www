              <p>For weight cargo like rice, you will have to ship them in
              20ft FCL and the weight limit is about 27,000kg per FCL, depending
              on the tare weight of the container.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For 40ft FCL, the weight will be lesser because the tare

              <p>Warehouse lor...</p>
              <p>warehouse is sheltered and the rice inside the vacuum bag last pretty long</p>
              <p>we don't need to stack on all food but on necessary selected food.</p>
              <p>And world shortage just means higher price which the consumers have to bear</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Lets just think about it as a buffer. They r not storing the food and not selling them and let them rot. They r storing the food and selling them away once the buffer reach its safe limit. It is like a flow process.</p>
              <p>I give an example. I sell TV from France. Every month I sell 100 +- 20 TV. If I import from France, it is cheaper if I import at batches of 500 and above. So wat I do ? I have a buffer. I stockpile 500 TV then sell them for about some months before importing another batch of 500 when my buffer is low like 150 TV. Storing in a warehouse at ulu area like tuas is not impossible or tat expensive.</p>
              <p>Lets say now the 500 TV need time to be manufacture in france and the time difference when I started my order to receiveing the order is 3 months. So wat I do ? I just store a bigger buffer. Previously if my TV is lesser than 120 or 200, I order a new batch of 500 TV. Now when the TV I have is lower than 400, I order another 500 TV. Voila ! I always stockpile at least 1 months of TV at any time ! If I want stockpile for 3 months, I just increased my buffer to 700 TV before placing a new order.</p>
              <p>Now just imagine the above example for food, replacing the TV as tons of rice. Tis is not economically infeasible or difficult.</p>
              <p>U think stockpiling things r difficult ? Almost all consumer goods u see around have stockpiled materials one way or another.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Dear All,</p>
              <p>Please note that the present situation has resulted in the present 'rice exporting' countries cutting their export volumes to maintain their domestic price stability in the face of global rice shortages.</p>
              <p>These countries - such as Vietnam, Thailand and China - were nett rice exporters, and as the global supply situation worsen, they may not even export at all.</p>
              <p>Our 3 or 6 months rice stockpile will simply dwindle away into zero level without any further supplies forthcoming in the face of a global crunch.</p>
              <p>Countries like Indonesia, India, Philippines, Korea, Japan, Malaysia, Myanmar, Laos and Cambodia have their own rice output; but even during the better times, they do not produce enough for their own consumption, and supplement their local rice production with imports from the region.</p>
              <p>As matters stand, the Singapore Government may not be able to do much directly - in the face of this global rice shortage, and with alternative food products such as wheat and soya also affected by shortages and wild price hikes- the Singapore Government could begin to take a longer strategic view to safeguard Singaporeans' food supply.</p>
              <p>At the macro level, they could energise the Regional Governments into action, mobilising Governments to pool R+D funds to help boost production, assist the rice growing countries to be more efficient with the application of bio-engineering technologies, improve the infrastructures for the longer term storage and preservation of the rice harvested - all for the common good.</p>
              <p>At the micro level, the population could be forwarned and dietary habits modified before the crunch hit home, as had happened in the 1970s - when the population was stunned by the events that overtook them so suddenly.</p>
              <p>The Singapore Government is structured with Ministries organised to manage an urbanised ''industrial'' country, and there is no single Ministry to look into the strategic security of Singaporeans' food supply.</p>
              <p>Countries with an economy leaning heavily towards agriculture will have a Ministry of Agriculture to manage this strategic sector of the country - regardless if such a strategic agricultural field is a revenue generator or critical to the domestic needs.</p>
              <p>Singapore has a Ministry of Home Affairs that is structured towards the management of internal security, while the Ministry of Defense handles national defense and security, and even with the Total Defense concept being propagated - it does not look into food supply.</p>
              <p>The Ministry of Trade and Industry is about the only ministry able to handle this matter, as it is concerned with the following critical areas :</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Regional Trade and Investment - dealing mainly with trade policies and development</li>
              <li>GATT and WTO Policies  - affecting domestic trade</li>
              <li>Competition Law - concerning Consumer Protection, Commercial and Industrial land and facilities</li>
              <li>Human Capital - development of Science and Technology, intellectual Property</li>
              <li>Manufacturing and Services - Tourism, International and Regional Economic Relations</li>
              <li>International Business Development - Economic Planning and Expansion</li>
              <li>Enterprise and Entrepreneurship Development - R&amp;D Policies, Productivity</li>
              <li>Energy Security - Gas and Electricity Markets, Economic Defense and Emergency Planning</li>
              <li>Economic Monitoring and Reporting - Economic Modelling, Statistics</li>
              </ul>

              <p>This Ministry of Trade &amp; Industry could give more attention to the strategic needs of Singaporeans; as it does not seem to give any high profile attention to this portion of the ministry's wide portfolio.</p>
              <p> Recently there has been concerns raised that several European countries, and major agricultural regions in the USA are converting their food production resources into products to provide bio-fuels - which are seen to be more profitable.</p>
              <p>This will take a large portion of their agriculture resources away from food production to feed the millions in this World.</p>
              <p>The Singapore Government could take some pro-active action on the world stage to take stock of the World food supply situation, much as Singapore did in taking the lead role to draft the Law of the Sea Agreement that was accepted by nearly every country on this globe.</p>
              <p>It is about time that the highest paid Ministers on this Globe take on a higher profile to prove their worth beyond the shores of Singapore, to protect Singapore's interest - much like Israelis Ministers and Politicians playing the Global Card to protect Israel's survival.</p>

              <p>For you all uninformed ones....</p>
              <p>you people are 10 years too late to ask this question...</p>
              <p>remember the singapore malaysia water agreedment which entitles us to draw water from JOHOR river?</p>
              <p>guess wat.... we have similar agreedment with THAILAND... except that this time its RICE!</p>
              <p>this agreedment is tailor made to meet singapore need for rice during global food shortages or famine.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>of course... some of you already noted singapore actually have a rice stockpile to handle unforseen short term disruption to rice supply.... but i am sure you are now able to rest better knowing our thai brothers will share with us their rice in emergencies...</p>

              <p>For the informed ones - a piece of paper is worth only the face value of the paper, unless the spirit of the letters is respected.</p>
              <p>Despite the Water Agreement between Malaysia and Singapore was signed and lodged with the United Nations, Malaysia was putting up every effort to abrogate the entire agreement - as seen from the events in Year 2002:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #0000ff;">Singapore has rebuffed Malaysia's latest salvo. Singapore's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Dr Rais' remarks are 'not in accord' with the repeated assurances from the Malaysian government that the 1961 and 1962 water agreements would be honoured.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #0000ff;">Singapore's stance is correct. Malaysia cannot scrap the two agreements unilaterally as the documents were lodged with the United Nations. As noted by Singapore's Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew in his memoirs, Singapore would go to the United Nations Security Council if the agreements were breached.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">While Singapore's position is crystal clear, it's unclear if Malaysia could find a way to enact a new law that would bypass the water agreements. Under the water deals, Malaysia is legally obliged to sell water to Singapore at 3 sen per thousand gallons until 2061. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What's less certain is whether Malaysia has the right to determine the amount of water to be sold to Singapore.</span></strong> </span></p>
              <p>
              </p><p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>As the eventual sale quantum depends on available supply, Malaysia may argue that it has a prima facie right to take care of its domestic water needs first before supplying to any 'offshore party'. In other words, all Malaysian states must be self-sufficient in water before Johor could be allowed by the federal government to sell water to Singapore.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Malaysia is probably hoping to dilute the water agreements, without directly breaching the agreements</strong>. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The new proposal, if implemented, to bypass the two water agreements is similar to its action to end the trading of Malaysian stocks on Clob International, Singapore's over-the-counter market four years ago.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">For nearly a decade, Malaysia could not stem the flow of domestic money to Malaysian equities on Clob International. Instead of rescinding the Malaysian stocks on Clob International, Malaysia unilaterally declared Clob International an unrecognised market as part of its regime of capital controls. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Malaysia then ordered all its brokers to deal in Malaysian securities only through the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE) or through an exchange recognised by the KLSE. The move effectively put an end to the trading of Malaysian stocks on Clob International although it is a legitimate market.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Like the move to keep the trading of Malaysian equities in the country, Malaysia will probably attempt to ensure minimal leakage of its water reserves to Singapore, unless the new selling price is acceptable.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">But the water issue is a lot more complicated. Although Malaysia has a right to enact new laws, any attempt to breach the spirit of the water agreements will only strain bilateral relations further. </span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">Unfortunately, ''in times of urgencies'' that befall on every country - not only Singapore - that agreement with Thailand will not save Singapore, when Thailand cannot even have enough rice to feed their own Thai nationals.</span></p>
              <p>if there is a sudden global famine of pandemic maginitude across the entire world, it no longer matters which country you are in or from.... those with food reserves would pray hard their country population is small... and their stockpile is sky high.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">You are right to this extent that if famine is on a global basis, it does not matter which country one is in unless you are in a country with food reserves.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">Then again, the food reserves will also have its own shelf life, and unless renewed before the expiry date or the entire reserve stock is consumed, the final outcome remains bleak.</span></p>
              <p><br>and should the worst come to be... as global power structures crumbles under the waves of hunger, and countries goes to war to secure food... those bullets stored in our underground UAC... could very well determine if your family gets to feed or starve.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">Is there any left that is worth fighting for when famine is on a global scale ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">Can a hungry army have the capacity, energy and stamina to fight, and for how many days ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">Will it not be better for Governments to take consolidated efforts to address the present critical situation before it becomes a worse crisis ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">For a small country, whose ruling politicians had formed the government for the last 45 over years, and had made a deliberately determined decision to be totally dependent on food import, it remains the moral responsibility of this same Politicians to be more pro-active in ensuring the continued stable supply of the staple food of all Singaporeans.</span></p>
