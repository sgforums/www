              <p>A world rice shortage has been looming for the last 24 months, and the situation has not improved up till today.</p>
              <p>Rice producing countries are reducing export quantities, and not renewing current rice export contracts, or reducing the volume of existing export contracts - so as to ensure their own domestic supplies and to maintain social and political stabiliy within their own countries.</p>
              <p>The last time that Singapore experienced a similar situation was during the 1970s, when Singaporeans were encouraged to switch to wheat products and reduce rice consumption.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately for Singaporeans, wheat prices will be as high as the prices for rice, and the world is similarly facing shortages in wheat supply as well.</p>
              <p>Is the Government preparing Singaporeans towards the storm that is brewing ?</p>

              <div class="storybody"></div>
              <p class="storybody"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Vietnam, the world's second-biggest rice exporter, said it would cut exports by 22% this year, following similar moves by India and Egypt. </span></p>
              <p class="storybody"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Analysts said the Vietnam government wanted to stabilise domestic prices. </span></p>
              <p class="storybody"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Global rice prices have soared by 50% in the past two months raising supply concerns across Asia. </span></p>
              <p class="storybody"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Thailand is the world's largest rice exporter. </span></p>
              <p class="storybody"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>China subsidies</strong> </span></p>
              <p class="storybody"><span style="color: #0000ff;">While rice prices have risen primarily because of increasing demand from population growth, they have also been lifted by poor recent crops in Vietnam. </span></p>
              <p class="storybody"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Neighbouring Cambodia has also recently introduced limits on rice exports. </span></p>
              <p class="storybody"><span style="color: #0000ff;">China is the world's biggest rice producer, but almost all of its crop is kept for the domestic market. </span></p>
              <p class="storybody"><span style="color: #0000ff;">With the world's largest population to feed, Beijing keeps rice prices subsidised. </span></p>
              <p class="storybody"><span style="color: #0000ff;">It said on Friday that it would now pay farmers more for both rice and wheat in an attempt to boost crop production and cool surging inflation. </span></p>

              <p>Like you say money may not even buy you the rice or wheat. So it already to the point of not really within the control of the goverment. What they can do is to find alternative source or try to curb the increasing of price to the best that they can.</p>

              <p>So what can they do. Even if they will to give up their million dollars salaries, the problems will not go away.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you insist on a milliion dollars salaried suggestion. let this "assumed million dollars salaried  person" give you a solution. You you want to eat, just pay whatever price they demand or go for cheaper brand of rice, afterall rice is rice.  Mind you, this work for you to obtain the rice you need. You you accept this answer as a solution?   </p>

              a lesson in history here...ntuc was once called 'silo', the purpose? to stockpile food and it's supposed to do the same today, from what i understand, they are to hold 6 months worth of essential goods....if the crisis goes beyond 6 months...hmm i guess we have to eat grass....
              
              this is what sci-fi writers had been writing since decades ago ya....food shortages, climate changes, natural disasters &amp; etc....dooms day scenario countdown, the only thing now is to wait for the impending asteroid or for bush or some other nut to trigger nukes and begin the nuclear winter scenario...perhaps it's time to get a religion....lol....

              <p>Rice once landed in Singapore will be fumigated with Methyl Bromide and that will last at most 3 months before wevils start appearing again. A second fumigation is never recommended so far, not sure if it is effective and not sure if there is any health impact.</p>
              <p>Strategically I know it is mandatory for Singapore rice importers to keep a minimum of 3 months stock, which means all rice we eat now are at least 5 months old, from harvest, to shipping, to storage, to packaging, then to the shelves, then to your house, and another 2 weeks, until you cook the last grain.</p>
              <p>What other food can you keep for long? if you want to buy processed food, there are plenty, from instant noodle to cereal.</p>
              <p>Combat ration is a priviledge only for soldiers. It would be stupid to store processed food like combat ration to fight a world wide food shortage.</p>

              <p>Can't control everything doesn't mean they must stop control everything. I do agree that some of their policies suck, but just ask yourself can you do a better job then them? Anyway politic is a dirty game and it more like choosing the lesser evil.</p>
              <p>Before they come into power they will look like angels to make ppl like them. But once in power their devil horns n tail all come out and ppl will hate them. It a normal cycle.</p>

              <p>Not likely. One day 1 person consume 250g of rice. Lets say 3 million in total (including children and women consumption). 0.75 million per day. * 180 days = 135 million kg of rice. 13.5 million bags of 10 kg bags of rice. Lets be cautious and round down to 10 million bags of 10kg rice.</p>
              <p>And its not transparent as to WHAT they are doing.</p>
              <p>Not to say famine but increased inflation. As Singaporeans can afford it what.</p>
