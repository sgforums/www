A person with enormous emotional stability who does not allow his personal misfortunes or sufferings affect his judgement. In other words, he is impressive," he said.<br><br>The minister mentor said he has extended an invitation on behalf of Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong for Mr Xi to visit Singapore.<br><br>Senior Chinese leaders told Mr Lee that bilateral relations are now poised to move to the next level.<br><br>A proposed eco-city project is also expected to be finalised when Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao visits Singapore.<br><br>Chinese President Hu Jintao told the minister mentor that the project will be a timely collaboration as the world is turning their attention to the environment.<br><br>Noting Mr Lee's efforts and devotion in building bilateral ties, which started even before formal relations were established 17 years ago, Mr Hu said both countries should promote the relationship to new heights.<br><br>Sharing the same sentiments, Chinese State Councillor Tang Jiaxuan told Mr Lee that bilateral ties have entered a track of rapid, steady and mature development, and both sides should make use of complementary advantages to promote and deepen cooperation.<br><br>Sharing his observation of the different generations of Chinese leaders, Mr Lee noted a steady development in the leadership renewal process.<br><br>"I would say that they are beginning to regularise and institutionalise the way leaders are selected or voted into office by the elite at the top, the top crowders. So I expect at the next People's Congress, there will be more consultation, more expression of views, drawing of opinions, and then a final selection with a vote of the key person(s) involved, which created a much more stable position," he said.<br><br>"The senior leaders are prepared to step aside for younger leaders to come forward, so that there's a steady stream of able, committed people who will take on the leadership mantel in the years ahead," Minister for Defence Teo Chee Hean said of the Chinese leaders.<br><br>Minister in the Prime Minister's Office Lim Swee Say added that the Chinese leaders are prepared to go above and beyond to realise their long term goals, even if it means treading in uncharted waters.<br><br>On China-US relations, Mr Lee said that the biggest problem between the two countries is Taiwan, and the challenge is for the US to make sure that nothing foolish happens before the Taiwan elections in March, or there could be an unpredictable outcome. - CNA/ac<br><br></div>

Therefore, we believe that there's room for us to work together for mutual benefit and on the basis of equality and mutual respect."<br><br>A supplementary agreement was also signed between National Development Minister Mah Bow Tan and Chinese Construction Minister Wang Guangtao to guide the implementation details of the Eco-City Project, which will be led by Keppel Corporation.<br><br>Mr Lee said the new project will not be just another commercial venture, but one that reflects Singapore's commitment to share with China its developmental experience.<br><br>The leaders also launched the Singapore-China Foundation (SCF), which provides scholarship and exchange programmes for government officials.<br><br>Earlier, the leaders met for about an hour to discuss wide-ranging issues that include the Singapore-China Free Trade Agreement and Myanmar.<br><br>Premier Wen said China supports UN efforts to broker peace in Myanmar and hope the process of reconciliation can be restored.<br><br>In the days ahead, the Chinese premier will give a lecture at the National University of Singapore and attend the East Asia Summit.<br><br>- CNA/so<br><br></div>
