              <p>Honestly speaking, i dont have any good impression of those China PRC guys, they stare at you, talk so loud and rough, and if they are in a group, better don't disturb them cause they behave like gangster when they are in a group.Not all but most.This is what i saw and i just let it out here in this forum.Anyone agree with me, we must do a control on the input of China PRC into Singapore now! I had to say, control doesnt mean stop them from coming here.I mean control the amount of them getting our jobs.Or to say, control on the quality of the China PRC getting PR.Only good and well behave PRC will get the PR.I am afraid if we did not do a control on the quality of those coming here, Singapore will be flooded by those gangster PRC China people!!!</p>

              <p>It is not only the PRC nationals that are raising the head count, but also the Caucasians from Europe, UK and some from down south; as well as the different ethnic groups from within ASEAN - especially the Chinese from Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand, and some Myanmese and Filippino nationals - all with tertiary education.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans are marrying later, and not producing enough to impact the population replacement count - when two married persons will only produce only one or maximum two babies, and some may not even produce any.</p>
              <p>According to the thinking of the Ruling Political Party, this can affect the long term strategic position of Singapore - in terms of available manpower for the economy, defense and the availability of talents when the social environment will only produce one talent from a pool of ten thousand or perhaps a hundred thousand.</p>
              <p>Should we not hold the Ruling Political Party responsible in creating this environment that lead the Singaporeans into a situation that discourage early marriage, or when married to have babies later, and not producing enough babies to maintain or even increase the population growth ?</p>
              <p>Should we not hold the Ruling Political Party responsible for the supposed lack of talent, when they will not allow an environment for talents to grow, where different ideas will flourish, where mavericks can survive and thrive, where the standard thinking will not stifle new thinking ?</p>
              <p>Afterall, it was the eloquent speeches from the original thinking of the great MM LKY that inspired Singaporeans that energised a political environment that allowed him to exist:</p>

              <blockquote>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><br>"If we are to survive as a free democracy, then we must be prepared, in principle, to concede to our enemies - even those who do not subscribe to our views - as much(sic)constitutional rights as you concede yourself." -<em> Lee Kuan Yew Legislative Assembly Debates Sept 21, 1955 </em><br><br><em>"</em>But we either believe in democracy or we not. If we do, then, we must say categorically, without qualification, that no restraint from the any democratic processes, other than by the ordinary law of the land, should be allowed... If you believe in democracy, you must believe in it unconditionally. If you believe that men should be free, then, they should have the right of free association, of free speech, of free publication. Then, no law should permit those democratic processes to be set at nought, and no excuse, whether of security, should allow a government to be deterred from doing what it knows to right, and what it must know to be right... "- <em>Lee Kuan Yew, Legislative Assembly Debates April 27, 1955</em> <br><br>"Let us get down to fundamentals. Is this an open, or is this a closed society? Is it a society where men can preach ideas - novel, unorthodox, heresies, to established churches and established governments - where there is a constant contest for men's hearts and minds on the basis of what is right, of what is just, of what is in the national interests, or is it a closed society where the mass media - the newspapaers, the journals, publications, TV, radio - either bound by sound or by sight, or both sound and sight, men's minds are fed with a constant drone of sycophantic support for a particular orthodox political philosophy? That is the first question we asked ourselves. I would like to see minds stimulated and debate provoked, and truth refined and crystallized out of the conflict of different evidence and views. I, therefore, welcome every and any opportunity of a chance to agree, or to dissent, in order that out of thesis comes synthesis - thesis, anti-major premise, anti-premise, synthesis, so we progress... I welcome every opportunity to meet members of the opposition, and so do members of my party, over the radio, over the television, university forums, public rallies. We never run away from the open encounter. If your ideas, your views cannot stand the challenge of criticism then they are too fragile and not sturdy enough to last. I am talking of the principle of the open society, the open debate, ideas, not intimidation, persuasion not coercion... Sir, the basic fundamentals we asked ourselves...is whether the duties of the Minister of Information and Broadcasting are to produce closed minds or open minds, because these instruments - the mass media, the TV, the radio - can produce either the open minds receptive to ideas and ideals, a democratic system of life, or closed and limited. But I know that the open debate is a painful process for closed minds...But let me make this point: that 5 million adult minds in Malaysia cannot be closed - definitely not in the lifetime of the people in authority. It is not possible because whatever the faults of the colonial system, and there are many...they generated the open mind, the inquiring mind." <em>- Lee Kuan Yew Dec 18, 1964 Malaysian Parliamentary Debates </em></p>

I am told it is like making love-it is always easier the second time! The first time there may be pangs of conscience, a sense of guilt. But once embarked on this course with constant repetition you get more and more brazen in the attack. All you have to do is to dissolve organizations and societies and banish and detain the key political workers in these societies. Then miraculously everything is tranquil on the surface. Then an intimidated press and the government-controlled radio together can regularly sing your praises, and slowly and steadily the people are made to forget the evil things that have already been done, or if these things are referred to again they're conveniently distorted and distorted with impunity, because there will be no opposition to contradict." <em>-Lee Kuan Yew as an opposition PAP member during 1956 speaking to David Marshall</em></span></p>

              <p>It is not only the PRC nationals that are raising the head
              count, but also the Caucasians from Europe, UK and some from down
              south; as well as the different ethnic groups from
              within ASEAN - especially the Chinese from Malaysia, Indonesia
              and Thailand, and some Myanmese and Filippino nationals -
              all with tertiary education.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans are marrying later, and not producing enough to
              impact the population replacement count - when two married persons
              will only produce only one or maximum two babies, and some may
              not even produce any.</p>
              <p>According to the thinking of the Ruling Political Party, this
              can affect the long term strategic position of Singapore - in
              terms of available manpower for the economy, defense and the
              availability of talents when the social environment will only
              produce one talent from a pool of ten thousand
              or perhaps a hundred thousand.</p>
              <p>Should we not hold the Ruling Political Party responsible in
              creating this environment that lead the Singaporeans into a
              situation that discourage early marriage, or when married to have
              babies later, and not producing enough babies to maintain or even
              increase the population growth ?</p>
              <p>Should we not hold the Ruling Political Party responsible for
              the supposed lack of talent, when they will not allow an
              environment for talents to grow, where different ideas will
              flourish, where mavericks can survive and thrive, where the
              standard thinking will not stifle new thinking ?</p>
              <p>Afterall, it was the eloquent speeches from the
              original thinking of the great MM LKY that inspired
              Singaporeans that energised a political environment that allowed
              him to exist:</p>

              <p>After more then 50 years of continuous Government by a single
              Political Party influenced by the POWER of ONE - has the political,
              social and cultural environment improved from those days under
              Colonial Rule by the British and replaced by the Malaysian Federal
              Government ?</p>

              <p><br>Amazing reading ability from a 'mushroom' - which word in my paragraph which you quoted, had given you the idea that ''Atobe fears the competition from foreigners'' ?</p>
              <p>Yes, since you have brought it up, you should ''be afraid, be very afraid'' - as the dodo was crowded out of their living space on the natural home of the dodo in the Mauritius, by the human population that flowed over from the African continent.</p>
              <p>Similarly, the Indian and Pakistani migrants have been settling down in UK, to such an extent that the social color of UK has turned from white to chocolate, with the fresh English country air jarred by the acrid smell of curries and garlic.</p>
              <p>At least, the British has the political and social space to raise their voices and have them truly heard and represented in Parliament.</p>
              <p>Does Singaporeans have that same space under the rule of the Power of One, that replaced Colonial Rule with Autocratic Rule ?</p>
