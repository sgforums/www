When he was caught, all his mother did was to apologise to others on his behalf.<br><br>One day, he stole jewels that were meant for the emperor. It was a capital offence, so he was to be executed.<br><br>At the execution, he told his mother he wanted to suckle at her breast one last time, but proceeded to bite off her nipple instead.<br><br>The man screamed: 'I am in this state today, because you never disciplined me at all. You never made me pay for my mistakes. Now I am paying for them, and so shall you!'<br><br>With that, he was executed.<br><br>I remember I was rather grossed-out at the tale, but I never forgot its lesson.<br><br>And it was why I was so upset when I read about the boy in school uniform who reportedly punched a bus driver when he and his girl friend were stopped from getting off the public bus.<br><br>They had earlier refused to let the driver confiscate the girl's Ez-link card, which was suspected to be stolen or lost.<br><br>My initial reaction was one of embarrassment when I saw which school the boy is from.<br><br>I was from Chinese High School which, together with Hwa Chong Junior College, is now Hwa Chong Institution - the boy's school.<br><br>Then I started getting annoyed when I read that the boy called his father crying when he realised the police had been called.<br><br>FORGIVENESS<br><br>If the boy felt 'man enough' to 'defend' his girlfriend and beat up someone over it, why wasn't he 'man enough' to face the consequences of what he had done?<br><br>When the bus driver drove into the terminal, the boy's father was waiting there to apologise, and to the amazement of many, the father knelt in front of the bus driver to seek forgiveness for his son.<br><br>At this part of the report, I gave up and flung the papers down in disgust.<br><br>I am not sure whose backbone was missing there - the father's or the son's.<br><br>Is there a lesson from this incident staring us in the face?<br><br>What was the father thinking? Did the father think he was helping his son?<br><br>What was the boy thinking as he saw his father kneeling there, giving up his self-respect, begging on his behalf?<br><br>As I discussed the issue with my parents, my father said flatly to me: 'If you ever do that, don't expect me to kneel for you. You do something wrong, you face up to it.'<br><br>I'm not going to argue with him.<br><br>The behaviour of the father disturbed me, as I wondered about parents like him who would fall to their knees for their children's bad behaviour.<br><br>We need to send out a message that no matter who you are, which school you are from, who your parents are and what they do, you alone have to face the consequences of your wrongdoing.<br><br>But it is tragic that we are thrown back to feudal times, where such sacrifice of dignity is needed so that someone else may get off for wrongdoing.<br><br>The writer, 22, is a second-year political science undergraduate.<br><br></div>
