              <p>The main issues that puzzles me are, firstly they keep raising the conservatory fees and claimed that it is a only a minimal amount as to compare the cost of maintaining the estate, upgrading the facilities and the high labour cost. Whatever fees that are charge to the residents are for the benifits of the residents itselves and not for their profit taking.</p>
              <p>And so, many times we have heard residents being charge of interest and lawyer fees for not paying their conservatory fees on time and residents being drag to courts and sent behind bars for failing to pay their fees.</p>
              <p>I am not trying to say that they have to to be charitable in running the Town Council but by charging interest and lawyer fees to the unaffortable, dragging them to court and putting them behind bar for not able to pay the fees...where is the humanity act? where is the care for the residents that have voted and make your payday possible?</p>
              <p>Even with your installment plans, amount payable plan are set by TC and not to the capability of the residents and when they default and payment...tada..off you go to the court dude! and no more installment plan for you..you got to pay them in full.</p>
              <p>And this is exactly what happen to a buddy of mine who was retranched and jobless for almost 2 years.</p>
              <p>I am a person who believe in retribution, what goes around comes around. If you have heart for others...your life will be much more beautiful then it is now.</p>
              <p>Lastly, if any of you still remember once there was an opposition party who was charge for misappropriating the TC fund. He eventually lost the election and charged in court...looks like the next election will not come any sooner....lol</p>
              <p>Now, can we say that this is also a misappropriating of funds? Since it done without the knowledge of the residents and also the people of Singapore.</p>

              <p>let's say if potong pasir runs into problem with monies, they will be ridiculed by these learned scholars for running into a deficit and couldn't manage their money.</p>
              <p>town council exists to manage and maintain public properties. their sole job is to do manage this well in the most cost effective manner. not build surpluses to buffer against future expenses as they like to position it. typical bs.</p>
              <p>thank goodness for the lehman fiasco, this `rubbish' is now widely strewn all over the estates. the clean-up would be interesting. let's see how much is swept under the carpet. </p>
              <p>interestingly, one never would have guessed what happened in wall street will cast a dark shadow on this government, which for a long time has lost sight of what it means to serve the ppl first.</p>

              <p>Why are we paying more than we should to the TC so that they can build such a huge reserve when they could have ask if the need arise? In asking for the extras, they had "invested" or gambled for a returns.</p>
              <p>To put it in a crude way, we could have "invested" or gambled it away ourself. let says if I used $1 to "invest" in 4D. my returns for 1st price is 2000 times the amount I put in. If I were to lose, I'm answerable to myself and I still have to answer to the call of the TC for the monthly TC fees. Now that the $16m has gone kaput, who is answerable? an honest mistake?</p>

              <p><br>that is a rhetorical question.</p>
              <p>they will never let up on collecting too much s-11.</p>
              <p>let's say if potong pasir runs into problem with monies, they will be ridiculed by these learned scholars for running into a deficit and couldn't manage their money.</p>
              <p>town council exists to manage and maintain public properties. their sole job is to do manage this well in the most cost effective manner. not build surpluses to buffer against future expenses as they like to position it. typical bs.</p>
              <p>thank goodness for the lehman fiasco, this `rubbish' is now widely strewn all over the estates. the clean-up would be interesting. let's see how much is swept under the carpet. </p>
              <p>interestingly, one never would have guessed what happened in wall street will cast a dark shadow on this government, which for a long time has lost sight of what it means to serve the ppl first.</p>

              <p>it will be more than sweeping under the carpet more like how to hide the skeletons<br>maybe it will be just like the 'Bush Joke' - "what the f*** happened to billy"</p>
