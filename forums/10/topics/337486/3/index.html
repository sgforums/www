              <p>Aiyah.. u all dun propaganda lah. The net amount of toen council money is still positive even after the loss. So can dun spread rumors and sway people into opposition or not.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You people always look at the negative side. Typical singaporean. I can see many coffeeshop people also picking fish bones again about govt and town council.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>-First, they disclose the news, is honesty liao, so that is a good thing.</p>
              <p>-Second, when they made money in the past, so even with these loss, there is still money still, so what is there to complain.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thirdly, you people say the town council is gambler or corrupt, you all better dun anyhow say. Back with substantial argument. Wait you all kana sue then you know.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If town council got used our money for personal usage, then that is wrong. SO for all kpkb, please provide ample evidence instead of misleading readers... If really for embezzment, then we should really lambast the people involved, if not, dun anyhow complain.</p>

              <p><br>the point is that TC should not even be claiming extra from residents to invest, when they are after all a public service provider.</p>
              <p>i don't mind organizations like PUB to invest their profits in wadever ventures.</p>
              <p>but TCs? no way.</p>
              <p>their sole purpose is not to sell us water or electricity. they have always existed to <strong>coordinate </strong>efforts in maintaining the estate, i.e. hire cleaners, pay the utility bills for the estate.</p>
              <p>we pay them just enough to cover their operating cost. they are never meant to be a for profit agency, with a $1bn fund which no one knows of until they disclose the $12m losses.</p>
              <p>losses are revealed to us to save their ass, while news of profits are kept silence.</p>
              <p>SP power is a for profit company, but town councils are not. thus, it is not justifiable for them to charge extra for hoarding and investing. why do they need the extra money from investment anyway? do they operate like companies, where they need funds to acquire other companies? no. even if they manage to earn extra, the profits made from the "illegally-charged fees" do not go back to the residents in any sense.</p>
              <p>the residents are still over-charged regardless of whether the TCs' investment make a profit or not.</p>

First, why did the TC in invested in Lehman-linked structured products without the knowledge of the people? Second, why the president has no say in this? Third, whatever happened to Mas selamat? Fourth, why did the recess bell go off 20 minutes <em>early</em>? And fifth, what the fuck happened to AndrewPKYap?</p>

              <p>to be honest, i dun blame the town counicl for investing the moeny. Like all investment, there's always a risk involve. Else, inflation is just gona diminnish their funds. It is an honest mistake and someone will have to take the fall. We all like to go around witch hunting when thing goes wrong, such is the society we live in. Else, there wont be improvement if ppl think they can get away with lossing million of dollars.</p>
              <p>But what surprise me is, town councils are actually so rich!!! 16 with 1b of sinking fund. and that is just sinking fund! Why are we still seeing old women/men sourcing paper cardboard, can, begging on our everyday life? Cant they take like 0.1% of this fund to feed them or provide for them?</p>
              <p>sigh... a money driven society leader with very liitle compassion for those founder that once help build the city that they inherited.</p>

              <p>I think if the surpluses are indeed "returned" to the people, people are more willing to accept losses that comes with risks.</p>
