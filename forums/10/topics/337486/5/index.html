              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Secondly, these people did not vote them in to cock-up.</span></span></p>

              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">They cock-up, they must pay for it.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Otherwise "if "I won 66.6% of the votes" can be used as an excuse" then they can murder people and get away with it.</span></span></p>

              <div class="story_text">TWO People's Action Party (PAP) town councils are reviewing their investment strategies, just days after it was revealed that they had some funds exposed to toxic products.
              <p>Pasir Ris-Punggol and Tampines town councils told The Straits Times yesterday that they are rethinking how best to invest their funds in the light of the global downturn.</p>
              <p>Dr Ahmad Magad, MP and chairman of Pasir Ris-Punggol, said that his town council is exploring safer financial options that are 'much more protected, which will also mean lower returns'.</p>
              <p>Parliament was told on Monday that the Pasir Ris-Punggol Town Council had invested $4 million, or 2.7 per cent of its total funds, in financial products linked to the now-bankrupt Lehman Brothers investment bank.</p>
              <p>It was one of eight town councils which had a total of $16 million exposed to various troubled products. These included Lehman Minibonds and the now worthless Merrill Lynch Jubilee Series 3 LinkEarner Notes.</p>
              <p>Dr Ahmad acknowledged that his town council's investment had caused some unhappiness. It thus decided to move to safer options.</p>
              <p>In addition, the bleak global economic outlook 'means that we have to think about how best to invest our money', he said.</p>
              <p>Likewise, Tampines Town Council chairman Ong Kian Min said he will discuss with his fund managers what needs to be tweaked in their investments: 'We will not tell them exactly what to do, as they are the experts. But it is a good time to discuss our strategy now, as we constantly do.'</p>
              <p>Tampines Town Council has $22 million parked with three fund managers and had $250,000 invested in Lehman Brothers bonds, which, like the Minibonds, are also in distress.</p>
              <p>Other PAP town councils The Straits Times spoke to said that they were comfortable with their current levels of investing as they had taken care to be conservative and prudent. For instance, Tanjong Pagar Town Council, which had $250,000 in Lehman bonds, said that it takes a cautious approach.</p>
              <p>The fund managers told the council that they invested in the Lehman product because it was rated very safe earlier this year, said the council spokesman. About 22 per cent of its funds are parked with fund managers. These generated $16 million from 2004 to last year, she added.</p>
              <p>A check with the opposition wards showed that Potong Pasir put funds only in Singapore bonds and cash deposits, and did not employ a fund manager.</p>
              <p>Its latest financial statement showed that it held $2.5 million in bonds last year, now valued at $2.61 million - a return of about 4 per cent.</p>
              <p>Hougang placed 40 per cent of its sinking fund with a fund manager. This generated 6 per cent a year in the last three years, said Hougang MP Low Thia Khiang earlier this month.</p>
              <p>He did not respond to queries from this newspaper yesterday on how this was achieved.</p>
              <p>That town council investments have been paying off over the years is something that should not be brushed off, said Mr Inderjit Singh, chairman of Ang Mo Kio-Yio Chu Kang Town Council.</p>
              <p>His town council had $1.5 million exposed to Lehman Brothers bonds through its fund manager, but it has otherwise been generating 3 per cent returns a year for three years.</p>
              <p>Mr Inderjit said: 'Just one investment out of 30 lost money. We have made money overall, which is good for the town.'</p>

              <p>Bah, what a weak excuse. 1. Nobody expects town councils to collect so much in  conservancy charges so that they can become hedge fund managers.  2. When was the last time the conservancy charges were ever *lowered* because of their investment gains? No thanks to embezzlement</p>

                                    more than just money. Comment. By Seah Chiang Nee.<br> Nov 22, 2008</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">It never 
                                    rains, but pours; it wouldn’t have been too bad if 
                                    I were just talking about the weather.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">I’m 
                                    referring to the growing pain that the global financial 
                                    meltdown is wreaking on this small affluent state.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">It has 
                                    made us – the government and the people – a 
                                    lot less rich, and pushed the poorer class into deeper dire 
                                    straits. It has eroded national cohesiveness and widened 
                                    the economic gap.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">The 
                                    country has been pushed back by at least a decade, possibly 
                                    more. Leaders have warned that the pre-crisis living may 
                                    not come back for some years.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">The 
                                    government, which had been sweeping general elections, is 
                                    evidently worried about an upsurge in discontent that could 
                                    erode its power base.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">“The 
                                    crisis has dealt a blow to public trust in the younger leaders’ 
                                    ability to help people manage the crisis,” said an 
                                    activist.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Take 
                                    weekends at the Speakers Corner.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Hundreds 
                                    of victims of the US financial woes have been gathering 
                                    almost every Saturday to vent their anger at what they see 
                                    as government failure to protect their interests.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">This 
                                    by itself is a national phenomenon, considering that public 
                                    protests had been forbidden until a few months ago.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">The 
                                    protesters are among 10,000 Singaporeans who have lost S$500mil 
                                    (RM1.2bil) of their life savings on “toxic” 
                                    Lehman Brothers products sold here by DBS, a government-controlled 
                                    bank.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">When 
                                    Lehman went bankrupt, these structured notes, which were 
                                    extremely complicated products offering a high 5% interest, 
                                    became worthless.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Many 
                                    claim the local banks had portrayed them as a safe product, 
                                    instead of telling them that if one of the six underwriting 
                                    banks goes bust, the principal amount would be loss.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">DBS 
                                    has denied this, and the Monetary Authority of Singapore 
                                    (MAS) is investigating specific charges. Meanwhile, a small 
                                    number of old and ill-educated investors have been refunded.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">The 
                                    irate protesters are not your usual breed of street protesters, 
                                    but hail from Singapore’s most conservative, pro-government 
                                    citizenry.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Some 
                                    are retirees and housewives, careful investors, who speak 
                                    no English. Women have openly wept while the men, with controlled 
                                    anger, lashed out at what they consider the government’s 
                                    unsympathetic response.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Before 
                                    tempers cool, another public outcry has erupted with serious 
                                    repercussions for the government, and undermined its standing 
                                    in Singapore’s heartland.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Eight 
                                    of the 14 PAP-managed town councils, which altogether have 
                                    S$2bil in “sinking funds” reserves, have invested 
                                    and lost S$16mil in the failed structured products.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">The 
                                    money was collected from every household and meant for use 
                                    in the estate’s upkeep.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">They 
                                    refer only to the toxic products and do not include investments 
                                    in other markets, which have declined significantly in value. 
                                    There has been no town council disclosure of total losses.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Questions 
                                    about the town councils’ total investments – 
                                    let alone losses – are unknown. So really, how much 
                                    money has been lost?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Residents 
                                    are worried that the market decline will mean higher conservancy 
                                    charges.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">“My 
                                    questions are: Why were these estate funds – with 
                                    PAP members of Parliament in charge – allowed to be 
                                    used to buy risky papers?” asked a web writer.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">In the 
                                    first place, why were they collecting so much excess funds 
                                    instead of using it to develop the estates?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Criticism 
                                    has been widespread because it affects more than a million 
                                    people – although very marginally.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Some 
                                    Singaporeans fear that more skeletons will emerge within 
                                    the government machinery as the crisis deepens.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Many 
                                    statutory boards, educational institutions, trade unions 
                                    and armed forces may have saved up and invested billions.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Those 
                                    who did are continuing to see the flow of red ink.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">The 
                                    conventional wisdom is that the current storm will blow 
                                    over and the lost value will be restored – but that 
                                    is many years away.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Amidst 
                                    the “sinking funds” losses, it was announced 
                                    that four Statutory Boards had incurred 14% market losses 
                                    this year, none of which were Lehman’s toxic products.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">They 
                                    were the Civil Service College, Singapore Land Authority, 
                                    Infocomm Development Authority and the Professional Engineers’ 
                                    Board. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">However, 
                                    the losses represented only 0.05% of their total investment 
                                    portfolios.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">The 
                                    market rewards were rich during the good times, but the 
                                    punishment is just as hefty when times are bad. So why does 
                                    Singapore invest so mightily?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">The 
                                    reason lies in its small size and lack of natural resources, 
                                    which has forced it to rely on two things – human 
                                    skill and capital.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">During 
                                    the past 20 years, its investments overseas have been leaping.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Individually 
                                    they’re getting bigger. Previous totals of tens – 
                                    or at most a few hundred – millions of dollars, have 
                                    been eclipsed by new shareholdings today which are often 
                                    measured in the billions.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">It is 
                                    not known whether – or to what extent – the 
                                    post-crisis government will review its investment policies. 
                                    At the moment, Temasek and GIC appear to be adopting a more 
                                    cautious approach.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Some 
                                    10 years ago – even before the current big investment 
                                    push, Singapore was seen as a prime global candidate for 
                                    excess saving and investment.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">The 
                                    Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco wrote in 1997: “Singapore’s 
                                    saving and investment rates are the highest in the world, 
                                    and much of this saving and investment is mandated by the 
                                    government.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">“This 
                                    is in sharp contrast to Western industrialised countries 
                                    ... we cannot rule out the possibility that Singapore invests 
                                    too much.”</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">As industries 
                                    worldwide reduce their operations, Singapore, too, is cutting 
                                    back on its ambition.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">But 
                                    it will likely continue to develop its external wings – 
                                    by significantly investing abroad – perhaps on a much 
                                    more cautious mode.</span></p>
