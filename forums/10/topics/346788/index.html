              <h1>Building a New Policy for Latin America</h1>
              <h1><strong>Killing the Monroe Doctrine </strong></h1>
              <p>By SAUL LANDAU and PHILIP BRENNER</p>
              <p>P<span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">resident
                  Barack Obama could swiftly improve U.S. relations with Latin America by
                  announcing the death of the Monroe Doctrine and then presiding over its
                  funeral. Such a statement would cost him little domestically, and win
                  him praise and appreciation throughout Latin America and much of the
                  world.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Most
                  Americans don't know the details of this 185-year-old policy and could
                  care less about it. Latin Americans, in contrast, not only can describe
                  the Monroe Doctrine, but they revile it. In effect, it has become
                  nothing more than hollow rhetoric that offends the very people it
                  purports to defend.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">In
                  1823, Secretary of State John Quincy Adams wrote, and President James
                  Monroe proclaimed, a doctrine that asserted U.S. political character is
                  different from Europe's. The United States, President Monroe declared,
                  would consider the extension of Europe's monarchical political
                  influence into the New World "as dangerous to our peace and safety."
                  European powers should leave the Americas for the Americans, he warned,
                  and he strongly implied that there existed a U.S. sphere of influence
                  south of the border.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">At
                  the time, Europe shrugged. After all, the United States possessed
                  neither a formidable army nor navy. But three serious problems
                  fundamentally vitiated this apparently noble gesture to protect newly
                  independent republics in South America from European re-colonization.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">First,
                  Washington proclaimed it unilaterally. Latin Americans didn't ask us
                  for protection. U.S. diplomats didn't even consult their counterparts.
                  That was ironic, since the Doctrine's "protection" involved placing the
                  United States between Latin American countries and supposedly
                  malevolent European states.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Second,
                  its paternalism — the claim that "our southern brethren" lack the
                  ability to defend themselves — raises hackles in Latin America. Even if
                  the implication had some validity at one time, it no longer corresponds
                  to the region's reality.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">The
                  third and most problematic issue Obama faces from the outmoded doctrine
                  relates to its legacy. For more than a century, the United States has
                  periodically intervened in the domestic affairs of Latin American
                  countries. Typically the United States invoked the Monroe Doctrine —
                  without threats from Europe — to justify self-serving intrusions that
                  have inflicted heavy damage on Latin American dignity and sovereignty.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; color: #990000;"><strong>Roosevelt Corollary</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Under
                  President Theodore Roosevelt, the doctrine stood for the informal
                  colonization of most "independent" Caribbean Basin countries. The
                  so-called Roosevelt Corollary to the Monroe Doctrine claimed
                  Washington's right to preemptively intervene and occupy a Latin
                  American nation, even if no European power had yet threatened to impose
                  its power there. Roosevelt asserted that by virtue of going into debt
                  to a European bank, a Latin American country weakened itself
                  sufficiently to be vulnerable to re-colonization. Ergo, anticipatory
                  military intervention became a necessity from 1900 to 1933.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">U.S.
                  troops invaded Colombia in 1901 and 1902; Honduras in 1903, 1907, and
                  1911; and the Dominican Republic in 1903, 1904, 1914, and 1916,
                  occupying the island nation until 1924. U.S. troops landed in Nicaragua
                  on multiple occasions, occupying it for some 20 years, and occupied
                  Cuba for three years (1906-1909) and Haiti for 20 years. U.S. forces
                  also made incursions into Mexico, Panama, Guatemala, and Costa Rica.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">President
                  Dwight D. Eisenhower used the doctrine in 1954 to justify the overthrow
                  of a democratically elected government in Guatemala. President John F.
                  Kennedy embraced it from 1961 to 1963 in attacking Cuba, and President
                  Lyndon B. Johnson raised its banner in 1965 when he sent 23,000 Marines
                  into the Dominican Republic in support of generals who tyrannically
                  governed the country over the next 13 years. President Ronald Reagan
                  said it was the basis for the CIA wars he pursued in Nicaragua, El
                  Salvador, and Guatemala during which more than 200,000 Central
                  Americans died, as well as the U.S. attack on Grenada.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">For
                  these historic reasons, "Monroeism" carries a deeply negative meaning
                  in Latin America and the Caribbean. Throughout the region, the mere
                  mention of the Monroe Doctrine hints at impending U.S. aggression.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Nearly
                  two decades after the Cold War's demise, U.S. policy elites still cling
                  to this doctrine as an axiom of U.S. policy. In recent years they added
                  as the latest corollary a demand that Latin American governments adopt
                  neoliberal economics. No wonder Latin Americans have elected leaders —
                  in Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Chile, Ecuador, Nicaragua, Paraguay,
                  Guatemala, Honduras, Uruguay, and Venezuela — who repudiated not only
                  the doctrine's implied hegemony, but the economic rules that accompany
                  it today. Notably, not one Western hemispheric country supported the
                  United States in October, when the UN General Assembly voted 185-3 to
                  end the U.S. embargo against Cuba.</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; color: #990000;">The Ballots Did It</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Over
                  the last decade, citizens in Venezuela, Brazil, Argentina, Bolivia,
                  Ecuador, Nicaragua, and other Central American nations have declared
                  their opposition to U.S.-backed neoliberal economic policies and voted
                  for candidates who eschew the notion of perpetual U.S. hegemony.
                  Ballots, ultimately, killed the doctrine. This new wave of leaders is
                  challenging U.S. supremacy. Last year, Bolivian President Evo Morales
                  did what would have been unthinkable two decades ago: He evicted the
                  U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency. Ecuador has kicked out a U.S. military
                  base.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Most
                  Latin American nations now defy the United States on some major policy.
                  Chile and Mexico, both Security Council Members, voted against
                  Washington when the key UN resolution arose that would have sanctioned
                  Bush's invasion of Iraq. And U.S. influence has been further eroded by
                  the stronger diplomatic, economic, and military ties with China,
                  Russia, and Iran that several countries in the region are developing.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Given
                  the facts, President Obama should announce as soon as possible — and no
                  later than the mid-April Summit of the Americas in Trinidad that he's
                  slated to attend — that the Monroe Doctrine is dead and buried. This
                  move could serve as a rhetorical catalyst for developing real
                  partnerships that acknowledge Latin America's new status. Only the
                  funeral of this 19th-century canon will enable the United States to
                  birth a healthy policy.</span></p>

              <p>I don't quite understand where this fear of the Russians are coming from.</p>
              <p>Let's not talk history, let's talk about plain strategic vulnerability.</p>
              <p>The Russians are surrounded on 3 sides by nuclear capable countries/coalitions (EU, China, India).The EU may have something in common with them in terms of skin color and religion but not so in China and India.</p>
              <p>Thus, i do not believe they would be able to project their sphere of influence as broadly as the Americans, who has the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans as natural barriers against invasion and bordered in the North by a country (Canada) that's very similar with them in terms of culture and in the South by a country who do not have the military capability to threaten the US.</p>
              <p>While i do not discount the possibility  that they would bully other countries to get what they want, i would say the Americans are by far the greater Devil on the global stage.</p>
