Telecommunication companies have all been performing badly. i would attribute this to the deregulation... resulting in companies over paying in their acquisition. But in an industry where fixed cost of RnD is so high, such a move is needed to gain scale economies. So we can't judge now. Besides DoCoMo, most telecommunication companies have been shareholder value destroyers over the past 5 yrs. so we shld judge by industry standards</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>actually diggo addressed most the issue i wanted to. but since i am enjoying this, i'll continue  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br><strong>larger as it is, Taiwan's domestic market is still puny compared to the worldwide demand necessary to support its globalised industries. like Singapore, Taiwan needs to reach out to the world to prosper hence their situation is not dissimilar to ours. </strong><br><br>i agree with this.<br><br><strong>we haven't really gotten out of our problems either so i shall argue that we're no better.<br><br>but that's not what the statistics tell us ... hong kong's economy will be more tightly interwoven with china's and in the long run will ride the wave better than us.</strong><br><br>my arguement is the same. HK has China to lean on. if not for China they'll be in big trouble.<br><br>a result of their lassez faire aprroach. this is a sweeping statement, but there are many economist that would agree with me. i can provide references to justify my arguement if u need me to.<br><br><strong>having a god father is one thing but being ingenious is even more crucial and that comes with freedom to make choices and to practise business acumen. if everything is centrally directed, if the destiny of everyone lies within the hands of a select few, we would be (and we have been) at the mercy of the mistakes of those chosen ones who have proven to be human after all ... </strong><br><br>i agree with u. on a side note.. S'pore not that bad right? i've always thought that maybe politically we;re restrictive, but economically we're pretty liberal? correct me if i'm wrong.<br><br><strong>past formulas don't work as well anymore, even the govt has realised that and is emphasizing biomedical research now ... </strong><br><br>this is what i have been arguing for. constant upgrading<br><br><strong>compared to low labour cost industries, of course high value adding industries are better ... but still not as good as being the owners of these high value adding industries for at the end of the day, most of the value that we add goes to the owners ... we're simply providing a service - manufacturing service. </strong><br><br>O, definitely! if we r the ownder that will be better. but somehow that isn't happening. is it the govt's fault or ours? i think it's a bit of both. sometimes, i really think we need to look towards ourselves a bit more often.<br><br><strong>no offense taken. essentially, after Chiang Kai Shek's death, the country liberalised so much so that today, the nationalists are no longer in power. this is indeed a radical transformation and while i'm not saying whether or not this is the best political outcome, the benefit to their economy is evident in terms of the strength with which they weathered the 9-11 and other recent global storms. </strong><br><br>i agree with this<br><br><strong><br>my message was, since we're no different from them, why condem them when we're gulty of the same practices? Aren't we slapping ourselves? </strong><br><br>O, i think u've got my stance wrong. i said they practise relationship lending and crony capitalism. i didn't say it was wrong  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  . i do not subscribe to the neo-classical view, i feel strongly that for a country to succeed, the govt must play a pervasive role. which is exactly what all the Asian countries have been doing all this while.<br><br><strong>there is a fundamental difference. if no one supplies water to me, i can build my own well. if no one gives me jobs, i can find my ways. if someone ties my hands behind my back and stuff my mouth with propaganda, i am left helplessly to be taken at ransom. </strong><br><br>my area of research is actually focusing on China's development. i can assure u that the people there face a much tougher business environment than S'poreans, but speaking with some of the more successsful entrepreneurs, what struck me was they knew the govt will not help them, but still persevered anyway. maybe we should learn?<br><br><strong>sounds fine but i feel that ultimately we should simply let things be. we have nurtured our children as best as we could. the only way for them to grow further is for them to seek their own destinies. by dictating where they go and what they do, they can never develop the wings to fly far. </strong><br><br>hahaa.... i'm still very young.  i'll fight for my destiny too  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br><strong>the authorities have always been harping on foreign talent and many of the leg shaking, cosy jobs are given to ang moh expats. all these indicate that we're not as well regarded as we ought to be</strong><br><br>honestly, i dun like it either.<br><br></div>
