They can simply write any internal circular to limit tender participations in any projects to their own government agencies and not to admit any particular private sector if they choose to do so.  </blockquote>First of all, there is no evidence of such internal memos. I have competed with GLCs before for govt projects and won even though my offer costs more.<br>Even if they do have such an instruction, it is still a free market cos they are free to choose anybody they want to do business with.<br><br><blockquote><br>Try to tell NTUC to follow the market practice they will tell you that they are the cooperative and should be allowed to do anything in that name. </blockquote>Huh? Is NTUC a GLC? You don't even know what a GLC is, what the hell are you talking about?<br><br><blockquote><br>Some foreign insurance companies will tell you why they are backing away from government controlled businesses whenever NTUC is bidding - they have no chance to compete because of certain discriminations. </blockquote>Rubbish! NTUC only does retail insurance.<br>Can you tell us which foreign insurance company and which GLC you are talking about?<br>Again, NTUC is not a GLC. You can't even tell which is a GLC. I suggest you stop BS here.<br><br><blockquote><br>Try to tell Straits Times not to charge their excessive advertisement fees, they will tell you all their rules and regulations and policies. But when they decide that the news print has gone up they will tell you they will have to increase their copy prices. </blockquote>Excessive fees? Based on what?<br>Whats wrong with increasing print price when the price of paper has gone up so much? How can a free market economy restrict companies from increasing prices? Are you anti free enterprise?<br><br><blockquote><br>So much is the monopoly of government in businesses that the market freedom is not real. That is why all the government services and GLC prices will keep going up. </blockquote>Be specific will you? What monopoly are you refering to?<br><br><blockquote><br>Furthermore GLCs are simply not enterprises in the sense that they will be run like the private free-market entities. They will always use the government backing to increase profits to make up for the lack of competitiveness or entrepreneurship.</blockquote>I don't think you have an idea of what a free enterprise market is. How can a free enterprise market be restricting profits?<br><br><blockquote><br>So when MediaCorps splits into two but failed due to bureaucracy and lack of entrepreneurship, they know that they could merge again to make them the only monopoly to entitle them to charge higher fees.<br><br>Now Mediacorps is profitable again because of monopoly not free market.</blockquote>Er.. can you explain why the govt would want to canibalise its own profits in the first place if they want a monopoly?<br><br><blockquote><br>Try to tell the HDB not to go into business, or increase their shop rentals beyond what the market can afford, they will laugh away all such simplistic suggestion because they know that no one can tell them what to do.</blockquote>What is wrong with increasing shop rentals when there are so many people queuing to rent? Are you sure you know what is free enterprise?<br><br><blockquote><br>On the day the government decided to go into business there is no more free market and all the free market talks today is just an assumptions and not the truth because there is no such thing as markets once the government decides to go into business.     </blockquote>I think you just don't have the guts or ability to compete hard, you want easy business. This is a free enterprise economy my friend. Whining instead of competing won't get you anywhere.<br><br>Singapore has consistently been voted as one of the freest economies in the world, second only to Hong Kong and even overtaking them at one time.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>If GLCs take up say 30% of private sector's traditional business what will happen to our economic competitiveness?</blockquote>Where did you get that figure? Out of the air?<br>What is your definition of tradional business?<br><br><blockquote><br>Let us examine the following:-<br><br>(1) These GLCs will step into the traditional domestic sector to take away equivalent amount of business.<br><br>(2) These GLCs will develop to take away the domestic businesses by fair or foul means causing shrinking domestic businesses.</blockquote>Like?<br><br><blockquote><br>(3) CEOs and managers will take over the traditional entrepreneurs in running of GRCs displacing the free-market entrepreneurs who will dwindle in numbers.</blockquote>GLCs are in fact better managed than local antrepreneurs? Have you worked with local companies?<br><br><blockquote><br>(4) With gradual reductions in entrepreneurs, domestic economy will grow weakers while the GLCs continue to expand to take over all the government-related businesses displacing more and more domestic business pies.</blockquote>Not true. GLCs can grow the economy and they are actually very limited in scope. In other words, its not a problem for true entrepreneurs.<br><br><blockquote><br>(5) Monies and profits of GLCs go into government's coffers and not the private citizens' investments thereby reducing expansions of investments in the private sector.</blockquote>It goes into public spending and back to private citizens.<br>I think you don't have a clear view of fund flows in an economy do you?<br><br><blockquote><br>(6) GLCs being mostly run by government, are not run like enterprises but monopolies thereby reducing entrepreneurship in these companies. Over time they will have to seek price increases as the way to continue their growth.<br></blockquote>Not true, GLCs are better runned than many local enterprises.<br><br><blockquote><br>(7) Citizens end up being made to pay fees increases for all the GLC-run services and businesses while the domestic sector is deprived of corresponding growths.</blockquote>Not necessarily. GLCs can also be a stabilising factor when it comes to prices.<br>In fact, had there been no GLCs, many goods and services would have gone up even higher in prices either under private individuals or by foreign companies.<br><br><blockquote><br>GLCs are not helping to grow the economy but are constraining the real growth by monopolies. Examples are failures - SBSs and MediaCorps which cannot do well due to lack of entrepreneurship and finally have to depend more and more on fee monopolistic fee increases and not true competitions to make profits.   </blockquote>SBS privatised remember?<br>Mediacorp is doing fine. The market in Singapore is just too small for two players.<br><br></div>

This kind of business will not bring in the technological advancement or start-ups. There is no evidence that our scholars or public servants possess the true entrepreneurship.<br><br>By taking over some existing shipyards and going into ship repairs or rig buildings, many private sector people have done it all the time. By cannabalizing and restructuring existing banks taken over with monies like DBS may be growing but sooner or later it will have to come up with its own products in order to stay successful like the fortune 500 banks. So it is not a case of entrepreneurship or technology growth which is what we need to upgrade the whole economy.<br><br>We may end up with more losses as government might still take over some micropolis type and found that they lack the technology excellenece and have to suffer losses. CSM is losing a lot of monies because of such lack of total knowledge applications.<br><br>Many new technologies will have to be understood by going into them based on master plans and thorough implementation excellence otherwise they will continue to lose monies one after another ventures.<br><br>Now Yeo Cheow Tong tried to say that biomedicals would take up to 30 years to see results.

Even the MNCs will have to move away from here eventually as well because of higher operating costs due to direct and indirect taxes like double-charges on lands and triple charges on vehicles etc that make their operations uncompetitive.<br><br>If government understands fundamentals of economics they should know that by letting citizens make more monies with less taxes and charges monies will go round and round among the people more times and at the end the government coffers will grow more from higher volumes of taxes.<br><br>In this way, a pro-business government can create greater vibrancy and the domestic sector will grow more viable and competitive.</div>
