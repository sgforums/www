That is one thing you do not notice. If you look at the whole economy, govt is very selective and and do mostly export type businesses or businesses that the private sector will not go into. In effect, the govt actually craeted a lot of opportunities for locals with their ventures.<br><br><blockquote><br>In addition, our tax-and-recover government system of running the country is extremely anti-business.

We must avoid it or end up like New Orleans.<br><br><blockquote><br>Hence, government charges fees to recover all costs plus rentals or land costs and depreciations on assets and fixed equipment, paid for by the taxpayers.</blockquote>I agree with charging all the costs except land cost.<br><br><blockquote><br>Hence the taxes paid by citizens are not put to use for benefits of citizens but accumulated as surpluses and long-term reserves.</blockquote>First of all, we do need reserves. Only fools don't keep reserves.<br>Secondly, these surpluses go into public works or investments, they are not kept sitting in a vault.<br><br><blockquote><br>Under such tax-and-recover system of government, all ministries and statutory boards will become corporations which used taxpayers' monies to acquire lands becoming owners while charging for services at full costs inclusive of rentals and land costs.

I think you have a wrong definition of it. Please explain yourself.<br>BTW, do you know that health care is subsidised in Singapore?<br>Do you know what will happen if you want to fully subsidise health care? Have you ever noticed the health care system in UK and Canada?<br><br><blockquote><br>If we add the off-budget surpluses to the budget surpluses the government is enriching itself at the expense of the people every year because of creative accounting and all the double and triple taxations.</blockquote>Again you gotta define what you mean by double taxation. You have not been clear about this one.<br><br><blockquote><br>Thus, HDB in selling flats built on lands acquired by the public should not charge for the land costs as to do so would amount to profiteering or double taxation.</blockquote>Why is that so?<br>If you don't charge land cost, land would either be misused or Singapore would be bought over by foreigners.<br><br><blockquote><br>Hospitals built on publicly acquired lands or buildings would be profiteering if they charge for rentals and land costs in the patient billings.<br><br>It is about time for government to stop double taxations to lessen the burdens on citizens and improve their livelihood.</blockquote>I don't think hospitals charge land cost.<br>But if they do, then I disagree with it.<br>You got to show us proof of your claims to be fair.<br></div>

Are GLCs really that pervasive that it stifles entrepreneurship? China's economy 15 years ago..  depended on SOEs for 80% of their economy. Once the socialist stance was laxed ... the private enterprises took the lead and not contribute to 70% of the economy with SOEs playing a significantly smaller role.<br><br>Can we reflect and think abt it. is it really the government's fault? i do agree that they have room for improvements, but shifting the blame to them for everything... isn't a solution</div></blockquote>The reason you gave for GLCs going into domestic business was not the same reason as given by ministers defending that decision. Some ministers and MPs have disagreed too with government going into domestic businesses but I think they have been sidelined.<br><br>GLCs have gone into all kinds of domestic businesses and that is a fact too difficult to hide. Cleantech, a subsidiary of HDB has gone into cleaning service and landscaping. Sembawang has gone into refuse disposal.<br><br>There are many other GLCs competing with citizens for a living. There is no need to be so narrow-minded or self-serving in running a country. Leaders should not be overly concerned with their immediate gains or surpluses as there are many worthwhile other objectives and by governing objectively they could over the long run achieve more. More surpluses will come back through more taxes from more successful private sector businesses.<br><br>It will be quite presumptuous for our leaders to reply in the next breath that if they don't go into domestic sector of business, some others like the foreign companies will do so. It is so short-sighted this kind of reasoning on the part of our leaders of world-class calibre.</div>
