It does not run the country based on certain basic principles as stated in the thread "Problems with Leaders - too much concepts and assumptions"<br><br>Many policies have been wrong but were carried on or auto-piloted for years as stated by retired senior civil servant Mr. Ngiam Tong Dow in one article in the ST about Spartan versus Athenian system of government. Despite objections by the people against streaming of students and an academic education system that produced so-called scholars to become highly educated unemployed at the expense of broad-based practical education, the government still stubbornly refused to make changes until it is too late.

Can't we be more objective? Yes the government makes mistakes in some of their economic policies.. but isn't that normal? We must stay united, learn from our mistakes and keep striving to make S'pore a better place.<br><br>I myself am working in an Aussie Uni as a researcher, from discussions with other international economists, a lot of them shower S'pore with praises, but sometimes we dun learn to appreciate that.

Speaking of which, Singtel is S'pore's largest corporation. sometimes it's sad when u think abt it. But what really is the root problem? GLCs? or is it us?

The high labour cost has resulted in the hollowing of many manufacturing sectors, this is the salient factor on why the government needs GLCs present to help develop the high-value added industries.<br><br>however, i am still a bit disturbed on Robert's comments abt GLCs getting involved in some small areas of the private sector. dun see a point for that. weird</div>
