Even if buyer certified OEM it is at the level of administrative such as certified in the manner of legality no child abuse license to export and operate. Manufacture of Sample are great show case but when it comes to mass production all factories will maximizes profitabilities by reducing cost.<br><br>The complexity of changing ownership of OEM operating in PRC may played a part in the result of buyer unable to control the quality of goods. As such alot of Testing and inspecting are done at the point of import into the United States.<br><br>At the end of the day it doesn't really matters regards to export country regulation. It is at the hand of importing country requirement and companies .<br>In the case of goods to import it is the origin country that need to find out buying countries import requirement.<br><br>If PRC feel that if it is not in their interest to work with importing countries than it is a matter of ego rather than taking their own industry to a higher level of quality.<br><br>but i think PRC will over time take it seriously and managed its level of control especially those product that affect the livelyhood of consumer.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>When the world is improving and demand for almost everything is soring rapidly, China being one of the largest exporter, tries to follow and up its economy by increasing its production.<br><br>Though China is is unaware of its backwardness, they still insist on increasing the production level. When this happens, the hike in production will lead to compromising in the qualities of goods and sub-standard products, unhygenic and improper goods are manufactured. This is the opportunity cost for China when they are seriously lacking adequate tuning in its F&amp;B and other sectors and compromises are made due to their <strong>overly-greedy desire </strong>to gain more revenue and develop the country.<br><br>On top of this, i am most disgusted by the authorities in China for they ever-lasting thick-skinned face, always <strong>covering up </strong>statistics and data and put on a false front tt everything in China is under their control. Recently, dont-know-some-big-official declared proudly in the media affirming to all the countries tt 99% of their exported goods are safe. wth how true?<br><br>However, dont you all realise tt westerners are trying 100 and 1 ways to expose China? Sometimes, their articles on China are just so aggressive and trying to create some sort of "demoting" of China. Yes, it is  China's fault for their sub-standard goods but most of the time the West always over exaggerate. IMHO probably the West are afraid of losing to China one day.<br><br>Well, China pple ought to change and adopt a new mentality. Or else, the gvt shld at least do smthing or create firmer legistration for F&amp;B. China once being a strong nation with rich history and culture is now being lowered into a nation with unglamerous discoveries, full of pirated &amp; dangerous goods and so on.<br><br>Olympics 2008 is around the corner, we'll see even more sub-standard goods in China as they increase and multiply their production even more while trying to compete with one another to win the millions of visting tourists.<br><br>omg.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>LOS ANGELES : The US maker of Barbie dolls Mattel announced on Tuesday yet another massive recall of toys made in China, targeting some 844,000 items with high levels of lead, the company said in a statement.<br><br>"As a result of the company's ongoing investigation of its toys manufactured by vendors in China, the company has voluntarily recalled 11 (types of) toys globally," the statement from company headquarters in El Segundo, California said.<br><br>It is the third such recall of Chinese toys this summer.<br><br>Prior recalls affecting millions of toys prompted an internal investigation of Mattel toys made by Chinese vendors, which resulted in Tuesday's recall of 522,000 items within the United States and 322,000 more worldwide, the statement said.<br><br>Mattel blamed Chinese manufacturers for using "uncertified paints" with excessive amounts of lead, especially in yellow, brown and orange paints applied to the toys.<br><br>"Consequently, several subcontractors are no longer manufacturing Mattel toys," said Mattel's chief officer Robert Eckert in the statement.<br><br>Several of the affected items are Barbie accessories, but not the dolls themselves, Mattel said.<br><br>The company also recalled three toys in its Fisher-Price range, again made by Chinese manufacturers, and will refund the purchase price to consumers.<br><br>On Monday, China's chief safety watchdog blamed Mattel's designs for its prior recalls of toys made in China.<br><br>Li Changjiang said Chinese factories were in the clear over the alleged discovery of formaldehyde in clothing sold in New Zealand, as he sought to reassure the world over the "Made in China" label.<br><br>Li said only 15 percent of the recalled toys were deemed unsafe due to Chinese manufacturers using paints with high levels of lead.<br><br>The European Commission said last week that it would take "regulatory" action against toys deemed unsafe after Mattel last month recalled 18 million Chinese-made products worldwide over high lead levels and small magnets that have seriously injured at least three children. - AFP/ch<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>China steps up scrutiny of US food, delaying shipments  </strong><br><br>BEIJING - CHINA has sharply increased inspections of imported US food, escalating its spat with Washington over product safety and leaving American beef piling up in warehouses and delaying shipments of black pepper and other goods.<br><br>Authorities who used to inspect as little as 5 per cent of imported goods now check every shipment of American poultry, snack foods and other products, companies and trade groups say.<br><br>'I suspect they are doing this to keep the pressure on the United States to relent on some of these (food safety disputes), because the US is taking a very tough stand on Chinese products,' said James Rice, the China country manager for Tyson Foods, the world's largest meat processor.<br><br>Chinese authorities banned chicken imports from two Tyson plants in June after salmonella was found in shipments from them, Mr Rice said. But he said the company, which sells about US$200 million (S$306 million) worth of chicken to China every year, still was allowed to import from its 167 other facilities.<br><br>The stepped-up inspections are the latest in a tit-for-tat between Washington and Beijing after a series of large-scale product recalls - from bad pet food to dangerous toothpaste and toys - raised scrutiny of Chinese-made products in the US.<br><br><strong>Rejected pork</strong><br>On Saturday, Beijing said it rejected 18.4 tons of American pork because it contained ractopamine, a drug that is used by US hog farmers to produce leaner meat but is banned in China.<br><br>The United States restricted imports from China of five types of seafood in July after tests found unapproved drugs - a move that Beijing criticised as improper and excessive.<br><br>The tougher Chinese inspection regime is forcing importers and retailers to adjust shipping and delivery schedules, though so far they say the delays have not harmed their bottom lines.<br><br>But the moves add to tensions in a relationship that is strained by China's multibillion-dollar trade surplus with the United States.<br><br>Chinese officials have suggested the US government might be using safety concerns as an excuse to block imports from China.<br><br><strong>Major market for soybeans and chicken </strong><br>China is a major market for US soybeans and chicken, and sales of citrus, beef and processed food also are growing.<br><br>It is unclear how much US food has been rejected in China's latest campaign or whether the rate has increased.

But were they heavily criticised and where are the media mentioning that their designers are not qualified, no quality checks etc? But if Mattell were a China owned company, it will be another China Bashing media and criticism.<br><br>I just feel that it is one sided...</div>
