            <div class='col-md body'>Recently the news has been full of scary articles about recalls of products made in China. From toys for toddlers to dog food, the message is that China is so backward or corrupt that everything made there is suspect.<br><br>People who understand the world of cross-border manufacturing know that this news angle is rubbish. Matel, Fisher-Price and the other multinationals are responsible for providing detailed specs to manufacturing plants. The plants don't know the safety rules in the country the goods are shipped to; they might not even know where the goods are destined. The company that hires them is responsible for telling them exactly which paint to use - they can't just leave it up to the Chinese plant manager and hope he doesn't decide to use leaded paint. They can't just accept goods without testing. If they do, then it's their fault.<br><br>Maybe this is just another case of the media getting a story wrong. Coincidentally though, the US government seems obsessed with China as the only threat to American world supremacy. China is too strong, too robust economically, and too damn big. Whenever I hear a story that bashes China, I take a long breath and wonder who initiated it. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><span style="color: red;"><strong>CHINA BASHING </strong></span>or <strong><span style="color: green;">BLESSING IN DISGUISE  </span></strong> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"><br><br><img src="http://www.economist.com/images/20070519/2007LD1.jpg"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I have to agree with you to cetain extent.<br><br>In many industry, different country use different standards, a product passing standard of country A, the same product can be rejected in another country. So being Safe or Dangerous, only depends on who set the standard.<br><br>And in the process of manufacturing the product, some of material used are appointed by the buyer side(They force you to get a particular material from a particular supplier appointed by them), they are actually indirectly involved in the production process too. Unless the manufacturere ignore instructions from buyers, then it's totally manufacturere's fault. If they follow buyer's instruction closely and things go wrong, it should be the buyer's fault.<br><br>And yes, QC or inspection ppl are to be blamed also. If these items are so bad, why they can bypass the checks and go to the retail market? Many buyers put in-house QC at manufacturer side, why they didn't reject it before exporting out of China??<br><br>Imagine somehow many ppl can smuggle drugs into Singapore, teens and many singaporean addicted to drugs, you may blame the country where the drugs are from. But you will also wonder what the hell the custom officer are doing, right??<br><br>Or let's say i manufacture one super bad quality, harmful to human, cause cancer medicine, and i manage to bring it to Singapore retail market, sell it legally in supermarket and pharmacies, who to blame?? Of cos i am the super evil bad guy who make this bad medicine in the first place. But your govt is not doing a good job if i manage to sell harmful things legally in the retail market.<br></div>

And i never said i want to bury the fault of manufacturer under the carpet. I dont know why i got this idea i am defending on manufacturer side. I said many time they have their fault, they have the biggest fault, but not 100%. Same as TS, i think it's not fair when the other parties involved can get away with their fault.<br><br>What TS said is that the buyers/importer/organization responsible for checking safety issue, their fault are "buried under the carpet". Which is not fair. They have their fault too but media do not mention about them. They mention only the manufacturer, putting 100% fault to Chinese.<br><br>Yes, i stand my ground that they are irresponsible.<br><br>Remember Slim10 Case anyone?? Was the China manufacturer the only one blamed?? importer and SG distributor was blamed too. And they should be blamed becuase the whole supply chain from manufacturer to retailer, everyone are responsible for the product.<br><br>Being the importer of certain product, or you hold a brand of certain product, you should do your part in controling &amp; assuring the quality &amp; safety factor of the products too. If you don't do your part, you are irresponisble.<br><br>Imagine if Sony(just example, i dont hate Sony) don't do their part in controling safety issues for their home electronics, and someone got shocked to death. Who to blame? you blame the Malaysian factory who make the product? Or you blame Sony for not controlling the safety factors of their products? I believe both must be blamed, Not putting ALL blame to the Malaysian factory.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>How can it be BASHING when it is true? China never came out to say that it is false did it? That China supplier to Mattel killed himself and blamed his "good friend" but he certainly did not say that the allegations were false.</div>

And i never said i want to bury the fault of manufacturer under the carpet. I dont know why i got this idea i am defending on manufacturer side. I said many time they have their fault, they have the biggest fault, but not 100%. Same as TS, i think it's not fair when the other parties involved can get away with their fault.<br><br>What TS said is that the buyers/importer/organization responsible for checking safety issue, their fault are "buried under the carpet". Which is not fair. They have their fault too but media do not mention about them. They mention only the manufacturer, putting 100% fault to Chinese.<br><br>Yes, i stand my ground that they are irresponsible.<br><br>Remember Slim10 Case anyone?? Was the China manufacturer the only one blamed?? importer and SG distributor was blamed too. And they should be blamed becuase the whole supply chain from manufacturer to retailer, everyone are responsible for the product.<br><br>Being the importer of certain product, or you hold a brand of certain product, you should do your part in controling &amp; assuring the quality &amp; safety factor of the products too. If you don't do your part, you are irresponisble.<br><br>Imagine if Sony(just example, i dont hate Sony) don't do their part in controling safety issues for their home electronics, and someone got shocked to death. Who to blame? you blame the Malaysian factory who make the product? Or you blame Sony for not controlling the safety factors of their products? I believe both must be blamed, Not putting ALL blame to the Malaysian factory.<br><br></div></blockquote>You do realise that many of the products themselves ended up for sale in the home country? Perhaps you would like to recall the incident in China where hundreds of infants died because of defective milk? The Chinese authorities themselves admit that they have very poor oversight over their factories which was why they did set up an agency to monitor the quality of food products. The end result was that the head of the agency recently got charged for corruption and given a summary execution or committed suicide. I forgot which happened.</div>

Some of these standards are fairly high. Hence companies have to modify products by region to meet these standards.<br><br>The EU especially, has strict laws governing consumer protection.</div>

So company standard is stricter or higher than the government standard, which is, again, the minimum.<br><br>Major corporations like Mattel and Sony etc, have their own product standard, and reputation, which is expected to be way ABOVE what the government standard mandated ....   get it?<br><br>Now, here's another piece of news to you:<br><br>Chinese government only certifies products that are to be sold inside China, and by most accounts, western corporations only produce their products in china only to be sold back in their home countries. That's how they get tax break from Chinese government.<br><br>No, China government doesn't certify their products if they aren't to be sold inside China, get it???<br><br>Companies with world famous brand names have their own reputation to maintain, they have to own QA process, and they would not and should not depend on Chinese government agency or any other government agency for their own quality control process.<br><br>Companies hires and fires manufactures all the times, depending on the quality and cost the manufactures can provide. Of course, the OEM manufactures share some blame for defected or dangerous product, but only the clueless would think OEMs should share the major portion of the blame.<br><br>when you buy a Toyota, you expect Toyota quality, regardless where it's produced. do you understand?<br><br></div>
