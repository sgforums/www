              <p>Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe plans to regain his hold over the country he has ruled for nearly three decades after being re-elected leader of his Zanu-PF party at the age of 85.</p>
              <p>Mugabe appeared triumphant following yesterday's re-election, which keeps him in power for another five years.</p>
              <p>The Zanu-PF was severely weakened after it lost its parliamentary majority in last year's contested elections.</p>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/12/13/article-1235449-0794F8F4000005DC-627_468x333.jpg" alt="Robert Mugabe" width="468" height="333">

              </div>
              <p>Mugabe was was forced into a power-sharing deal with former rivals after the 2008 poll, but many fear it is doomed to fail as he clings on to power.</p>
              <p>'The inclusive government has a short life of 24 months,' he said on Saturday. 'So we must be ready for the elections and we must not be defeated like we were last year.</p>
              <p>'We must win resoundingly and regain the constituents we lost.'</p>
              <p>A new election date has not been set, but many observers fear that the build up will see the return of the violence that has marred previous polls.</p>
              <p>Joice Mujuru, a former guerrilla fighter in the bush war, retained her post of second vice president. John Nkomo was elected as the party's other vice president to replace Joseph Msika, who died this year.</p>
              <p>Zimbabwe's ambassador to South Africa, Simon Khaya Moyo, will take over from Nkomo as party chairman.</p>
