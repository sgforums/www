            <div class='col-md body'>Hahahaha. In some places, you cannot vote for the opposition party because it simply doesn't exist! In this situation, the PAP just emerge victorious... Interesting right? Even if your area does have an opposition party... Does it make any difference? If you look back in the history of the Republic of Singapore, the PAP dominated in politics and will continue to dominate it!! Complain all you want, the situation will never change. So it is not important whether you vote for PAP or not... The point is that things will not change and you might risk being sued by them for slander/libel (history showed and proved that it happened to a few people who dared to complain and oppose the government!)</div>
