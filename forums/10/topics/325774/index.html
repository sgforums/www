              <p>I have no love for the MLM ( Multi-Level Marketing) industry. To me, it is nothing more than the most extreme form of capitalism. It's model is the pyramid where the hardworking ones at the bottom supports the lazy ones at the top whom earns the most money, and when the bottom ones cannot recruit others, they suffers the most and earn nothing for their efforts.</p>
              <p>Secondly, the product they sell are generally overpriced. Example, a product actually cost only $25, but is marked up to become $50, so as to pay off everyone in the levels, with the ones at the bottom getting perhaps $1 and the one at the top getting $15, the rest shared between the levels.</p>
              <p>However, there can be no denying on the unbelievable outreach that MLM offers,  often exponentially, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">into areas whereby traditional marketing media cannot reach, eg:- people whom do not watch TV, internet, read news. </span></p>
              <p>It starts with one person, who recruits 3 others known as level 2, then these 3 recruit 3 others, with a total of 13 persons within seconds. It continues to reach out and 'theoratically', within 6 months, MLM has the capability to encircle and recruit the entire human race!</p>
              <p>We would like to believe and trust in our own national intelligence agencies that they do have a network of agents, but in truth, they are no where in the league of a successful MLM network, whom can go trans-national, bonded and motivated by the ideology of money.</p>
              <p>With a $1million dollar budget, perhaps it is time for the more successful MLM companies in Singapore, with a network here, in Malaysia as well as Indonesia, to work out a deal for official status in the capture of not only Mas Selamat, but other terrorists as well.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">How it would work ( A tentative plan )</span></p>
              <p><strong>1.</strong> The most successful MLM company be given official status by the State to assist in the sharing on information of operating terrorists.</p>
              <p><strong>2.</strong> A brochure in the form of a booklet be made and purchased by downlines, with information on:-</p>
              <p>a. Face and brief history of Mas</p>
              <p>b. His likes and dislikes, habits</p>
              <p>c. Different disguises he may adopt</p>
              <p>d. Traits and characteristics of undercover terrorists, their modus operandi, and creature habits - things to look out for,.</p>
              <p><strong>3.</strong> Disbursement of $1million:-</p>
              <p>a. The one who gives the right information, gets the entire million and a new identity in a new land.</p>
              <p>b. An additional fund of $200,000, paid by the state, to be shared between the levels in the MLM agency.</p>
              <p>4. Security:-</p>
              <p>The Human race hates terrorism and those involve in it, no matter what religion they belong to. It is the right of every single human being to ferret out terrrorists. While the terrorists can strike back, they DO NOT HAVE THE CAPABILITY to wipe out the entire human race. Thus, there is no need to fear them, but instead, for the sake of our race, to ferret them out and rehabilitate them, a responsibility we all share.</p>
              <p>Radical times require radical responses.</p>
