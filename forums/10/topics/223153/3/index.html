Simple, find another source."<br><br>This statement has nothing to do with electricity generation, I am using it as an example to explain outsourcing. Did it mention anything about electricity generation?<br><br>FYI, it's a whole lot cheaper to produce electricity by natural gas, based on California Energy Commission's report in 2003, it's like 4.58 US cents/Kwh, even if you inflate it by 100%, it's still around 10 US cents/Kwh.<br><br>http://www.energy.ca.gov/2003_energypolicy/documents/2003-02-25+26_workshop/100-03-001SD_BADR.PDF<br><br>*YAWN*<br><br>ratio decidendi</div>

Power failure are due to many reasons not just cable been damage. LOL There no 100% reliablility, this i agree, but can they sustain the same reliability as we have at present? malaysian end oni generate electricity, does that mean that their power station will not have down time? WOW u sure got faith in them. LOL maybe they should hired u as their ambassador to promote their company.</div>
