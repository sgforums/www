            <div class='col-md body'>I managed to find the cost of producing 1 Kwh of electricity under inefficient means, through the use of mobile power generators using diesel.<br><br>Diesel is a cheap component from distillating a barrel of oil. 44 gallons are produced from 1 barrel of oil, of which 9.2 gallons are diesel. We will assume that diesel and gasonline &amp; jet fuel are priced the same and the cost of 1 barrel of oil is USD 60<br><br>http://www.energyquest.ca.gov/story/chapter08.html<br><br>Cost per gallon of diesel:<br>(USD 60 / 44 gallons) = USD 1.36/gallon of diesel (SGD 2.12 / gallon of diesel)<br><br>Diesel engine-generator sets operated at their best efficiency point can produce between 3 and 4 kilowatthours of electrical energy for each litre of diesel fuel consumed, with lower efficiency at part load.<br><br>1 US gallon = 3.785 litres<br><br>Therefore SGD 2.12 / gallon of diesel is equivalent to 3.785 litres.<br><br>We take the average of "3 and 4 kilowatthours of electrical energy for each litre of diesel fuel consumed", we get 3.5 Kwh / litre.<br><br>For the SGD 2.12 you pay for 3.785 litres of diesel, it will produce:<br><br>3.785 litres X 3.5 Kwh/litre = 13.25 Kwh<br><br>Therefore 1 Kwh of electricity generation based on inefficient method is:<br><br>SGD 2.12 / 13.25 = 16 cents/Kwh<br><br>Under very inefficient means of electricity generation, we can still achieve 16 cents/Kwh. What does this tell us about the 21.64 cents / Kwh Singapore Power charges Singapore citizens?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think the best way to bring down the price of the big E, is to bring in private companies to compete with SPower, just like how M1 was brought in to compete with Singtel (Starhub not included har. The green and the red shares the same boss, M1 boss is two Malaysian and HK company).<br><br>Then SPower will be trying it's ways and means to bring down operating cost in order to compete with these companies.</div>
