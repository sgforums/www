But these are not isolated incidents.<br><br>And while our govt brazenly preach the goal of  'swiss standard of living', these chaps are roughing out the void decks.<br><br>Anyhow, a govt sanctioned shelter is only a short-term solution to the growing problem.

Through slogans, problems are convenently mulled over or postponed or justisfied instead of being solved.<br><br>Through slogans like  Tripartism, Job enlargement, Retraining, welfarism etc, many of our problems were grossed over. This is the kind of governance we are getting. If leaders are effective, they have to take care of the unemployed people seeking jobs currently being turned down by employers because too many jobs are still going to the foreigners who can easily claim to be foreign talents.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I believe no matter how developed or rich a country is, there are bound to be people who are forced to live on the streets. In Singapore, it may seem like everyone has a roof over our heads, jobs, education, etc, but we all know that homeless Singaporeans do exist. We all know it like its a dirty little secret.<br><br>I'm not sure if it's the Asian mentality or if it's just a Singaporean mentality. The homeless people issue is just like any other issue which the Singaporean "public" (whatever that means) are not willing to discuss openly. Issues such as the alternative culture (ie homosexuality), sexuality education, "white horses" in the military, true meaning of democracy and among others.<br><br>Instead of discussing if homeless people exist in Singapore, perhaps we should discuss on what we can do about the issue.</div>

Only then, can they grasp the predicament of these folks. That will define how our govt should approach the situation.<br><br>If the majority of these homeless are actually forced from their homes, then a govt body should address reconciliation or legal action. If instead they are true blue homeless, then offering a temporary shelter while opening a channel for 'adoption' into other homesteads may be an option.<br><br>The next step will have to be preventive action. Or perhaps both should be tackled simultaneously.</div>
