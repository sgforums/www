FTs are an inevitable neccessity in this knowledge driven economy, unfortunately<br><br>so where does that leaves us ? ... now that the salad days of the mid 80s to 90s are well and truly over, we have no choice but to swallow some "bitterness" as the economy structrally re-adjust, to the un-initiated, structural re-adjustment means the loss of certain types of jobs that'll never return, in our case low tech assembly lines for instance, pressing widgets together etc, all these jobs have now gone to China, or better yet, been replaced by robots, these types of jobs won't come back even when the economy recovers. The rise of China is a reality, the evolving knowledge driven economy is a reality, and whinning and bitching at the goverment won't help, because there isn't much the goverment can do really,<br><br>what are we to do as individuals ? I like the term "life long employability", that would mean having skill sets that would make you attractive to employers, for those chappies who like to tell themselves that paper qualitications doesn't really much, I'd say, don't kid yourselves, the days of O level or A level managers are over, I remember back in my poly days lecturers telling us that with a diploma, after a while, you can become an "engineer", I learnt much to my chargrin, that in most other countries, being an "Engineer" means that you have sat for the Professional Engineering Board Exams and have a P.E on your name card ! and for that matter, most "engineers" overseas do have it ! Remember the Nicoll Highway collaspe ? ... why do we have an Ang Moh Engineer signing the plans ? but locals to execute them ? ... of course it would be nice to have a local doing the signing, but there simply isn't many Singaporean P.E around in the first place !<br><br>That would be for the younger chappies, chappies like me, what about the older folks then, like the middle aged lady you mention (and my mother too I would add, she got retrenched 10 yrs ago after the company she was working in as an admin supervisor changed hands, and being middle aged and no degree, has been a house wife since ), I confess that I  have no satisfactory answer, yes, some companies certainly do practise agism (along with sexism and racism for some too), but I'd like to warn everyone that things will probably get worse, the wage cost in Singapore is still high compared to other developed economies in the region, take Hong Kong and Taiwan for instance, I was shocked to learn that the expected starting pay of a fresh grad in Hong Kong would be even slightly lower than what a fresh poly grad in Singapore can expect to earn ! and because we're still some distance off from that point, I think the income gap in Singapore will only widen.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>What would be the impact in not signing up with 1 '1-million' A-STAR scholar? Would it set our economy by 0.001 percentage point? What would be the estimated returns from him? What could happen to him if his '1-million' scholarship was rejected?<br><br>How can we spent that '1-million' on social welfare?<br><br>We can save lifes!<br><br>Remember the fire incident in Bukit Batok? A old malay man was burnt dead, cos he has no elecctricity at home, and had to resort to burn candles. And now his wife had to live by herself.<br><br>And remember the sister-brother in Hougang. They had survived on no water and electricity for many years.

However if we are prudent on our expenditures, we need not even have to raise our income tax by 1%, and yet still have our unfortunates, unpriviledged well taken care of.<br><br>Remember our 7 wonders? Remember the golden handshake given to HDB staffs? Remember our explanades? Remember our NLB?<br><br>And sad to say, I have yet to contribute a cent to NKF.

Prices, fares keep moving upwards while we're being told to accept less and less pay while working even longer hours. How much longer before something gives way? During times of economic downturn or turmoil, as people become increasingly frustrated and angry, social faultlines will tend to surface.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>

In Singapore, almost everyone has a flat mah, so how can anyone be poor or worse still, be homeless? This is why the "New Poor" idea sprouted by opposition is rubbish.<br><br>Look at the homeless people in the photos --- why are they homeless? They must have sold off their homes, so they might be homeless but not poor. In fact, they must be the anti-thesis of the "New Poor", or what i call the "New Rich". Sell off your home and be rich -- this must be the solution to the "New Poor" problem.<br><br>"Some chose to be homeless because they like it." This is most brilliant!<br>No wonder PAP is keen to upgrade East Coast Park -- it must be in preparation for those who enjoy sleeping in the open after selling off their homes. Why, they might even make some money by charging these "New Rich" a daily fee!<br><br>With shrinking incomes and ever higher costs of living, i am sure this solution to the "New Poor" problem is going to be popular in the future.

            <div class='col-md body'>To some extent, Salman is right in that technically speaking, Singapore does not have a problem with homeless persons. The Destitute Persons Act [CAP 78] takes care of that:<br><br>"3. Â—(1) Any public officer acting under the direction of the Director or any police officer may take in his charge any destitute person and deliver him to the custody of the Director.<br><br>(2) If the Director has reasonable cause to believe that any person so delivered into his custody has no visible means of subsistence, he may arrange for that person to be temporarily admitted into a welfare home until an inquiry has been held by him.<br><br>(3) Every such inquiry shall be completed within a period of 30 days from the date of that personÂ’s admission into a welfare home such further period, not exceeding 30 days, as the Minister may approve.<br><br>(4) If after holding such inquiry the Director is satisfied that that person is a destitute person within the meaning of this Act, he may by warrant under his hand require that person to reside in a welfare home. "<br><br>So if a person is really down and out with no means of subsistence, he will be confined by law in a welfare home, whether he likes it or not. So nobody can be really homeless in Singapore. If he cannot find a roof to sleep under, the courts will provide one for him, until his dying day.<br></div>

White hair indicates no absence of any need on the other hand, so your analogy is invalid.<br><br>But anyway, it is not so easy to get people to open their homes to someone. Solving homelessness does not just include providing a roof; it also involves paying for that person's food, water and transport consumption, not to mention healthcare bills (which are rather high). As it happens, my domestic finances are rather tight; I cannot afford to house someone else. And I'm from the middle-class, which likely means that most heartlanders porbably cannot take on an extra family member.<br><br></div>
