              <p>agree with angel here. not everyone have the ability to afford the top up. for example, if u have bought a new unit when you are 25 yr old, fully cleared ur debts by 40, retiring at 65. you may not have the money to fork out 50k, 100k to top up for a new flat if your property was confiscated before the 99 yr lease is up.</p>
              <p>and why should you pay for something which you already rightfully own? not everyone buys a HDB unit for investment. most buyers seek a house to live in, and they are content to live in the unit for as long as they live. these people are clearly not interested whether their house still retain any value or not.</p>
              <p>and who says you cannot live in old units? there are buildings over 100 yrs old in singapore, and yet they are still functioning. in Vietnam, people are still living in buildings from the French colonial era, more than 100 yrs old in age. clearly, a HDB flat can last for 99 yrs.</p>
              <p>and why sell us the lease at 99 yrs when we all know that it is bound to be confiscated back by the government before the lease is up, without any compensation? ( allowing you a cheaper unit doesn't equate to monetary compensation). we bought our flats from HDB, from the government, and it is just right that they observe the sale, fulfilling their side of the bargain, ensuring that we get compensation if they decided to evict us before the lease we paid for is up.</p>
              <p>it is just like buying a car. it is ok to scrap the car when it reaches the end of its COE period. you do not expect the government to scrap ur COE before the 10 yrs are up, and confiscate ur car, while at the same time saying that they will subsidise ur purchase of a new car. Why get a new car/flat, when it is still working fine, physically and legally?</p>
              <p>HDB is a scam. take ur money, take ur flat, build new flats, repeat cycle again and again.</p>

              <p>Sorry about my earlier post. I think I was quite harsh. Do understand why I was that hot- tempered.</p>
              <p>Ok 1st of all, I want to highlight that we, guys, are not happy with the duration of NS, not NS itself. Imagine spending 2 years in a place training with pays that part- timers could easily earn more? I don't think that is really feasible, especially since Singapore is not facing any immediate external threats like what others countries do.</p>
              <p>I when to check wiki and i found out that the average time required for NS for a "peaceful" country is just 12mnts. So I'm puzzled why we can't just use that as a guideline?</p>
              <p>Also, its is clear that FTs are having the advantage in jobs over us. This is pretty clear cut, they have more working experience since they don't have to go NS, and that allows them to have an advantage over us sg guys. I'm aware of our need for FTs for our economy and I understand the reason for defence. We can't let others do our job can we? But, the very least govt should do is to prevent us from suffering any disadvantages when we are out in the working world.</p>

              <p>While, i calculated the min pay this way.</p>
              <p>The average pay for a full time worker holding an O-level cert is around SG$1000/mnth ( giv or take a little)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He/She total working time around 8hrs/day 5days/wk, which is</p>
              <p>(8*5)(4) = 160hrs/mnth</p>
              <p>NS men need to stay in their camp the whole day, basically around 5days/wk also,</p>
              <p>(24*5)(4) = 480hrs/month</p>
              <p>So i think its rather fairer for the NS men.</p>
              <p>Yes, there is a scheme for part 5, but it benefits are way too minute to scarifice the 2yrs experience the FTs have ahead of NS men.</p>
              <p>The last time i checked, SG have around 300 billion in its coffers in 2004. Pls correct me if I'm wrong. It is also recieving surplus every single year after the asian financial crisis. I think its a good time to use those money on the "human" aspect of nation building. I also don't think taxes will increase. Even with this implementation, they will still recieve surplus due to our improving economy and increasing population.</p>

              <p>do average sgporean have a choice? not many people like you own private property i assume. i'm not a cost expert, but let me do simple maths here. After 50 years, your old HDB house still has market value (luckily, but definitely not as competitive as younger flats), that's why u top up the difference in market value with the new HDB flat u gonna get.</p>
              <p>eg. say they arrange a HDB 4 room market value (new) =&gt;  $200,000</p>
              <p>  your old HDB 4 room market value (50 years old) =&gt; $100,000  (originally u buy the flat for $30,000 50 years ago)</p>
              <p>they give u discount/perk like $50,000, so u have to top up $50,000 to move into the new house (look, either u take the deal or move elsewhere yourself, obviously u couldn't stay any longer in that old flat)</p>
              <p>now u know our government is kind and good to his people?</p>

              <p>Sorry about my earlier post. I think I was quite harsh. Do understand why I was that hot- tempered.</p>
              <p>Ok 1st of all, I want to highlight that we, guys, are not happy with the duration of NS, not NS itself. Imagine spending 2 years in a place training with pays that part- timers could easily earn more? I don't think that is really feasible, especially since Singapore is not facing any immediate external threats like what others countries do.</p>
              <p>I when to check wiki and i found out that the average time required for NS for a "peaceful" country is just 12mnts. So I'm puzzled why we can't just use that as a guideline?</p>
              <p>Also, its is clear that FTs are having the advantage in jobs over us. This is pretty clear cut, they have more working experience since they don't have to go NS, and that allows them to have an advantage over us sg guys. I'm aware of our need for FTs for our economy and I understand the reason for defence. We can't let others do our job can we? But, the very least govt should do is to prevent us from suffering any disadvantages when we are out in the working world.</p>

              <p>No problem lah, in fact, i like rash and hot temper guy. At least they got substance, unlike those nerdy ones. Guess NS can tougher a guy up. NS is never a flavor to guy since it started in the late 60s, but then parents at that time encouraged them to join so that young guys dun end up in secret society as it tend to be. Naturally, it bring about discipline among our young boys who do NS, and they started to build our economy with we gals. I dunno, but i guess those will the days my Daddy got no FT to worry about. Today, scenario changed, you guys hv to competite with FT and worst, some of us gals become your superior due to longer experiences. Whatever it is , NS is not going to go away unless if there is a change of political ruling. I therefore urge all our boys who served NS or are serving NS to take build a good discipline in life and to take it as a part of life so as to challenge and competite with FT in a better physical shape and mentality of wining them rather than despise them.</p>

              <p>how many of u here understand the new CPF ruling?</p>
              <p>is CPF really beneficial? do u know if u park your money with gurantee bonds, u can easily earn at least 3.5%/yr interest yourself? why garmen so rich?</p>
              <p>who are actually bounded by CPF? FT/PR can choose not to stay in Singapore (going back to their homeland) at retirement age and withdraw Full cash out but how about Sgporean, if i'm not wrong, a portion of CPF monies will only return to you when u reach 80yrs old, how many of u can live till that age? for those who can't, your monies will be 'confiscated', these monies are ours right? think again....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>note: now CPF minimum Sum is currently $94,600, and going to be up as years goes by...</p>
