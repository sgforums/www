              <p>As someone who have not went through the hardships of NS, talk from you, please, is really cheap. True, sg guys are pampered compared to others, blame it on our hardship free childhood, if you must, but aren't sg girls the same?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As a current (ording) NSF, we do no favours for the system performence, but the system, believe it or not, is outdated as well. Believe me, the system has been F-up from the past generations as well, with ppl dying here and there as recently as the 1980s.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Think what most sg guys are pissed about is that we serve NS to protect our country, while the FT (notice i don't mention girls) can just come in and fight with us for our ricebowl. It's not fair, but fat hope to wish for anything to change bah, i guess.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Whatever the case, a guy gotta do what a guy gotta do, and I do serve my country with pride. Hope that in the future, things will impove bah. ^^</p>
