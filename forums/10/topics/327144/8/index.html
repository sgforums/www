              <p>Really, asking a girl to serve in the army is not very fair to them. They already have to do NS by having to give birth :D.</p>
              <p>Maybe why us Singaporeans are unhappy is that when we serve 2.5 years in NS, we feel we are not recognized by the country.</p>
              <p>Take my case for example. I had my exams in June 14 and I was called up for reservist on 11 June. I wrote a letter in and they say come back in camp then talk. Subsequently due to the effeciency of SAF, they only released me on 13 June to go back and study for exam.. When I say why in the first place they don't let me off early, they say is because yours is a private course and not NUS or NTU, so cannot make fast decision.</p>
              <p>The fact is, we want to know why we have to give 2.5 years (plus reservist time) of our lives to protect FTs who some think we are wusses(I'm not saying who) and at the same time why the goverment doesn't help us in our upgrading? Is our Singaporean citizenship merely a liability that needs us to serve the army and not be compensated for our efforts?</p>

              <p>I am glad to hear this guy is so patriotic and family minded. He
              is able to stand up to defend us in time of difficulties.
              Yeah!!!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However, serving NS, should be a separate issue and should not
              be involve in your competition with FTs. Let put it that FTs are
              here to motivate you to improve further and work harder if not
              smarter. You should therefore instead of whining about NS and FT
              spoiling your chances in yr career, work harder and smarter, and
              put NS training into your advantages against the FTs. You should
              have better endurance, tolerance, strength and physical attributes
              than a FTs.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As i say again, look at FTs as they are here to help us
              build our economy due to our lack of manpower, if FTs are to leave,
              our economy will shrink and in the end, all of us hv no jobs. If
              you keep blaming the FTs for these and that, then you got no guts
              to challenge them. Do you think the FTs really like to come here??
              Do you think they like to leave their country, their homeland,
              their love ones behind and come here to make a living?? We must
              learn to competite in a Global labour forces, no more thinking of
              iron rice bowl serve in front of you.</p>

              <p>do average sgporean have a choice? not many people like you own private property i assume. i'm not a cost expert, but let me do simple maths here. After 50 years, your old HDB house still has market value (luckily, but definitely not as competitive as younger flats), that's why u top up the difference in market value with the new HDB flat u gonna get.</p>
              <p>eg. say they arrange a HDB 4 room market value (new) =&gt;  $200,000</p>
              <p>  your old HDB 4 room market value (50 years old) =&gt; $100,000  (originally u buy the flat for $30,000 50 years ago)</p>
              <p>they give u discount/perk like $50,000, so u have to top up $50,000 to move into the new house (look, either u take the deal or move elsewhere yourself, obviously u couldn't stay any longer in that old flat)</p>
              <p>now u know our government is kind and good to his people?</p>
