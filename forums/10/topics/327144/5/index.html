              <p>Coward? if i am a coward i would have AWOLed long time ago or flee to another country b4 enlistment, if i am a coward i would take the easy way out and keng my way through 2 years rather thab be a combat specialist. Police &amp; CD got different role than the  SAF not to mention they got higher pay than SAF NSF at the same level. All my men from my active days in unit till we did reservist whine and complain about NS/Reservist, but when its time to move out they still do so and perform well up to standards. If war happens tomorrow i have my absolute faith in them not to flee. So if they whine and gripe everytime we have to do something i would not say a damn word about it,  And hey if most of us were cowards, SAF would got a problem with manpower....and why dont you try being a soldier for a week or two, then we'll see what you gotta say about NS.</p>
