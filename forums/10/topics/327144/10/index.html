              <p>how many of u here understand the new CPF ruling?</p>
              <p>is CPF really beneficial? do u know if u park your money with gurantee bonds, u can easily earn at least 3.5%/yr interest yourself? why garmen so rich?</p>
              <p>who are actually bounded by CPF? FT/PR can choose not to stay in Singapore (going back to their homeland) at retirement age and withdraw Full cash out but how about Sgporean, if i'm not wrong, a portion of CPF monies will only return to you when u reach 80yrs old, how many of u can live till that age? for those who can't, your monies will be 'confiscated', these monies are ours right? think again....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>note: now CPF minimum Sum is currently $94,600, and going to be up as years goes by...</p>

              <p>if u r a PR and decided to give up PR for retirement back to your country, u can withdraw full amount and enjoy in your MOTHERLAND. The difference here is if you are Sgporean., naturally Singapore is your motherland!! and we have to renounce our citizenship to get back our own monies!! i believe you are joking when you mention "same", it's entirely different.</p>
              <p>To answer your questions, kindly see below:-</p>
              <p><span style="color: #004891;">Q: Do foreigners have to contribute to the 
              CPF?</span></p>
              <p>Foreigners only need to begin their monthly contributions to 
              the CPF after having assumed permanent resident status. During the first two 
              years as a permanent resident, contribution rates to CPF are reduced.</p>
              <p>(look, most foreigners working here ultimately will get PR at least to avoid hassles of re-applying employment pass (subject to government approval), moving from one job to another and other factors too)</p>
              <p><span style="color: #004891;">Q: Can permanent residents withdraw their 
              Central Provident Fund savings?</span></p>
              <p>PR can withdraw their savings at age 55, after a Minimum Sum in 
              their Retirement Account is set aside. Members can also withdraw their CPF 
              savings if they are permanently incapacitated or will leave Singapore and West 
              Malaysia permanently. If members do return to Singapore, they must reimburse the 
              CPF Board for the amount they had withdrawn with interest.</p>
