              <p>I agree with u, but after serving our NS, we are left to the dogs, the corporate MNC dogs. Without logical rules and laws, we get fired, due to reservist commitments ect. NS is not the issue. The aftermath is.</p>
              <p>There was on one occasion i read a news tat returning soldiers from Iraq had a free brothel treat. What priviedges do we NS men get other than a starting higher pay, but that benefit too gets eaten up.</p>
              <p>Other countries treat their serving soldeirs very well compared to ours.</p>

              <p>Guys in NS can find a few good buddies and start a business venture together while they are still in NS!!!

              <p>They can hire their girl friends or girlfriends to work and watch over the business venture for them. But of course they must also work when they get released on Saturday and Sunday.</p>

              <p>the truth is, I have been there, seen that, and really think that it is not something i will encourage. i have heard success stories of students starting a business while still schooling, and i believe that if you work hard, you will succeed. but i can't find it in my heart to encourage people to do things that is so risky.</p>
              <p>but since you request me to do something positive and encouraging once in my life, and to do it here....here goes...</p>

              <p>Coward? if i am a coward i would have AWOLed long time ago or flee to another country b4 enlistment, if i am a coward i would take the easy way out and keng my way through 2 years rather thab be a combat specialist. Police &amp; CD got different role than the  SAF not to mention they got higher pay than SAF NSF at the same level. All my men from my active days in unit till we did reservist whine and complain about NS/Reservist, but when its time to move out they still do so and perform well up to standards. If war happens tomorrow i have my absolute faith in them not to flee. So if they whine and gripe everytime we have to do something i would not say a damn word about it,  And hey if most of us were cowards, SAF would got a problem with manpower....and why dont you try being a soldier for a week or two, then we'll see what you gotta say about NS.</p>
