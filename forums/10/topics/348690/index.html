              <h1>A call for the Singapore Government to be made accountable to the people</h1>
              <p><strong>By Fang Zhi Yuan</strong></p>
              <p>As a true bred Singaporean who was born and educated here, I have
              never seen Singapore in a worse shape for the last 30 years. Even
              during the 1985 and 2003 recessions, there were glimpses of hope that
              things will soon turn around.</p>
              <p>Our economy is now in dire straits. It is expected to contract
              between - 2.8 and - 5% this year. Fresh graduates have difficulties
              finding a job and earn a decent living to start their own families.
              Middle-aged professionals, managers and technicians face the threat of
              retrenchment. A rising portion of our silver-haired population have
              little money for retirement and has to continue working for as long
              their physical health permits.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The regime has conveniently attributed the cause of the economic
              duress entirely to external circumstances beyond their control
              including losing $58 billion dollars of public monies and possibly more
              in ill-timed investments.</strong></span></p>
              <p>Singaporeans are told to buckled up and stay united for the tough
              times ahead, but there is a lot of angst, frustration and uncertainty
              on the ground whether we will survive this downturn. Where are we
              heading ? Have we learnt from our mistakes ? And more importantly, will
              we continue to stick to old and tested methods of governing the nation
              which has led us to near financial ruins ?</p>
              <p>Iceland, the epicenter of the banking crisis, saw huge debts
              toppling its banks last autumn. Its fragile economy is expected to
              contract by 10 percent this year. Faced with rocketing unemployment and
              rising inflation, Icelanders have increasingly taken to the streets to
              voice their anger.</p>
              <p>Icelandic Prime Minister Geir Haarde, rattled by the financial
              crisis and widespread anti-government protests, called early national
              elections for May 9 on Friday and announced he was stepping down.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>In Singapore, there is no opposition in Parliament to take
              the regime to task for the mismanagement of our economy and reserves.
              Draconian laws curbing civil rights of citizens are in place to prevent
              Singaporeans from marching in the streets to protest. The state media
              tries to concoct a fairy tale to exonerate the regime from its gross
              negligence and lapse of judgement which is becoming increasingly
              difficult and embarrassing for them to cover up.</strong></span></p>
              <p>The politicians pretend nothing has happened and the citizens
              continue life as before, but a palpable undercurrent of discontent and
              disgruntlement is growing.</p>
              <p>In spite of the regime’s insistence that we have lost less money
              than others and the amount lost is only on paper, many Singaporeans
              remain unconvinced going by the whispers circulating around in the
              internet chatrooms and coffeeshops in the HDB heartlands.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Singaporeans are not naive, ignorant and stupid people. Though they
              may not express it explicity, they know deep down inside their hearts
              that they have been short changed by the regime. They have lost trust
              and confidence in the regime, yet they have little choice but to
              continue to lend support to it because there is no alternative to
              replace them as of yet.</strong></span></p>
              <p>We are talking about S$58 billion dollars and possibly more of our
              reserves being wiped out in less than a year, never mind if it is a
              real loss or a loss on paper only. We cannot simply brush the matter
              aside without getting to the bottom of things: what went wrong exactly ?</p>
              <p>I sincerely call on worthy members of the PAP and the opposition who
              truly feel for the suffering and hardship of ordinary Singaporeans to
              set aside their partisan differences to form a Parliamentary Select
              Committee to probe the loss.</p>
              <p>We must get to the bottom of how much of our reserves built up
              painstakingly over the years have been lost overnight in these
              disastrous investments. Who made the decision to invest and who is
              responsible for the appointment of these decision-makers ? Has due
              diligence been exercised in the execution of these decisions ? What
              mistakes have been made ? And how are we going to prevent a repeat of
              this fiasco again ? Are our children and grandchildren going to pay for
              the mistakes made by the current administration in the future ?</p>
              <p>An independent Commission of Inquiry (COI) must be convened
              immediately to investigate the matter and an external accounting firm
              should be engaged to audit the accounts of GIC and Temasek.
              Singaporeans have the right to demand for complete honesty,
              accountability and transparency from the elected government of the day.
              It has to be made answerable to the voters.</p>
              <p>Since the Prime Minister’s father and wife are key personnel
              involved, he has to relinquish his position as Prime Minister as is the
              standard practice in developed countries temporarily till the
              investigations are complete. The Commission of Inquiry should conduct a
              thorough review of GIC and Temasek’s set up, modus operandi and
              investment strategies and give Singaporeans an answer.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Can we trust a system which is based only on trust without any
              checks and balances ? In other first world democracies, the close
              relatives of the Prime Minister will not even be allowed to hold such
              important positions in the government in the first place !</strong></span></p>
              <p>To the PAP MPs out there, do you serve the people of Singapore or
              the PAP ? To the opposition MPs, ask yourselves if you are fulfilling
              your duties as an opposition in Parliament to be the government’s
              “watchdog”. $58 billion dollars of our monies are lost and not a single
              question is asked in Parliament.</p>
              <p>Where is the accountability to the
              people who voted for you in the last election ? To the President of
              Singapore who is the highest paid leader in the world, will you
              justified even a single cent of taxpayers’ monies if you continue to
              ignore wishes of the public to request both Temasek and GIC to make a
              full disclosure of their losses ?</p>
              <p>It is better that the government come clean with the people now
              rather than to allow rumors to fester and spread uncontrollably at the
              grassroots level which will eventually erode the confidence and faith
              the people have in their governance. Evading and giving half-baked
              non-answers to pull a wool over our eyes will only create more doubts,
              mistrust and angst.</p>

              Yes, we need to know more about the losses incurred by both Temasek and GIC. This is not to punish anyone but to learn the mistakes made. Without learning the mistakes how can we ever emerge smarter?
              
              It is also important both the organisations be transparent and accountable for that would lead to more diligence and prudence.
