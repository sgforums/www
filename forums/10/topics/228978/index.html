            <div class='col-md body'>The Singapore Government (Singapore's Education System) is bias. They allow cheenas who fail their English (D7)(or say; people who are chinese-oriented) to enter polys/jcs; but for those who fail their maths (E8 and F9) and/or science; they look down on you and have nowhere to go.<br><br>Can I derive at this conclusion that society hates (or simply sidelines) people who are good in english; cause they think all or most of them are snobs, and rendered 'em totally useless elites?<br>And people who excel in maths are better (and treasured; deemed to be more successful) than people who are good in English..<br><br>Little wonder so many big bosses can't even speak proper English; and sometimes they tried too hard and ended up embarrassing themselves further.<br><br>Maybe we should ask 'em what's the area of a circle.<br><br>- to sum it all, industries like engineering, accountancy, architecture requires maths, basic maths; but in reality, we do not need maths (why the fuck do we study A-maths for?), they're all crap which is totally useless?!<br><br>No one's gon' ask you what are indices; probably for the rest of your life. (if you're workin' in industries which do not need maths)<br><br>And English is very important, but the Government isn't emphasizing so much on it, thus had sidelined all those who failed their maths terribly from entrance to all polys and jcs. How discriminating. What message does the govt send out here?<br><br>That those English-oriented fools (who suck in maths) would never be as successful as those cheenas (who excel in maths)?<br><br>That maths is definitely much more important than English?<br><br>Maths is the common language?<br><br>that we must maintain that stupid reputation we're the best when it comes to education in maths, yet Singaporeans' standard of english is simply pathetic and all their (govt) efforts couldn't get any positive results?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br></div>

If you think it darn boring, sianz and dumb, the most unlikely you will want to remember and even using it.<br><br>The method is a simple way of harnassing creativity. It all depends on how individual use it. I read of a book where the author claim that he learns how to draw ( from someone who totally can't draw to someone who can draw a very nice picture ) just by practising some of these "creativity exercise" which harnass the usage of his right brain or ustiling both brain in a more holistically manner.. which tada.. demonstrate the potential in each us.<br><br></div>

They allow cheenas who fail their English (D7)(or say; people who are chinese-oriented) to enter polys/jcs; but for those who fail their maths (E8 and F9) and/or science; they look down on you and have nowhere to go.<br><br>Can I derive at this conclusion that society hates (or simply sidelines) people who are good in english; cause they think all or most of them are snobs, and rendered 'em totally useless elites?<br>And people who excel in maths are better (and treasured; deemed to be more successful) than people who are good in English..<br><br>Little wonder so many big bosses can't even speak proper English; and sometimes they tried too hard and ended up embarrassing themselves further.<br><br>Maybe we should ask 'em what's the area of a circle.<br><br>- to sum it all, industries like engineering, accountancy, architecture requires maths, basic maths; but in reality, we do not need maths (why the fuck do we study A-maths for?), they're all crap which is totally useless?!<br><br>No one's gon' ask you what are indices; probably for the rest of your life. (if you're workin' in industries which do not need maths)<br><br>And English is very important, but the Government isn't emphasizing so much on it, thus had sidelined all those who failed their maths terribly from entrance to all polys and jcs. How discriminating. What message does the govt send out here?<br><br>That those English-oriented fools (who suck in maths) would never be as successful as those cheenas (who excel in maths)?<br><br>That maths is definitely much more important than English?<br><br>Maths is the common language?<br><br>that we must maintain that stupid reputation we're the best when it comes to education in maths, yet Singaporeans' standard of english is simply pathetic and all their (govt) efforts couldn't get any positive results?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br></div></blockquote>MOE is accepting those PRC students cos the govt hope that these students will stay on after their studies. It is not cos MOE, and much less the society, hates people who are good in English.<br><br>Our govt love elites and to them there is no such thing as useless elites. Btw, being good in English only doesn't render one an elite.<br><br>It is rather narrow-minded to think that one subject is more impt than others. Every subject contributes to the development of humanity.<br><br>i think our view of education and knowledge has one fundamental flaw: it is based on utilitarian pragmatic grounds.<br><br>We have been conditioned to pursue whatever education or knowledge that will enable us to get a well paying job. There are actually many other things to learn though they may not be well paying they contribute to our pulsating universe and allow us to fulfill our potential!</div>
