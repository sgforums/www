This is at least better than the past when they accepted everything blindly what the government said and were taken for granted.<br><br>In the Buangkok case, citizens have again spoken up. Their white elephant protest is a good start. The RGS school girls are not accepting the Buangkok white elephant blandly.<br><br>Whether white elephant placards or T-shirt shows the people are maturing in their political consciousness, I think time will tell but they have made a start - a slow and tentative start. I hope this trend of questioning the authority will continue and become part of the culture and social sphere of the masses. If they don't speak up and question, there will be more persistent autocracy and harsh anti-people political apathy and all the wrong wrong doings resulting in their present struggles with high costs and unemployments.<br><br>When problems occur the government is not going to admit them like the NKF and they will have to fight for their own cause and be heard before problems are admitted and solved.<br><br>People must develop their capacity to be vibrant and objective and collective and by being together as demonstrated in forums they will be a force to reckon with and be respected not being taken for granted or brainwashed by propagandas and election goodies.<br><br>My two cents' worth.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>HDB made huge profits from its sale of flats and yet it is still trying to squeeze more and more profits by S-A-L-M-A-N-I-S-I-N-G the purchasers with wrongful resale levies.<br><br>It is ridiculous that citizens simply keep paying more and more profits to the HDB to no end.<br><br>Originally, in the early 1970s when HDB only charges construction costs in selling flats to people under the "Homeownership for the People" scheme at $6,200 for a 3-room standard flat and $7,800 for a 3-room improved flat, I fully agree with the levy to discourage people from taking advantage of subsidy by limiting any one who has bought HDB flat at original lowly-priced flats to one upgrading to a bigger flat or as HDB put it to one bite of the cherry.<br><br>In later years when HDB increases the price of 3-rm flat from $7,800 to $150,000 for a similar 3-rm flat and sells the 4-rm flat at $200,000, it is charging at full market price and any so-called discounts is only window dressing and not a subsidy.<br><br>HDB has lost the right from the late 1970s to say that it is subsidising its 3-rm or 4-rm sale flats. It is only through creative accounting that it is claiming to give subsidy the reason for collecting the resale or upgrading levy but it simply carried on the charging.<br><br>WP should consider adding one more item to the Manifesto : "to abolish the HDB levy and refund all levies to the purchasers especially after the HDB priced the sale prices to include land costs up to full market values and more especially after HDB resale prices have kept dropping from the HDB original sale prices.</div>
