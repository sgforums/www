            <div class='col-md body'>Teens' white elephant T-shirt venture gets police attention<br><br>VAL CHUA<br>Assistant News Editor<br>val@newstoday.com.sg<br><br>CONTROVERSY has trailed the Buangkok MRT station for the past two-and-a-half years Â— right up to its long-awaited opening day.<br><br>On Friday, while preparations went into overdrive for the carnival to celebrate the opening of the $80-million station on Sunday, drama knocked on its doors yet again. This time, it was over some "Save the White Elephants" T-shirts that former Raffles Girls' School (RGS) students were planning to sell at the carnival.<br><br>That day, the students and Punggol South organisers received a reminder from the police that they needed a fund-raising permit before they could sell the T-shirts to the public, in line with existing regulations. The 27 students were also told that they might break the law if the T-shirts were worn "en masse".<br><br>The last minute reminder had apparently caught the 17-year-old students Â— who had created the T-shirts last year after the infamous white-elephant incident Â— off guard. When contacted, a police spokesperson confirmed that the advisory was sent out.<br><br>"In view of the nature of the event, we had advised the organisers that they should be aware that the wearing of T-shirts en masse may be misconstrued by some as an offence under the Miscellaneous Offences (Public &amp; Order &amp; Nuisance) (Assemblies &amp; Processions) Rules. Should Police receive any report or complaints, we would have to look into the matter. This is consistent with all reports made to the Police," he told Today.<br><br>But the police have no objections to the fund-raising initiative per se, and are prepared to expedite the permit, which normally takes three days to process.<br><br>"In this case, we have made an exception for the students. We have communicated to the event organiser that the fundraisers can still apply for a permit on Saturday, as long as they are able to produce a memo of understanding with the charitable organisation," said the police spokesperson on Friday night.<br><br>The latest drama caps the bumpy ride surrounding the Buangkok MRT station, which will finally open after two-and-a-half years of lobbying, including the placement of eight cut-outs of white elephants in August, which resulted in the police issuing a stern warning to a grassroots leader.<br><br>The then-RGS girls were inspired by the incident to create the T-shirts, selling them at $12 each, to raise funds for Youth Guidance, a charity that helps youth at risk. They managed to sell all but 60 of some 300 T-shirts.<br><br>Calling themselves Project White Elephant, the girls Â— formerly from class 415 in RGS Â— had said in a Lianhe Zaobao interview that they had always taken a strong interest in current affairs and the Buangkok incident had caught their attention.<br><br>They wanted to "galvanise the youth of today to rise up from the apathy they are stereotyped with and take an active role in airing their views".<br><br>In an infosheet which they sent to potential buyers of the T-shirts, they had said: "Even though the White Elephant has become our mascot and symbol for the project, we are in no way attempting to judge or condone the Buangkok MRT incident.<br><br>"Rather, we are using the accidental fame of the elephants to spark interest in our project; they also serve as a reminder that legal boundaries are important and should be adhered to even while expressing one's views and opinions about political issues."<br><br>Impressed by their entrepreneurial spirit and derring-do, Punggol South grassroots leaders had invited the team to set up a stall at the opening ceremony of the station.<br><br>Commenting on the latest police advisory, a grassroots leader remarked: "There's no reason for them to protest, because the station is going to be opened!"<br><br>Some 5,000 residents and non-residents Â— who had each bought tickets at $3 Â— are expected to turn up this Sunday. A 240m long ribbon will be placed around the station, allowing for some 400 residents to cut the ribbon alongside guests of honour.<br><br>Of the latest controversy, Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC MP Charles Chong advised the students: "The (fund-raising) permit is not a new requirement. We would urge them to get it."<br><br>He also assured the authorities that the participants had been given T-shirts to wear Â— but they are purple in colour, with "no animal images on it".<br><br>------------------------<br><br>This is preposterous, not to mention a slap in the face of common sense. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> There is evidently a lack of brains/common sense in the upper echelons that run this show.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"></div>
