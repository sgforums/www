              <p>Freedom of speech is something that everyone should have the right to exercise.</p>

              <p>We cannot abuse our freedom of speech to defame or slander and spread lies and rumours for hidden agendas.</p>
              <p>I don't think its right to spread hostile or false propaganda either.</p>

              <p><strong><span>Court: Dutch lawmaker is entitled to make anti-Quran statements</span></strong></p>
              <p>THE HAGUE, Netherlands – A Dutch lawmaker who sparked protests across
              the Muslim world with a film criticizing the Quran is entitled to
              express his anti-Islamic views, a court ruled Monday, rejecting a
              request to muzzle him.</p>
              <p>The court ruled that the views expressed by right-wing legislator
              Geert Wilders do not exceed the legal boundaries against inciting
              hatred or violence.</p>
              <p>
              
              </p>
              <div class="parMarker">

              <div class="bigbox" style="float: right; width: 300px;"><br> </div>
              </div>
              <p>The Netherlands Islamic Federation
              withdrew its petition to ban Wilders' film “Fitna” after it appeared on
              the Internet March 27, the day before the case was heard in a heavily
              guarded courtroom.</p>
              <p>The movie, which links terror attacks by Muslim extremists with
              texts from Islam's holy book, triggered angry street protests in
              Pakistan, Malaysia and Indonesia, as well as calls in other countries
              to boycott Dutch goods.</p>
              <p>The federation asked The Hague District Court to order Wilders
              to stop making statements “in writing, on film or spoken” that are
              deemed insulting to Muslims, and to apologize for past statements.
              Wilders has called the Quran a fascist book and compared it to Adolf
              Hitler's “Mein Kampf.”</p>
              <p>In a written judgment published Monday, the court said Wilders'
              right to free speech and role as a politician allow him to voice his
              criticisms of radical Islam and the Quran.</p>
              <p>As a lawmaker, Wilders “must be able to – sometimes in sharp
              terms – express his opinions,” the ruling said. “In this context, it
              cannot be said that (Wilders') statements – even though provocative –
              are an incitement to hate or violence against Muslims.”</p>
              <p>Wilders welcomed the ruling.</p>
              <p>“I always believed that within the context of political debate
              ... I should be allowed to say what my opinion is, which is that I see
              the danger and threat of Islam to our country and the West,” he told
              The Associated Press.</p>
              <p>“As a politician, you have to be able to say what you think,” he said.</p>
              <p>In his film, Wilders couples verses from the Quran with images
              of the terror attacks on New York, Madrid and elsewhere, and shows
              footage of imams saying Islam should dominate the world.</p>
              <p>The movie also says it is up to Muslims to “tear out the hateful verses from the Quran.”</p>
              <p>Despite protests in the Muslim world, there was no violent
              backlash in the Netherlands, where Wilders' anti-Islam views are widely
              known.</p>
              <p>Wilders has often warned of what he calls the growing
              “Islamization” of the Netherlands, where Muslims make up about 850,000
              of the 16 million population.</p>
              <p>Wilders slightly modified “Fitna” after he was threatened with
              possible legal action for copyright violation for using a cartoon by a
              Danish artist who portrayed Islam's prophet wearing a bomb-shaped
              turban.</p>
              <p>“Fitna,” which in Arabic means “strife,” now starts and ends
              with a different cartoon portraying a bearded man in a turban carrying
              a globe, with a lit fuse on his shoulder.</p>

              <p>fos is a double-edge sword. ppl can abuse it but ppl also can benefit from it.</p>
              <p>i think overall it should benefit mankind for we can hear various views and then make our own independent decisions.</p>

              <p>But like FireIce pointed out..... how do you prevent ppl from abusing it <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="icon_question.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What happen when someone in S'pore wants to produce a similar film like '<strong>Finta</strong>'.....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If we were to stop him/her..... there would be no real 'FOS'</p>
              <p>If we don't stop him/her..... we would have no peace among the races.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Could we depend on S'poreans to knows the boundaries.....<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="icon_question.gif"> to be aware of the consequences....<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="icon_question.gif"> I really hope we could..... but seeing how if I don't agree with Anti-Govt views here instantly made me a ''PAP running dog".... I doubt we understand what FOS really means.....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Just my 2 cents worth.... or is even this too Pro-Govt for the ppl here...... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>

              <p>that's why i said FOS is a myth in the first place. in reality, there is no such thing.</p>
              <p>when america prides itself and say it is a free country, is it really `free' in every sense of the word? that one can rape, pillage and steal to one's heart's content because america declares itself `free'?</p>
              <p>FOS in reality is relative when it is used and applied.</p>
              <p>let's have a dose of realism here when we discuss this. if one insists on discussing FOS in its theoratical context, then i rest my case.</p>
