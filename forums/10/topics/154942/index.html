            <div class='col-md body'>U.S. tells nations hands off Internet<br><br>By John Zarocostas<br>SPECIAL TO THE WASHINGTON TIMES<br>September 27, 2005<br><br>GENEVA -- The United States said at the outset of global talks on information technology yesterday that it will fight attempts to put the United Nations or any international group in charge of the Internet.<br><br>"We want to make sure the private sector leads and the Internet continues to be a reservoir of great innovation, and that governments continue to focus on enabling the growth of the Internet, and not of controlling its use," Ambassador David A. Gross told The Washington Times in an interview.<br><br>Major developing nations spearheaded by China, Brazil, South Africa, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and a number of industrialized countries including Norway, Switzerland and Russia would like to see the United States relinquish its historic control of the Internet.<br><br>"This situation is very undemocratic, unfair and unreasonable," said Sha Zukang, the ambassador from China, which this week imposed new rules that allow only "healthy and civilized" news to be read by the mainland's 100 million Web users.<br><br>China's government will determine which news is healthy and which news is not.<br><br>The question of Internet governance is the most politically charged issue in preparatory talks here for the second World Information Society Summit to be held in Tunis, Tunisia, in November.<br><br>Mr. Gross, U.S. coordinator for international communications and information policy, said the role of the U.S. government is "to ensure stability and reliability of the Internet.<br><br>"We will take no action that would undermine that stability," he said.<br>The U.S.-based ICANN -- or Internet Corp. for Assigned Names and Numbers -- is a nonprofit corporation that administers the Internet's domain name system.<br><br>Massod Khan, Pakistan's ambassador and chairman of the Internet governance segment of the talks, said the issues are difficult and added "there is a will to engage, but we have to wait for the outcome."<br><br>Paul Twomey, president of ICANN, said his organization does not want to see "the Internet's technological future politicized."<br><br><a href="http://www.washtimes.com/world/20050926-094916-3102r.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.washtimes.com/world/20050926-094916-3102r.htm</a> Full report here..</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>There is something all countries ought to learn - openness leads to spirits of enquiries and scientific empirism and fruitful search for truths, the ultimate and indispensable conditions for progress.<br><br>Let us face it, the progress of civilization is largely due to men's open and unrestrained scientifc quest for truths and facts. This factor of national success has been amply proven over centuries by men of science over the years. It is not a question of pride but biologically the Asians seem to be shy of criticism and openness. Their leaders' lack of openness or kiasuism can be seen in kiasu political controls as well methodology used in regulating the countries.<br><br>If any countries want progress and better lives for their citizens, their leaders should open up to permit freedoms of views and search for truths and knowledge and applications of science and technology. Opening up of society to allow people to mature in political wisdoms is one major factor of success.<br><br>But sad to say owing to biology perhaps, we often found quick claims and assumptions made for slightest progress whether in nation building or business. Why so narrow and self-centred in attitude towards fellow human beings. If not for application of scientific and technological advances made in the west we may still be in the backwaters.<br><br>Yet our leaders were so quick to claim superiority for 40 years of nation building without knowing this truth. Our leaders should be more humble and objective and allow citizens' greater openness and liberal pursuits by the citizens to practise choices in every field. It is the same for business, R&amp; D or political participations. Open pursuit of knowledge and truths have brought about progress for many people in the western world for many years. This will still be the surest way to allow citizens to be competitive and make progess in whatever they are doing to make decent living.<br><br>Arrogance has gone to the head of our leaders who are making claims of world's bests every day. I would suggest that their initial success in management area has not been sustained in applying existing knowledge due to lack of encouraging citizens in open pursuits of knowledge.<br><br>It will be myopic to claim success when success was attributable to taxing and recovering costs from the citizens. Real success will come from open pursuits of science and technolgies in every field.<br><br>Let the leaders learn from the world westerners' perspective on the internet. Internet reflects the same human spirit of qnquiries and hunger for truths. Through internet, citizens will make greater progress to empower scientific pursuits.<br><br>By taking actions on people for so-called racism in blogs without fully understanding the whole issue about openness and spirit of enquiries, we are making a wrong move. Let the internet stay open without interfering by the state to clamp down on this or that on the slightest excuse for political kiasuism.<br><br>We are already subjected to too many minute control in our lives. We are already limited in intellectual space with many uncalled for restrictions in our lives.<br><br>Let the international views upholding openness of blogs or internets be another reminder to our leaders that kiasuism in politics will not work. Their narrow attitude towards information and views is at fault not society or citizens. Look at the NKF case, their faults do not become truths after 20 years of denial about promotion of elites or their reward system.<br><br>There is a need to be not so kiasu or else no matter what they do they will be finally hurting their own people's progress. It is not a smart move to try to extend state control on the net.</div>
