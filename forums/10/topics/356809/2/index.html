              <p>There is a rather broad defination of what are our traits. But rather than to define it here and be made a mockery out of it, let us make a comparison on how other nations define their shared identity and common values, aspirations, and you will be able to find for yourself how you feel about such traits.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Americans:- Anglo saxons, immigrants of various lands, largely protestant christians, escaped from serfdom to a new land and thru hardwork, built up a civilisation that rivalled Rome, with the greatest office in the land avaliable to any - rich or poor, white or black - the president of a nation.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>England: Largely protestants, claims ancient heritage back to Druids and some revisionists amongst them back to stonehenge. Hold themselves responsible for bringing civilisation to the world through forcing non-whites into slavery, robbing and raping asia of its wealth, believers of white supremacy in private.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>These are only some rather tongue in cheek examples and certainly not definative, but only to serve as examples for you to define. Only you alone can define how you feel as a Singaporean in relation to another. Anything else would only be felt forced upon by a third party. Ask yourself this rather - how had you benefitted today or lost compared to another thriving and respected society in the world in full reality and you will know how your values should be defined.</p>

              <p>Is there such a thing as a Singaporean identity - when there is such a huge influx of foreigners ?</p>
              <p>What is the Singaporean identity today ?</p>
              <p>Is a common identity moulded by common aspirations ?</p>
              <p>If identity is moulded by aspirations - are the aspirations of the present Singaporean generation of this 21st Century similar to those Pre-WW1 arriving "Singaporeans", or even those born Pre- and post WW2, or similar to the generations born during the time of independence, or even those born post independence ?</p>
              <p>That will be four groups of Singaporeans at different periods of Singapore's History -with different aspirations of their times - that will need to be compared with.</p>
              <p>If the present day new arrivals into Singapore have the same "<em>migrant aspirations"</em> that are similar to those Pre-WW1 "Singaporean" generation, can the present aspirations of these newly arrived Singaporeans be similar to the aspirations of the present Singapore generation born and bred here since Post-WW2 ?</p>
              <p>If the aspirations of the new Singaporean "arrivees" are out of synch with those who are born and bred here since Post-WW2 - can there be any common identity, a sense of common shared values ?</p>
              <p>If at all, the forum that was reported in the Straits Times is nothing better than another propaganda attempt to blow the trumpet on behalf of MM, and use the occassion to soothe the social resentment at the vast number of foreigners - (those with and without TALENT) that have been admitted into Singapore to be Citizens or PRs.</p>
              <p>Reference to the growing tide of resentment can be read from the other thread in this Speaker's Corner at : <a rel="nofollow" href="/forums/10/topics/357147">‘Three Singaporeans write on Singapore society and PAP regime’  </a></p>
              <p>If at all, the theme itself is another sly attempt at brain-washing and lull Singaporeans to sleep over the fact that a larger influx of foreigners as Singaporean Citizens will provide the PAP with another 10 years of assured political influence.</p>
              <p>It will take about this length of time for the new Singaporeans to become 100% localised with local problems and resentment, and begin to be awaken to the stifling dominance of the PAP ways over Singaporean lives.</p>

              <p>LKY said, "If you are good, educated, intelligent and capable, no matter who you are, what color you are, what race you are, what nationalities you are from, WE WANT YOU" just like Uncle Sam of USA. So, where got cronyism or nepotism? It is all about meritocracy and not meritocrazy ya, if you can perform and bring good to singapore, you are in, but if you cannot perform, so be it, just be normal like me, but you cannot perform, born loser and yet make a lot of noise, you better take more medications or end your life.</p>

              <p>i think the Rajaratnam's national pledge would be a place

              <p>I think that is pretty much getting your "shared" identity dictated to you.  The "National Pledge" as its name suggests, promotes a national identity construct; Singaporean.  I won't contest what it means to be a "Singaporean" since its also hard to define what being "American", "British" or "Japanese" really means, so I'll really accept "Singaporean" as a shared identity without asking.</p>
              <p>But what are our shared values?  I'd say being an American, "freedom" is a shared value.  "Democracy" is a common aspiration. There is an ideology of "liberalism" (using that word loosely here) behind their identity, value and common aspirations.  Singapore doesn't have such an ideology behind our value, and aspirations.  So how do we know if the dictated values and common aspirations are indeed "ours" and not decided by the current political regime?</p>
              <p>If there is indeed an ideology to Singapore, I'd have to agree that it would have to be "pragmatism."  What kind of common identity, values and aspirations would that inspire?  How can it possibly inspire any since anything can go for the sake of being pragmatic?</p>
              <p>Too many questions, too little answers.</p>

              <p><em>Let us ask ourself this, why do we need shared identity, values and aspirations?</em></p>
              <p>Utimately, as many believed, life is all about money, the making of it, the saving of it and the spending of it, so help me heaven and let no one stop me from achieving it, no matter what circumstances or situations prevail.</p>
              <p>We study, eat, sleep, wake up, pass our exams, get a job, earn our money and to hell with everything else.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now, stand back at look at what i have written. Is this a life you want? Is there any further meaning to your existance? More critically, have you thought who made it possible, as well as the complexities and intricacies, developements involved, for you to earn money ?</p>
              <p>An identity is something that differentiates you from a blangadeshi, a communist chinese, an african village peasant. An identity that has roots traced back in time of a shared beginning which you can take pride with, something which when in time of crises, each can look at one another for encouragement and draw strengths upon a shared past to face a new challenge without fear.</p>
              <p>Values are something which you strongly believe and should be upheld, at even the cost of your life. It is that which protects a civlised society to thrive and grow, something which all from different groups and religion can respect and agreee to disagree on, a compromise so that all may live and grow old in peace.</p>
              <p>Aspiration is a hope that you want to achieve, in consideration of others in society. Not of the beggar thy neighbour sort, but one that will elevate other lives as you rise.</p>
              <p>Feel free to explore what it means to you in your free time, for despite our differences, we singaporeans have much in common, and need not be that which is programmed from our political leaders, for the goodwill and brotherhood of mankind exists in all of us, inclulding leaders, the sum experiences/traditions of our civilisation's existance, from the  bedrock family unit and laws, which is responsible for us being different from apes and animals of the wild. </p>
