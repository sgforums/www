Bear in mind that we are not voting in just a minister with a seat; we are voting in a minister with 5 seats. PAP can easily push out with any policy simply because they have more than 2/3 majority. How much of the rest are effective as MPs? This is the main drawback of mega-GRCs =&gt; MPs are voted in not based of their calibre and quality, but because of a person. Do we want that?

PAP's explanation is that they are there because they want to serve the country. The high pay is there because they can earn just as much if they were to work outside, implying they can easily get better jobs outside and thus do not need to be working in the government to get that pay. My question is, if they want to serve the country, why is a pay rise so important to them? It is their choice to serve the country; it's not a way of living for them.<br><br>3) It's not about the cost of election. Whether the opposition can afford will determine the amount of competition the incumbent will have. So what if one day the opposition does not have enough money to run for election? My point here was not speculate the cost of election. I'm trying to raise the point that increased MP salary will lead to increased election deposit, which will further limit the amount of competition that PAP will have in the elections.</div>
