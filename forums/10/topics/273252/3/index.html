            <div class='col-md body'>I won't try to compare the amount of destitutes in other countries for the single fact that those countries never made the claim that they eliminate poverty. I do believe there was a quote from our MM Lee stating it was so.<br><br>I'm not a PAP or LKY hater, in fact i do agree with the logic for most of the laws they have made and you can't argue the fact that they have helped Singapore grow.<br><br>My issue is that most of these destitutes i see are the elderly who had to make a living through collecting card board boxes and used can drinks. Have they not contribute towards Singapore's prosperity during their youth in their own way?<br><br>Surely something can be done to help them, it's simply not right to see old people who are 60-70 years old having to make a living digging into trash cans and dragging large piles of cardboard around.<br><br>If our ministers insist on being the highest paid in the entire world, then i insist they must do more than their counterparts from other countries. Simply accepting that poverty and the homeless is a worldwide issue and not worth the effort to solve locally means they are undeserving of the salary given to them.<br><br>Why should we be made to pay 2 mil for a minister that is doing no different from his New York/Paris/London counterparts?</div>

We look at an average person's economic values at age 10,20,30,40,50,60,70,80,90.<br><br>In Singapore, some are old, slow, weak and no livelihood.

I know, my conviction tells me, BECOS time passes very slow for these people, and experiencing their lives tell me so.<br><br>Personal convictions from the hearts are WORTHLESS.
