            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Mat Toro:</div><div class="quote_body">Thats why unemployment and taxes are so high in Germany.<br>You want to pay high taxes or have no jobs?<br></div></blockquote>Many chose to be unemployed because the benefits are very good. Umemployment is a choice by many. This is told to me by Germans. One of them is a person ready to retire soon, working in a university where they do track unemployment rates.<br><br>High taxes? I don't mind if my salaries was as high as theirs. Do you know that even with their high GST, quite a substantial amount of their basic goods are still around the same price as in Singapore, if not cheaper, after considering the exchange rates?<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Mat Toro:</div><div class="quote_body">Teaching people to depend on themselves, thats really the most humane thing to do. You need to look at the big picture and realise that.<br></div></blockquote>Ok lor. European countries are not being humane by 'teaching' people to depend on themselves. And when you need help, you have no one to turn to.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Mat Toro:</div><div class="quote_body">Not many homeless in Singapore. they are homeless by choice, not the govt's fault because govt do provide shelter for these people.<br></div></blockquote>I challenge you to the statement of being homeless by choice.<br><br>You said government teach people to depend on themselves is good, yet you support them providing shelter to peoply.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Mat Toro:</div><div class="quote_body">Its true. Check with MCDS or your neighbourhood police post. They do run shelters for the destitute but these are not publicised. I know because I have helped these people before, you didn't, thats why you don't know. all you know is to complain complain, blame and blame.<br></div></blockquote>I know because I have personally travelled Europe and many things do enter my eyes. I have seen enough of homeless hiding here and there in Singapore. Singapore do provide free shelters, within HDBs, within rubbish dumps, etc etc, where the homeless now hide. Have you open your eyes when you walk around? Is there a need for us to bring you to the 'homeless' of Singapore for an interview?<br><br>I complained? I'm pointing out to you the various misconceptions you have been holding.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Mat Toro:</div><div class="quote_body">Useless fella.  </div></blockquote>I agree. I'm useless. I never say I wasn't. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br></div>
