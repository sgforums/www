Or is it a closed society where the mass mediaÂ—the newspapers, journals, publications, TV, radio. . . feed menÂ’s minds with a constant drone of</span> <span style="color: red;"><strong>sycophantic support for a particular orthodox philosophy</strong></span><span style="color: darkgreen;">?Â”<br><br></span></blockquote></span><br><br><span style="color: darkred;">Forty years later, in 1997, LKY remark was recorded in the aritcle <span style="font-style: italic;"><a href="http://%20http://www.singapore-window.org/sw00/000614ug.htm" rel="nofollow">Machiavelli's Tiger - Lee Kuan Yew and Singapore's authoritarian government</a></span> : </span><br><br><span style="color: darkgreen;"><blockquote><br><span style="font-style: italic;">'Between being loved and being feared, I have always believed Machiavelli was right.
