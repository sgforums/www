            <div class='col-md body'>How about non-conformist ex-President Ong Teng Cheong? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br>Monday Â• May 16, 2005<br><br>EX-PRESIDENTS ALL DESERVE STATE FUNERALS<br><br>Lack of a clear policy is puzzling<br><br>Like many other Singaporeans, I am both puzzled and saddened over the non-accordance of a state funeral for former president Ong Teng Cheong who passed away in February 2002.<br><br>To me, the reply from Mr Chen Hwai Liang, the press secretary to the Prime Minister ("Honour rites still evolving" May 14 Â— 15) has only added to the confusion as to who qualifies for the state funeral and who does not.<br><br>Mr Chen said a person's "rank or the appointment that he or she had held" need not necessarily determine if a state funeral would be accorded, as it "depends on the person's services to the nation, as well as other special circumstances".<br><br>In the hearts and minds, knowledge and understanding, of many Singaporeans, Mr Ong had served us well since 1972 Â– whether as a Member of Parliament (MP), minister, labour chief or as our first elected president.<br><br>Even before entering politics, he contributed as a grassroots volunteer in Seletar Hills.<br><br>What about his firm beliefs and convictions over the positive impact of the Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) system, during the transportation debate in the early 1980s?<br><br>Have we forgotten the significance of the three committees headed by Mr Ong: the Moral Education Committee (1979), Advisory Council on Art and Culture (1989) and the Chinese Language Review Committee (1992) which led to significant changes in our society today?<br><br>I agree that "when Singaporeans who have made major contributions to the country pass away, it is right and fitting that they be honoured and mourned by the nation", regardless of whether they may or may not be former presidents.<br><br>However, isn't it clear that Mr Ong's contributions merited such appreciation?<br><br>In any case, the actions of former presidents Ong and Wee Kim Wee have taught us valuable lessons in life: Be it about humility, sincerity, graciousness, courage, concern for others, and so son. We should remember and appreciate them in the years to come.<br><br>It is pointless to have bridges or airports named after them if, years down the road, our children do not even know their significance to Singapore. Yet again, the naming of key buildings or structures in memory of them would help future generations understand.<br><br>For a start, I suggest renaming Changi Airport and the new Low Cost Carriers (LCCs) terminal as the Ong Teng Cheong Airport and Wee Kim Wee Terminal. With the emergence of LCCs, more families and ordinary Singaporeans are able to enjoy the luxury of travelling.<br><br>And given the humble backgrounds of both former presidents, it is apt that the airport and terminal are named in their memory.<br><br>Mr Chen's point that our practices and customs for public ceremonies and observations are "still evolving", seems contrary to Singapore's reputation for careful organisation and planning.<br><br>It is most unusual that there is no definite policy or rules regarding a state funeral.<br><br>It is ironic that a president is given the honour of the nation's salute on National Day, and yet when it comes to his funeral ceremony, the Prime Minister and his Cabinet have the final say.<br><br>Any president, whether outstanding or mediocre, should be given respect and recognition.<br><br>Letters from Jason Lee Boon Hong and Ho Chan Sian</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>PAP introduces second batch of new candidates for upcoming GE</strong><br>By Asha Popatlal, Channel NewsAsia<br><br>The People's Action Party has introduced its second batch of new candidates for the upcoming General Election.<br><br>Among the three introduced on Tuesday was 44-year-old Seah Kian Peng, who is currently the Deputy Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer of NTUC FairPrice. He's married, with a son and daughter.<br><br>On the community front, Mr Seah has been a member of the Jurong Central Citizens Consultative Committee since 2002.<br><br>He is also a board member of the Centre for Fathering.<br><br>Mr Seah graduated from the University of New South Wales with a Bachelor of Building honours degree.<br><br>Asked about his priorities, Mr Seah said the creation of good quality jobs is essential as is growing the economy.<br><br>But at the root of it all, the man whose parents struggled financially to support the family said a strong family unit is essential.<br><br>"I hope we can promote a model which is family-centric and we can do a lot for the community by being family-centric. If we can get that right, I believe we can solve many of the problems we have right now," said PAP candidate Seah Kian Peng.<br><br>Also introduced was the first Indian candidate.<br><br>Hri Kumar, a 39-year-old lawyer, is a Director with Drew &amp; Napier, a firm he has worked in since graduating from the National University of Singapore.<br><br>He has represented party leaders in high profile defamation lawsuits in the past.<br><br>The youngest of nine children, Mr Hri Kumar has been active with school and community activities from an early age.<br><br>He has been helping at meet-the-people sessions in Taman Jurong constituency since last October.<br><br>Asked about issues he would fight for, he stressed education and spoke candidly about his struggles with Chinese as a second language - his parents made each child learn different second languages.<br><br>He also commented on the hottest issue of the election - PAP's policy of linking votes to upgrading.<br><br>"The issue of upgrading has particular significance to since some of my family members still live in Potong Pasir. In fact that's where I grew up, in Blk 224, Lorong 8 Toa Payoh. At the last elections, Mr Chiam succeeded in persuading the voters to vote for him despite the fact that upgrading was also offered, so the voters have a choice. So I dont think anyone is being arm-twisted into voting for one party or another," said PAP candidate Hri Kumar.<br><br>The third new PAP candidate introduced on Tuesday was 48-year-old Ellen Lee, an advocate and solicitor with Ramdas &amp; Wong.<br><br>She's married and has been involved with volunteer service since 1981.<br><br>She currently volunteers her time at a number of places such as the Ang Mo Kio Family Service Centre and the Centre for Promoting Alternatives to Violence.<br><br>Her focus will be the difficulties many heartlanders face with the cost of living and to make sure their children receive as high a level of education as possible.<br><br>Known for her work with the Singapore Association of Women Lawyers, Madam Lee had been approached by the party to stand previously in 1997.<br><br>"I have been approached before but did not take it up because I felt I needed more time on the ground and there were other things to be done as well. At that time, they were opening the door ajar slightly, but not fully, for more women candidates," said PAP candidate Ellen Lee.<br><br>At 48, she is the oldest candidate introduced so far.<br><br>The next round of introductions will be on Thursday.<br><br>- CNA/ir/ls<br><br></div>
