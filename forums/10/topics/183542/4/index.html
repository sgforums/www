My parents were poor and my parents showed very good attitude to sustain the family. With a better platform, we can create an environment where this group would be able to find themselves and I hope to give them a platform and help to create an environment for them - a light at the end of the tunnel - to dare to dream."<br><br>Another post-independence candidate is 38-year-old Josephine Teo, a Human Resource Director with NTUC.<br><br>Before joining the labour organisation, Mrs Teo had worked at the Economic Development Board as well as A*STAR, Singapore's leading science and technology agency.<br><br>She is married with 3 children, and has helped raised funds for the SARS Relief Fund and also organised tsunami relief efforts.<br><br>Mrs Teo has an arts degree from National University of Singapore and a Master in economics from the London School of Economics.<br><br>She said she came forward because she wants to help shape the Singapore of tomorrow for future generations.<br><br>Mrs Teo said: "In 20-25 years when my children are of age, will they say to me: 'Mummy, we are very sorry but Singapore is just not a good place to stay, we are leaving, to pack our bags and go somewhere else'?
