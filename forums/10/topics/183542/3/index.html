            <div class='col-md body'>I have more respect for the new opposition candidates whom I am sure, had to overcome a lot of obstacles before volunteering to be an opposition member.  It is not easy to make the choice to become the alternative voice in politics especially in Singapore.<br><br>The new PAP candidates come across as "yes" persons and have opted for the easier path in choosing to join the incumbent party.  Despite their insistence of new ideas to "challenge" and "renew" the party, I seriously doubt they can offer much real change because of the rigidity imposed by the party itself (despite their constant trumpeting of their "self renewal" or calls to "slaughter sacred cows" ).  When queried about national issues, you can expect all the safe and "acceptable" answers even if their conscience dictates otherwise.<br><br>Even if you were different and wanted to change the status quo, once drafted, your ideas will be squashed if it is not in line with "the greater good" of the party.  However vocal you are, you will soon be reduced to merely a mouthpiece of the party and echoing the party line when questioned vigourously on political issues.<br><br>I guess if you want a "safe" political career, you join the incumbent party.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>NUS forum pits PAP against opposition<br><br>Indranee quizzed on upgrading and Chiam on voting for opposition<br>By Leslie Koh and Sim Chi Yin<br><br>PEOPLE'S Action Party (PAP) MP Indranee Rajah was all ready to focus on the needs of young voters when she arrived at a university forum yesterday to discuss the next General Election.<br><br>IT'S ABOUT A WHOLE NEW GENERATION<br><br>'A key thing about this election will be about identifying what young people want. One way to do that is through the younger candidates...This GE is about a whole new generation coming up, a whole new generation being able to help chart the course of this country, a whole new generation whose voice we need to channel into policy, and into the thinking and direction of the nation.'<br><br>MISS INDRANEE RAJAH, an MP for Tanjong Pagar GRC<br><br>But when an opposition MP chose to talk about why Singapore needed a strong opposition in Parliament, the topic ended up dominating the session at the National University of Singapore (NUS).<br><br>Students at the two-hour forum found it just too hard to ignore the words of veteran opposition figure Chiam See Tong. 'Do you want a one-party rule in Singapore to continue or plurality of political parties in Parliament?' he asked.<br><br>It prompted the students to repeatedly probe Miss Indranee, the only PAP representative on the panel, on some of the ruling party's election tactics and practices at parliamentary sittings.<br><br>These included upgrading housing estates in PAP wards first and requiring all PAP MPs to vote on new laws being passed along party lines.<br><br>VOTERS WANT THE REAL THING<br><br>The forum, organised by the Political Science Association, drew more than 450 students to listen to Miss Indranee, an MP for Tanjong Pagar GRC, Workers' Party assistant organising secretary Chia Ti Lik, Mr Chiam and motivational trainer Cherie Lim.<br><br>Miss Indranee, in her opening remarks, said one key issue in the next GE was how the Government could engage younger voters.<br><br>Urging them to cast their vote wisely, she said: 'How a young person votes determines the direction that a country goes...It allows you to help chart the future of a nation.'<br><br>But Mr Chiam homed in on what he saw as the only issue in the election: Do Singaporeans want a one-party rule? An opposition is needed, he argued, to voice their concerns.<br><br>He hit out at ideas floated to let some PAP MPs vote in Parliament without being constrained by the party whip. 'Voters do not want pseudo-opposition...they want the genuine stuff,' he said, drawing loud cheers.<br><br>Mr Chiam also criticised the PAP for making it difficult for opposition MPs to operate in their constituencies, by putting certain funds and grassroots organisations under the charge of PAP representatives.<br><br>It led the students to direct a volley of questions at Miss Indranee during the Q &amp; A session. They asked: How can you represent people in the House when you must obey the party whip? Have you ever voted against your conscience? Why is the PAP denying upgrading to opposition wards? Is it buying votes?<br><br>Replying in a measured tone, Miss Indranee explained the need for the whip - to ensure Bills are passed - and the Government's stand on upgrading. It had to give priority to those who supported it, she said.<br><br>The two opposition figures, too, got their share of blunt questions, such as, why should Singaporeans vote for the opposition?<br><br>Mr Chiam's reply: 'If you want the whole Parliament to be controlled by the PAP, vote all PAP. But if you feel the opposition has a role to play, in checking the PAP... vote in the opposition.'<br><br>Though Miss Indranee and Mr Chia's answers drew applause, the students reserved their loudest cheers for Mr Chiam, who charmed them with his wit. When a buzzer went off to indicate the time limit of his opening speech, he deadpanned: 'We also often get disturbances during election rallies.'<br><br>Even after the forum, some 30 students crowded round him, keen to talk to the longest-serving opposition MP who has held his Potong Pasir seat for more than 20 years. Said history student Eisen Teo, 21: 'I was struck by Mr Chiam simply because of who he is. He's been around for so long and he speaks up in Parliament.'<br><br>leskoh@sph.com.sg </strong><br><br>You can see that the ruling party have ran out of ideas. Firstly, you have the SM shouting that its about Upgrading , lifting whip to make their MP "oppositions" and then its MPs saying  IT'S ABOUT A WHOLE NEW GENERATION.  You can see that they have also lost their directions and would grab every opportunity to threaten the citizens ie : No upgrading, oppostion is time bomb etc...<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Whos' whiter than who?<br><br>March 31, 2006<br>Opposition urged to reveal candidates for close scrutiny<br>Be as open as PAP, says Teo Chee Hean as he unveils 3 more new faces<br><br>By Sue-Ann Chia<br></strong><br><br>THE opposition should be as open as the People's Action Party in telling Singaporeans who will contest the coming general election, Mr Teo Chee Hean said yesterday.<br><br>Introducing the PAP's third batch of new faces, he hoped opposition parties would also reveal their candidates early, rather than keep their names under wraps until Nomination Day.<br><br>Mr Teo, the ruling party's second assistant secretary-general, said it was presenting its new faces now to let people know who they were and what they stood for.<br><br>'One of the reasons why we introduce our candidates in this way - with their CVs, have them speak to the media - is so that Singaporeans, their voters, can get to know them. It's a transparent process,' he said.<br><br>'We are prepared to put our candidates out for close scrutiny by the public.<br><br>'We hope that the opposition will be prepared to do the same as well, put their candidates up, tell us who they are early so that...we will not be surprised when they turn up just on Nomination Day to submit their papers.'<br><br>Similarly, he said, the opposition must be prepared for the public to scrutinise their programmes, as outlined in their manifesto.<br><br>Hence, he was surprised that the Workers' Party put out a manifesto but felt affronted when PAP leaders questioned it. The PAP's programmes and policies are clear, he said, so its manifesto should not surprise.<br><br>Mr Teo, who is Defence Minister, presented three new candidates at the PAP's Upper Changi headquarters.<br><br>They were Ms Jessica Tan, 39, a general manager of software giant Microsoft; Mr Teo Ser Luck, 37, general manager in global freight firm DHL Express Singapore; and lawyer Michael Palmer, also 37.<br><br>All three were born after Singapore's independence, and more than half the PAP's new candidates will be from this post-1965 generation.<br><br>'While we continue to pay attention to the needs of Singaporeans of all ages, we do need to ensure that the concerns, hopes and aspirations of the post-independence generation are fully represented in Parliament, and their needs are reflected in the policy choices that we make,' said the minister. Ms Tan, Mr Teo and Mr Palmer were typical of their generation, he said, juggling busy careers with raising young families and caring for elderly parents too.<br><br>Mr Palmer is the PAP's first Eurasian candidate in two decades. An old boy of the St Andrew's family of schools and a rugby player, he said he is entering politics because he believes in 'more action, less talk'.<br><br>Ms Tan, who attended CHIJ St Joseph's Convent, Catholic Junior College and the National University of Singapore, is married with three children, aged 10, 12, and 14.<br><br>She likened taking the plunge into politics to getting married and having her first baby - a commitment bringing heavy responsibilities.<br><br>For Mr Teo, an old boy of Victoria School and a triathlete, success at the polls may mean having to quit his job, because of company policy. But the father of two is prepared for the change, saying he can 'help many companies, but serve only one country'.<br><br>Minister Teo said the new candidates share the same values and commitment to serve.<br><br>'But beyond that core, I think there's also a refreshing diversity of views, backgrounds and things which they want to push for,' he said.<br><br>------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Wah, MP Superstars now on.<br>PAP challenge Opp to reveal candidates.<br>Is it setting up to be an Andrew Kuan ending for these people?</div>

It means you challenge the process that you take for granted. It does not have to come out induced. If you already agree, there's no point to disagree just because you want to be a non-conformist."<br><br>"So I have in mind my own career and within the Malay Muslim community - approaches that I've taken, it's always to challenge the process, challenging the status quo but there's no need to do it destructively."<br><br>The second candidate, and the fourth female one introduced so far, was 45-year-old Lee Bee Wah, who came from humble beginnings.<br><br>Her parents worked as rubber-tappers in a remote rubber plantation in Malacca.<br><br>Armed with a never-say-die attitude, Lee Bee Wah backpacked to Singapore in 1980 with just $20 from her father, determined to strike out on her own.<br><br>She says the poverty she experienced at childhood has toughened her resolve to level up through education - a cause she wants to champion for the underprivileged.<br><br>Ms Lee said: "The two topics that are always very close to my heart is education for children. That is something that I want to see - all children irrespective of their family background they should receive sufficient education so that their lives can improve. So we should look into ways and means to achieve that. And the other thing - I'd like to see more small and medium size enterprises to be successful, and bring them out of the country, venture abroad."<br><br>Ten years ago, Ms Lee founded her own property development company.<br><br>She is married with two children and has been actively involved in grassroots and social work over the last 6 years.<br><br>The NTU civil engineering graduate is also an avid Liverpool football fan.<br><br>The third candidate unveiled was 44-year-old Lee Yi Shyan, who had spent many years studying and working in China and the US.<br><br>Mr Lee had studied in Beijing's Tsinghua University as well as Harvard Business School, and is eloquent in both English and Mandarin.<br><br>Until his resignation on Sunday, he was the CEO of IE Singapore, who had helped local companies grow and venture abroad.<br><br>Now, he's setting his sights on helping Singaporeans understand and leverage on globalisation.<br><br>Mr Lee said: "I see great opportunities for Singapore firms. Also I sense a great deal of competition facing our workers. So I hope my international experience can in some way contribute to our desire to become and effective the node between the rising east and the west among the region as a hub and creating jobs and a bright future."<br><br>Mr Lee said being part of a team for a common mission is rewarding. And nothing tugs at his heart more than watching Singapore taking part in international or world-wide competition.<br><br>The future seems bright for Mr Lee.<br><br>According to PAP Chairman Lim Boon Heng, Mr Lee has the potential for higher office.<br><br>But for now, Mr Lee says he will devote his full attention to working the ground. - CNA/ch<br><br></div>

An active volunteer on humanitarian missions overseas, she is one of the recipients of this year's Outstanding Young Person Award.<br><br>She also served on several Residents' Committees in the Marine Parade constituency before 2002.<br><br>She believes her clinical experience in empathising with patients will help her embark on her new goal of helping Singaporeans achieve their aspirations.<br><br>While she gives the assurance that she will not shy from debating hot issues, she is also prepared to defend sound policies, such as the government's ban on explicit political discussions on the internet.<br><br>"There are certain policies, rules and regulations which may not always be very popular with the community. But there are certain things and actions that need to be taken, and people may not be aware of the long term consequences of such issues. So I think some regulations are certainly necessary and politics is something that should not be considered as entertainment," said PAP candidate Dr Fatimah.<br><br>The medical graduate from the National University of Singapore also lectures on emergency medicine at her alma mater.<br><br>The second candidate - 44-year-old Alvin Yeo Khirn Hai is the Managing Director of Wong Partnership. He is the fourth lawyer in the PAP's slate of new faces.<br><br>Married with two young children aged 9 and 5, Mr Yeo named education as one of his key concerns.<br><br>When he was 37, he was the youngest lawyer to be appointed Senior Counsel in Singapore.<br><br>Mr Yeo is active in the legal sector, serving as a Council Member of the Law Society.<br><br>He was also a member of the Legal Working Group of the Economic Review Committee which reported directly to Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.<br><br>An old boy of Anglo-Chinese School, Mr Yeo graduated in law from King's College, University of London<br><br>"I think my aspirations at this point is to be elected as MP and one should just take it one step at a time. The opposition sometimes have an easier tagline - vote us in and we'll check on the government. They check on the government and do what? What exactly are they going to change? I suppose part of the aim is to bring the debate on some sort of grounds, on what is wrong that needs to be fixed or changed," said PAP candidate Alvin Yeo.<br><br>"I mentioned education and I'd like to see less emphasis on rote learning but more emphasis on actual learning on how to think and getting the best of every individual. I tend to agree with Eng Hwa that there has been perhaps too much streaming," he added.<br><br>Mr Yeo's priority now is to gain experience in grassroots work.<br><br>The third candidate, 42-year-old Liang Eng Hwa rose from the ranks as a trainee officer with DBS Bank to become its Managing Director in 2003.<br><br>Mr Liang, who is married with three children, is active in grassroots work at Buona Vista.<br><br>This includes serving as Secretary of the Buona Vista Citizens Consultative Committee and Chairman of the YP Buona Vista PAP Branch.<br><br>The community leader was awarded the Public Service Medal in 2005.<br><br>Mr Liang has a Diploma in Civil Engineering from the Singapore Polytechnic, as well as Bachelor of Commerce from the University of Melbourne.<br><br>"Although I have taken a different path, I still benefited from the system in Singapore and from the social mobility. From my life experience, you can see that there is a second chance in Singapore if one is prepared to work hard for it and never to give up," said PAP candidate Liang Eng Hwa.<br><br>While he was not against the opposition, he questioned if it played a credible role in providing checks.<br><br>"Right now, PAP MPs and NMPs are the ones that really play that role in a more constructive way. From the ways we bring in different viewpoints from diverse background as members of Parliament, you will have robust debate there regardless if the opposition is there or not," said Liang<br><br>The sixth batch of candidates will be introduced on Friday. - CNA/de/ls<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>PAP introduces three more candidates for upcoming General Election</strong><br>By May Wong, Channel NewsAsia<br><br>SINGAPORE : The People's Action Party has introduced its next 3 candidates for the upcoming General Election - among them, a former civil servant with a strong bi-cultural background.<br><br>Two of them were familiar with Singapore's constant drive to stay ahead of the competition.<br><br>This brings to 18 the total number of candidates introduced so far. And more will be introduced at another news conference next Tuesday.<br><br>A former civil servant, 35-year-old Baey Yam Keng is familiar with Singapore's drive to promote economic investments as well as the arts scene.<br><br>That's because Mr Baey, a father of 3, was with the Economic Development Board, before joining the Information, Communications and the Arts Ministry.<br><br>This avid theatre buff has also tried his hand at theatre productions.<br><br>Mr Baey said the Singapore system has enabled him to progress, achieving different milestones in life.<br><br>He said: "Of course in the journey, some will run faster, some will be left behind. I view that it's the role of the government to let those who can run fast, to run as fast as they can but for those who are lagging behind, to give a helping hand.<br><br>"And we should also be looking at ways of different measures of success, of achievement in life, whether it's academic qualification, or a certain raw talent, or maybe just a simple belief.<br><br>"I think the government should really provide that environment for all these different diversities and differences to flourish in this society and that's how the society would move on and progress."<br><br>And helping the society progress through education and economic growth is what 42-year-old Grace Fu wants to do.<br><br>The mother of three is PSA International's Chief Executive Officer for Southeast Asia and Japan.<br><br>She feels strongly that every child should be given equal education opportunities.<br><br>But to have that, she says, there must be good policies to drive the economy in this competitive global environment - one she experienced personally when PSA had to retrench its staff to stay agile.<br><br>And she understands why certain decisions - like the development of the integrated resorts - have to be taken.<br><br>She said: "The IR is a very hotly debated topic and it probably cut through the hearts of many Singaporeans but personally from a part of a business community, the way I look at it, it shows the flexibility. It shows the flexibility on the government front, as I say, to seize the opportunities that come our way.<br><br>"I think that's very important. In this world, the momentum of change is increasing. And really the world will pass us by if we do not seize the moment. I think in the longer run, that's what we'll need.<br><br>"We'll need very quick decisions, carefully considered but it has to be done quickly and we must be nimble. We must question our policies, our regulations, what we can do better. Personally from the business community's perspective, I think there's still a lot can be done on the cost of doing business in Singapore."<br><br>The third candidate is 36-year-old Lam Pin Min.<br><br>The father of two girls is an eye surgeon and consultant at the KK Women's and Children's Hospital.<br><br>Dr Lam was involved in many humanitarian missions like leading a medical contingent to East Timor and has been active in community work for the past 5 years.<br><br>The experience, he says, opened his eyes to the plight of poorer Singaporeans.<br><br>He said: "All of us come from different backgrounds, diverse backgrounds. And when the party look for potential candidates, they have to assess the candidates very carefully, in terms of certain qualities, virtues.<br><br>"You don't just select somebody who is different so that you can answer to the voters, 'oh, we have someone different', but whether this fellow can contribute to the Singapore society.<br><br>"What has he done? What can he contribute? What can he do in the future for Singaporeans? I think that's important. It's not just doing something different so you can answer to voters' criticism."<br><br>Aside from being active in community work in Radin Mas, Dr Lam is also a Councillor on the Central Singapore Community Development Council.<br><br>And he is a founding member and director of Compass Welfare Foundation, a voluntary welfare organisation set up to look after the welfare and needs of the sick and elderly poor.<br><br>The medical graduate from the National University of Singapore also has a Master in Ophthalmology. - CNA/ch<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by gerrykoh:</div><div class="quote_body">Lawyers are very smart, they can make white becomes black</div></blockquote>How true is your observation lawyers are too smart for the people. When people elect too many lawyers they are going to encounter certain undesirable consequences. Instead of getting them to serve the people, they may perceive knowingly or subconsciously people as their adversaries like in the litigation cases and get embroiled in putting up all kinds of legalistic controls and gerrymandering to give themselves more power, and more control and more legal and administrative rights over the people.<br><br>The citizens will be legalistically controlled over time with all kinds of laws and penalties passed and eventually losing their rights because the legal gerrymander of the system and the constitution..<br><br>Lawyers may not be the kind of MPs we should have to serve us. When they mismanage or neglect their duties, people will have to contend with their litigious mindset and will have difficulty to get them to empathise and listen and accept their mistakes. They will not admit their mistakes as has happened so often in the past in many cases of major policy errors or highway collapse or overcharging of fees.<br><br>This negativism of lawyers are attributable to their training which is to argue and defend whatever are their actions for their own interest or party interest. This is what has happened to letting a lawyer to run the country.<br><br>As lawyers they are not concerned with welfare, welbeings, right or wrong but to defend their own interests and the interests of their own clients and party.<br><br>Eventually when we have too many lawyers among the ministers, we would not end up creating a more creative and entrepreneurial economy but a litigious country where the lawyers would keep preempting antagonistic legislations and controls to tackle the people regarding them as adversaries like the litigation cases in court.<br><br>As a result of too many lawyers in the government we are now a legalistically controlled society where the original one-man-one-vote election system is changed into the one-man-no-vote or one-man-block-vote GRC system to prevent the oppositions from contesting, fairly in the election.<br><br>The Sedition Act will be amended like the GRC through gerrymandering to make it look like there is a lot of mischief going on in the private blogs or website when actually it is only a normal part of growing up of a nation.</div>

I cannot give you a percentage and say that is a good result because the people will have to decide.'<br><br>He gave two reasons why this will be a watershed election.<br><br>First: It will be Mr Lee Hsien Loong's first since becoming Prime Minister in August 2004.<br><br>Second: It will send to Parliament a fresh team to run Singapore for the next decade and this called for the best team to tackle challenges ahead and seize opportunities.<br><br>'Prime Minister Lee and his team will therefore need the strong endorsement of the people to support him and his team, and together we will be able to give Singaporeans a better life,' Mr Wong said.<br><br>Mr Wong, who is the PAP's first assistant secretary-general, was speaking at a press conference to introduce the party's seventh batch of new candidates.<br><br>Among them were two long-time party activists - Jalan Besar branch secretary Lim Biow Chuan, 43, a lawyer, and chairman of Young PAP north-east district Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim, 38, a university lecturer.<br><br>The third was Mrs Josephine Teo, 38, the director of human resources at the National Trades Union Congress.<br><br>So far, the party has named 21 new candidates, including seven women, the same number as in 2001.<br><br>A final batch of new faces is expected tomorrow.<br><br>The next step: announcing the party manifesto, which Mr Wong hinted could be as early as this week.<br><br>PAP MPs interviewed yesterday were optimistic that Mr Wong's expectations could be met on polling day.<br><br>Madam Halimah Yacob (Jurong GRC) said: 'Our new PM has worked hard and the people have responded well with him.' She expected that to translate into votes.<br><br>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Holland-Bukit Panjang GRC) also felt that the party had been doing more to connect with the ground through various activities.<br><br>Opposition leader and Non-Constituency MP Steve Chia however felt that Mr Wong was being unrealistic.<br><br>'I will advise him to lower his expectations. He should be thankful and grateful if the PAP can get 62 per cent,' he said.<br><br>Nanyang Technological University political scientist Ho Khai Leong thought that a 75 per cent margin of support would be exceptional anywhere.<br><br>PAP leaders had been saying as much, he noted, and felt that Mr Wong's latest statement now showed greater confidence.<br><br>'The PAP may feel it has done enough to sweeten the ground with the Progress Package (of Budget surplus payouts) and its new candidates to win the support of the people,' he said.<br><br>Still, he felt that hitting close to a margin of 75 per cent would be 'very difficult to achieve'.<br><br>Senior research fellow Gillian Koh of the Institute of Policy Studies said: 'It is a very high target to meet. In 2001, the country was facing a recession and there was the threat of terrorism. In that climate of fear, voters went with the tried and tested.'<br><br>But noting that the economy is doing very well, she said voters might decide to reward the PAP with strong support.<br><br>National University of Singapore political scientist Antonio Rappa said it was hard to make predictions on the margin of victory, but thought it 'plausible' that voters might hand the PAP a handsome victory.<br><br>'If they look, on balance, at how they have been treated and have benefited from the economy in recent years, and the political stability, they have every reason to return the PAP to power with such a high margin,' he said.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The requests by Teo Chee Hean, Ng Eng Hen and Wong Kan Seng and co to the opposition to 'reveal' their candidates to get scrutinised is bemusing.<br><br>Obviously, they know if the people scrutinise the PAP CANDIDATES, what they will find are 'spotless' track records. Left to our own resources, there is no way we can truly unearth past blemishes to question.<br><br>But with the resources of the ruling party, how difficult will it be to dig up the simplest dirt on an opposition to smear his election campaign and discredit them?<br><br>The worry is how far-fetched an insecure party would exaggerate and blow-up a small blemish on a opposition candidate.</div>
