            <div class='col-md body'>An article written by Chua Mui Hoong was rather daming of the 3 candidates, by Straits Times Standard. Below is a section that stands out:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="color: darkred;">Quizzed on their political views, the three candidates, alas, retreated to textbook answers. For example, they were asked their views on a Straits Times survey of young voters which found that 40 per cent cited political freedom as one issue that would sway their vote. They were also asked if they thought it desirable to have more opposition in Parliament.<br><br>Mr Zaqy's reply was that it all depended on how freedom was defined.<br><br>Dr Lim thought having more opposition was not a priority. 'Within the PAP itself, there's a self-checking system,' he said, adding that while monopoly of power tended to corrupt, 'thank goodness, I think that has not happened over here' as 'honesty is one of the values of the PAP'.<br><br>What checks does the PAP have? Dr Lim referred to the government parliamentary committees where PAP MPs debate policies and the systematic attempt to solicit feedback on policies. 'There's always consultation going on,' he said.<br><br>While desirable, having consultation on policies is surely not the same as having constitutional checks and balances on the Government - but this was not a point that he chose to finesse over.<br><br>As for Ms Phua, she observed that Singapore could not afford to waste time on internal politicking as regional economies moved ahead, seemingly subscribing to the view articulated by some that democracy, with its debate and jostling for power, is a waste of time that detracts from the real work of government.<br><br>Even the issues they said they want to push for are <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>all within the PAP's radar screens</strong></span>, such as Dr Lim on devoting more resources to children from low-income families and Mr Zaqy on bridging the gap between policy and implementation.<br><br>What little they revealed about their views on political issues was generally pro-status quo, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>even conformist </strong></span>at times.</span></span><br><br>Zaqy cannot give direct answers, Dr Lim thinks everything can be defined from a doctor's 'consultation' perspective and Ms Phua feels we're WASTING TIME POLITICKING when overseas opportunities beckon.<br><br>If Lim Boon Heng want to unveil 'non-conformists' candidates to sell the idea that we don't need any opposition party representation in Parliament because the PAP members themselves will offer alternative voices and ideas, then he better do <strong><span style="color: brown;">MUCH BETTER </span></strong>with the next set of candidates then these 3 wishy-washy robots.<br></div>
