              <p><strong>NTU censors campus news coverage of Chee Soon Juan visit</strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Terence Lee / Youth Editor</span></strong></p>
              <p><img class="alignleft" style="border: 3px solid black; margin: 13px; float: left;" src="http://i140.photobucket.com/albums/r19/theonlinecitizen/Pictures%20Posted%20on%20TOC/Opposition%20Civil%20Society/SDP/csj.jpg" alt="" width="220" height="160"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Dr
              Chee Soon Juan created a whirlwind when he paid a surprise visit to
              NTU, but left behind only a whimper as the university censored all
              campus news coverage of his arrival.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">The latest issue of NTU’s campus newspaper, <a href="http://www3.ntu.edu.sg/chronicle/">The Nanyang Chronicle</a> , was published on Monday (15<sup>th</sup> September), and was slated to feature an article about Dr Chee’s visit.
              In the end, it featured only a visit of a different sort – that of the
              former President of India, Dr APJ Abdul Kalam, who is a stranger among
              Singaporean students.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">On 26<sup>th</sup> August, the controversial opposition figure, together with several
              other Singapore Democratic Party (SDP) leaders, visited NTU to
              distribute flyers and interact with the students. The NTU visit was
              part of a tour by the SDP to “raise political awareness,” and it
              included NIE, SMU and NUS as well. The NUS visit, which happened on 11<sup>th</sup> September, was covered by the university’s student-run online newspaper, <a href="http://campus-observer.org/content/view/184/33/">The Campus Observer</a> .</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Student journalists from the Chronicle and NTU’s student-run news magazine programme, <a href="http://www3.ntu.edu.sg/sci/showcase/spectrumtv.htm">Nanyang Spectrum</a> , were quick to converge on Dr Chee and the SDP members to conduct interviews.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Mr Philip Lim,
              23, head of Nanyang Spectrum, was in-charge of producing the news clip
              for Dr Chee’s visit. Equipped with a video camera, he was on-site to
              document his visit, but he had trouble finding students to interview. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">“This has never
              occurred to me before, even after many months on Spectrum. I suspect
              it’s due to the sensitivity of the topic,” he said.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">He also recalled
              how some students whom he spoke to did not know who Dr Chee was.
              “Someone even asked me if he was the national table tennis coach who
              just got sacked!” he added. The question, in fact, is a misnomer; the
              coach in question, Mr Liu Guodong, is in talks to renew his contract
              with the Singapore Table Tennis Association to help prepare the
              national team for the 2012 London Olympics.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">However, any
              excitement that their news items would appear on print or screen died
              down quickly. Mr Lim recalled how he had to remove two out of the three
              soundbites he planned to use, after some advice from his professors.
              Further edits were made thereafter, until he felt it was “neutral
              enough already.” </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Despite these
              measures, the episode was shown for less than three days before the
              university’s corporate communications department ordered the episode to
              be taken off-the-air for good.</span></p>
              <p><img class="alignleft" style="border: 3px solid black; margin: 13px; float: left;" src="http://i140.photobucket.com/albums/r19/theonlinecitizen/Pictures%20Posted%20on%20TOC/Education/chronicle1220.jpg" alt="" width="220" height="160"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">The article slated for the Nanyang Chronicle was also axed. (<em>Picture, left: The in-house advertisement that was created to replace the Chee Soon Juan story.</em>)
              After much negotiation between the paper’s teacher-advisors and the
              university, NTU president Su Guaning gave the article the go-ahead.
              However, he changed his mind at the last minute, and the article was
              removed just one day before the newspaper’s publication on Monday (15<sup>th</sup> September). Many of the student editors at the Chronicle were clearly indignant when they learnt about this.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">One of them, 3<sup>rd</sup> year communications studies student Cheryl Ong, 21 — who is also the Chronicle’s news editor — wrote on her blog: <span style="color: black;">“The
              reason given for the censorship left a bad taste in my mouth. I can’t
              really talk about what my teacher told us, because it was mostly his
              conjecture—’They’ have yet to tell us the official reason.”</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">She also wrote how “a number of journalism students were rather disgruntled” when the incident transpired. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Chief editor Lin
              Junjie, 23, said that while they “do not necessarily agree with all
              executive decisions made by the owner or the publisher”, their
              journalists have “done their best” to cover every story, including the
              one that was censored.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">“The situation wasn’t within our control as we’re funded by them,” he said.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">According to
              Associate Professor Benjamin Detenber, Chair of NTU’s Wee Kim Wee
              School of Communication and Information (WKWSCI), which runs both
              campus media, the university’s position is that the story was killed
              because “there was a feeling of concern over the use of student media
              to publicise and promote the unsolicited views of an uninvited person
              to the campus.”</span></p>
              <p><img class="alignleft" style="border: 3px solid black; margin: 13px; float: left;" src="http://i140.photobucket.com/albums/r19/theonlinecitizen/Pictures%20Posted%20on%20TOC/Education/C2B220.jpg" alt="" width="220" height="160"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">But
              22-year-old NTU student Naresh Ethan Subhash, who is currently studying
              film, remained highly critical. He said: “I’m really frustrated. Being
              university students, we are people who can think for ourselves. If they
              want to create an institution of higher education, censoring the campus
              media is totally unacceptable.”</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">However, Mr Sng
              Weiliang, a 22 year-old business student, offered another perspective:
              “I guess they feel that younger people tend to be more myopic, that’s
              why they want to prevent us from being influenced.”</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Literature student Elaine Lee, 20, felt that the censorship questions the student’s analytical ability. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">“If we aren’t exposed to anything, how can we be expected to gauge one political view from another?” she added. </span></p>

              <p>This is quite hilarious.</p>
                      <p> </p>
                      <p>On one hand,comments have been made in the past on Singapore tertiary students being pure muggers and not having any creativity or opinion of their own.On the other,we have the university administration stifling the creative and honest efforts of their student reporters.</p>
                      <p> </p>
                      <p>One would expect a world class educational institute to want its students to be more exposed and proactive to current affairs both locally and worldwide.To nuture them into thinking people who are able to formulate their own reasoning where any biases are based on actual facts that have been researched.Afterall,aren't these students the FUTURE LEADERS of Singapore?</p>
                      <p> </p>
                      <p>Just what is NTU trying to put across to their students?</p>
                      <p> </p>
                      <p>Views are to be made on invitation only or else STFU?Some views are correct but others are wrong?For their reputation's sake,I hope it wasn't the latter.</p>
                      <p> </p>
                      <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">“there was a feeling of concern over the use of student media to publicise and promote the unsolicited views of an uninvited person to the campus.”</span></p>
                      <p> </p>
                      <p>Exactly whose concern was that?The student body,the school administration only(without input from their students) or some mysterious entity?
                      </p><p> </p>
                      <p>NUS or/&amp; SMU might have similiar protocols for their student press too so we cannot blame NTU only for following in the footsteps of others if such is the case.</p>
