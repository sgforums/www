I am not paid millions to think out a solution for that.<br><br>In fact, those paid with millions can't even solve this basic problem, and they still deem themselves successful?<br><br>Either way, the trick to this rubbish dump of a city, is to be<br>(1) self-sufficient, don't even bother about the govt<br>(2) go against their very policies, like how I go to a company that don't heed their stupid idea of low pay, high bonuses (when actually, the bonuses aren't high at all in singapore companies. More likely, its low pay, low bonuses)<br><br>So I detach myself from their silly propaganda, and my life's much better now.<br><br>In the Singapore company, they work you like a slave, telling you how hard the world out there is, that they are already very nice. When you leave, and you TRULY go out into the world, you realized that the world is much more beautiful and life's much better, that you realized they had cheated and lied for the few years you were in that place.<br><br>Only thing is...
