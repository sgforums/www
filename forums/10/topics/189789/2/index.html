            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by caramon.:</div><div class="quote_body">The support, no matter how small, is his daily driving force. However, I don't think singaporeans deserve him. A whole ungrateful lot. I sometimes wonder if Singaporeans are worth fighting for. If there is one man who can topple this Government, it's DR CHEE SOON JUAN. That, I've absolutely no doubt.<br></div></blockquote>That's a point I certainly agree with - Singaporeans, holistically, are a bunch of daft ingrates who simply aren't worth the time of anyone(and I include honest, albeit foolishly ineffective, people who run for the opposition in that assessment) trying to give them another option. In any other healthy democracy, it'd be appalling to even imagine the ruling party winning sufficient seats to be empowered to change their constitutions at a whim!<br><br>That said, I think there're a few points about Chee's approach which are questionable - questionable not because they are wrong, just that they aren't(and will never be) effective when applied in the wrong context. For starters, the SDP members who share Chee's ideology are better off being a civil society group/political activists(including being an underground one if need be) because quite simply, their stance(helped in no small part by the fascist press' manipulation) will simply not get them anywhere at the polls - let's face it, you don't fight for freedom and democracy in elections in a state whose politics are teetering closer to what's preached in North Korea than the US. And civil disobedience is such an abstract concept to Singaporeans at large that 90% of the population would probably understand it no better than rocket science - I think it's just self-defeating to aspire to restore democracy in Singapore on one hand, yet put themselves through the same electoral process they have rightly condemned as a dead-end with regards to having any realistic chance of reforming the political system.<br><br>Personally, I am not convinced Chee actually understands the framework and circumstances under which Civil Disobedience needs to function under - for starters, he doesn't even have the sort of support Ghandhi and Walesa had when they inspired hordes to eventually overthrow the British and the Communists respectively. I don't see any hope of a political reform by democratic means anyway and Chee's concepts and ideas are certainly on the right track, but for him to succeed, he'll have to be able to reach out more effectively(inspite of the constraints he faces, of course) to more people to get his message across and establish his base before he can even dream of putting his ideas into practice. Chee certainly needs to understand selling his message across to the average Joe(most of whom do not understand his politics anyway) and plain Janes are as essential as selling them to the intellectuals who have little problem identifying with what he is driving at - but comprehend the rudimentary logic that in any democracy, an idiot will have as much power as an intellectual to determine the kind of system he/she wants to live in. So long as he doesn't reach out to sufficient average Joes and plain Janes, I just can't see his campaign being kickstarted regardless of how tough a stand the fascists take against him. Afterall, few(if any) non-democracies were ever toppled by democratic means in the 20th Century.<br><br>For me, two revolutionary pro-democratic movements in the 20th Century clearly stand out, illustrating the contrasting consequences of doing the same thing under grave and grossly different circumstances - the Solidarnosc movement and the Tiananmen incident. On close scrutiny of the two events, it's really not hard to understand how Walesa was able to inspire - helped in no small part by Pope John Paul II and Mikhail Gorbachev in the later years of his movement admittedly - a revolution which eventually swept across the Eastern bloc and realised the previously unimaginable reality of living in a world with the absence of the 'mighty' USSR. I doubt there was a better organised non-violent revolution on a scale as grand as that of Solidarnosc in recent memory. The Tiananmen revolution, on the other hand, failed miserably not just because of the Chinese authorities' heavy-handed approach to dealing with the protesters - ultimately, I thought the lack of unity and common purpose amongst the protesters and various groups fighting for different interests made their efforts self-defeating. Clearly, these 2 events serve as prime examples of how similar movements hoping to achieve the same goals(albeit with slightly different measures) met with such different fates despite the fact Solidarnosc actually started off on a much more modest scale and had infinitely fewer people than the quarter-million who packed Tianmen Square in June '89.<br><br>At best, I'd liken Chee to spearheading a disorganised, disunited group(and a minority at that) at the Tiananmen protests. At worst, he's just a lunatic ranting and raving on the streets who speaks a language the average chap can barely comprehend. If he's to succeed with his civil disobedience efforts, I think he'd be better off first taking a leaf out of Ghandhi/Walesa's book and understand the fact he will not succeed without sufficient support so as not do something in vain, much less for a bunch of daft ingrates...</div>

And whoever equated an increase in political awareness with having anything to do with voting against the incumbents? If your logic was anything to go by, then obviously the Americans and the British at large have had a decrease in political awareness considering how often the incumbents have been voted back to power over the last half-century! In which case, clearly having decrease in political awareness can't be bad at all considering the progress they have both made over the last 50 years.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Carry on with the rhetoric of choosing 'wisely' and ram home the point the threadstarter initiated which I concurred with : CSJ is simply running his head into a wall with his planned policies given the intellect of a vast majority of those who have had an 'increase' in political awareness!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br></div>
