            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Siok Chin,<br><br>It is with much sadness that I am unable to join you and the other speakers on stage. It is even harder not to be able to be there to speak up for my fellow Singaporeans who continue to be oppressed and exploited by the heartless policies of the PAP.<br><br>I don't know of any country where ministers lavish themselves with million dollar salaries while the people find life such a struggle and our elderly continue to have to work even as their arching bones cry out for help.<br><br>This is wrong, very wrong.<br><br>I have seen the weary faces and the empty eyes of our fellow citizens, and I understand how much they long for some rest.<br><br>This is why I constantly think about how we can bring justice to Singaporeans whom our government is supposed to serve but has instead exploited.<br><br>With the election system and the media controlled by the PAP, it is extremely difficult for Singaporeans to let the PAP know their views. Elections in Singapore are a farce.<br><br>This is why I strongly believe that we need to reform our political system so that the media will reflect the people's views and not just be the lapdog of the PAP, and so that that the elections will be an accurate gauge of the people's anger towards the ruling party.<br><br>At the moment, everything is designed to make the PAP look good and for it to retain overwhelming control of Parliament regardless of how the people feel.<br><br>But this is also precisely the reason Â– because of our calling for reform Â– that the PAP and its media are running this vicious campaign against the SDP and ESPECIALLY the SDP.<br><br>There are hardly any fair reports about our campaign even though we have raised many questions that the people are concerned about. And yet, it is only too happy to constantly portray the party in disarray so as to make sure that it inflicts maximum damage on the party that calls for reform.<br><br>But this is why the SDP must persevere and continue to push for reform in our country so that ultimately our people have a true voice in our nation's affairs.<br><br>I have been made a bankrupt and I have been jailed. But that will not deter me from standing up for my people. Why? Because I was born Singaporean and I will remain Singaporean till the day I die.<br><br>People ask me why I don't leave this country and look for a better life elsewhere. If I do that, the PAP wins. If the PAP wins, the people lose. I will not let the people lose.<br><br>I will always be there to fight for them Â– always.<br><br>I thank everyone of you for working so hard in this campaign and I wish all my fellow Singaporeans the very best in life.<br><br>Chee Soon Juan<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dr. Sun was born as Sun Wen in 1866 in the coastal village Tsuihsiang of Hsianshan County, Kwangtung Province, and later changed his name, first to Sun Yat-sen and, later, during his revolutionary days in Japan, to Sun Chung-shan. Raised in a poor farming family, Dr. Sun learned the hardships of working life at an early age and always sympathized with the people's hardships.<br><br>To carry out democratic revolution in China, Sun founded the Society for Regenerating China and the Revolutionary Alliance and extensively studied the political systems of European countries and America in formulating the Three Principles of the People: Nationalism, Democracy, and Social Well-being. After failing on several attempts to unite the people to revolt, Sun finally succeeded with the Wuch'ang Uprising on October 10, 1911, leading to the successful overthrow of the Ch'ing government and the establishment of the Republic of China.<br><br>Dr. Sun devoted his life to realizing this dream, leaving behind, with his death in 1925, a lasting contribution to his nation and an invaluable legacy for scholars and thinkers. This legacy includes Sun's outline and strategy for nation-founding and the Three Principles of the People.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The 2006 election results were a disappointment, especially how it turned out in Aljunied, but I canÂ’t say IÂ’m particularly surprised. It was very expected. I attended most AP rallies, including that tear-inducing National Pledge moment in Serangoon, and witnessed for myself the amazing scenes in Hougang on Mayday, but something within me kept biting away and brought me down to earth, constantly reminding me that the results were never going to be much different from 2001, and Aljunied will never be lost by the ruling party. I was right.<br><br>I think the Singapore Democratic Party is the most credible opposition party in Singapore. Why do I say that? Because theyÂ’re the only real advocates of democracy in this country. The party under Dr Chee has a crystal direction Â– just give us democracy and we wonÂ’t bother you anymore.<br><br>Singapore politics can only be saved by that one word - DEMOCRACY. There can be no other way. Only when power is returned to the people can this country move forward.<br><br>In order to bring about total democracy, there has to be a few vital elements in place, in a particular order. Let me explain.<br><br>The fundamental principle of democracy is the role of individual citizens to exercise his or her right in the running of their own country. In its simplest form, this is known as HUMAN RIGHTS.<br><br>One of the most crucial components of human rights is FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION.<br><br>If there exists a freedom to express, then FREEDOM OF PRESS will be the automatic by-product. The media will be liberated and become independent of external political powers by any one body. I think it is easy to underestimate the importance of this element, but the power of the media is all-pervasive. The media has the ability to sway absolute public opinion, which is all that is needed to win an election. He who controls the media will win. ItÂ’s that simple, because Singaporeans are simple.<br><br>Once FREEDOM OF PRESS is achieved, free flow of information will ensure the masses become politically aware. ItÂ’s known as public education (a tool that the Internet is performing very well in).<br><br>Once the public becomes sufficiently aware, political maturity will develop. And once the people become politically savvy, where everyone has an opinion (like in America, the motherland of all things democratic), no amount of sueing, arresting, discrediting or GRC re-structuring will then stop Singaporeans from voting out the ruling party.<br><br>Once the ruling party is voted out, political restructuring will take place and power will return to the people. Case in point: when something unjust happens, public outrage will be triggered and the natural reaction from a vibrant and politically mature society would be to stage non-violent protests. ItÂ’s a product of every individualÂ’s right to FREEDOM OF ASSEMBLY.<br><br>Result of all these elements coming together at once? Democracy.<br><br>Now, do you notice a common denominator in all of the capped terms I have used above?<br><br>If you have read any of Dr Chee Soon JuanÂ’s books (Your Future, My Faith, Our Freedom; To Be Free; The Power of Courage), youÂ’ll be smiling and nodding along with me by now. All that I have mentioned above are the core values that Dr Chee has been trying to advocate throughout his political career. I am proud to say that I have read all three of his books from cover to cover, and if there is one conclusion I have drawn from the personal insights I have gathered, it is this Â– THIS MAN KNOWS WHAT THE HELL HEÂ’S DOING.<br><br>While other opposition parties (the WorkersÂ’ Party included) focus their strategies extensively on tip-toeing along the undemocratic boundaries put in place by their very opponents and trying to gain ground (significant or not), the Singapore Democratic Party sets out deliberately to DEMOLISH these barriers. The reason why opposition parties will never win a GRC is because no political party will ever be able to win in such conditions. Notice that this isnÂ’t an opinion Â– this is a statement. The PAP will MAKE SURE disaster never happens. They have the power to, because they make up the all rules.<br><br>Dr Chee, all this while, has been trying to drill into the core of the corruption and REFORM the system, because heÂ’s intelligent to acknowledge that the only way to remove these rules is to BREAK them. What are other opposition parties gunning for? More members of the opposition in Parliament?<br><br>Dr Chee isnÂ’t interested in that, because having mere "alternative voices" do not bring about true democracy Â– what this country needs is a BRAND NEW VOICE. Hiring first class graduates and law lecturers to make the opposition seem more "credible" to the people? How on earth can you hope to achieve that and sway public opinion when you donÂ’t even have freedom of press to communicate the message that you want?<br><br>Why do you think Dr Chee is always speaking out in public "without a permit" (freedom of expression)? Why do you think the SDP protested outside the CPF building (freedom of assembly)? Why do you think he was the main advocate against the hanging of Nguyen Toung Van together with M. Ravi (Human Rights)?<br><br>The simple reason is that any rule that hints at going against his democratic beliefs, you can be sure heÂ’ll be there to fight it. The party is communicating a very important message Â– not a desire to enter Parliament to talk about upgrading.<br><br>People say Dr Chee slams the government for the sake of it. If you think about it, can you blame him? All the principles he believes in, the PAP tries its utmost to put down. TheyÂ’re directly opposite poles Â– one seeks to return absolute power back to the people, the other will do anything to keep that power.<br><br>While other opposition parties seek to enter Parliament through the votes of the people, Dr Chee deliberately fights the war head-on against his opponents, disregarding the popular opinion of the general public. This would be why he is extremely disliked by the masses.<br><br>With all due respect to the current opposition slate in the country, who has, to their absolute credit, toiled endlessly trying to end the regime, theyÂ’re playing themselves right into their opponentsÂ’ traps. Singapore is an ANARCHY. The election process is a farce and the more opposition parties try to contest seats, the happier the PAP will be. "There you go," theyÂ’ll say. "We have elections. ItÂ’s democracy". ItÂ’s not.<br><br>All IÂ’m trying to say is that, if any of the opposition camps were to continue participating in elections the way theyÂ’re currently run, none of them will have any chance of garnering any headway towards political advancement. IÂ’ll need to repeat this again Â– YOUÂ’RE PLAYING THE GAME WITHIN RULES SET BY YOUR OPPONENTS.<br><br>If theyÂ’re unfair rules, youÂ’re screwed. Even if you win, you lose because your opponents say so. ItÂ’s in the rules and itÂ’s just been drawn up, they will say. How can you ever expect to win in these conditions? IsnÂ’t all just a royal waste of everyoneÂ’s time?<br><br>The only solution is to BREAK THOSE BLOODY RULES and establish new and fair ones. If need be, call in a neutral umpire and let them decide how the game should be played. To this end, Dr Chee is doing everything he can to get the international community involved Â– heÂ’s taking pain to build up a global name for himself so that the world can sit up and take notice of the atrocities that is the PAP; not because heÂ’s a "foreign traitor" but because he knows he canÂ’t break the system from within.<br><br>Those in power need to be OVERTHROWN. Not re-represented, not "checked and balanced", but OVERTHROWN. The usual excuses of "oh, politics is long-haul and Rome isnÂ’t built in a day", or "his confrontational style doesnÂ’t connect with Singaporeans" donÂ’t hold water, because if he fought a democratic war that way, then the country will never be liberalized.<br><br>Gandhi, Aung San Suu Kyi, Martin Luther King Â– these liberalists have demonstrated before us that the only way to win a democratic battle against tyrants is to fight with them wearing your heart on your sleeves. The only way to overthrow a tyrant is to play with them at their own game.<br><br>Dr Chee is like Christ. HeÂ’s on the verge of being crucified by the very people he has been trying to save. He could walk away, but he doesnÂ’t. The citizens heÂ’s trying to liberate are throwing rocks at him and calling him a lunatic at the same time. If I were him I would have given up within the first week.<br><br>Imagine how much he had to go through for our sake Â– how many of us would have put ourselves, let alone our family, through these series of odeals? How many of us would have chose jail terms over a cushy job in a national University? How many of us would have the courage to take on a 40-year regime all by yourself?<br><br>HeÂ’s, to put it mildly, our only remaining salvation. Once he throws in the towel and leaves the country, weÂ’ll be screwed for the next generation and beyond. This man is the only remaining threat to Lee Kuan YewÂ’s power and there is no clearer indication of that than the obsession of the ruling party to demolish him at all costs.<br><br>If you were Lee Kuan Yew, would you seek out to eliminate him? I know I would. Low Thia Khiang and Chiam See Tong are grassroots leaders from the ground up and their priority is in serving the people in the wards theyÂ’re in Â– theyÂ’re not direct threats to Lee Kuan YewÂ’s power.<br><br>In fact theyÂ’re needed in Parliament to maintain that faÃ§ade of democracy and shield off some of the heat generated by the international community. Dr Chee is more than a direct threat Â– he wants to remove power from Lee. That is why he has to be destroyed.<br><br>He is our only hope. If we donÂ’t want to help, the least we can do is to cheer him on.<br></div>
