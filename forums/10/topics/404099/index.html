              <p><strong>By LIM SUE GOAN</strong></p>
              <p><strong></strong><br><em>Translated by SOONG PHUI JEE</em></p>
              <p>A friend from China jokingly said that Singapore would be led by Chinese immigrants 50 or 100 years from now.</p>
              <p>Such a scenario may actually be possible. Chinese immigrants can now be found everywhere in Singapore and over a third of its five million population are said to be foreigners.</p>
              <p>Singapore is facing a population ageing problem. Its fertility rate is lower than its population replacement rate. Hence, the Singapore government has to bring in immigrants and foreign workers to support its economic development. The Singapore government has always adopted the pragmatic approach in the interest of the country.</p>
              <p>According to Singapore’s founding father Lee Kuan Yew, Singaporeans have become less hard-driving and hard-striving.</p>
              <p>He said that if native Singaporeans are falling behind because the spurs are not stuck into the hide, that is their problem.</p>
              <p>Chinese immigrate to Singapore to look for a better life and they will sure work hard even in a discriminated environment, so that their children can receive a better education.</p>
              <p>Together with the low fertility rate of Singaporeans, a child of Chinese immigrants could possibily become the country's prime minister within two or three generations.</p>
              <p>The increasing number of Chinese immigrants has caused unhappiness among some native Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>It was reported that when a Singaporean young woman was complaining tearfully to her daughter in a train about her husband who had a secret affair with a Chinese immigrant woman, she called her "a Chinese bitch". But a Chinese immigrant woman sitting next to her thought she was referring to her. As a result, they had a shouting match for 30 minutes.</p>
              <p>The serious contradictions between Singaporean citizens and foreign immigrants were a result of the country's policies. The people have to bear the consequences of their choice to accept Chinese immigrants. Similar to its liberal economic, conservative politics system, it brings both positive and negative impact.</p>
              <p>Although Singapore enjoys a prosperous economy, it is not a perfect country. A Singaporean who received the Malaysian Association of Chinese Newspaper Editors representatives said: "You (Malaysian Chinese Newspapers) always praise Singapore but we don't think our country is so good." He cited the flood in Orchard Road and the escape of a terrorist as shameful events to have happened in the country.</p>
              <p>It is a justified view. The Singapore government is too pragmatic, causing people to think that there is too much of intervention in their life. Thus, many Singaporeans think they have everything and the country is safe, but life is boring.</p>
              <p>Take the casinos as an example, Singapore has a good control mechanism as even small cards are placed at toilets in the casinos to remind the people to stay away from gambling.</p>
              <p>But allowing the operation of casinos is actually a test for human nature. It may not bring any social problem in a few months time but the society will have to pay the price a few years later, or when Kuan Yew is no longer around.</p>
              <p>Similarly, the society is very open to allow topless shows, but its politics is being tightly controlled. An overly controlled country will face difficulties in finding qualified political successors. Kuan Yew's set of political thinking may be a disaster to the country once he is no longer around to make correct judgments.</p>
              <p>Any system will have its advantages and disadvantages. Singaporeans must bear the consequences of their choices. It applies to Malaysia that pursues racial politics.</p>

              <p>There is continuef high rate of migration from China despite its prosperity.

              <p>Spore gover is well aware of these facts of China and one of the immigration policy is to offer PR to PRC chinese who need only to proof ownership to an investment anywhere in China. Many Chinese invested in spore bond or unit trust just to obtain PR.</p>
              <p>I am very sure that sg has given more PR over the years because it will attract these rich PRC to transfer part of their weath to Sg. With no special skill or business opportunities that the PRC 'FT" who can compete with local spore, these ppl will invest in property and shares. With continued rise in property price and resales HDB, this policy of allowing PRC immigration will hurt the ordinary Sg who will compete with 'FT' on house, jobs, lowering salary and higher living cost.

              <p><strong>L'Oreal fraud trial adjourned amid growing tax scandal</strong></p>
              <p>A French court has indefinitely adjourned the trial of photographer Francois-Marie Banier (photo), the man accused of defrauding L'Oreal heiress Liliane Bettencourt, saying it needed time to examine new evidence linking Bettencourt to a tax scandal.</p>
              <p><strong>AFP</strong> - A French court on Thursday halted indefinitely the trial of a photographer accused of defrauding France's richest woman after the case got tangled up in a political scandal.</p>
              <p>Celebrity photographer Francois-Marie Banier, 63, went on trial accused by the daughter of L'Oreal cosmetics heiress Liliane Bettencourt of cheating her aging mother out of one billion euros (1.2 billion dollars).</p>
              <p>The court adjourned the case so that judges could examine sensitive new evidence: secret recordings of Bettencourt talking to aides, which sparked a scandal that has embarrassed the French government.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Defence lawyer Herve Temime said Banier could not get a fair trial in what he called a "nauseating and impossible" case, tainted by the political scandal and the clandestine recordings.</p>
              <p>"Is it any less nauseating that a man exploits a woman and profits from her?" responded Olivier Metzner, lawyer for daughter Francoise Bettencourt-Meyers who brought the case against Banier.</p>
              <p>French media last month published details of telephone conversations secretly recorded by Bettencourt's butler, which allegedly revealed she was plotting to evade taxes on her huge fortune.</p>
              <p>Temime complained to the court at Nanterre, west of Paris, that the tapes had been leaked to media before they were shown to trial lawyers. "We no longer have the conditions for a fair trial," he said.</p>
              <p>Presiding judge Isabelle Prevost-Desprez adjourned the trial indefinitely so she could carry out a "complementary investigation" into the tapes.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"This extra information should shed light on matters," Temime told reporters afterwards.</p>
              <p>If convicted, Banier faces up to three years in prison and a fine of 375,000 euros (460,000 dollars).</p>
              <p>The furore over the tapes has sparked calls for the resignation of Labour Minister Eric Woerth, accused of a conflict of interest because his wife worked for Bettencourt's estate while he was budget minister in charge of tax fraud.</p>
              <p>The taped conversations between Bettencourt and her financial adviser allegedly reveal that she hid 80 million euros in Swiss bank accounts while making big donations to friends in the ruling UMP party.</p>
              <p>With pressure on Woerth growing, Le Monde newspaper reported on Thursday that he had dined with Bettencourt in January 2008. Woerth's office confirmed the dinner but dismissed it as "nothing incredible."</p>
              <p>Banier sat in the courtroom, drawing in a sketchbook and joking with his lawyers as he waited for the trial to start and then sat solemnly listening as the arguments were heard. Neither Bettencourt nor her daughter were present.</p>
              <p>Liliane Bettencourt is the sole heir of L'Oreal, the global shampoo and beauty products company that her father founded. Her current fortune has been estimated at 17 billion euros (20 billion dollars).</p>
              <p>Banier is accused of "fraudulently" exploiting Bettencourt, who gave him masterpiece paintings including works by Matisse and Mondrian, cash and insurance policies worth a billion euros.</p>
              <p>Bettencourt-Meyers accuses him of swooping in after the death of her mother's husband, working to estrange her from her family.</p>
              <p>Banier and Liliane Bettencourt have rejected the daughter's claims and accused her of trying to cash in on her inheritance.</p>
              <p>Dubbed "photographer to the stars" after shooting the likes of US actor Johnny Depp and Princess Caroline of Monaco, Banier became close friends with Bettencourt after meeting her at a dinner party in 1969.</p>
              <p>He told Le Monde last year that Bettencourt was "completely sane" and gave him the gifts as a friend.</p>
              <p>"We have nothing to fear," his lawyer Temime told reporters. "Mr Banier wants to be judged, to be cleared of all suspicion."</p>
