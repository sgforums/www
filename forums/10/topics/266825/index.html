Donation monies of NKF belong to NKF the donation public and its board trustees. Trouble is you have listened to too much crap that Singapore success is one man success. Certainly there is a more practical world outside where the best of employees or senior staff are always only employees or iron rice bowler not on par with shareholders or equity owners. But in our case it is always as if the shareholders' funds can be taken for benchmarking our ministers' worth.<br><br>Go and tell that to Microsoft Bill Gates that Microsoft should pay their employees 5% of company revenues and you will see what he will say - you must be mad. Do you have any idea how much is 5% of microsoft and how many countries that could purchase along the african coast.<br><br>Monies of corporation belong to the shareholders and employees or senior staff are entitled to salaries only which are amounts with which the company can purchase from the open market. So stop listening to such crap from the MM that Singapore Incorporated's funds are his for the taking with yet another clever artful benchmarking.<br><br>May be one cannot really blame MM for when anyone is in power for too long he may think of all sorts of options or benchmarking to justify his own worth when the fact is that no one is indispensable in the real world outside no matter how talented or positive is one's contributions to the company.<br><br>If he can create another microsoft or some other world-beating products instead of taxing and legalistic wrangling to serve his own narrow agenda of staying in power, may be he is worth a bit more than bush.<br><br>All his megalomaniac associations of Singapore success as his own is only his own figment of imagination run wild.<br><br>It is as simple as that like bck would put it.</div>
