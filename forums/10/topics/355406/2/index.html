              <h1>JBJ’s son Kenneth joins Reform Party</h1>
              <p>MR KENNETH Jeyaretnam, the elder son of late opposition leader
                  J.B. Jeyaretnam, has joined the opposition ranks and is not ruling
                  out contesting the next general election.</p>
              <p>Three weeks ago, he joined the Reform Party, which was set up by
                  his father a few months before he died last September.</p>
              <p>The 50-year-old hedge fund manager was co-opted into the party’s
                  13-man central executive committee (CEC) a week later.</p>
              <p>Mr Jeyaretnam confirmed to The Straits Times yesterday that he
                  had joined the opposition party. ‘The timing was right. My father
                  founded the party, so this is one way to honour him and to continue
                  his legacy,’ he said.</p>
              <p>The party was set up by the late Mr Jeyaretnam - better known as
                  JBJ - after he was discharged from bankruptcy in 2007. It was
                  registered last July.</p>
              <p>But he died of heart failure two months later. He was 82.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There has been speculation on the opposition scene in recent
                  months that the younger Jeyaretnam would be entering the fray. This
                  was in the light of speeches he made at events organised by
                  opposition parties in memory of his father.</p>
              <p>Mr Jeyaretnam said he had recently thought about entering
                  politics, after Reform Party CEC member James Teo invited him to
                  join the party. He next met Mr Ng Teck Siong, the party chairman
                  and his father’s long-time ally, and made his decision.</p>
              <p>Married with a 12-year-old son, Mr Jeyaretnam worked in London’s
                  financial sector for several years before he returned with his
                  family to Singapore last April.</p>
              <p>His brother Philip, 45, is a Senior Counsel and partner at Rodyk
                  &amp; Davidson, and a former president of the Law Society.</p>
              <p>The brothers graduated from Cambridge University with
                  first-class honours degrees in economics and law respectively.</p>
              <p>Asked if his brother would join politics too, Mr Jeyaretnam
                  said: ‘My brother is his own man. You would have to ask him.’</p>
              <p>Mr Philip Jeyaretnam could not be reached for comment.</p>
              <p>Mr Ng said the Reform Party plans to tap Mr Jeyaretnam’s
                  economics expertise, and might also field him at the next
                  polls.</p>
              <p>‘As a party, we will try to get the best people to run for
                  elections. Kenneth is a potential candidate,’ he said.</p>
              <p>Mr Jeyaretnam said he is open to standing as a candidate, and he
                  sees a need for a ‘real economist’ on the political scene, to raise
                  economic issues.</p>
              <p>He added: ‘Like the Prime Minister, I also have a double first
                  from Cambridge.’</p>
              <p>PM Lee Hsien Loong, 57, earned double first-class honours in
                  mathematics at Cambridge.</p>
              <p>Is Mr Jeyaretnam a potential successor to his father’s
                  secretary-general post in the Reform Party? ‘The CEC will have to
                  decide on that,’ Mr Ng replied.</p>
              <p>That post has been left vacant since Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam’s death.
                  Other vacant posts are those of assistant secretary-general and
                  treasurer, added Mr Ng.</p>
              <p>The party has recruited 20 members since October. Among them is
                  Mr Ng E-Jay, 32, a blogger who is doing a doctorate in mathematics
                  at the National University of Singapore.</p>
              <p>Political observer Eugene Tan, a law lecturer at Singapore
                  Management University, said Mr Jeyaretnam has given the Reform
                  Party a ‘tremendous boost’, given his academic achievements,
                  professional background and political pedigree.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, the party that the late Mr Jeyaretnam used to lead,
                  the Workers’ Party, has also seen changes in its membership, but in
                  the form of resignations. Four members have quit in the past two
                  weeks.</p>
              <p>They include Mr Abdul Salim Harun, 27, and Ms Lee Wai Leng, 30,
                  who were part of the Workers’ Party team that lost to PM Lee’s team
                  in Ang Mo Kio GRC during the 2006 polls.</p>
              <p>The party’s organising secretary, Mr Yaw Shin Leong, who led the
                  Ang Mo Kio team, said: ‘In all organisations, members come and go.
                  They have contributed to the party. We wish them well.’</p>
