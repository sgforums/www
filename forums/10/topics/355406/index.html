              <h1>JBJ’s son Kenneth joins Reform Party</h1>
              <p>MR KENNETH Jeyaretnam, the elder son of late opposition leader J.B.
              Jeyaretnam, has joined the opposition ranks and is not ruling out
              contesting the next general election.</p>
              <p>Three weeks ago, he joined the Reform Party, which was set up by his father a few months before he died last September.</p>
              <p>The 50-year-old hedge fund manager was co-opted into the party’s 13-man central executive committee (CEC) a week later.</p>
              <p>Mr Jeyaretnam confirmed to The Straits Times yesterday that he had
              joined the opposition party. ‘The timing was right. My father founded
              the party, so this is one way to honour him and to continue his
              legacy,’ he said.</p>
              <p>The party was set up by the late Mr Jeyaretnam - better known as JBJ
              - after he was discharged from bankruptcy in 2007. It was registered
              last July.</p>
              <p>But he died of heart failure two months later. He was 82.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There has been speculation on the opposition scene in recent months
              that the younger Jeyaretnam would be entering the fray. This was in the
              light of speeches he made at events organised by opposition parties in
              memory of his father.</p>
              <p>Mr Jeyaretnam said he had recently thought about entering politics,
              after Reform Party CEC member James Teo invited him to join the party.
              He next met Mr Ng Teck Siong, the party chairman and his father’s
              long-time ally, and made his decision.</p>
              <p>Married with a 12-year-old son, Mr Jeyaretnam worked in London’s
              financial sector for several years before he returned with his family
              to Singapore last April.</p>
              <p>His brother Philip, 45, is a Senior Counsel and partner at Rodyk &amp; Davidson, and a former president of the Law Society.</p>
              <p>The brothers graduated from Cambridge University with first-class honours degrees in economics and law respectively.</p>
              <p>Asked if his brother would join politics too, Mr Jeyaretnam said: ‘My brother is his own man. You would have to ask him.’</p>
              <p>Mr Philip Jeyaretnam could not be reached for comment.</p>
              <p>Mr Ng said the Reform Party plans to tap Mr Jeyaretnam’s economics expertise, and might also field him at the next polls.</p>
              <p>‘As a party, we will try to get the best people to run for elections. Kenneth is a potential candidate,’ he said.</p>
              <p>Mr Jeyaretnam said he is open to standing as a candidate, and he
              sees a need for a ‘real economist’ on the political scene, to raise
              economic issues.</p>
              <p>He added: ‘Like the Prime Minister, I also have a double first from Cambridge.’</p>
              <p>PM Lee Hsien Loong, 57, earned double first-class honours in mathematics at Cambridge.</p>
              <p>Is Mr Jeyaretnam a potential successor to his father’s
              secretary-general post in the Reform Party? ‘The CEC will have to
              decide on that,’ Mr Ng replied.</p>
              <p>That post has been left vacant since Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam’s death.
              Other vacant posts are those of assistant secretary-general and
              treasurer, added Mr Ng.</p>
              <p>The party has recruited 20 members since October. Among them is Mr
              Ng E-Jay, 32, a blogger who is doing a doctorate in mathematics at the
              National University of Singapore.</p>
              <p>Political observer Eugene Tan, a law lecturer at Singapore
              Management University, said Mr Jeyaretnam has given the Reform Party a
              ‘tremendous boost’, given his academic achievements, professional
              background and political pedigree.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, the party that the late Mr Jeyaretnam used to lead, the
              Workers’ Party, has also seen changes in its membership, but in the
              form of resignations. Four members have quit in the past two weeks.</p>
              <p>They include Mr Abdul Salim Harun, 27, and Ms Lee Wai Leng, 30, who
              were part of the Workers’ Party team that lost to PM Lee’s team in Ang
              Mo Kio GRC during the 2006 polls.</p>
              <p>The party’s organising secretary, Mr Yaw Shin Leong, who led the Ang
              Mo Kio team, said: ‘In all organisations, members come and go. They
              have contributed to the party. We wish them well.’</p>

              <p>The people who are weak or uneducated do not have a voice. In
              democratic societies, they can only demonstrate and protest - <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>but this
              is not allowed in Singapore.</strong></span> Here, they can only suffer in silence, or
              voice their grievances in the coffee shop. They receive low wages that
              are not sufficient to feed a family. Many cannot afford to have a
              family.</p>
              <div>The
              people who are better educated and able to take care of themselves
              argue in favour of free market - no minimum wage, no unemployment
              insurance and low taxation. They are in favour of "survival of the
              fittest". <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Let the weak die.</strong></span></div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>The day will come
              when these people became the weak, the exploited, the victims of the
              free market. They will lose their job and cannot feed their family/
              They will then complain about being exploited, but it will be too late.</div>

              <div>I wish to introduce to you the <a href="http://docs.google.com/Doc?docid=dcqjz7c8_72c8z8xvg5&amp;hl=en">letter from the grave</a>,
              written by a brave journalist (Lasantha Wikrewatunga) who was willing
              to speak for others. He paid the price with his life - he was
              assassinated by his enemies.  </div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>In his letter, he quoted a poem from Martin Niemoller, which said, "there was nobody left to speak for me". I quote it below.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="border-collapse: collapse; font-family: arial;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic;">  First they came for the Jews<br>  and I did not speak out because I was not a Jew.<br>  Then they came for the Communists<br>  and I did not speak out because I was not a Communist.<br>  Then they came for the trade unionists<br>  and I did not speak out because I was not a trade unionist.<br>  Then they came for me<br>  and there was no one left to speak out for me.<br></span></span></div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Martin
              Niemoller was a German. At a young age, he admired  what Adolf Hitler
              did to build up Germany. Later, he spoke against the repressive actions
              taken by Hitler to build his power, and was sent to concentration camp.
              He wrote the peom while in prison.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>I hope that Signaporeans will reflect on what we can do for the people who are not able to speak for themselves.</div>

              <p>From AFP</p>
              <h1 class="title_normal">Son of Singapore's late opposition icon enters politics</h1>
              <div class="segment_normal">
              <div class="detail">
              <div class="gchild chrome1 left"></div>
              <p>A son of Singapore's late opposition icon J.B. Jeyaretnam said Friday he had joined his father's pro-democracy party and may run for parliament in the next general elections.</p>
              <p>British-trained economist Kenneth Jeyaretnam, 50, told AFP he had been approached to join other parties but decided going with the Reform Party was the right thing to do.</p>
              <p>"This is examining my conscience... I should go with the Reform Party because it was set up by my father," Jeyaretnam said.</p>
              <p>"I want to honour what he stood for, everything that he said, but I will be my own man," he said.</p>
              <p>Jeyaretnam's father, who died in September last year from a heart attack aged 82, suffered jail stints and libel suits in his lonely battle for greater political freedom in the wealthy city-state.</p>
              <p>"My message to Singaporeans out there is don't be afraid," said Jeyaretnam.</p>
              <p>"I want to show that competition is vital in politics as it is in business, so it's not to be feared but to be embraced," he said.</p>
              <p>Jeyaretnam, who worked in the financial sector in London after earning a double first-class honours degree from the University of Cambridge and returned to Singapore last year, says he can offer alternative economic policies to those espoused by the ruling People's Action Party (PAP).</p>
              <p>"I want to create an image of economic competency of the opposition, meaning that I can advocate policies for economic prosperity and I can advocate better economic policies than the present government," he said.</p>
              <p>Jeyaretnam joined the Reform Party three weeks ago and said he was ready to go out and meet Singaporeans just like his father, a fiery orator who peddled anti-PAP books in the waning years of his political career.</p>
              <p>"There is a lot of work to be done... I have a lot to do and go out to meet people," said Jeyaretnam.</p>
              <p>"My father was always a firm believer that you have to go out and meet with the ordinary people," he said.</p>
              <p>Asked if he was prepared to run for office, he replied: "Absolutely ready."</p>
              <p>The late Jeyaretnam was a bitter foe of Singapore's founding father Lee Kuan Yew, whose son Lee Hsien Loong became prime minister in 2004 after Goh Chok Tong stepped down. The younger Lee led the PAP to victory in the 2006 general elections.</p>
              <p>J.B. Jeyaretnam founded the Reform Party a few months before his sudden death and was hoping to run for office again despite his age.</p>
              <p>He was one of the few Singaporeans who spoke out consistently against the PAP, espousing causes such as human rights and greater political freedoms in the city-state, and made history by breaking the PAP's total grip on parliament in 1981.</p>
              <p>His younger son Philip, 45, also educated at Cambridge, is an author and senior lawyer who has served as president of the Law Society of Singapore.</p>
              <p>The PAP, which has been in power since 1959, says its tough laws against dissent are necessary to ensure the stability which has helped Singapore progress economically to become among the wealthiest in Asia.</p>
              <p>It controls all but two of the 84 seats in parliament.</p>
              <p>General elections are not due until 2011 but there is speculation that the PAP will seek a mandate earlier, hoping Singaporeans would support its record of economic progress and stability instead of voting for untested opposition leaders during an economic recession.</p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">
              </span></p><p> </p>
              <p>Statement on Court Appearance 01/04/09</p>
              <p>I was required to attend court on the 01/04/09 for Pre-Trial Conference,it was scheduled at Court 3 for 10am.</p>
              <p>The
              hearing was conducted in chambers.The judge and i had a close
              discussion about the alleged shoplifting case,the police death threats
              case and my video interview.</p>
              <p>During this discussion,the judge,the Honorable Mr Ng Peng Hong had this to say about my video interview,<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>"You were supposed to ignite a bomb,but you defused it instead."</strong></span></p>
              <p>After
              i stated that my instructions from my lawyer was to claim trial and see
              the evidence the police have against me, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>the Judge had this to
              say,"Maybe you should just plead guilty.What your lawyer want may not
              be what you want."</strong></span></p>
              <p>After i made repeated requests for SSGT
              Iskander Tang of CID Bomb Investigation Squad to appear as a
              witness,the Judge had this to say,<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>"I cannot allow you to call on
              Iskander Tang as a witness because he has been placed under
              detention. Since he's under detention, how to get him out as a witness?"</strong></span></p>
              <p>At
              this point,i made a request of the Judge,i requested that the Deputy
              Public Prosecutor(DPP)was NOT allowed to withdraw the charges and that
              this case must go to trial and that i would be calling upon Mr Iskander
              Tang as a witness.The DPP's face turned ashen,he mumbled something and
              the Judge granted me the request.</p>
              <p>The Judge also announced that
              the case was adjourned for me to get my lawyer to attend court together
              with me,next court appearance was to be on the 07/04/09 for PTC.</p>
              <p>As
              i walked out of chambers,i noticed that there were 2 other persons in
              addition to the 2 court clerks.The 2 new persons were a male and
              female,both dress in white/light peach coloured attire.</p>
              <p>The minute i stepped out of the door,the female went,"Great,now we've got him.Prepare the documents and hand him over to us."</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>I was thinking,"Huh?WTF?!"</strong></span></p>
              <p>The female court clerk went,"Didn't you hear?The case has been adjourned."</p>
              <p>The male court clerk went,"He has a lawyer,the case has been adjourned.You guys are not going to get him."<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>
              <p>I wonder who and where these 2 persons are from,and how they know the "verdict" before the Judge made any ruling.</p>
              </strong></span>
              <p>As
              i left the court room,IO Makmur,who is in charge of the shoplifting
              case,beckoned me over.He had a chinese colleage with him,i do not know
              his name.They asked me various questions about the cases.</p>
              <p>When we reached the outside of the Sub Courts,<strong>i enquired the chinese officer as to whether Iskander Tang was really under detention,he affirmed that it was so.</strong>IO
              Makmur asked me what i was going to do,and i said the same thing as i
              did to the Judge &amp; the DPP,that i wanted to go to trial &amp; that
              i wanted to call upon Iskander Tang as a witness.</p>
              <p>The chinese officer seemed overcome with emotion at this,as he closed his eyes tightly and visibly shook.</p>
              <p>IO Makmur turned and looked me in the face,"You think you can get him out of detention?"</p>
              <p>I said to him,"I don't know what the current culture in the SPF is,but where i come from,we don't leave our people behind."</p>
              <p>IO Makmur,"Oh,so he's your people ah?"</p>
              <p>I said,"Whoa,don't get me wrong.We are not together in some conspiracy against the state of Singapore.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>What
              i am trying to say is,metaphorically speaking,Iskander took a bullet
              for me and for the thousands of netizens out there.So it is not right
              for us to leave him behind.Maybe you feel that Iskander has betrayed
              the SPF and deserve to be punished,but i feel that maybe he feels he is
              doing his duty,which is protecting innocent citizens of Singapore."</strong></span></p>
              <p>We parted ways.</p>

              <p>Let Singapore see Kenneth Jeyaratnam for the person that he truly is WITHOUT the dirty "gangster style" politics that LKY has displayed since 1957 - while attempting to be the clean politician that he pretend to be.</p>

              <p><em>Ladies and Gentlemen,<br><br>My tribute to Kenneth Jeyaretnam</em><br><br>Gopalan Nair<br>Gopalan Nair Attorneys at Law<br>39737 Paseo Padre Parkway, Suite A1<br>Fremont, California 94538<br>USA<br><br>April 09, 2009 By Air Mail<br><br>Kenneth Jeyaretnam<br>The Reform Party<br>18A, Smith Street<br>Singapore 058932<br><br>Dear Kenneth,<br><br>I
              congratulate you for your courageous decision in joining the Reform
              Party. You have chosen the honorable path by this action. There is no
              doubt this momentous decision that you made was not for any personal
              gain but to do the right thing for the people of Singapore. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Singapore
              today is a one party totalitarian dictatorship which is a far cry from
              what it was meant to be in 1963 when it broke from colonial rule. </strong></span><br><br>I
              have personally known your father throughout the 1980s when I was his
              colleague in the Worker's Party. He was an honest man, passionately
              committed to democracy in Singapore. Sadly he did not live long enough
              to see the fruits of his struggle.<br><br>With this vindictive
              government in Singapore, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>I have no doubt that this is the beginning of
              your troubles. </strong></span>I am sure you too are fully aware of it. If you stood by
              your principles to fight for Singaporeans rights, to use Churchill's
              words, you have nothing to hope for but "blood toil tears and sweat".</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>This is how, this small minded government goes about it's business to
              stay in power.</strong></span></p>
              <p>At least this is how it must be in the immediate future.
              But I am sure, in the end, if you have the courage to stand your
              ground, without faltering, without wavering and without baulking; in
              the end you will be vindicated. I have no doubt in my mind of it.<br><br>The
              memory of your illustrious father lives with you and walks with you.
              That memory alone which is vivid in the minds of all Singaporeans will
              cause many to join you and the political opposition. Your attraction is
              also your admirable qualifications as an economist. <br><br>You are
              walking the righteous path. You have my admiration and respect. I have
              no doubt that you will succeed. I wish you success.<br><br>Yours sincerely,<br><br>Gopalan Nair</p>

              <p>Wonder if he is joining opposition for the sake of filial piety or for the future of singapore?? If for the sake of filial piety to his late father, it will be just another ribbon cutting ceremony, and after that, nothing liao.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I think since Philip decided not to enter, MM LKY called upon kenny to enter just to show some respect to his long time opponent and perhaps it may help to remove some of his sins. LKY very clever one.</p>

              <p>Uncle, in politic science, sometime you need to tame and respect the opposition so as to gain gentlemanship with an uterior motives, this is the skill of LKY. And most of the time, opposition falls into the trap.</p>
