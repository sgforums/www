              <p>http://www.screendaily.com/territories/asia-pacific/singapores-boku-films-to-co-produce-the-host-sequel/5003777.article</p>
              <p><strong>ScreenDaily.com, 22 Jul 2009, Jean Noh</strong><br> <br> Singaporean production company Boku Films has signed an MOU with
              Korea’s Chungeorahm to co-produce and invest $5m in the Korean sequel
              to hit monster movie The Host.<br> <br> Chungeorahm CEO Choi Yong-bae signed the deal with Boku Films head
              Kelvin Tong last night at the Puchon International Fantastic Film
              Festival (PiFan) during the Network of Asian Fantastic Films (NAFF)
              Singapore Spotlight event.<br> <br> <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Also present was Kenneth Tan, head
              of Singapore’s Media Development Authority (MDA), which will contribute
              50% or $2.5m of Boku Films’ investment.<br> </strong></span> <br> The original The Host, directed by Bong Joon-ho, clocked up 13 million
              admissions on local release in 2006 and remains Korea’s top box office
              hit to date. It was also sold to 134 countries.<br> <br> A director is yet to be announced for the sequel. Manga artist Kang
              Full previously worked on drafts of a script, but Choi notes that the
              story has been evolving past that.<br> <br> The film’s projected budget is KW12bn, which when first announced last
              year was “in the $12m range”, but fluctuating exchange rates have
              brought the budget in dollar terms down to $9.6m.<br> <br> “We’re pleased to be working with Boku Films and the MDA on this global
              co-production,” Choi Yong-bae told Screendaily. “SK Telecom has already
              invested funds for development and planning of the sequel, which we aim
              to have completed in 2010.”<br> <br> Chungeorahm previously did a deal with Ning Hao’s Stoneman Films for a Chinese sequel.<br> <br> “We’ll call the Korean sequel The Host 2, not to be confused with the
              China version, which right now we can just refer to as the Chinese
              sequel,” notes Choi. “I’ll be meeting with Ning Hao next month to
              discuss further developments.”<br> <br> Boku Films has also seen a top box office hit in Singapore with The
              Maid and produced the award-winning Rule #1 while MDA is spearheading
              an initiative to make Singapore an international media hub with support
              for films, TV, music, games and animation.<br> <br> -----------------------------<br> <br> <span style="color: navy;"><strong>Other Hot News @ <a href="http://singaporenewsalternative.blogspot.com/">Singapore News Alternative</a>:</strong><br> <br> 1.

              <p>Wooots!!! Yippie!!!!!</p>
              <p>Its A GREAT MOVIE!!! Best korean film I had ever seen! Dont really know how to put it, but hey, many people can relate to it! ( Not to the monster, of course ). The cast and the story line was great. Gimme the Host to Transformer anytime!!</p>
              <p>May the sequel outstrip the initial movie, and the MDA youtube rap will be forgiven!<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>PS:For those in the loop, the film was meant to be anti-american, drawing parallels with the monster being US, their bases on S.Korean land and their doings. But hey, I go to the movies to relax and be carried away by the plot and the storyline, no bother about satires, watch it as it is, and I am sure many would have done what the lead actor did in the face of calamity and dangers posed to their loved ones. </p>

              <p>This government has many great ideas in throwing Singaporean money at foreigners.</p>
              <p>Then it will do its best to recover more money from Singaporean with the multiple brilliant ideas of new ERP gantries, increases in ERP charges, water conservation charges, higher electrical charges, revised bus fares, manipulating the COEs, and with more new creative ideas such as building new Express Ways but setting the speed limit at 70 kmh and installing expensive cameras to enforce it.</p>
              <p>The old methods are not abandoned either, as can be seen by an increase number and frequency of Traffic Police putting up candid cameras in more creative ways to trap unsuspecting Singaporeans hurrying about to make ends meet.</p>
              <p>How many Singaporean businesses will benefit ?</p>
              <p>How many Singaporeans will be employed as extras if and when the Korean movie set come to Singapore to cut any local scenes ?</p>
              <p>How big will the spin off in benefits can Singapore get from this "investment" that the IDA has made to the Koreans ?</p>
