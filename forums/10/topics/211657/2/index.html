They have free education all the way to A'Levels.<br><br>Yes, we don't have Malays in our key SAF regiments but that's a security issue. Nothing rascist.<br><br>Job ads also tend to advertise for people who are bilingual. If a Malay can speak Chinese, why not? Nothing rascist here too.<br><br>The "so-called" marginalisation is because the majority of them do not work as hard and strive as high as they should, thereby languishing in the lower rungs of society.</div></blockquote>Even if a malay is competent in conversing in mandarin, somehow the employers will set another condition and at the end of the day they prefer mandarin speaking chinese over mandarin speaking malays even though they are on the same ground in terms of competency and ability. This happened to me before. Straight in the face. Quite a number of my friends faced this problem as well.<br><br>As for your statement regarding majority of the 'Mats and Minahs' not<br>working and striving as high as they could, I believe that more are well educated now(an increase in the number of them graduated from local universities)and have the potential to suceed if given the chance. At the end of the day, in the eye of employers, preference still comes into play.<br><br>I remembered a saying during my ns days, "If things doesn't go your way, what to do, suk thumb lor !!"  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

In Singapore, people can switch camps when situation benefits them, others don't switch camp but just move with the tides, most choose to be apathetic and just keep quiet.

Reality hurts ! So much talk about democracy but a little is being put into practice. This is the harsh life that we singaporeans have to live up with.
