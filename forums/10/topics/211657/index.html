            <div class='col-md body'>The following is a report in Malaysian newspaper which showed that MM Lee's speech to the IMF was rather racial and uncalled for.<br><br>Such speeches will not help Singapore to build better relations with its neighbouring countries.<br><br>QUOTE: BANGI: Malaysia can do without scathing comments from its neighbours, especially if the statements made are inaccurate and have political implications, Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak said.<br><br>He said that a recent statement made by former Singapore Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew on the status of the Chinese community in Malaysia and Indonesia was seen as Â“naughty.Â”<br><br>Â“I do not know the reason he made such a statement but it should not have been made at all. ItÂ’s a comment that we can do without and it is not appreciated at all,Â” he said after launching and presenting the Amanah Saham Bumiputera (ASB) Sejahtera aid to the hardcore poor yesterday.<br><br>On Sept 15, Reuters quoted Lee, who is Minister Mentor for the island republic, as saying it was vital for the predominantly ethnic Chinese state to stand up to its bigger, majority Muslim neighbours, Indonesia and Malaysia.<br><br>OFFICE VISIT: Najib having a discussion with Wolfowitz at his office in Putrajaya yesterday.Â— Bernamapic<br>Lee, who was speaking at a forum on the sidelines of the World Bank-International Monetary Fund meetings, had also said the attitude of neighbouring Malaysia and Indonesia towards Singapore was shaped by the way they treated their own ethnic Chinese minorities.<br><br>Lee had said that SingaporeÂ’s neighbours had problems with their Chinese communities because they were successful and hardworking and Â“therefore, they are systematically marginalised.Â”<br><br>Najib said LeeÂ’s comment, apart from having political implication, was also not accurate and did not represent the actual scenario in the country.<br><br>Â“We do not sideline the non-bumiputra in this country. What are in place are efforts to create a balance between the bumiputra and the non-bumiputra,'' he added.<br><br>Asked if Malaysia would send a diplomatic note to protest LeeÂ’s statement, the Deputy Prime Minister said: Â“I donÂ’t know about that. It is up to Cabinet to decide.Â”<br><br>On another matter, Najib, who met Paul Wolfowitz at his office in Putrajaya yesterday, said the World Bank president had asked what was the key to the nationÂ’s socio-economic and political success and had wanted Malaysia to share its success story and experience with foreign ministers of 18 African nations.<br><br>Â“We are glad to share our experience and impart the factors that have made us successful. But I informed Wolfowitz that Malaysia does not want to be seen as 'preaching' to them what to do.<br><br>Â“We will give the facts and it is up to them to consider what can be used, accepted, modified and implemented in their respective country,Â” he added. UNQUOTE<br><br>So will PM Lee exercise his leadership as PM to stop MM Lee from making similar speeches.</div>

On this rationale, they must outperform the narrow politicians elsewhere and be made more accountable and be questioned for their beliefs and philosophy.<br><br>So I would expect our leaders to have good thinking and Leadership in foreign policies is called for among our own leaders - not off-the-cuff comments which bring about more spats.</div>

About how schools will fail certain Chinese students who are doing much better then their Malay students, basically MARGINALIZATION of the Chinese.<br><br>Isn't this TRUE in actual fact??<br><br>Personally, I too feel that it is so.<br><br></div></blockquote>This is absolutely true and there is no question about it!! whether it is our business or not is another matter.  Ask any Malaysians in Singapore. Ask any ex malaysians in Australia and England. They won't tell you they din like Mahathir or UMNO or were afraid of PAS. Ask also the ethnic Indians in KL if how they are treated as a citizen compared to the Malays. They may not used words like marginalization, but more down to earth words.<br><br>Ask the indonesian chinese about their position as citizens of Indonesia, if they are treated anywhere as equal as the minority in singapore, those singaporean who want to migrate should go there, things are cheaper, and they can say any damn thing against the government, against the leadership, can demonstrate on the streets, absolute freedom of expression, but only on politic, what we do not have here.<br></div>

What we face here is more of a political thing; what our gov says, we must accept without any arguments.<br><br>We have a different set of problems. And between us and them (Indonesia and Malaysia), our problems aren't any worse or better than theirs. It's just as much a problem. And will grow as years passes.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Singapore Malays are hardly marginalised. They have free education all the way to A'Levels.<br><br>Yes, we don't have Malays in our key SAF regiments but that's a security issue. Nothing rascist.<br><br>Job ads also tend to advertise for people who are bilingual. If a Malay can speak Chinese, why not? Nothing rascist here too.<br><br>The "so-called" marginalisation is because the majority of them do not work as hard and strive as high as they should, thereby languishing in the lower rungs of society.</div>
