            <div class='col-md body'>making baby? govt revising way to make singapore make more baby?<br>i have few personal pointers that i wish to bring out :<br>1. why govt wana give benefits?<br>- the govt we know nowadays place monetary benefits above everything. why govt wana do a business that doesnt ripe benefits?<br>we have lowest birth rate in 2003. if this trend is not revise, singapore could face big problem in the future.<br>a. reduce nos of tax payers in 20 years down the road. govt cannot generate enough taxes income. to resolve it, either to increase taxes in the future or increase company taxes which either way singapore govt would like to aviod else, all those CPF cut or flexi wages also no use. moreover unattractive taxes would also turn away foreign talents or induce singaporean to work oversea.<br>b. defence. simply not enuff soldier to support skeleton crew at all units.<br>c. fewer workers in the employment market. company cant find enuff workers or realise they need to pay higher wages to get employee might look elsewhere for investment.<br>d. shrinking own economy. ageing population or shrinking population means small domestic economy. vulnerable to any macroenvironment changes. i think govt is aiming for bigger domestic market in singapore by having bigger population.<br><br>2. why singaporean not having enuff babies?<br>i also father soon. i plan at most 2 kids. why? simply cannot affordfor myself though i love children.<br>a. hospital fees<br>hospitalisation fees ard $5000-$6000 for B2 ward.<br>of which around $3000 cash is needed.  futher $2000+ is  medisave.  havent count consultation fees for 10 mths which could add up by another $1000 cash.<br>total 1 year for pregnacy cost : $7000. ($4000 cash).<br>havent add tonic for wife, baby medical cost.<br>b. unsecure working environment.<br>who want to have some many baby and higher expenses by having a bigger family. what happen if either one breadwinner is jobless? more ppl will suffer. also having more than 2 kids meaning wife would have to resign and take care. meaning more mouth to feed by lesser income.<br>c. bleak future for the kids.<br>singapore is like a sunset economy for most ppl. unless you are a professional like lawyers, doctors, auditors. poor is going to get poorer and rich getting richer. kids in the future gona find it tough<br><br>conclusion:<br>whatever the outcome from this 2004 budget, dont think gona change my view about nos of kids we gona have.<br><br>anyone ever wonder how much it cost to have a baby in HK?<br>be surprise how cheap it is.<br>not gona mention australian as the taxes there are higher so baby delivery there is almost free.<br><br>what do fellow friends think about it?<br>Pires<br>(Fan of arsenal FC  the champion of 2003-2004 english premier league<br>and possible 2003-2004  FA cup winnder + 2003-2004 champion league winner).<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>watched document on about this couple. Wife worked in SP (I think) 4 kids. She mention by 4th kids there are nothing...no leave, no subs. True in a sense to stop abuse by 1% malays who have &gt;3 childrens even earning $1000 a mth.<br><br>But then she go on saying, cannot stop working becos it will cost more to the family finances. The shows goes on say: HER HUSBAND EARNS $10K/Mth. Can you beat that....how many Sporean couples even earn a combine income of $10K????<br><br>So what is enough? I think it is more so $$ issue.<br><br>1. Employers... change of labour law<br>2. Longer leave for mother, also include 1 mouth leave for father since now have children are responsiblity of both sexes.<br>3. Lower Hospitals.<br>4. Tax rebates<br>5.

People are just simply too busy and life is very hectic. Already many graduates cannot find jobs, what makes you think they would want to find new families? Raising children especially in Singapore is very costly. Time and dedication is a must, with more working mothers and fathers, will children really be looked after properly? In other words, even if we have more children or families here, will they be of good quality? What sort of babies does the government want? The lifestyle in Singapore is just too hectic, my teachers dont even have time for PTA meetings, yet alone to raise families. And this is the same with my adult friends, mostly insurance agents, they dont think that Singapore is a place to really raise children.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Parka:</div><div class="quote_body"><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Anyway, it all boils down to economics.<br><br>More people = more spending.<br>More people might mean more productivity...</div></blockquote>If one wants to argue about increasing productivity, then thought should be given to the unemployed, rather than put more resources in raising children.</div>
