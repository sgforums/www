              <div id="entry">
              <p><strong><em><span style="font-weight: normal;">By</span><strong> Andrew Loh</strong></em></strong></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-21642" style="float: left; margin: 10px; border: black 3px solid;" title="llbad10" src="http://theonlinecitizen.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/VB-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="250"></strong>At a forum organised by REACH, the government’s online feedback portal, Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports, Dr Vivian Balakrishnan, said:</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">“If you were a poor person, anywhere on this planet, Singapore is the one place where you will have a roof over your head, where you will have food on the table. Even if you can’t afford it, we will have meals delivered to you.”</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Dr Balakrishnan did not clarify who he meant by “we” when he said “…we will have meals delivered to you.” One assumes that he is referring to the government, or more specifically, his own ministry.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">If this were so, it would run contrary to what we have witnessed on the ground. In my interaction with various sections of poor people and homeless people in Singapore, I have yet to come across any government department or ministry which provides free meals to those who cannot afford them.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"> </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Instead, the free meals are provided by religious groups, non-governmental organizations and well-meaning Singaporeans.<em> (Please see some of these in the list at the end of this article. Courtesy of: </em><a href="http://hubpages.com/hub/Who-says-theres-no-free-lunch-in-Singapore"><em><span style="color: #336699;">Hub Pages</span></em></a><em>. )</em></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Perhaps the question we should ask Dr Balakrishnan is: Which government agency or ministry provides free meals to the poor – and deliver to them as well? If this is indeed so, could the minister provide the details – which government programme does this, what kinds of meals are provided, what are the criterias to qualify?</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">With the increasing number of homeless and poorer Singaporeans in our midst, giving full publicity to such government programmes, if they exist, is of paramount importance. After all, it could be a matter of life and death.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Dr Balakrishan will forgive this writer if he (this writer) sounds guarded about the minister’s assurance, especially when this writer remembers the dismissive and condescending tone of the minister’s reply to MP, Dr Lily Neo, in 2007. Dr Neo had asked the government to increase the amount those on the Public Assistance scheme receive.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Dr Balakrishnan rejected Dr Neo’s appeal with these words (<a href="http://siewkumhong.blogspot.com/2007/03/how-many-portions-of-help-sir.html"><span style="color: #336699;">see here</span></a>):</p>
              <blockquote style="text-align: justify;">
              <p><strong>“How much do you want? Do you want three meals in a hawker centre, food court or restaurant?”</strong></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">If the government does indeed provide free meals for those in need, why is it that during the recession of 2008/2009, when long queues for free food could be seen at places like the <a href="http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5gn3TzAFycEuhznB1K_9Nqs_3rQCg"><span style="color: #336699;">Singapore Buddhist Lodge</span></a>, the government did not make it known then that it also provides free meals?</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Why is Dr Balakrishnan saying so only now – after the bad times are over?</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">While the minister may now declare that free meals will be provided and even delivered to the poor, one hopes that the minister will not just make empty promises – and spend more time on the ground getting to know the reality which an increasing number of Singaporeans are facing.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Otherwise, we can dismiss the minister’s words as just hot air from the Ivory Tower.</p>

              <p>What he said, did not reflect the state's, the party's or the govt's line.</p>
              <p>His soft, humane approach sticks out like a sour thumb and is so incongruent with the hard, survival-of-the-fittest approach of the PAP.</p>
              <p>Frankly, Dr Balakrishnan is better off being a medical doctor than a politician.</p>

              <p><strong>Dr Vivian Balakrishnan: “I am confident we have done our duty”</strong></p>
              </div>
              </div>
              <p>Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports Dr Vivian Balakrishnan said during a dialogue organized by REACH last night that a “poor person in Singapore fares much better than the poor in Asia or the West” without substantiating his claims.</p>
              <p>Outlining his “accomplishments” to help the poor and needy in Singapore, he noted that he has raised the monthly allowance for those on public assistance (PA) steadily and “improved” the delivery of assistance since he took over the ministry in 2005.</p>
              <p><strong>“I’m confident we’ve done our duty,”</strong> he proclaimed.</p>
              <p>Only Singaporeans who are certified permanently unfit to work and completely destitute with no living relatives can qualify for PA aid which offers a miserly $360 monthly per recipient, hardly enough to survive in Singapore.</p>
              <p>When asked by MP Lily Neo in 2007 to increase the monthly PA allowance so that its recipients can have three basic meals a day, Minister for Community, Youth and Sports Dr Vivian Balakrishnan retorted:</p>
              <p><strong>“How much do you want? Do you want three meals in a hawker centre, food court or restaurant?”</strong></p>
              <p>He added that “one limiting factor must be the sum that we give through public assistance cannot be so generous as to erode the work ethic.”</p>
              <p>[Source: Channel News Asia, 9 March 2007]</p>
              <p>The Straits Times reported of late that there were only 11 successful PA applicants between July 2008 and Deccember 2009. MCYS said that the low numbers showed that Singaporeans want to be as “self-reliant” as much as possible.</p>
              <p>However Dr Vivian has no qualms splurging $10 million dollars of taxpayers’ monies on a Community Integration Fund to make the foreigners feel welcomed and accepted in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Though Singapore is the second richest country in Asia after Japan, Singaporeans enjoy few social welfare benefits from its miserly PAP government which exhorts them to work for as long as they can well into their golden years till they drop dead while being “faster, cheaper and better” at the same time.</p>
              <p>On the other hand, its cash-flushed sovereign wealth funds are rich enough to fritter billions of dollars of national reserves to bail out ailing U.S. and European banks.</p>
              <p>Dr Vivian Balakrishnan costs Singapore taxpayers about $1.9 million dollars a year or $5,278 dollars a day.</p>

              <p><br>I have met him face to face a number of times.  He looks soft and weak, too unbelievable to be a politician.   He is better in the role as a doctor.    He was a CEO of a public organisation before joining politics.    I suppose he has connection with the MIW.   </p>
