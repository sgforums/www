They will not participate if it is not profitable to them and they will never ever subsidise your transport fares. So now you have 2 bodies waiting to suck money out of you.<br><br>Probably the only subsidy that is true to its purpose now of helping the poor is the education subsidy, offering low fees for children to study in mainstream government schools up to secondary level, even though it has also started to get a bit expensive for some parents.</div>

Sparing 1% or even just 0.1% of it to help these needy people. What's the point of holding so much cash for the future when old folks here are suffering at this moment in time. Where's the humanity in it?<br><br>The good thing about a strong currency is that it helps to control inflation. Guess it's an issue of finding an equilibrium. The recent appreciation of SGD is a reaction to rising inflation by the MAS, regardless of the fact that USD is on the fall, since if the policy had not changed recently, they would pump more SGD just to keep pace with the sliding USD.</div></blockquote>Didn't you heard him, the great PM said a few times that he is not making Singapore a welfare state thus I believe this may be the reason why they are so unwilling to use the reserve to help the poor.</div>

If we people come out with solution then we might as well get the pay of PAP.   People here can only give suggestions and not going into details.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Zenden9 and tamago, if he asks some more refer him to speak to PAP personally.  He is just going round and round expecting perfect replies from you guys when the govt is the one who should look into this matter.   He is just having fun going merry go round with you guys.</div>
