Profits were justified by saying that it is to motivate the operators to improve. But to motivate the operator, you need to motivate the staff. Ain't all salaries accounted for before the profit? Then how does having more money around motivate the staff when they could see that they are not getting what they have worked for while peasants keep paying more.<br><br>A portion of the profit went into purchase of new buses when their life spans are up, but sadly the extension of lifespans from 12 to 17 years only gives them extra revenue to combat inflation. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>
