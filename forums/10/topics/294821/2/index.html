She earns about $600 a month. Her mother or father-in-law cares for her five children when she is at work. The family lives in a five-room flat in Marsiling.<br><br>Madam Maryanti always shops around for the cheapest groceries and household goods. She has also cut down on tidbits for her children.<br><br>The family now uses cheaper detergent, which costs about $4 for a 5kg box, compared to her previous brand, which cost $6 for a 3kg box.<br><br>Her three-year-old toddler Khalaf Hubaish drinks Dugrow milk, which costs $8.50 for a 1kg tin, instead of Friso milk, which costs $20 for an equivalent tin. He wears the cheapest diapers that Madam Maryanti can find: $12 for 35 pieces compared to $17 for other brands.<br><br>She buys fish only on Sundays, around noon, when fishmongers are clearing their stocks because the market is closed on Mondays.<br><br>'I can get 2kg of ikan selar kuning (gold-banded scad) or mackerel for just $7, instead of $6 a kilogram.' That is enough to last the family a week.<br><br>She tries to buy more chicken than fish because chicken is cheaper. The family has stopped eating out.<br><br>When she shops for groceries in Johor Baru, she takes along a calculator to make sure that she buys only things which are cheaper after the currency conversion.<br><br>When money dries up towards the end of the month, the children receive less pocket money and take a packed lunch to school.<br><br>To save on electricity charges, the family has cut down on television viewing. Electrical appliances are no longer placed on stand-by mode but switched off when not in use.<br><br>Madam Maryanti said she also makes sure that her children turn off the light when they leave a room. 'We have no choice but to do this. Everything is more expensive now.'<br><br>ndianah@sph.com.sg<br><br>-------------------------------------------------------<br><br><strong>Where does the money go?</strong><br><br>THE Hazalis' combined household income: $2,200<br><br>Their monthly expenses:<br>Groceries: $150<br>Wet market items: $200<br>Utilities: $220<br>Insurance: $380<br>Children's pocket money and transport: $300<br><br>Mr Hazali's lunch money, transport and cigarettes: $500<br><br>Madam Maryanti's monthly savings: $100<br>Miscellaneous items (mobile phone bills, snacks, clothes and so on): $350<br>Total: $2,200<br><br>Copyright, 2007, Singapore Press Holdings Limited[/b]</blockquote>In the 1st place why have up to 5 children when u knw yur living in a place like SG??

But to say they didn't have planning is not entirely true too.<br><br>She was married 15 years ago (1992). That time, the economy has never been better, so they ended up with four 10-somethings. In fact, many believed the economy will roar back after 1997, just like how it did after 1987, but it didn't. Still, in that case, there's no way you can blame them for not being able to tell what the future holds. Who will know that difficult times are to last when times of prosperity were assumed to be back for certain. Let us not forget how many people might be influenced by the Feel Good Times who had a wider readership then before the Internet took over.<br><br>In fact, between 1997 and now is what I feel is "The Lost Decade", like how Japan had it in the 1990's when the economy started collapsing.</div>
