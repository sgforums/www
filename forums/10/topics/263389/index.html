            <div class='col-md body'>Dr. Vivian Balakrishnan was held up as one of the promising younger ministers or new blood and was appointed by ex-PM Goh Chok Tong to be in charge of remaking Singapore.<br><br>During the Annual Conference on Remaking of Singapore in 2002 at Suntec, I as one of the audience present raised the question : "Minister, the major issue of great concern to citizens at this point is the rising costs of living. What do you intend to do in the remaking of Singapore to address this problem?"<br><br>His reply: "Costs have many components. There are the fixed cost and variable cost. The government has no control over variable cost like imported goods and services."<br><br>Instead, in one of his public speeches, he retorted : "Do you have a solution to rising cost of living?"<br><br>So being one of our promising younger ministers and being in charge of remaking of Singapore, he was without doubt given the opportunity to do something to reverse or modify some past policies which caused rising costs of living in the face of dropping wages and structural unemployments e.g. double charging and profiteering by HDB and many GLCs on lands and assets which were already paid by citizens through all sorts of creative accounting.<br><br>He simply avoided the issue and denied problems by asking people instead to give him solutions.<br><br>Has he any record to show that he has succeeded in remaking Singapore or the economy to date?<br><br>Now being the minister in charge of community development is he prepared to take up issues brought up by the youths of today or is he playing safe to safeguard his own career.<br><br>If he is the minister in charge of community development surely when PM Lee decided to donate his salary increment to charity after feeling remorse about the uproar created by the public over the ministers' million-dollar pay again, he should have demonstrated his spirit of community bonding by donating his undeserved salary increment to charity as well.<br><br>What kind of ministers do we have today, really?<br></div>

It is definitely the lee hsien loong who gave him the task to do so.  that lee hsien loong wanna do this I guess is to ease his conscience, make himself look good so they can rest assured and go ahead to extend withdrawal of CPF to 65 year old.<br><br>lee hsien loong is definitely not the one who solves problems, instead he creates problems for the people.   Can't think of any young minister who has abilities to solve problems.  Young ministers solving problems for the party to reach their target they will and are capable,  but to solve problems to care for the people, I doubt!!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>When you were the PM, you had the once-in-a-lifetime rare opportunity to do something for the country by recognizing the root cause of problems like rising costs of living by reversing or modifying wrong government policies such as double charging on lands on housing or basic services.<br><br>The double charging on lands by HDB in sale of low-cost housing at market prices has been exposed by the public without any credible replies from the HDB or Minister Mah Bow Tan to this day. Mah Bow Tan seems to be avoiding this issue.<br><br>So if being the ex-PM, he did not have the courage or ability to check on wrong policies that caused the perpetual rising costs of living thereby undermining the growth and vibrancy of the domestic economy, how could he now offer any good advice to younger ministers when he himself obviously had miserably failed to do so.<br><br>So one by one the young ministers will copy his example by keeping quiet about the whole issue hopefully people will forget them over time.<br><br>Is this sort of leadership the younger generation wants to have nowadays in the age of globalization.<br><br>Do we want to see such pretensions repeated ad nausem in Singapore political evolution?</div>
