              <p>You are digging more and more a hole for yourself.</p>
              <p>People who earn a higher income, definitely will be taxed. There is of course a limit on the total amt of tax deductibles.</p>
              <p>HK$300,000.00??? = S$6,000.00??? You think HK$ is Thai Bhat???</p>
              <p>HK$300,000.00 = S$53,000.00. You cannot even get your exchange rate correct.</p>
              <p>You are now trying to claim that you are right through knowing some 'people' over in HK, which probably doesn't exist. If you wish, I can even quote you some more articles that compare (ON A NEUTRAL basis) taxation between Singapore and HK.</p>
              <p>And if you really like to dig a hole even further, and like to compare with real people, I have ACTUAL relatives in HK, and so far, I know that their taxes are better than ours.</p>
              <p>If that's STILL not enough, I nearly had gone to Hong Kong to work before, and I also did a study of their HK taxation to know whether it's beneficial to go over than to stay in Singapore. In the end, I did not go, coz I decided to come to USA instead.</p>
              <p>Perhaps I am a nerd, but at least I am not you, for you are the greatest liar I have ever seen.</p>
              <p>Just be gracious and admit it, and stop digging a hole to show us your ignorance.</p>

              <p>I don't deny that USA has more taxes. But I am just paid more than enough to ensure I earn well even after I nett off taxes. Moreover, I do not just compare based on taxes, or salaries, etc, but also on the cost of living. And I dare say right now that USA's cost of living is actually lower than Singapore or HK.</p>
              <p>And, do not forget that HK is NOT exactly under communist policies, due to the 1 country, 2 policies rule for 50 years.</p>
              <p>What is there to mislead? light123 just brought up the ACCA paper questions on HK taxation. I brought up official articles for you to read. I DARE say you have not read anything, and you just keep trying to lie your way through everything.</p>
              <p>If HK taxes are higher than Singapore's, then ACCA papers are wrong? Official articles are wrong? Between your word using some 'personal experience' (which we still do not know whether its true or not), versus official articles and ACCA papers, who should we believe?</p>
              <p>You can forget about me mentioning my personal experience on this, coz official articles already tell you that you are a liar.</p>

              <p>As I said, IRA's official articles are all up on the net to read. Why do you need to call them and ask "Who's taxes are lower? Yours or Singapore's?" I wonder they really will bother to answer this question since all the answers are on their website</p>

              <p>I don't mind meeting you to go HK, but that has to be a year or so later, when I am on home leave and on my entitled trip home to Singapore. I love HK's cantonese roasted duck *slurp*, though I think roasted goose is overhyped.</p>
              <p>As I said, IRA's official articles are all up on the net to read. Why do you need to call them and ask "Who's taxes are lower? Yours or Singapore's?" I wonder they really will bother to answer this question since all the answers are on their website</p>

              <p><br>if u still wanted to refer to net info to decide your points, i have nothing more to said, i am a person of reality, i can read, then i venture and investigate, not blur blur follow the info and hit a lamp post, so it net wrote Wanchai roast duck is nice, you believe it?? when i went there, the best roast duck rice is at Empress Restuarant, Wong Tai Sin place. That is why, i say nerd are nerd, over depend on net is not going to tell you a thousand stories, net is just like news, can be manipulated, and unlike newspaper or advertisment, you cannot even sue them for any non update or irrelevant information, for leisure and knowledge reading, it is ok, but for serious business or migration and any other personal life changes, you hv to check it out.</p>
              <p>I will be free this Jan, got kris flyer point free to go down, if you are on, i enagage my business partner over there, and we can meet at Wong Tai Sin place, outskirt of kowloon. Just tell me the hotel you are in, i can get someone down to fetch you, or you prefer to buy Octopus card, the MTR station is Wong Tai Sin.</p>

              <p><br>You are comparing  on corporate taxes, dun forget Singapore do not collect uncorporate business, a gain for all those SME and food sellers, in HK, whatever you do, you have to paid 15% of your shop tax on top of you own personnel income tax + your land tax which is very high in HK, and furthermore, HK do not have Job Credit and Tax rebate scheme as like Singapore.</p>

              <p>It need even less knowledge to conduct its flesh trade which is sufficient for its skills to meet the requirements of a global economy - the Taiwanese 'hum' is unbeatable in its skill to flap its clitoris to spread its ignorance and get satisfaction in getting all the attention to its whorish demands.</p>

              <p>It is a surprise that the Taiwanese 'hum' can claim to be a female and do not know if it has any holes ?</p>
              <p>It will not be a surprise if there are more holes in the Taiwanese 'hum' with multiple clitoris planted to help itself to flap so much ignorance that attract all the much needed attention to its whorish ways.</p>
              <p>It is not a surprise that the Taiwanese 'hum' will put up childish challenges that leads to further idiocy - which only serves to satisfy its agenda to drag this thread into further irrelevance, and also into deeper controversies setup over its deliberate stupidity.</p>
              <p>Until every thread get driven into the ground by the deliberate efforts of the Taiwanese 'hum' to make every thread into more nonsensical exchange with its ignorance - it will continue to post its garbage to get its orgasmic fix as an "Attention Seeking Whore".</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>The whore in the Taiwanese 'hum' was never a doubt, what else can it further display besides it ignorance and its flapping clitoris that wags its ignorance in every thread.</p>
              <p>What else can be expected from a Taiwanese 'hum' to perform its self-acclaimed HR role in the flesh trade - that is no more then the known role in 'hum-relations' ?</p>

              <p><br>Obviously the Taiwanese 'hum' has yet to get its orgasmic fix last night as it failed to sell any of its body parts in the flesh trade, and is now looking to "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">bulldoze those U grads till their pants drop</span></em>".</p>
              <p>What can a Taiwanese 'hum' do when the U grads drop their pants ?</p>
              <p>One look at the Taiwanese 'hum' the grads stick the 'hum' into the swill bin and make a U-Turn and get its money back the door.</p>
              <p>When will the Taiwanese 'hum' learn to stop flapping its clitoris in a public forum after its tongue already got tired out from overworking to get the needed orgasmic fix for its "Attention Seeking Whore" inside the 'hum'.</p>
