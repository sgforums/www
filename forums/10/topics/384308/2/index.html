              <p>I believe cutting GST does not suit that particular party's agenda.    No need give stupid excuse if they refuse to cut GST to lower the living costs during this recession for the people.    Pay them so much to talk crap, illogical.</p>

              <p><br>i believe if you shop at NTUC or Sheng Siong there is no Gst, but if you shop your necessities at up town Market place, Taka, Metro, Cold storage...then you get the paid Gst. Let me give u a scenario, Ah Huat is a workers earning 2k per month, Angel is a CEO, earning 15k per month. Ah Huat goes to NTUC, a walking distance from his house to buy his neccessities, Angel goes to Takashimaya to do her shopping, every month Ah Huat spent about $200 with no Gst at NTUC, Angel also spent $200 but with Gst of $14, Car parking $20, Petrol $10, ERP $6, Car depreciation $20 car insurance..road tax  etc etc which total up to about $260. And yet when i comes to rebates, Ah Huat get full rebates of $300 Gst rebates and other govt rebates of $600, totally $900. And Angel get nothing if she is consider as the upper rich, yet she is been taxed both on income and public spending. In the end, govt used Angel tax to create job credits so that company do not retrench workers, free education and upgrading for Singaporeans at e2i or learning Hub, bursaries, back to school voucher, transport vouchers, Power Supply offset vouchers, linkpoints for NTUC shopping, rebate of 5% for NTUC shopper..etc etc. And Angel get nothing but pay and pay.</p>
              <p>Therefore, Ah Huat gained from Gst, if only he knows how to be thrift about his spending and not anyhow go and spent on clubs or gals or lotteries, that is why govt keep telling people, to spend within your means, you will not lose out.</p>

              <p><br>DPM Wong could be right, in Singapore we had cut Corporate tax from 33% to about 20%, this to attract FDI and MNC here, and was done in a staggered pattern, then to recover the lost, Govt instill GST from 3% to current 7%, so if Gst is to reduce, Corpoarte tax may go up again, leading to high business cost.

              I shop there many times, NTUC always give me free vouchers, I also
              got discount vouchers, you have to rub shoulder with those guys on
              the top ya. Last time, i shop at cold storage, a month spent about
              $1000 which my Dad give me every month for essential and
              groceries items, today, at NTUC i spent $300 can already. But of
              course you have to bear to shop with bangala, PRC and some poor
              singaporeans whereas uptown supermarket are more classy.</p>

              <p><br>The fact is they got no rebate and relief in their taxes, you go the right fact or not??? In fact, most of the lower earning singaporeans are not even paying taxes after so much relief, and a poor HKees still have to pay taxes even if he had 10 childrens ya.
