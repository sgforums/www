              <p>Malaysia: GST Bill tabled, fierce debates expected</p>
              <p><span class="time">December 16, 2009</span></p>
              <p><strong>By Syed Jaymal Zahiid from The Malaysian Insider</strong></p>
              <p>The government today tabled a law to introduce a controversial Goods and Services Tax (GST) which it says is necessary to broaden the tax base but the opposition claims will be a burden on ordinary Malaysians.</p>
              <p>Under the proposal, the government is looking at a GST rate of four per cent.</p>
              <p>The GST will be replacing the current Sales and Services Tax (SST) system which the government claims is costing businesses and consumers more.</p>
              <p>Finance Minister II Datuk Seri Ahmad Husni Hanadzlah later told reporters the government is estimating an increase of RM1 billion in tax collection or RM13 billion in total in the first year of the tax system’s implementation.</p>
              <p>The SST had only managed to rake in RM12 billion and has also proven to have “inherent weaknesses”, Husni added.</p>
              <p>The replacement of the SST with the GST will also see businesses save RM4 billion from GST while exporters, RM1.4 billion, he claimed.</p>
              <p>The GST’s implementation will not be a stroll in the park for the government as it expects to face fierce opposition from political rivals who are already campaigning against its implementation.</p>
              <p>Pakatan Rakyat has already set up an anti-GST task force which claims the implementation — when income growth has been stagnant — will only burden the electorate.</p>
              <p>Husni, however, said there was no need for voters to worry about its implementation as the GST will exempt taxation on basic products like rice, vegetables, sugar, flour, cooking oil, fish, beef and chicken.</p>
              <p>“Also small and medium enterprises with revenue below RM500,000 will be exempted from the GST,” he Husni.</p>
              <p>Debate on the Bill will proceed in March next year. The government is expected to go on a major exercise next week to campaign for GST by explaining to the public the rationale for introducing the new tax.</p>
              <p>The tabling of the GST Bill, however, did not proceed smoothly as Pakatan Rakyat (PR) lawmakers, who are opposed to its implementation, tried their best to delay proceedings.</p>
              <p>Teluk Intan DAP parliamentarian M. Manogaran stood to object, saying that there were many other Bills left unresolved but his objection was shot down by Deputy Speaker Datuk Wan Junaidi Wan Jaafar.</p>
              <p>The government plans to fully implement the GST in mid-2011. – The Malaysian Insider</p>

              <p>Malaysia: GST Bill tabled, fierce debates expected</p>
              <p><span>December 16, 2009</span></p>
              <p><strong>By Syed Jaymal Zahiid from The Malaysian
                              Insider</strong></p>
              <p>The government today tabled a law to introduce a controversial
                              Goods and Services Tax (GST) which it says is necessary to broaden
                              the tax base but the opposition claims will be a burden on ordinary
                              Malaysians.</p>
              <p>Under the proposal, the government is looking at a GST rate of
                              four per cent.</p>

              <p>Malaysia cuts fuel subsidy (Written by Jed Yoong) </p>
              <p>Wednesday, 04 June 2008 The half of Kuala Lumpur’s budget that was going to energy support is no longer sustainable ...</p>
              <p>"hefty fuel subsidies that would have cost RM56 billion this year, about half of the government’s revenue."</p>
              <p>...</p>
              <p>So Malaysia can avoid GST if they reduce fuel subsidies. Singapore on the other hand, can start taxing diesel/ tax based on emissions in more taxes need be raised. </p>
