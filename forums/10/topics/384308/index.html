              <p><span class="postbody">By Gabriel Chen Dec 8, 2009 
              <br> <br> 'Leaders must have the conviction to push through what needs to be done, rather than what is politically expedient or populist.'
              <br> <br> LEADERS must have the conviction to do what is right and not what is
              popular, even if it costs them political points, said Deputy Prime
              Minister Wong Kan Seng yesterday.
              <br> <br>He told a leadership forum that a crisis may give leaders the
              platform and momentum to drive difficult reforms, but such tough
              measures become harder to pursue once the economy rallies. <br> <br> Businesses and employees would be reluctant to see the withdrawal of
              temporary support measures put in place during the downturn, and they
              might also be wary of moves to tighten credit and strengthen corporate
              governance.
              <br> <br>'In such a situation, leaders must have the conviction to push
              through what needs to be done, rather than what is politically
              expedient or populist,' Mr Wong said.
              <br> <br>He cited a range of populist measures that the Government avoided
              during the recession - decisions that did earn some criticism from some
              groups and observers.
              <br> <br>There were calls to temporarily cut the goods and services tax
              (GST) and Central Providend Fund (CPF) contribution rate for employers
              - 'appealing arguments which we thoroughly assessed and ultimately
              rejected', he said.
              <br> <br>The belief was that a lower GST rate would boost consumer spending,
              while payroll costs would fall with a cut to the employer CPF
              contribution rate.
              <br> <br> Mr Wong explained yesterday why the Government did not heed both calls.
              <br> <br>He said the fundamental problem during the recession was not one of
              wage competitiveness, but a slump in global demand. So cutting the
              employer CPF contribution rate would not have been appropriate.
              <br> <br>'An across-the-board cut in wages was not warranted,' he said,
              adding that the Government's $4.5 billion Jobs Credit scheme provided
              employers with temporary relief on wage costs.
              <br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: normal;">On the calls for slashing the GST rate, <span style="font-weight: bold;">Mr Wong said such a move might actually raise business costs, </span>as companies would have to change their systems to adjust to a new GST rate</span>.</span> <br>He was speaking at the fifth Asia Economic Summit yesterday, an
              event that brings together leading strategic thinkers, government
              officials and corporate chiefs to brainstorm and discuss the strategic
              challenges that Asia faces and the prospects ahead.
              <br> <br>Other speakers included Penang Chief Minister Lim Guan Eng; Mr
              Joseph Tan, Credit Suisse's Asian chief economist for private banking;
              and Mr Wei Jianguo, secretary-general of the China Centre for
              International Economic Exchanges.
              <br> <br>Mr Lim said the unipolar world, dominated by the United States, has
              given way to a global economy that is becoming more multipolar in
              nature.
              <br> <br>Meanwhile, Mr Wei urged leaders to strengthen regional cooperation,
              actively explore a new growth model, protect the environment and
              achieve stable long-term development.</span></p>

              <p>the differences is, when Gst increase, Govt will help organisations to adapt and plan for them for a period of time, but if Gst decrease, Govt being on the losing side, how to help them to adapt, so companies would had to change the system themselves.</p>
              <p>If Gst is to reduce, govt tax dept will lose out, thereby unable to fund project such as jobs credits, silk upgrading which they had poured billions into it. It is not cheap ok, without the govt intervention, credits and also thanks to our reserve, in the last recession, we could had been wipe off the market.</p>

              <p>  I would have to disagree with you on this.</p>
              <p>Though you may be true about service charge, but for Gst, it is everywhere.</p>
              <p>Everything to buy is included with Gst, from Electronics at Courts, to Fresh Stock at Supermarkets, to small items at Convenience stalls like 7-Eleven.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>  And, since the Gst was previously 5%, if it were really to reduce to 5%, businesses would just have to revert back to their old systems.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>BTW, would it cost alot to change the systems?</p>

              <p>angel7030,</p>
              <p>you spoke a similar tone as minister v bala, and I love to engage a talk with someone with an intellectual level as minister v bala.</p>
              <p>You said "eat at hawker centre, no Gst" =&gt; You must belong to the elite family (GCT's wife family) who cannot see through that the hawkers need to pay gst to their raw materials and landlord. The cost increase is pass to the customers. If you don't see the price increase, check out the quantity of food you are getting in hawker centre.</p>
              <p>You said "Gst to fund to job credit." Get your figures right, Gst is not enough to fund job credit totally. It was drawn from the reserves. Job credit is devised by the government to help the people, cool. If government come up with a idea, be responsible for it. Don't stress the people with more taxing. If the intention is to make rich people pay more, why introduce in the consumption tax (GST) only , increase the income tax bracket for high income earners. The elite protects the elite, who in the elite family wants to pay more in income tax.</p>
              <p>And if V Bala wants to allocate $20M social project to welcome new immigrants into our estate, why so stingy with $20 increase in social welfare monthly payout to poor people?</p>
              <p>And V Bala is so concerned with bar top dancing and jealousy fight in bar, he should oversee the geylang industry now, 10 times worse. And worst still, he is a minister for community development youth sport, why is he supporting casino? To create more job and drive economy? why only about 3000 odd poor people get monthly state welfare now out of 3.5M singaporean. More bar top dancing and jealous fight for him to talk about in the future ?</p>
              <p>Angel7030, to help yourself, please think of the poor people life, they may not afford a meal at hawker centres. And your logic collapses. And if you say it is only few people in the whole of singapore cannot afford a meal, I tell you one people is too many for ministers drawing top dollars benchmarked to top profession's pay. Do they want to benchmark with  poor people indicators?</p>

              <p><br>i believe if you shop at NTUC or Sheng Siong there is no Gst, but if you shop your necessities at up town Market place, Taka, Metro, Cold storage...then you get the paid Gst. Let me give u a scenario, Ah Huat is a workers earning 2k per month, Angel is a CEO, earning 15k per month. Ah Huat goes to NTUC, a walking distance from his house to buy his neccessities, Angel goes to Takashimaya to do her shopping, every month Ah Huat spent about $200 with no Gst at NTUC, Angel also spent $200 but with Gst of $14, Car parking $20, Petrol $10, ERP $6, Car depreciation $20 car insurance..road tax  etc etc which total up to about $260. And yet when i comes to rebates, Ah Huat get full rebates of $300 Gst rebates and other govt rebates of $600, totally $900. And Angel get nothing if she is consider as the upper rich, yet she is been taxed both on income and public spending. In the end, govt used Angel tax to create job credits so that company do not retrench workers, free education and upgrading for Singaporeans at e2i or learning Hub, bursaries, back to school voucher, transport vouchers, Power Supply offset vouchers, linkpoints for NTUC shopping, rebate of 5% for NTUC shopper..etc etc. And Angel get nothing but pay and pay.</p>
              <p>Therefore, Ah Huat gained from Gst, if only he knows how to be thrift about his spending and not anyhow go and spent on clubs or gals or lotteries, that is why govt keep telling people, to spend within your means, you will not lose out.</p>
