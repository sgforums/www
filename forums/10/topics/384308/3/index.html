So, what is HK 12,000 USD one time personal relief comparing to us, govt got give them any other rebate or not???</p>

              <p>I will give you some more background so that you don't embarass yourself on HK matters in future.</p>
              <p>Excerpts from an article:</p>
              <p>http://www.freedomandprosperity.org/Papers/hongkong/hongkong.shtml</p>
              <p><span>The net effects of the allowances, personal deductions, brackets and rates of tax are as follows.</span></p>
              <ol>
              <li><span>Most
              people (about 60 percent of the working population) pay no tax on their
              incomes at all (because the allowances and deductions to which their
              circumstances entitle them effectively exempt them from tax altogether).<br> </span></li>
              <li><span>Of
              those whose incomes are taxable (that is, the other 40 percent), the
              great majority pay at an average rate of less than 16 percent. The
              reason for this is that the allowances, personal deductions and
              progressive rates of tax (2 percent, 8 percent, 12 percent and 17
              percent) produce a total liability of less than 16 percent.<br> </span></li>
              <li><span>A
              very small number pay tax at 16 percent. This rate of tax applies only
              where it produces a lesser total liability than would the progressive
              rates (2 percent, 8 percent, 12 percent and 17 percent).</span></li>
              </ol>

              <p>You know, angel7030</p>
              <p>the further you go on this topic, the deeper the hole you dig</p>
              <p>I refer to an extract from the article:</p>
              <p>"<span>There are also <span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>tax allowances for children and for various
                          categories of dependent relatives (parents, grandparents, siblings,
                          etc)</strong></span></span>. The effect of these is to exempt the first part of the taxpayer's
                          income from tax - the amount exempted depending on the taxpayer's
                          personal circumstances (marital status, number of children, etc)."</span></p>
              <p>In short, there are tax deductibles for children AND parents, and EVEN grandparents (which Singapore does not have)</p>
              <p>Whether you had been to HK or not, is not my concern.</p>
              <p>What is A FACT right now, is that you know NOTHING about the HK Tax system, and yet you behave as if you know it. Be gracious and admit it and just shut up, and perhaps you will spare yourself further embarassment.</p>

              <p>the further you go on this topic, the deeper the hole you dig</p>
              <p>I refer to an extract from the article:</p>
              <p>"<span>There are also <span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>tax allowances for children and for various categories of dependent relatives (parents, grandparents, siblings, etc)</strong></span></span>. The effect of these is to exempt the first part of the taxpayer's income from tax - the amount exempted depending on the taxpayer's personal circumstances (marital status, number of children, etc)."</span></p>
              <p>In short, there are tax deductibles for children AND parents, and EVEN grandparents (which Singapore does not have)</p>
              <p>Whether you had been to HK or not, is not my concern.</p>
              <p>What is A FACT right now, is that you know NOTHING about the HK Tax system, and yet you behave as if you know it. Be gracious and admit it and just shut up, and perhaps you will spare yourself further embarassment.</p>

              <p>You are digging more and more a hole for yourself.</p>
              <p>People who earn a higher income, definitely will be taxed. There is of course a limit on the total amt of tax deductibles.</p>
              <p>HK$300,000.00??? = S$6,000.00??? You think HK$ is Thai Bhat???</p>
              <p>HK$300,000.00 = S$53,000.00. You cannot even get your exchange rate correct.</p>
              <p>You are now trying to claim that you are right through knowing some 'people' over in HK, which probably doesn't exist. If you wish, I can even quote you some more articles that compare (ON A NEUTRAL basis) taxation between Singapore and HK.</p>
              <p>And if you really like to dig a hole even further, and like to compare with real people, I have ACTUAL relatives in HK, and so far, I know that their taxes are better than ours.</p>
              <p>If that's STILL not enough, I nearly had gone to Hong Kong to work before, and I also did a study of their HK taxation to know whether it's beneficial to go over than to stay in Singapore. In the end, I did not go, coz I decided to come to USA instead.</p>
              <p>Perhaps I am a nerd, but at least I am not you, for you are the greatest liar I have ever seen.</p>

              <p>You started off ASKING me whether they got other rebates. This shows you DO NOT know much about the taxation in HK. (Even one-time personal relief is incorrect, but I am too lazy to point out to you that)</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>"they have indeed only one ductible, no children relief, they wanted less population and they dun care about your parents too, all is expected to work and save. I just been to HK and get to know their social impact from my HK business partner and you tell me i got no where to go?? You must be joking."</em></span></p>
              <p>You continued to insist they have ONLY ONE deductible, and NO relief for children and parents. You started to delude all of us by claiming you have a business partner in HK.</p>
              <p>And when I bring out actual data to show you, you ended up with this statement</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>"their reliefs need to apply and most will not get it, unlike ours, we automatically qualify, I talk to a HKee working there..."</em></span></p>
              <p>So instead of your business partner, you next change source to a HKee and now claim that you KNOW they have reliefs, but most cannot be applied.</p>
              <p>So from not knowing anything, to 'evolving' to knowing something after I posted OFFICIAL articles for you to see.</p>
              <p>IF you are not the greatest liar, I don't know who else is.</p>

              <p><br>My goodness, you read from where, book or net??? you got be real ok, their reliefs need to apply and most will not get it, unlike ours, we automatically qualify, I talk to a HKee working there and you think they give me shit about their taxes, i was like you thinking that they have a less tax to pay, and she laughed with tea nearly pewed out of her cup. You better get the right picture, the words "depend" is very important in HK ok, if you are earning HK 300,000 in Hk, equivalent to about &amp; S$6000, you can kiss goodbye to all those relief ok, please go there and check it out if you have relatives or HK colleagues, the only thing that is free in HK, is anything gain from shares, stocks and gambling now happy valley, is not taxable, this is to encourage investement to uphold a vibrant HK financial services market ya. That is why peoples in HK like to invest and gamble in 6 nos and horses. I know you look at google or nets or study some shit, but which country dun give you a good picture of their taxation system, dun be fool by them ya. They are admiring our Tax system more than theirs and you can said they paid less tax??? U know how much the Brit had took from them?? and now you think the good old China Beijing govt is going let them have all those relief when China country side are having no jobs and suffering?? I think, you are a really a nerd.</p>

              <p>the further you go on this topic, the deeper the hole you dig</p>
              <p>I refer to an extract from the article:</p>
              <p>"<span>There are also <span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>tax allowances for children and for various categories of dependent relatives (parents, grandparents, siblings, etc)</strong></span></span>. The effect of these is to exempt the first part of the taxpayer's income from tax - the amount exempted depending on the taxpayer's personal circumstances (marital status, number of children, etc)."</span></p>
              <p>In short, there are tax deductibles for children AND parents, and EVEN grandparents (which Singapore does not have)</p>
              <p>Whether you had been to HK or not, is not my concern.</p>
              <p>What is A FACT right now, is that you know NOTHING about the HK Tax system, and yet you behave as if you know it. Be gracious and admit it and just shut up, and perhaps you will spare yourself further embarassment.</p>
