              <p><span>Temasek Review - January 25, 2010</span></p>
              <p><strong>Written by Our Correspondent</strong></p>
              <p>PAP MPs rallied to the side of Singapore strongman Lee Kuan Yew after a citizen asked Education Minister Dr Ng Eng Hen last Friday during a dialogue session with NUS Alumni on why he is not stepping down. (read article <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.temasekreview.com/2010/01/23/ng-eng-hen-tanjong-pagar-constitutents-free-to-vote-mm-lee-out-if-they-feel-hes-not-adding-value/"><span style="color: #a91b33;">here</span></a>)</p>
              <p>Dr Ng replied that his constituents at Tanjong Pagar are free to vote him out if they feel he is not “adding value” to Singapore.</p>
              <p>Chinese tabloid Shin Min daily responded swiftly with a blatantly one-sided article defending MM Lee quoting from a few PAP MPs all of whom implored Lee to stay on.</p>
              <p>Fellow Tanjong Pagar MP Baey Kam Keng claimed that Lee is still “very popular” with his constituents.</p>
              <p>Nee Soon Central MP Ong Ah Heng said:</p>
              <p><em>“MM Lee should not retire and should stay on as he is adding value to both Singapore and Singaporeans.”</em></p>
              <p>Another MP Lee Bee Wah (previously a Malaysian) whose opinions are now “highly” sought after by the Chinese press added:</p>
              <p><em>“MM Lee has a lot of foresight and is concerned about Singapore’s future. He will think of what happened 20 and 30 years later and he doesn’t mind introducing unpopular policies.”</em></p>
              <p>Lee admitted to an audience of Japanese business leaders lately that he is “not doing much work except forecasting”.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, Lee’s “forecasts” are mostly wrong. In 2007, he boasted unashamedly that Singapore would enter a “golden period” for the next few decades. A year later, Singapore became the first Asian country to enter into a recession and is still barely out of it.</p>
              <p>As Chairman of Government Investment Corporation which managed Singapore’s national reserves, he or his team made a few dubious investment decisions which caused Singapore to lose billions of dollars last year, the exact amount of losses remained unknown to this very day.</p>
              <p>Though he proclaimed himself to be taking a backseat in the cabinet, many Singaporeans still believe that he is the real power behind the throne.</p>
              <p>A former Prime Minister of Singapore, Lee is the oldest MP in Parliament at 86 years of age. Now assuming the position of “Minister Mentor” which is unheard of anywhere in the world, Lee draws an annual salary of about $3 million dollars, or more than 6 times that of U.S. President Barack Obama.</p>
              <p>While Lee still have some blind supporters from the previous generations, many young Singaporeans are either indifferent to him or are strongly opposed to his continued role in the Singapore government, judging from the comments posted in the internet chatrooms.</p>
              <p>Lee’s growing unpopularity among the young voters may prove to be a liability for the PAP in the next general election. He recently peeved off an entire nation with his insensitive remarks about Singaporeans in an interview with National Geographic magazine.</p>
              <p>He told the journalist Mark Jacobson that though he was aware of the fact that “many Singaporeans are unhappy with the influx of immigrants”, he continued to insist that it is for “good” of the nation:</p>
              <p><em>“Over time, Singaporeans have become less hard-driving and hard-striving. This is why it is a good thing that the nation has welcomed so many Chinese immigrants.”</em> Lee was quoted saying.</p>
              <p>Lee described the country’s new subjects as “hungry,” with parents who “pushed the children very hard.”</p>
              <p><em>“If native Singaporeans are falling behind because the spurs are not stuck into the hide, that is their problem,”</em> he quipped.</p>

              <p> <strong>EDITORS’ NOTE:</strong></p>
              <p><em>The Temasek Review is of the view that MM Lee not only does not add any value to Singapore or Singaporeans, he is becoming a liability to the nation with many flawed and myopic policies which caused tremendous suffering to ordinary Singaporeans. We call on Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong to heed public opinion especially from young Singaporeans and ask his father to step down by the next election or risk the PAP losing votes.</em></p>

              <p> +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p>
              <p>Understandable that PAP ministers are not for LKY to retire.     Nobody would dare to tell his or her boss to retire.</p>
              <p>What is missing is they keep saying he adds value but did not state how he adds value.</p>
              <p>Bottomline is we are the ones feeding LKY and the PAP ministers, the people of Singapore should have the last say and should be taken seriously.   We are the boss of LKY and all PAP ministers.   Without us, it is impossible they get paid at all.  Who dare not to listen to the boss?  hahahah</p>

              <p>Of course MM Lee is still adding value to Singapore; he’s adding negative value, just like how his daughter-in-law earned negative profits of $48,000,000,000/- for Temasek Holdings.</p>
              <p><strong>Progressive polltics ahead on Mon, 25th Jan 2010 12:21 pm </strong></p>
              <p>I think the MM can still contribute BUT not officially as MM drawing such a monstrous salary at $250,000 per month. He can give informal advice to the parliament – that’s all. At that age, accountability has no more meaning. what if he makes wrong decisions and they are proven wrong?? What does accountability mean? If there is no meaningful accountability, I think the responsibility should not be given.</p>

              <p>Everyone must make Boss happy to keep his job.<br>The one who make Him the happiest will get promoted and maximum bonuses. Maybe Boss will give him a giant Ang Bao during Chinese New Year, maybe a Minister post or a GLC or 2.</p>

              care..to ensure they dun work for these external powers or
              agencies....to use power hungry opposition to topple Singapore so
              as to control us ..if that happens....we fall into hands of

              <p>and can we be sure LKY isn't controlled by some foreign power................think about it, no one in his right mind will dare take S'pore independent when we even depends on others for food and water............much less economic survival................did the Brits really so willingly gave up control of such a vital geographic location............???</p>
