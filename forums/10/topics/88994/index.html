NOt only in singapore, all over the world.<br><br>In my primary school a very very long time ago, there was this security guard that shouted at kids just because they did things he didnt like. what right does he have to do that? he was just a FUcking security guard. I bet that moron is probably sleeping on the streets today begging for food somewhere.<br><br>then there was once I was at a shopping center. I was standing at the escalator waiting for my parents to come out from a shop. then this clumsy woman walk past and knocked over the rubbish bin. then I put the bin up. and later another person also walk past and knock the bin over. tamade, so many clumsy people in this world. so I put up the bin again. then some FUcking security guard came over and scolded me because he thought I was knocking over the bin for fun. security guards should get their heads out of their asses.<br><br>Just recently, I was reading at a bookstand in a supermarket. then all of a sudden a moronic assclown approached me from behind and flashed something in front of me which I didnt even see. "Security" he said. he said I was standing their for a very long time, and I was not allowed to stand  there and read book. I was like wtf. then I complained to the customer service and I was told that the security guard was an undercover. I almost laughed if I was not so pissed off. undercover security guard? then I was told that I had to do whatever the security guard says because he finds me suspicious and he has the right to make me leave. WTF. I was damn angry and I went to argue with the "undercover" but he was giving me all sorts of BullShit. then later I called the manager of the supermarket and I was bent on getting that motherFucker fired but of course the phony manager was like "we apologize, we apologize" stupid gay, if you are sincere you would have fired the assclown.<br><br>I hate people. some people in this world are alive only because its against the law to kill them.<br><br>and I wouldnt be surprised if the security guard at SUNTEC was being unreasonable because all security guards are retards.</div>
