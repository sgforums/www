              <p><span><em>European banks face an entirely new wave
                          of losses in coming months not yet calculated in any government bank
                          rescue aid to date. Unlike the losses of US banks which derive
                          initially from their exposures to low-quality sub-prime real estate and
                          other securitized lending, the problems of western European banks, most
                          especially in Austria, Sweden and perhaps Switzerland
                          arise from the massive volumes of loans they made during the 2002-2007
                          period of extreme low international interest rates to clients in
                          eastern European countries.</em> </span></p>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB">The problems in Eastern Europe
                          which are just now emerging with full force are, if you will, an
                          indirect consequence of the libertine monetary policies of the
                          Greenspan Fed from 2002 until 2006, the period where Wall Street’s
                          asset backed securitization Ponzi Scheme took off.<strong></strong></span></p>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB">The riskiness of these
                          eastern European loans is now coming to light as the global economic
                          recession in both east and west Europe is forcing western banks to pull
                          back, refusing to renew loans or ‘rollover’ the credits, leaving
                          thousands of borrowers with unpayable loan debts. The dimension of the
                          eastern European emerging loan crisis pales anything yet realized. It
                          will force a radical new look at the entire question of bank
                          nationalizations in coming weeks regardless what nice hopes politicians
                          in any party entertain.</span></p>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB">Moody’s Rating Service
                          has just announced it ‘might’ downgrade a number of western European
                          banks with large exposures to eastern Europe. On the report, the Euro
                          fell to 2 and a half month lows against the dollar. </span></p>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB">The Moodys report
                          mentioned especially banks in eastern Europe owned by western European
                          banks including specifically Raiffeisen Zenetralbank Oesterreich and Sweden’s
                          Swedbank. The public Moody’s warning will now force western banks with
                          subsidiaries in eastern Europe to dramatically tighten lending
                          conditions in the east at just the time the opposite is needed to keep
                          economic growth from collapsing and thereby setting off chair-reaction
                          loan defaults. The western banks are caught in a devil’s circle. </span></p>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB">According to my well-informed City of London
                          sources, the new concerns over bank exposures to eastern Europe will
                          define the next wave of the global financial crisis, one they believe
                          could be even more devastating than the US sub-prime securitization collapse which triggered the entire crisis of confidence.<span>  </span></span></p>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB">As a result of the
                          Moody’s warning, west European banks will now likely be selective in
                          supporting their subsidiaries. Moody’s report noted that ‘banks in
                          countries that are associated with higher systemic risks might face
                          reduced support.’ Western European governments may also establish rules
                          to ensure banks receiving state support are forbidden to aid foreign
                          subsidiaries. This is already the case with Greek banks and the Greek
                          Government. The result is to make a bad situation far worse. </span></p>
              <p><strong><span lang="EN-GB">The size of risks are staggering</span></strong></p>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB">The amount of loans
                          potentially at risk involve mostly Italian, Austrian, Swiss, Swedish
                          and it is believed German banks. Once the countries of the former Soviet Union
                          and Warsaw Pact declared independence in the early 1990’s west European
                          banks rushed in to buy on the cheap the major banks in most of the
                          newly independent east countries. As US interest rate cuts after the
                          stock crisis in 2002 <span> </span>pushed interest rates
                          around the world to new lows, easy credit led to higher risk lending
                          across borders in foreign currencies. In countries such as Hungary
                          Swiss and Austrian banks promoted home mortgage loans denominated in
                          Swiss Franc where interest rates were significantly lower. The only
                          risk at the time was if the Hungarian currency were to devalue, forcing
                          homeowners in Hungary
                          to repay sometimes double the monthly amount in Swiss Francs. That is
                          what has happened over the past 18 months as western banks and funds
                          have dramatically reduced their speculative investments in eastern
                          countries to repatriate capital back home where the mother banks had
                          serious problems caused by the US
                          banking catastrophe. In the case of the Polish Zloty, the currency has
                          dropped in recent months by 50%. The volume of mortgages existing in
                          foreign currencies in Poland is not known but London estimates are that it could be huge.</span></p>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB">In the case of Austrian
                          banks, the country faces a rerun of the 1931 Vienna Creditanstalt
                          crisis which in chain-reaction spread to the German banks and brought
                          Continental Europe into the economic crisis of 1931-33. At the recent
                          EU Finance Ministers’ meeting in Brussels,
                          Austrian Finance Minister Josef Pröll reportedly pleaded with his
                          colleagues to come up with a €150 billion rescue package for the banks
                          in eastern Europe. Austrian banks alone have lent €230 billion there,
                          equivalent to 70% of Austria’s GDP. Austria’s largest bank, Bank Austria, which in turn is owned by Italy’s Unicredito along with the German HypoVereinsbank, faces what the Vienna press calls a ‘monetary Stalingrad’ over its loan exposure in the east. In a botter historic irony, Bank Austria bought the Vienna Creditanstalt in recent years in its wave of mergers. </span></p>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB">According to estimates published in the Vienna
                          financial press, were only 10% of the Austrian loans in the east to
                          default in coming months, it ‘would lead to the collapse of the
                          Austrian financial system.’ The EU’s European Bank for Reconstruction
                          and Development (EBRD) in London estimates that bad debts in the east will exceed 10% and ‘may reach 20%.’ </span></p>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB">German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück reportedly flatly rejected any EU rescue funds for the east, claiming it was not Germany’s
                          problem. He may soon regret that as the crisis spreads to German banks
                          and results in far greater costs to German taxpayers. One of the most
                          striking aspects of the present crisis which first erupted in summer of
                          2007 is the increasingly evident incompetence of leading finance
                          ministers and central bankers from Washington to Brussels to Paris and Frankfurt and Berlin to deal resolutely with the crisis. </span></p>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB">The London office of US
                          investment bank, Morgan Stanley has issued a report estimating the
                          total of western European bank lending to the east. According to the
                          report Eastern Europe has borrowed a
                          total of more than $1.7 TRILLION abroad from mainly west European
                          banks. Much of that has been short-term borrowing of less than a year.
                          In 2009 eastern countries must repay or roll-over (renew) some $400
                          billion, fully 33% of the region’s total GDP. As global recession
                          deepens the chances of that are fading by the day. Now western banks
                          are refusing to roll-over such loans, under political pressure and
                          financial pressure back home. The credit window in the east, only two
                          years ago the source of booming profits for the west European banks,
                          have now slammed shut. </span></p>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB">Even Russia
                          which a year ago had more than $600 billion foreign exchange reserves,
                          is in a difficult situation. Russian large companies must repay or
                          roll-over $500 billion this year. Russia has bled 36pc of its foreign reserves since August defending the rouble. </span></p>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB">In Poland, 60% of all mortgages are in Swiss francs. The Polish zloty has just fallen in half against the Swiss franc. Hungary, the Balkans, the Baltics, and Ukraine are all suffering variants of this same story. As an act of collective folly – by lenders and borrowers – it matches America's
                          sub-prime debacle. This crisis, for European banks comes atop their
                          losses in US real estate securities. In is the next wave of the crisis
                          that is about to hit. Almost all East bloc debts are owed to West Europe,
                          especially Austrian, Swedish, Greek, Italian, and Belgian banks.
                          Europeans account for an astonishing 74% of the entire $4.9 trillion
                          portfolio of loans to emerging markets. They are five times more
                          exposed to this latest crisis than American or Japanese banks, and they
                          are 50pc more leveraged according to the IMF.<strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB">Whether it takes months,
                          or just weeks, Europe's financial system now faces a major test and the
                          situation is complicated by the fact that when the rules of the
                          European Central Bank were finalized in the late 1990’s, governments
                          could not agree to surrender total national central banking powers to
                          the new ECB. As a result, in this first test of the ECB in a systemic
                          crisis, the bank is unable to act in the same manner as say the Federal
                          Reserve and fiull the role of lender of last resort or to flood the
                          markets with emergency stimulus. <strong></strong></span></p>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB">By some estimates the
                          European Central Bank already needs to cut rates to zero and then
                          purchase bonds and Pfandbriefe on a huge scale. It is constrained by
                          geopolitics – a German-Dutch veto – and the Maastricht Treaty. The EBRD
                          estimates that eastern Europe needs at least €400bn in help to cover
                          loans and prop up the credit system. </span></p>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB">Europe</span><span lang="EN-GB">'s governments are making matters worse. Some are pressuring their banks to pull back, undercutting subsidiaries in East Europe. Athens
                          has ordered Greek banks to pull out of the Balkans. The sums needed are
                          beyond the limits of the IMF, which has already bailed out Hungary,
                          Ukraine, Latvia, Belarus, Iceland, and Pakistan – and Turkey next – and
                          is fast exhausting its own €155bn reserve, forcing it to sell its gold
                          reserves to raise cash.</span></p>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB">The recent IMF $16bn rescue of Ukraine
                          has unravelled. The country – facing a 12pc contraction in GDP after
                          the collapse of steel prices – is going towards default, leaving
                          Unicredit, Raffeisen and ING facing disaster. Latvia's
                          central bank governor has declared his economy "clinically dead" after
                          it shrank 10.5pc in the fourth quarter. Protesters have smashed the
                          treasury and stormed parliament.<strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB">Perhaps most alarming is
                          that the EU institutions don't have any framework for dealing with
                          this. The day they decide not to save one of these one countries will
                          be the trigger for a massive crisis with contagion spreading into the
                          EU.<strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span lang="EN-GB">Clear
                          at present is that for small-minded political reasons, Berlin is not
                          going to rescue Ireland, Spain, Greece and Portugal as the collapse of
                          their credit bubbles leads to rising defaults, or rescue Italy by
                          accepting plans for EU ‘union bonds’ should the debt markets boycott
                          Italy's exploding public debt, hitting 112% of GDP next year, just
                          revised up from 101%.</span></p>

              <p>I heard similar report from a Thai radio early morning today too. That would make it even uglier.</p>
              <p>Canada, Spain, Australia and New Zealand seem to be the only 4 western economies that are still looking fine.</p>
              <p>Asian economies that will be hardest hit will be the most open ones.</p>

              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Asian "coolie to other countries" economies, and coolies, like the foreign coolies in Singapore, will be hit. Thailand as I can see, is not a coolie economy, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Thaksin tried to make it one, selling Shin Corp to Temasek, but luckily for Thailand he was kicked out.</span></span></p>
