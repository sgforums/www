              <p><a href="http://www.temasekreview.com/2009/10/29/town-council-act-cap-329a-states-clearly-that-govt-must-work-with-town-councils-run-by-mps-to-implement-lup/">http://www.temasekreview.com/2009/10...implement-lup/</a><br> <br> <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Town Council Act (CAP 329A) states clearly that Govt must work with Town Councils (run by MPs) to implement LUP<br> </strong></span> <br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>OPINION</strong></span><br> <br> In a letter published in the Straits Times Forum on 27 October 2009,
              Press Secretary to the Ministry of National Development Lim Yuin Chien
              wrote that there is a difference between the roles of a MP and an
              adviser.<br> <br> This was what he wrote:<br> <br> “In Singapore, MPs also have an important role in running town
              councils. As provided for in the Town Councils Act, this role includes
              managing the common property of HDB estates and carrying out local
              improvement projects, thereby contributing to the well-being of the
              people of the constituency.<br> <br> As for the government-appointed adviser, his main role is to assist in
              implementing national programmes, such as government campaigns, and
              HDB’s upgrading programmes, including the Lift Upgrading Programme
              (LUP).”<br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>Mr Lim’s reply appears to give one the impression
              that the PAP’s “grassroots adviser” is obliged to implement the LUP
              under the law and not the MP. </strong></span><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>However, there is NO ROLE stipulated for grassroots advisers under the Town Council Act (CAP 329A) at all.</strong></span><br> <br> <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Under Part IVA (Lift Upgrading
              Works) of the Act, the Town Council is the authority involved from the
              preliminary discussions about the upgrading to its final implementation
              on the ground.</strong></span><br> <br> Since Hougang Town Council is under the charge of its MP Low Thia
              Kiang, Mr Low Thia Kiang should be the one implementing the LUP and NOT
              the PAP losing candidate Eric Low.<br> <br> <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>There are NO PROVISIONS made in
              the Act for the Ministry of National Development to collaborate with
              PAP-appointed grassroots adviser instead of the legitimate MP.</strong></span><br> <br> Attached below are selected segments of the Town Councils Act (CAP 329A)<br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>Declaration of precincts</strong><br> 24B. —(1) The Minister may, after consulting the Board and the Town
              Council concerned, from time to time by order published in the Gazette,
              declare any housing estate of the Board or any part thereof within that
              Town Council’s Town to be a precinct for the purposes of the Town
              Council carrying out any lift upgrading works in buildings within the
              precinct.<br> <br> <strong>Lift upgrading works in a precinct</strong><br> 24C. —(1) Where any housing estate of the Board or any part thereof
              within a Town has been declared a precinct under section 24B, the Town
              Council for that Town shall, as soon as practicable —<br> <br> (a) make arrangements to conduct in the manner prescribed a poll of
              such owners of the flats within the precinct as may be prescribed with
              a view to establishing their opinions about the Town Council’s
              proposals to carry out lift upgrading works in buildings within the
              precinct; and (b) do such other things as the Minister may direct.<br> <br> Power to carry out lift upgrading works and recover improvement contributions<br> 24D. —(1) As soon as practicable after the Minister has given his
              approval under section 24C (3) (b), the Town Council concerned shall
              carry out the lift upgrading works in the precinct in such manner as
              the Town Council thinks fit.</span> <br> <br> [Source: <a href="http://statutes.agc.gov.sg/">Statutes of Singapore</a>]<br> <br> <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>As we can see from the above, the
              Minister has to work with the Town Council to carry out lift upgrading
              works in the precinct. Therefore, he should work directly with Hougang
              Town Council and NOT the PAP grassroots adviser.</strong></span><br> <br> Who is the Chairman of Hougang Town Council? According to the official
              website of Hougang Town Council, its Chairman is Mr Low Thia Kiang, the
              MP for Hougang.<br> <br> [Source: <a href="http://www.hougang.org.sg/html/htc_chairman.html">Hougang Town Council</a>]<br> <br> Naturally it follows that the Ministry of National Development should
              just work with Mr Low to implement the LUP in Hougang. There is simply
              no business for the PA or Mr Eric Low to be involved in the first place!<br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>In an interview with the state media, Mr Eric Low
              even claimed that he was involved in the discussion with the Ministry
              about the LUP and subsequent conducting of polls among the Hougang
              residents, but he has absolutely NO POWER to do so under the Town
              Council Acts!<br> </strong></span> <br> Why wasn’t the Town Councils Act adhered to this instance? What does it
              say of the minister and the civil servants if they don’t even bother to
              follow the Act? Did they miss out the fine print in the Act out of
              hindsight or are they simply flouting the rules?<br> <br> If the Act is frivolous and redundant, then why is it in our Statutes
              in the first place? Is the PAP making a mockery out of the
              Attorney-General Chambers?<br> <br> Or is the Minister ignorant of the Act? If he is not, why didn’t he
              follow the provisions provided in the Act to work with Mr Low Thia
              Kiang? Why did he choose to appoint Mr Eric Low to implement the LUP
              instead?<br> <br> The National Development Ministry MUST explain why there was a
              discrepancy in what was printed in the Town Councils Act and its
              actions.<br> <br> From now onwards, pending to further revisions to the Town Councils
              Act, ALL lift upgrading works in any precincts in Singapore must be
              implemented through their respective Town Councils led by their MPs
              regardless of their political affiliations.<br> <br> Singapore Law Minister Mr Shanmugam told visiting American delegates
              from the New York State Bar Association yesterday that Singapore is a
              country governed by law:<br> <br> “The rule of law was necessary to assure people of different races that
              they had equal opportunities, and to attract foreign investments for
              economic growth,” he said.<br> <br> It is a joke that for some strange reasons or another, Mr Shanmugan’s
              ministerial colleague has refused to obey the Town Councils Act by
              choosing not to work with Hougang Town Council and even has the
              audacity to TWIST the facts by claiming that “it is the role of the
              grassroots advisers to implement the LUP” through his press secretary
              when it was stated NOWHERE in the Town Councils Act that the LUP has to
              be carried out by the grassroots advisers!<br> <br> From beginning to end, there was no mention of the words “Grassroots
              advisers”, “People Association” or “PAP losing candidates” and so how
              did Mr Eric Low come into the picture at all?<br> <br> Can Mr Shanmugam please explain to Singaporeans who is in the wrong? Is
              there a mistake somewhere in the Town Councils Act or did the Minister
              fail to follow what was printed in the Act?<br> <br> Singapore has always prided itself as a country governed strictly by
              laws. Nobody is above the law in Singapore, be it a common man in the
              street, a tycoon or an important political leader.<br> <br> <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Was the Town Councils Act flouted?
              If not, why not? If it has indeed been contravened, what punishment
              should the Attorney-Chambers mete out to the transgressors?<br> </strong></span> <br> This is an important matter of public interest as it concerns the
              sanctity of law in Singapore. If the Mr Eric Low or the civil servants
              are able to get away by their actions of not following the law, what
              does it say about the rule of law in Singapore?<br> <br> If the minister, Mr Eric Low and other civil servants had respected the
              Town Council Acts, they should have followed it strictly in accordance
              to Part IVA (Life Upgrading Works) and work directly with Hougang MP
              Low Thia Kiang instead. Mr Low should be the person announcing the LUP
              and NOT Mr Eric Low.<br> <br> Mr Eric Low can volunteer his services to Hougang residents by being
              the personal assistant of Mr Low Thia Kiang in his own personal
              capacity, but he should not be the main liaison person between Hougang
              Town Council and the National Development Ministry.<br> <br> Singaporeans expect no less than a clear explanation on this matter
              from the authorities concerned – the National Development Ministry, the
              Law Ministry, HDB, People’s Association and the Attorney-General
              Chambers.<br> <br> If a precedent is set which allows for laws as outlined in the
              Singapore Statutes to be ignored and disobeyed, what will our country
              become?<br> <br> Mr Shanmugam should put his words into action by clearing up the
              “misunderstanding” over the Town Councils Act to lay down the ground
              rules explicitly so that future sagas like this will not happen again.<br> <br> ==========================<br> <br> <span style="font-size: small;"><strong>For local news from non-local mainstream media, visit: <a href="http://singaporenewsalternative.blogspot.com/">http://singaporenewsalternative.blogspot.com</a></strong></span><br> <br> .</p>

              <p>Which means, the Minister also can choose not to declare that precinct to be part of LUP.</p>
              <p>That means if you force their hand on this, then the above mentioned precinct's LUP may be jeopardized. </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px; font-weight: bold;">In an interview with the state media, Mr Eric Low even claimed that he was involved in the discussion with the Ministry about the LUP and subsequent conducting of polls among the Hougang residents, but he has absolutely NO POWER to do so under the Town Council Acts!</span></p>
              <p>It seems well within Mr Low's purview to conduct polls among residents of his precinct.  And as for discussions with ministries, I think forcing this hand would cut both ways as well.  That is, opposition grassroots advisors would be rejected in any dialog with ministries based on this precedence if you try argue it through.  That means, ministries would have rights to reject dialogs with grassroots advisers in future. </p>
              <p>Not really the best strategy.</p>

              <p>When the Singapore Constitution can be bastardised beyond recognition, what is the worth of a Town Council Act ?</p>
              <p>When the Pledge is a solemn oath taken seriously by all Singaporeans for more then forty years, and can be redefined to be no more then an "aspiration" - is there any respect for the articles mentioned in a Town Council Act ?</p>
              <p>When the Bye-Laws can be cunningly redefined to protect the Ministers interests after they have contravened the laws - is there any law and order in Singapore ?</p>
              <p>What is the worth of the Law in Singapore when there are separate laws for ordinary Singaporeans, and another interpretation for the PAP ?</p>
