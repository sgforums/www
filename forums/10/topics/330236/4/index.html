              <p>short answer, nothing. singapore will not sink if 1m leaves. in fact, it takes the weight off the island. what a reprieve!</p>
              <p>i won't want to go into lengths explaining myself, but just mentioning the below to explain me saying so:</p>
              <p>there are as many variables as fixed factors that will mold the nation to sustain itself. you are assuming everything is transfixed in the present infrastructure that will cause singapore to fall thru' the cracks.</p>
              <p>if you earns $3.5k/mth now and next month, your pay is halved. would you die?</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>I appreciate u giving out a short answer but it is too optimistic to think tat 1 million job holder dissappear and business will be as usual for singapore in the long run. If there r too little job holder, growth is stiffened and businesses r affected. Cost spiralled out of control, constructions r halted project r postponed and probably relocated. Then u will see singapore really sinking in economy after a period of time. If u talk about your pay, lets say your pay is reduced halved in the long run. Wat will happened to u ? U will probably go out lesser, enjoy a lesser quality of life.</p>

              <p>One thing for sure, when i was studying and doing a project on the GDP of singapore, i found that in the 70s, 80s and 90s the GDP are all double digits except for oil crisis, financial crisis and 85' crisis, and at that time we dun much foreigner here, except our tradition Malaysians helping us out, we dun even have FTs to churn us up, but today, which is my generation, we see a drop in GDP to single digits even with high tech industry and a full force of over a million foreigners (not malaysians), so what are we looking at, do foreigners and FT really help us???</p>

              <p>developing countries get a high rate of growth easier. The more developed u r the less u can grow. If u realy wanna see the rate of growth it is really relatively about the same level except at crisis period</p>

              <p>Why don't we ask the following... if too little job holder in singapore, will it cause the companies to move out. Yes because the cost is gonna be much more expensive. If there r no foreign workers will we be forcing singaporean to do jobs they do not like ? Yes because someone has to built buildings etc</p>
              <p>Put it tis way... economist put us as no unemployment rate and any lower it is bad for economy. The balance can be striked by controlling flow of foreigners. Should we follow academics or not in employment rate ?</p>

              <p>There are just too many factors to talk about these.</p>
              <p>True, some FWs and FTs are definitely needed and required. But all 100% of them??? Question would then be... how many of these 1 million can we not do without?</p>
              <p>Anyway, there are still good and friendly FWs around, and these are definitely very welcomed, as least to me. Eg yesterday at Boon Keng KFC, there was this PRC lady serving us at the counter. Somehow, I can see her enthusiasm in serving, and her quick smile and everything you can expect of from a service staff. This is someone indeed better than quite a number of local service staff.</p>

              <p>I will say that we need FWs, but the FTs need to be carefully qualified. Maids, construction workers, those doing jobs such as rubbish collectors, cleaners..and now even the copi ah soh are those I have no problem with.</p>
              <p>But those in the office, the none expats (meaning they are not senior enough even in their own organisation to be given housing), or foreigners here on local term, are the ones I really have problem with. Some Australians are here on local term, live in HDB. Some PRC here on tourist visa, got job on local term and squeezed in some HDB to reduce costs, some local companies, recruited philippino architect as cheap assistant, but 4 to 5 into one small condo ....all these people, regardless of whether they come from....are called FT and not much of a talent to me.</p>

              <p>Nobody's asking the 1 million foreigners to leave en bloc. Now that the economy depends on them, it's quite redundant to ask such a qn right. This is like a chicken and egg issue. Why even have so many foreigners in the first place if most jobs created have gone to them? The answer is so as to maintain Sg's vibrant economy. More companies, more economy growth, more tax revenue in the coffers and Sg looks gd still.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ever wondered why the govt only releases unemployment rate for residents (prs included)? Because the stats for the no. of Singaporeans unemployed would be too embarassing. The unemployment percentage is also reduced by the massive numbers of new PRs employed.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Foreigners are here to depress wages so that Singapore remains a popular destination for foreign investment. The tax collected from such FDIs contribute greatly to govt revenue. Such a strategy is only for developing countries like Msia. The idea was to receive the expertise and stand on our own but Sg has hardly ever done so. The rote learning environment due to our education system has hardly helped entrepreneurship either. We will forever remain a hunting ground for cheap labour if this strategy continues. Rich poor divide can only widen.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Vote wisely the next election and blood a new generation...very slowly but surely in the next 10 years to form the next govt.</p>

              <p>At this rate i'm pretty sure SG will bleed to death.. Perishing slowly from hemophilia, losing the best of her economic blood consisting of the middle class and the competent, leaving only the foreigners and those too poor to get out.. Its only a matter of time..........</p>

              <h2 id="story_byline"><strong>Certain public services are bursting at the seams in the wake of a 60% jump in population in the past 16 years.</strong></h2>
              <div id="story_content">
              <p>THE fast pace of population expansion is beginning to show up in the daily lives of Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>People are feeling the pinch of insufficient hospital beds and doctors, delayed buses and cramped trains, which runs counter to the city’s traditional image of efficiency.</p>
              <p>Some public services are facing stresses in the wake of a <span style="color: #ff0000;">60%</span> surge in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">population</span> in the past 16 years.</p>
              <p>In 1990, there were only<span style="color: #ff0000;"> 2.7</span> <span style="color: #ff0000;">million</span> people living here; today there are <span style="color: #ff0000;">4.3</span> <span style="color: #ff0000;">million</span>,</p>
              <p>one of the fastest rates of increase in the world.</p>
              <p>This exerts pressures on space and manpower – resulting in shortages and over-crowdedness in some areas – and, of course, on cost structures.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Last year</span>, the country – one of the most densely populated in the world – granted <span style="color: #ff0000;">permanent residence</span> to <span style="color: #ff0000;">58,200</span>, and <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">citizenship</span></span> to <span style="color: #ff0000;">13,900</span> <span style="color: #ff0000;">foreigners</span>.</p>
              <p>The crowds in the streets haven’t reached the frantic levels of that in Tokyo, Shanghai or Hong Kong – but given the ambition to push for a population to 6.5 million, it may not be too far away.</p>
              <p>Another source could be the expected rise in the number of tourists from <span style="color: #ff0000;">9 million</span> to <span style="color: #ff0000;">18 million</span> after 2010, when two <span style="color: #ff0000;">casino resorts start operation</span>. The size of land, on the other hand, remains static.</p>
              <p>A small-time businessman told me over lunch last week: “Almost every day, we read of <span style="color: #ff0000;">public services</span> being <span style="color: #ff0000;">over-extended</span> by higher demand. I think it’s an omen of things to come.”</p>
              <p>His comment came after he had just gleaned the following news – all in one day – that reflected the impact of the expansion, and the government’s urgent efforts to cope with it:</p>
              <p>&gt; Hospitals. A serious <span style="color: #ff0000;">shortage of beds</span> led to a decision to build two more hospitals. This followed complaints about sick patients having to wait months before they got a specialist appointment or a bed.</p>
              <p>&gt; Public transport. More cases of <span style="color: #ff0000;">late buses</span> or <span style="color: #ff0000;">overcrowded trains</span> at peak periods. The bus company responded by setting up a</p>
              <p>website to inform passengers how long they would have to wait for their next bus.</p>
              <p>&gt; Energy. The<span style="color: #ff0000;"> government</span> reported it was <span style="color: #ff0000;">seeking alternative energy sources</span> and <span style="color: #ff0000;">amended</span> the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Gas Act</span> to guarantee <span style="color: #ff0000;">all players open access</span> to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">gas pipeline network</span> here.</p>
              <p>&gt; Imported sand. A <span style="color: #ff0000;">300-foot barge</span> arrived with <span style="color: #ff0000;">7,000 tonnes of sand</span> from Cambodia, to replace banned imports from Indonesia.</p>
              <p>A population two-thirds larger than today’s size, planned for 25 years’ time, would r<span style="color: #ff0000;">equire a revamp</span> of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">state’s security</span> needs, as well as to <span style="color: #ff0000;">source</span> for <span style="color: #ff0000;">more daily necessities</span> – like oil and gas, water and foodstuff – than currently imported.</p>
              <p>For example, providing security for 6.5 million people, considered a medium-size global city by 2030, will be beyond what the police force can now provide.</p>
              <p>Last week, Parliament passed a law that will allow the military to conduct civilian security operations.</p>
              <p>Apart from the two new hospitals, the government also gave the green light to build a new 40km, 33-station Downtown Line by 2018 to cater for the rising population.</p>
              <p>It is building more roads, underground storage caverns and more schools. In fact, almost every public service is coming under study.</p>
              <p>The mega concerns are, of course, for the government to resolve; the ordinary folks are preoccupied with not losing out to the foreigners in jobs, a nice home and a good education.</p>
              <p>Take healthcare, which was marked by a recent spate of public complaints about <span style="color: #ff0000;">shortage</span> in <span style="color: #ff0000;">hospitals </span>of <span style="color: #ff0000;">beds</span> and <span style="color: #ff0000;">doctors</span>.</p>
              <p>The National University Hospital (NUH) is said to be “filled to the brim”.</p>
              <p>A doctor said: “We have been told to hold off elective day surgeries, and every day we’re urged to discharge patients quickly if they are fit enough to go home.”</p>
              <p>The largest, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Singapore General Hospital</span>, reports <span style="color: #ff0000;">critical occupancy</span> of<span style="color: #ff0000;"> up to 97</span>%. Two <span style="color: #ff0000;">other hospitals</span>, Tan Tock Seng and Changi, are<span style="color: #ff0000;"> not much better</span>.</p>
              <p>One patient said he had to wait from 5pm to 3 am before being warded. “I was luckier. There were families of patients who had been waiting since 9am”, he said.</p>
              <p>In these critical times, long waiting times are a common feature.</p>
              <p>“I’ve tried visiting the hospital from 10am in the morning and by the time I’m home, it’s already 3am,” exclaimed another.</p>
              <p>“The worst thing is when they tell hospital cases that they have run out of beds.”</p>
              <p>These tales have come as a shock to Singaporeans who are used to reading media praises on their public healthcare as among the best in the world.</p>
              <p>Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew once described Britain’s public healthcare as below Singapore’s standards.</p>
              <p>Some shortages are happy problems.</p>
              <p>Last week officials announced the <span style="color: #ff0000;">projected</span> creation of <span style="color: #ff0000;">450,000 jobs</span> over the <span style="color: #ff0000;">next five years</span>; it says there are <span style="color: #ff0000;">not enough Singaporeans</span> to fill them, so more foreign workers are needed.</p>
              <p>Among the jobs are for <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>54,000 engineers, technicians and research scientists</strong></span>.</p>
              <p>Other worries are more fundamental.</p>
              <p>Today’s population of 4.3 million is made up of about 2.5 million Singaporeans, one million permanent residents and 800,000 foreigners.</p>
              <p>This could make original Singaporeans an endangered species in a future expanded Singapore in 2030. By then it will be one-third locals and the rest immigrants.</p>
              <p>Some pre-university students, in a seminar last week, <span style="color: #ff0000;">raised concerns</span> about a national <span style="color: #ff0000;">loss of common purpose</span> with the <span style="color: #ff0000;">ebb and flow of peoples</span>.</p>
              <p>A government official said a cultural mix would take two or three generations to take root. “I’m hopeful it will be like a gentle blending of two streams rather than the churning of murky water,” he said.</p>

              <h1 id="story_title">Singapore’s emigration rate, one of the highest in the world on a per capita basis, is a blow to the government.</h1>
              <div id="story_content">
              <p>YEARS of strong economic growth have failed to stem Singapore’s skilled youths from leaving for a better life abroad, with the number topping <span style="color: #ff0000;">1,000 a year</span>.</p>
              <p>This works out to <span style="color: #ff0000;">4%-5%, or three in 10, of the highly educated population</span>, a severe brain drain for a small, young nation, according to Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew.</p>
              <p>Such high-end emigration is usually associated with less better-off countries where living conditions are poor. Here the opposite is the case.</p>
              <p>Last year the economy created almost 200,000 jobs, far in excess of the 38,000 births recorded.</p>
              <p>The future doesn’t look better, either, despite Lee holding out promises of “a golden period” in the next five to 10 years.</p>
              <p>Lee believes the exodus, which has been worrying him for two decades, could only grow because “every year, there are more people going abroad for their first or second degree.”</p>
              <p>The <span style="color: #ff0000;">emigration rate</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">one of the highest</span> in the world <span style="color: #ff0000;">on a per capita ba</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">sis</span>, is a blow to the government, particularly to Lee, who takes pride in building up this once poor squatter colony into a glittering global city.</p>
              <p>They are people who abandoned their citizenship for a foreign one, mostly in Australia, the United States and Canada.</p>
              <p>It is particularly <span style="color: #ff0000;">serious for two reasons</span>. First, Singapore is a <span style="color: #ff0000;">young nation</span> that is working hard to consolidate its nationhood and its people, and second, its defence lies in a <span style="color: #ff0000;">reservist army</span>.</p>
              <p>This is made up of young men who have served two years of compulsory military training when they reach the age of 18. Any big outflow will badly affect security, not to mention the economy.</p>
              <p>Adding to a declining birth rate, the problem of emigration, which appears to have worsened during the past few decades as people became better educated, will further reduce the base of this well-trained people’s army.</p>
              <p>Hundreds of thousands of foreigners and permanent residents who have come to Singapore help make up the numbers, but they do not have to serve national service.</p>
              <p>The emigrants, mostly professionals, <span style="color: #ff0000;">don’t leave</span> Singapore out of <span style="color: #ff0000;">poverty</span> but to <span style="color: #ff0000;">seek</span> a <span style="color: #ff0000;">better</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">less pressurised</span> life.</p>
              <p>Lee recently said the brain drain is touching close to this family.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Lee’s grandson</span>, the elder son of Prime Minister Hsien Loong, who is studying in the United States, has indicated that he <span style="color: #ff0000;">may not return</span>.</p>
              <p>Over the years, the children of several Cabinet ministers have also made Britain or the US their home.</p>
              <p>Lee, aged 84, has often spoken on the issue with emotions, once tearing when referring to the losses.</p>
              <p>However, he has offered no reasons for the exodus beyond economic opportunities, although the government more or less knows what they are.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans who have or are planning to emigrate are given a host of 10 questions and asked to tick the three most important ones. They include the following: -</p>
              <p>&gt; <span style="color: #ff0000;">High costs of living</span></p>
              <p>&gt; <span style="color: #ff0000;">Singapore is too regulated and stifling</span></p>
              <p>&gt; <span style="color: #ff0000;">Better career and prospects overseas</span></p>
              <p>&gt; <span style="color: #ff0000;">Prefer a more relaxed lifestyle</span></p>
              <p>&gt; <span style="color: #ff0000;">Uncertain future of Singapore</span>.</p>
              <p>Some liberal Singaporeans believe Lee himself, with his authoritarian leadership and unpopular policies, is largely to blame.</p>
              <p>Singapore’s best-known writer Catherine Lim calls it a climate of fear that stops citizens from speaking out against the government, saying it could eventually lead to the decline of the state.</p>
              <p>She praised the government for its economic achievements but added: <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #000000;">“A</span> compliant, fearful population <span style="color: #000000;">that has</span> never<span style="color: #000000;"> learnt to be</span> politically savvy <span style="color: #000000;">could </span>spell the doom </span><span style="color: #000000;">of Singapore.”</span></p>
              <p>Globalisation, which offers opportunities in many countries like never before, is a big reason for the outflow.</p>
              <p>Many countries, including populous <span style="color: #ff0000;">China</span>, are making a <span style="color: #ff0000;">special effo</span>rt to <span style="color: #ff0000;">attract foreign talent</span>.</p>
              <p>Others who leave were worried about the future of their children living in a small island, and look for security and comfort of a larger country.</p>
              <p>The exodus is more than made up – at least in numbers – by a larger intake of professionals from China and India.</p>
              <p>“The trouble is many of <span style="color: #ff0000;">the Chinese</span> then use us as a stepping stone to go to America, where the grass is greener, Lee said.</p>
              <p>“But even if we only <span style="color: #ff0000;">keep 30%-40%</span> and <span style="color: #ff0000;">lose 60%-70%</span>, we’re a net gainer,” he added.</p>
              <p>He believed, however, that the Chinese would <span style="color: #ff0000;">cease to come</span> in <span style="color: #ff0000;">20 to 30 years’</span> time, when China’s living standards rise to match Singapore’s.</p>
              <p>Some feel the large presence of foreigners, and the perks they enjoy over locals in military exemption as well as in scholarships, are themselves strong push factors.</p>
              <p>They see the foreigners as a threat to jobs and space, undermining salaries and loosening the nation’s cohesion.</p>
              <p>“<span style="color: #000000;">I just feel</span><span style="color: #ff0000;"> very sad to see<span style="color: #000000;"> </span><span style="color: #000000;">the Singapore of today with</span> so many talented, passionate Singaporeans moving out <span style="color: #000000;">and being</span> replaced by many foreigners</span>,” said one blogger. “I feel sorry for the future.”</p>
              <p>Others point out the danger of an easy fix in numbers without regard to quality.</p>
              <p>“<span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #000000;">Foreigners</span> treat this place <span style="color: #000000;">as a</span> hotel, <span style="color: #000000;">when</span><span style="color: #000000;"> the</span> economy turns they <span style="color: #000000;">will</span> leave</span>,” said a teacher who is seeing more and more foreign students in his class.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Lee</span> recently made a <span style="color: #ff0000;">passionate appeal</span> to youths to <span style="color: #ff0000;">think hard about <span style="color: #000000;">their</span> <span style="color: #ff0000;">co</span></span><span style="color: #ff0000;">untry</span>. He said they had received education and opportunities provided by Singaporeans who had worked hard for it.</p>
              <p>“Can you in good conscience say, ‘Goodbye! Thank you very much?’ Can you leave with a clear conscience? I cannot,” he said.</p>
