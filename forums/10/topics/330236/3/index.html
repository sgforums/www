              <p>Your unemployment figure in the other thread is still showing

                      ? R they the same thing ?</p>
              <p>If u talk unique singapore culture, u seemed to be assuming most

                      fact is tat most people in singapore stay in singapore and

              <p>In a globalized environment, it is indeed very difficult for any
                  particular way of life to develop into a unique culture, more so in
                  the future than it was in the past. If somebody started doing
                  something that is worthwhile emulating, then it is emulated
                  everyway, not just Singapore. If it is difficult for Singapore to
                  develop its own culture because of moving population, then this
                  moving population is also affecting the culture of others.</p>
              <p>As it is, new cultures evolved for people of all countries, the
                  Generation Y, the yuppies and so on...and this is borderless. but,
                  there would still be something that would be peculiar to a
                  particular place, due to its weather, the profile of its
                  population...</p>
              <p>it really didn't take very long for Singlish to evolve into
                  something uniquely Singaporean.</p>
              <p>Some cuisines popular among Singaporean are being identified as
                  Singaporean, even though you still find Laksa in Penang but they
                  have to call it Penang Laksa.</p>
              <p>Even food court is something many foreigners would associate
                  with Singapore even though we find such places in many other Asian
                  countries.</p>
              <p>May be Singapore would become a city so international that you
                  see images of every other nations here, in that case, even the
                  local born would have to be international to survive. It is not
                  only the foreign born kids who prefer McDonalds, and the local kids
                  want only chwee Queh.</p>

              <p>However, they are those who had 'mediocre' exam results based on

              <p>Googoomuck,</p>
              <p>I can assure you that most of the Singaporeans in the UK work for international companies that are well recognised in the world.  I had qualified to enter NUS but chose to pursue my education abroad anyways. This is also similar to the Singaporeans I have met here and we are lucky to have study abroad because either we are on full scholarship  or our parents saved money for us to study abroad.</p>
              <p>I now work for one of the leading aircraft manufacturer (OEM) in the world.  My salary is almost 3 times the salary of an aerospace engineer in ST Aerospace in Singapore.  I think your comment about overseas Singaporeans is unfair and unjust.</p>

              <p>I always think that Sinagpore, its impossible to retire. I never wanted to work till the day i step into my coffin if I can afford one by the end of my days.  I had toyed with migrating but i know I am tied here due to family. If I am alone, I would have choosen to work overseas maybe HK, London or SF. My last trip to SF, when I was heading to fly back to Singapore, it felt as if I was leaving my home going back to a foreign land call Singapore.</p>

              <p>I can only influence and choose what I do with myself. Proposing is like empty talk that the govt do without fully understanding the situation and root cause.  I choose not to feel so much for the transgressions from fellow Singaproean and foreigners. But it is hard not to feel disappointed that for all our achievements, some of our people seemed to have regressed and lost their meaning as a part of humanity to the materialism that Singapore promotes.  If only you had heard of the way the people in other countries view about life and living. Maybe this is what really, people wanted after all and Singapore offers only materialism with little cultivation on the spirit and soul. It feels empty in this land. A sense of disconnectedness.  Feeling of uncaring from everyone around you that you are not important enough for the system, the people, fellow members of society to even have a though about that you are taken as an economic number and a wiget in the Singapore Inc. to help someone else make more money with your life.</p>

              <p>I always think that Sinagpore, its impossible to retire. I never wanted to work till the day i step into my coffin if I can afford one by the end of my days.  I had toyed with migrating but i know I am tied here due to family. If I am alone, I would have choosen to work overseas maybe HK, London or SF. My last trip to SF, when I was heading to fly back to Singapore, it felt as if I was leaving my home going back to a foreign land call Singapore.</p>

              <p>Singapore is not a good place for retirement.   Keep your fingers crossed that one day you will have opportunity to migrate overseas.    Can't imagine the future in Singapore.   Life is getting more and more tough here.   </p>

              <p>Googoomuck,</p>
              <p>I can assure you that most of the Singaporeans in the UK work
              for international companies that are well recognised in the world.
               I had qualified to enter NUS but chose to pursue my education
              abroad anyways. This is also similar to the Singaporeans I have met
              here and we are lucky to have study abroad because either we are on
              full scholarship  or our parents saved money for us to study
              abroad.</p>
              <p>I now work for one of the leading aircraft manufacturer (OEM) in
              the world.  My salary is almost 3 times the salary of an
              aerospace engineer in ST Aerospace in Singapore.  I think your
              comment about overseas Singaporeans is unfair and unjust.</p>

              <p>well, in most countries, there are urban area where the rat race is on, and there are rural area, where the cost of living is low and the way of life is relaxed. The people who can't stay competitive in the urban area will than have an option to live in the rural area, and provide their service which is essential to a small town community. Having a degree in law wouldn't be very useful in the rural area, as compared to a mechanic.</p>
              <p>For Singapore, there aren't really any rural area though...</p>

              <p>Wat r u trying to say here ? If 3 million people r in singapore labour force and if suddenly the 1 million foreigner disappear, who r gonna take over these 1 million jobs ? Even if everyone, including 12 years - 70 years r working, they probably cannot cover up such numbers.</p>

              <p>short answer, nothing. singapore will not sink if 1m leaves. in fact, it takes the weight off the island. what a reprieve!</p>

              <p>there are as many variables as fixed factors that will mold the nation to sustain itself. you are assuming everything is transfixed in the present infrastructure that will cause singapore to fall thru' the cracks.</p>

              <p>One thing for sure, when i was studying and doing a project on the GDP of singapore, i found that in the 70s, 80s and 90s the GDP are all double digits except for oil crisis, financial crisis and 85' crisis, and at that time we dun much foreigner here, except our tradition Malaysians helping us out, we dun even have FTs to churn us up, but today, which is my generation, we see a drop in GDP to single digits even with high tech industry and a full force of over a million foreigners (not malaysians), so what are we looking at, do foreigners and FT really help us???</p>

              <p>We will only have Singaporean who would identify themselves as Singaporean. The day they migrate to Australia, they become Australian, what Singapore identity can you find in them?</p>

              <p>There are just too many factors to talk about these.</p>
              <p>True, some FWs and FTs are definitely needed and required. But all 100% of them??? Question would then be... how many of these 1 million can we not do without?</p>
              <p>Anyway, there are still good and friendly FWs around, and these are definitely very welcomed, as least to me. Eg yesterday at Boon Keng KFC, there was this PRC lady serving us at the counter. Somehow, I can see her enthusiasm in serving, and her quick smile and everything you can expect of from a service staff. This is someone indeed better than quite a number of local service staff.</p>

              <p>While I agree with you that the govt may be a little too agressive in their pursue of excellence, there are some points you need to note.</p>
              <p>1. GDP was growing at double digits in the beginning, but the bases were low. From 1896 billion US in 1970 to  11,730 billion US in 1980, the increase of 9834 billion was 6 fold!  but from 36,843 billion US in 1990 to 92,720 billion US in 2000, the increase was a hefty 55,886 billion, but in terms of percentage, but it was 2.5 times.</p>
              <p>2. Last time Singaporeans have many children, and their parents worked as hawkers, cashiers, teachers...that time O level already can become government officers, U grad really big thing. Now our generation, dont want to have many children, even with incentives, running hawkers stall is very time consuming, I understand every years there are over 2000 A levels with 3 to 4 As. Our generation, or rather your generation, are more highly qualified, more choices of higher levels jobs.....times have changed.</p>
              <p>As long as the foreign workers are here to do what we don't want or can't do, I have no complain, even malaysia is getting in over 2 millions foreign workers otherwise their rubber and palm oil plantations would be left to the monkey. </p>
