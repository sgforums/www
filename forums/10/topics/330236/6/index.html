              <p>Not really pro or against. I'm neutral.</p>
              <p>I'm against PRCs who are damn rude and high and arrogant, especially if their skills are not that high at all.</p>
              <p>But I'm pro PRCs for the humble, nice ones who integrated themselves very very well into the Singaporean society. I do have nice PRC friends who are very very humble and well integrated into our society. But these are normally from the southern part of China, where their accent is more similar to ours cuz there's where most of our ancestors come from ;)<br>Of course, there are certain ones from the northern part of China who are polite as well, and try their best to make friends with many Singaporeans (and the different races as well) instead of always grouping with their PRC friends. I have this friend who came from near Mongol, who has another Malay friend as one of his very good friends.</p>
              <p>The same goes for any other foreigners, not just PRCs. I have had experience with Bangla workers who were extremely helpful and polite. But I have friends who had experience with damn rude ang mohs, and these are pple who we will not welcome at all. If you go to another host country, you don't go there and be rude to their people. It's only basic courtesy.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>INSIGHT DOWN SOUTH<br> By SEAH CHIANG NEE</strong><br></span> <strong><span style="color: #000000;">While Singapore has been successful in luring
                      many of the brightest brains in the region, more and more of its
                      own young professionals want out.<br> <br> A BAFFLING aspect of affluent Singapore, with all its economic
                      finery, is the large – and growing – exodus of its citizens over
                      the past 10 years.<br> <br> While the hot economy has attracted more than a million foreigners
                      to its shores, its own citizens have been leaving in record numbers
                      to settle down abroad.<br> Their exit seemed to have taken on a new life in recent years,
                      ironically when the economic growth and the job market were at
                      their best.<br> <br></span></strong><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>In
                      fact, one survey has placed Singapore’s outflow at 26.11 migrants
                      per 1,000 citizens – the second highest in the world. Only Timor
                      Leste (51.07) fares worse.<br> The explanation is, of course, globalisation, the new borderless
                      economy, which is offering more job options for skilled
                      Singaporeans who want a better life in bigger
                      countries.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>But the reason doesn’t end
                      there.<br> <br> Other comparable city-populations have similarly been affected, but
                      Singapore seems to have been hit hardest of all.<br> The explanation must involve a higher non-economic priority strong
                      enough to propel Singaporeans away from a stable, comfortable
                      living towards the uncertainties of a new life elsewhere.<br> <br></strong></span><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>Yet
                      this is what is happening, as new statistics have shown.<br> More educated Singaporeans – many taking their children with them –
                      are leaving or are planning to leave their country, which is itself
                      a traditional haven for outsiders fleeing from trouble.<br> <br> A recent indication of the scope of the dilemma was the rising
                      number of Singaporeans who asked for a document needed to apply for
                      permanent residency overseas.<br></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">It has exceeded 1,000 a month to
                      reach 12,707 last year from 4,996 in 1998, or a rise of 170% over
                      10 years, said Home Affairs Minister Wong Kan Seng.<br> These people, over the age of 16, could be leaving for good, but
                      they also included students and businessmen, who may eventually
                      return.<br> <br> In 10 years, they totalled 97,990 Singaporeans (a far greater
                      number if children were included).<br> <br> The government says about 140,000 Singaporeans are studying,
                      working or in business in foreign countries, which by itself is not
                      a bad thing, given Singapore’s global ambitions. The trouble is
                      many of them may not return.<br> All the current statistics point to an upward emigration among
                      Singaporeans who apply for PR or citizenship abroad. Some of the
                      PRs, it is feared, may keep their citizenship but have no intention
                      of returning home.<br> <br> “After coming back, I find that other countries have much more to
                      offer than Singapore, which is very boring,one youth
                      remarked.<br> <br> The number of Singaporeans who gave up their citizenship, Wong
                      said, averaged 1,000 a year in the last three years.<br> Other negative trends that reflect the tenuous link between many
                      citizens and their country are:<br> <br> Two-thirds of Singaporeans (aged 21-34) said in a survey that they
                      had considered retiring in another country with a slower pace of
                      life and lower cost of living.<br> <br> Among youths (15-29 years of age), 53% are considering emigration.
                      Despite having gone through national education, 37% say they are
                      not patriotic. (Indian youths are the most ready to emigrate – at
                      67%, compared with 60% of Malays and 49% of Chinese).<br> Six out of 10 undergraduates said they wanted to go abroad to live
                      or work, mostly to enjoy a higher quality of life with less
                      stress.<br> <br> An ACNielsen poll showed 21% of Singaporeans, mainly professionals,
                      were considering emigration, half opting for Australia and New
                      Zealand.<br> <br> For this small state with a short history, the steady exit is not
                      just a ‘numbers’ problem which can be – and is being – resolved by
                      substituting Singaporeans with foreigners.<br> <br> It has a serious security dimension, since the island is defended
                      by its own reservist soldiers after a two-year mandatory national
                      service (NS).<br> <br> Fewer true-blue Singaporeans means fewer soldiers because permanent
                      residents are not required to serve NS (only their 18-year-old sons
                      are).<br> A bigger impediment to nation-building is the looser physical bond
                      between today’s generation of Singaporeans and their country.
                      Nearly half of them do not think they need to reside here to be
                      emotionally rooted to the country.<br> It is estimated that half the Singaporeans who annually apply for
                      foreign PRs – 6,000 to 7,000 – eventually settle down
                      overseas.<br> The brain drain is serious. <strong>On a lighter note, more
                      China-citizens are coming into the country, if you get what I
                      mean.<br></strong>Even if 0.5% of its brightest minds were to
                      leave, it would hit Singapore hard, said Senior Minister Goh Chok
                      Tong.<br> “These are bright young people, children of very well-educated
                      Singaporeans. They study overseas now, and the very good ones are
                      right away green harvested by companies,” Goh said.<br> <br> So why is Asia’s second wealthiest state losing its youths at a
                      higher rate than its poorer neighbours?<br> “Many Singaporeans leave because of the stifling atmosphere of the
                      country and the political and intellectual lock-step enforced by
                      the government,” said one analyst.<br> “It would reverse if the government would begin to democratise, and
                      to allow its people to develop their talents – in Singapore, not
                      abroad.” <strong>And I thought S'pore is a democratic country, what
                      am I missing?<br> <br></strong>Importing large numbers of migrants from China and
                      India, most of whom treat it as a study or transit point, is not a
                      solution.<br> Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew once admitted: “They come in here,
                      they get an English education ? and they're off to America.”<br> <br> However, he seems resigned to it. Recently he told his political
