              <p><br>Not true. There are many who went to prestigious universities in the UK and US, and after having a taste of life there decided not to return. How about those who went to study overseas on government scholarships then decided to break their bond? Are they losers too? Sounds like 'sour grapes' syndrome to me.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The article rightly pointed out that many Singaporeans emigrate not just for economic reasons. I wonder what the migration push factors for a developed nation like Singaporea are? Are these same factors relevant to other developed nations like the US, UK or European nations??</p>

              <p>the economic situation and the political situation are stiffling, and that you can't really seek a political solution to handle your economic problems, well, i guess most of you probably know what i am talking about, given the state of the opposition currently.</p>
              <p>yes, the government may show statistics about GDP, and avg capita growth. but at the end of the day, they are just stats and does not accurately reflect the majority of the people in singapore. look at the straits time classified. how many jobs are there with pay above $2000? above $2500?</p>
              <p>most of the job offerings are offering $1000++ salary. so what if the government is able to create so many of these low quality jobs? at the end of the day, it is still not worthwhile for singaporeans to slog for meagre pay which couldn't even support their family. not that these jobs are taxing though. some pay as little as $3.50 per hour, for 12 hours of work. can anyone of you, support your family with that meagre pay?

              <p>not only do singaporeans find their employment opportunities taken away by foreigners, the presence of large numbers of  cheap foreign talent also spoil market, depressing wages artificially, and this is the result of lax immigration policies.</p>
              <p>the aim of importing foreign talents was originally to supplement our economy, to fill in positions we have labour shortage in. it was not to "complement", where they compete locals for jobs, when we already have plenty of surplus labour around.</p>
              <p>all i see is that the ministers are always asking why singaporeans are so discontent with the economy when they have afterall, created so many jobs. imo, they are out of touch with reality, leeching off their mulit-million salaries, of which is fully borned by  taxpayers, unable to connect with the fact that many of these jobs are not viable for anyone to support their family. earning millions, how could they understand the hardship of those earning only thousands?</p>

              <p>If u think singapore is really bad and other countries r so terrific, then u should really try to emigrate out and seek a happier lifestyle. US may have higher pay but higher unemployment rate, japan have a more costly standard of living + working more than singaporean and u spent much more on much smaller housing there.</p>
              <p>And if u look at foreigners in singapore, I got to ask tis... there r probably a million of foreigners in singapore and the unemployment rate is about 2-3%. Tis is refered by economist to be a full employment number and any lower is bad for everyone. If u translate down, singaporean need more job holders than the actual singapore population. If suddenly all foreigners dissappear, than who is to cover their 1 million jobs ? If u r the gov, wat will u propose to do ?</p>

              <p>It depends on what do you see in a culture. why do you think only those born in Singapore can develop a uniquely Singaporean culture?</p>
              <p>Of course if everybody come here and their next generation would move out, then it would be difficult for the society to develop something that could last long enough to become a local culture. But is it too soon to say about something that would require 100 of years to evolve?</p>

              <p>the aim of importing foreign talents was originally to supplement our economy, to fill in positions we have labour shortage in. it was not to "complement", where they compete locals for jobs, when we already have plenty of surplus labour around.</p>
              <p>all i see is that the ministers are always asking why singaporeans are so discontent with the economy when they have afterall, created so many jobs. imo, they are out of touch with reality, leeching off their mulit-million salaries, of which is fully borned by  taxpayers, unable to connect with the fact that many of these jobs are not viable for anyone to support their family. earning millions, how could they understand the hardship of those earning only thousands?</p>

              <p>In fact, I have copied a post from CNA forums before, and I shall repeat it here.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><span>On the subject of helping to CREATE jobs, this is
                                      what actually happens:<br> <br> There is a quota system for employer to hire foreign worker (SP
                                      &amp; WP). The employer must have a number of local headcounts (C +
                                      PR) and based on this is then allocated foreign worker quota. For
                                      example in the services sector, it will need to "employ" 5 local
                                      workers to get a quota of 5 WP of which only 1 can be from
                                      PRC.<br> <br> <span style="color: #ff0000;">Many SMEs and small restaurants and
                                      shops will not have so many local employees. So in order to get the
                                      quota, what these companies did was to simply contribute CPF for
                                      some housewives, their uncles and aunties who are not
                                      working.</span><br> <br> Ha ha, now we suddenly got an improvement in labor employment and
                                      most amazingly, many senior citizens or older workers are back in
                                      the workforce again. I remember our dear Dr. Ng EH was so proud of
                                      his ministries, but they either do not know the real reasons or
                                      pretended not to know.<br> <br> So we got PHANTOM JOBS being created for the local workforce and
                                      got VIRTUAL improvements in unemployment figures! -- everything is
                                      virutal that sounds like computer games more than
                                      reality.</span></p>

              <p>If there is a boat with 10 people on it and 3 fell off.   That's 30% that fell off.</p>
              <p>You cramp 90 more people on that boat and 17 more fell off.  In total now only 20% fell off.   Seems like an inprovement doesn't it?</p>
              <p>In reality 20 people fell off now as opposed to only 3 before.</p>
              <p>The figures also don't tell you if the original 7 were among the 17 that just fell off, nor does it tell you the condition of that over crowded boat now and how the reminder 80 people are barely keeping from falling off too.</p>

              <p>In a globalized environment, it is indeed very difficult for any particular way of life to develop into a unique culture, more so in the future than it was in the past. If somebody started doing something that is worthwhile emulating, then it is emulated everyway, not just Singapore. If it is difficult for Singapore to develop its own culture because of moving population, then this moving population is also affecting the culture of others.</p>
              <p>As it is, new cultures evolved for people of all countries, the Generation Y, the yuppies and so on...and this is borderless. but, there would still be something that would be peculiar to a particular place, due to its weather, the profile of its population...</p>
              <p>it really didn't take very long for Singlish to evolve into something uniquely Singaporean.</p>
              <p>Some cuisines popular among Singaporean are being identified as Singaporean, even though you still find Laksa in Penang but they have to call it Penang Laksa.</p>
              <p>Even food court is something many foreigners would associate with Singapore even though we find such places in many other Asian countries.</p>
              <p>May be Singapore would become a city so international that you see images of every other nations here, in that case, even the local born would have to be international to survive. It is not only the foreign born kids who prefer McDonalds, and the local kids want only chwee Queh.</p>

              <p>Your unemployment figure in the other thread is still showing 2-3% unemployed people. Why do u bring in local to foreigner ratio ? R they the same thing ?</p>
              <p>If u talk unique singapore culture, u seemed to be assuming most people r emigrated out while most people r immigrated in. However fact is tat most people in singapore stay in singapore and therefore a unique culture can exist.</p>

              So it is not right to state "There has always been one identity, Singaporean, in four different versions, the Chinese, the Malays, the Indians and the Others."
              
              Identity is more than just looks. Include accent, cultural level, mindset etc. Many similarities developed and unique and part of Singapore identity.

              <p>some countries such as US has higher unemployment cause the people choose not to work. There's this thing call social security.</p>
              <p>The other thing is that you must understand how the unemployment rate is calculated.</p>
              <p>Its is calculated base on : "unemployed workers" are those who are currently not working but are
              willing and able to work for pay, currently available to work, and have
              actively searched for work.</p>
              <p>Now if a person is not actively searching for work, then he is dropped off from that number. Its just a percentage number and never a true reflection of what is the actual situation. So I prefer people to stop quoting statistics because this tends to be based on a lot of economic assumptions. And you know what economist like to do? They have alot of assumptions so as to model systems.</p>

              <p>But a walk on the streets or a ride on the train will tell you that the foreigners now outnumber locals. A whole train cabin, sometimes can be half to 3 quarter full of foreigners.</p>

              <p>I think the figure for people not actively searching for work is after not finding jobs for a number of years. Tis removes people who wanna become full time housewives, dead, vegetable, retired, depend on the nation for welfare etc. And yes, if u want to depend on the state for welfare, u r not part of the unemployment rate unless there is incentives to do so. Economists and probably the expert in tis field had agreed on how to classify unemployment and wat is not considered as unemployment. Generally the figure should be trusted since it is really the case where few people cannot find jobs at all.</p>
