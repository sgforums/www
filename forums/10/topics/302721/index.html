            <div class='col-md body'>Bumiputra policies are for Bumiputra country. North Korea, Myanmar are to be compared with similar other dictatorial regimes.<br><br>If a man say Bill Gate has built up his company to Microsoft will he always tell his employees to receive less favorable salaries or treatments by comparing them with employees in Bumiputra or North Korea?<br><br>So please forummers who are always quoting ludicrous comparisons like Myanmar or North Korea just to deny or cover up problems, think again.<br><br>If our leaders do not always try to claim to be the world's best talents or comparing themselves with the few lucky best paid persons in the private sector in the first place to justify enriching themselves the million dollars reward people may still excuse them for certain problems and not demand their higher standards comparable to the best like Finland or Switzerland.<br><br>Trouble is they always tend to regard themselves as the best so people have to measure them against the best and not Bumiputra. It is not that people are that demanding or unreasonable really. The ministers have created their own predicament for regarding themselves as the best so they have to please more people and meet with higher expectations. This is the law of nature.<br><br>It is sad that despite claiming to be the best they still do not understand the above-stated simple fact as the root cause of many unhappiness and discontent for their inadequacy and lack of grace.<br><br>If MM Lee wanted to be better regarded in his final chapter he should come clean and stop all the hypocrisy. He should accept that his many policies in the past are ungracious to the people who are now still suffering from the serious long-term consequences having to struggle with rising costs and profiteering by all government agencies and losing their gracious retirements.<br><br>He himself should start behaving more humbling and graciously and stop talking down on people and expect people to change whereas he remains as aloof as ever failing to show care and concern for fellow citizens.<br><br>Do not always quote the worse cases to justify his policy failures. Quote the best countries like Switzerland, Finland or Korea and start seriously putting our best-paid scholars on the chopping block if they still cannot motivate the people in all works and businesses so that they could in time start producing world beating products and services due to empowering by the government through open and accountable policies producing results instead of just playing with hypes like property or retailing or IR or taking a ride on external conditions.<br><br>Our economic management is too hollow based on a lot of hypes. It is fragile with nothing much to boast of except for all the media talks of success in attracting foreign investments which at any time in a down turn will just leave us.<br><br>We have not restructured the economy to value-adding technology driven model yet talked about for years and we do not as yet have any major success in producing world beating products or services among our own domestic businesses.<br><br>If Singapore ministers are that good they should stop comparing with Bumiputra and start measuring their performance against the best of the democratic model, particularly the matured democracies as mentioned.</div>
