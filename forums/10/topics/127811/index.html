            <div class='col-md body'>Japan foreign minister leaves China after failing to get apology<br><br>Japanese Foreign Minister Nobutaka Machimura ended a two-day visit to China during which he failed to get an apology for widespread anti-Japanese protests.<br><br>"Japanese Foreign Minister Nobutaka Machimura concluded his visit to China and left here Tuesday morning," the Xinhua news agency reported.<br><br>China said Monday its ties with Japan were at a 30-year low and repeated it would not apologise for the series of protests after a second day of talks between Machimura and Chinese Foreign Minister Li Zhaoxing.<br><br>Li had told Machimura that China hoped Japan would take "concrete actions" to face up to its history of aggression in China to improve bilateral relations.<br><br>Machimura retorted by expressing "deep regret" over the rallies, which caused damage to Japanese diplomatic missions, restaurants and businesses in major Chinese cities.<br><br>Ties between East Asia's two most powerful nations have rapidly approached a nadir after Japan approved a nationalist textbook that glossed over wartime atrocities.<br><br>They have been further ruffled by Japan's bid for a permanent seat on the UN Security Council.<br><br>Amid the tension a Japanese court Tuesday rejected a compensation lawsuit filed by 10 Chinese survivors of Japanese atrocities including the 1937 Nanjing massacre.<br><br>The decision by the Tokyo High Court is consistent with repeated rulings in Japan, which says any compensation for World War II crimes is a bilateral issue between countries rather than a case an individual can bring before the courts.<br><br>The Tokyo High Court refused to hear an appeal by the women, whose case had already been dismissed by a district court. They can still go to the Supreme Court.<br><br>Plaintiffs left the courtroom holding a banner that read, "Unjust verdict."<br><br>The plaintiffs had sought 100 million yen (930,000 dollars) for atrocities including the Nanjing massacre, bombings by Japanese forces and the "Unit 731" that performed medical experiments on humans.<br><br>Meanwhile Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi on Tuesday defended his visits to a Tokyo war shrine that have infuriated China and called for the two countries to understand each other's views amid a heated row.<br><br>Since taking office in 2001, Koizumi has made four pilgrimages to the Yasukuni shrine, which honors 2.5 million Japanese war dead including seven World War II leaders hanged for war crimes.<br><br>Asked if his visits to the Shinto sanctuary were a reason for the massive anti-Japanese protests this month in China, Koizumi said: "I don't think so."<br><br>"I have been visiting in order to pledge not to have war and to mourn the war dead," Koizumi told reporters.<br><br>"Respective countries have respective histories and traditions and have different opinions," Koizumi said. "It is necessary to deepen mutual understanding."<br><br>Chinese State Councillor Tang Jiaxuan, a former foreign minister, has said Japanese leaders' visits to the Yasukuni shrine were at the heart of bilateral problems.<br><br>Koizumi has visited the shrine annually since taking office, each time prompting protests by China and South Korea, which were victims of Japanese aggression.<br><br>Koizumi has not yet gone this year or said clearly if he will. His last pilgrimage was on January 1, 2004.<br><br></div>

Since you love them so much ! </div></blockquote><strong>Calm down.</strong> The last thing we need is anger clouding the current situation. Already, enraged chinese protesters have resorted to physical show of force through stone pelting, material boycotts of Japanese products to make their point. I believe that a blockade of their front gate is a more effective and stronger statement: not only does it convey a picture of self-control despite great dissatisfaction, it also make it even easier to emphasis their points.<br><br>For me, the current status quo should not stay: they have obscured their own World War II history to such an extent that come a decade or two, the young Japanese would look at us in incredulity whenever we mention Japan's unapologetic stand.<br><br>We need to assert our rights to a public apology, not only to China and South Korea, but to all the other nations Japan has transgressed during its wartime aggression: to do justice to all the suffering our grandparents (parents to some of us) have suffered, we must demand that the Japanese education ministry rewrite their history books to adhere to facts. This is something I feel isn't hard achieve, and is the right thing to do. After all, History is about facts, not some nationalistic propaganda to whitewash the past.</div>
