              yes, i really hope to hear from pm
              
              Letter to PM
              
              The third posting addressed to Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong is from blogger FeedMeToTheFish
              
              Dear Mr Prime Minister,
              While you have your lymphoma, I have my share of heart attack and ventricular fibrillation.
              
              While you are concerned about your mum's health, I had the greatest understanding of the fragility of life and the inevitability of death while taking care of my dad (as old as your dad if he's alive today) when he was down with his degenerative disease.
              
              While you were growing up as the son of a prime minister in big but shabby Oxley Rise house (so said your sister [Link]), I was growing up with 8 other siblings in a $25-per-month-rented-one-room flat as the son of a Singapore Traction Company bus conductor moonlighting as a pirate taxi driver so that his family could survive.
              
              You did Harvard and Cambridge and whatever you fancy, the best I did was Senior Cambridge Certificate (today's 'O Level' equivalent).
              
              Today you are the highest paid politician in the whole wide world earning $3.7m (excluding your BG and after-55-PM-pension), I'm making do with about $24,000 per annum hawking my skills as a self employed. 
              
              I have no pension and I'm not entitled to any of the benefits which your PAP so often makes a song and dance about at every election and/or Budget Statement. 
              
              Please do not tell me about my GST rebate as it's nauseating since the GST went to your salary too.
              
              No, I'm not complaining of my state of being. Being rich and happy is where your mind is at, not what you can suck out of others! 
              
              As my kids can take care of themselves, $2,000 a month is enough for me and my wife to have a simple comfortable life. My family and I are blessed with what we are happy with!
              
              How much is enough?
              
              Enough for what?
              
              It depends on the individual's sense of value, contentment, greed, sense of power and one's one-upmanship. Does it feel good to be paid 6 times the POTUS?
              
              You tell me!
              
              Though we are of about the same age, we were made differently. I guess the only thing we have in common is that we are, born-in-Singapore, Singaporeans.
              
              As much as I'm a pauper compared to your riches, I'm delighted that I do not have to bear the responsibilities that you do.
              
              My wish for you is that you'd be blessed with grandfatherhood which I'm most grateful for when my child gave birth to another child.
              
              When one loves life, when one truly cares and has the free will to do so without the hindrance of position, power and face value, one is always free . . . . . . . . even to blog until one is caught :)
              
              I sincerely hope that the job you do now is the job that you love, not the job imposed by your father or whoever.
              
              Though I have been told by those who know you that you are not as useless (ie. for the magic salary you pay yourself, people expect magic performance too) and callous as you appear to be, I still have my doubt.
              
              From the pedigree that you were inseminated with (what with your dad laughing again at dummies like me for not having university education [Link]), I was shocked to hear of your "mee siam mai hum" and "fix opposition and buy votes". Which devil made you do that?
              
              You were silent for many days when Mas Selamat jalan.
              
              You were silent for many days when Singaporeans were hurt by the Lehman fiasco and toxic financial products.
              
              You were silent for many days when Town Councils burned themselves with Lehman too.
              
              I have never written to politicians especially ministers level as I know what I write doesn't mean squat to them . . . just another tiny voice in the wilderness.
              
              However, I'm writing now to do my part as a Singaporean before I die from my next heart attack.
              
              Mr Lee, please say something!
              
              Yes, before I'm fedtothefish, I hope that as highest paid prime minister of the universe, you will do the gracious thing of investigating why your PAP MP Dr Ong Seh Hong is in such a fix right now with the Ren Ci CEO Ming Yi saga.
              
              Silence may be golden but your reticence in commenting on the crucial happenings in Singapore lately is not helping you in your job. 
              
              It is not helping people to "Staying Together Moving Ahead" It makes a joke of your PAP manifesto. If you are still at a loss on what to say, Singaporeans will be wondering, "WTF is he doing?"
              
              Please say something worthy of your salary and position for the benefit of all Singaporeans on Ren Ci/Dr Ong's issue.
              
              Even if you were to tell us that "it's not an issue at all as he became whiter-than-white MP only after he cleared the loan", we would still be happier than to have you keep your mouth shut again.
              
              We look forward to it.
              
              Thank you.

              <p>well this letter meaningful but kind of pointless...i wonder if the PM even has the time to read it.

              <p>yes, i really hope to hear from pm</p>
              <p>Letter to PM</p>
              <p>The third posting addressed to Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong is from blogger FeedMeToTheFish</p>
              <p>Dear Mr Prime Minister,<br>While you have your lymphoma, I have my share of heart attack and ventricular fibrillation.</p>
              <p>While you are concerned about your mum’s health, I had the greatest understanding of the fragility of life and the inevitability of death while taking care of my dad (as old as your dad if he’s alive today) when he was down with his degenerative disease.</p>
              <p>While you were growing up as the son of a prime minister in big but shabby Oxley Rise house (so said your sister [Link]), I was growing up with 8 other siblings in a $25-per-month-rented-one-room flat as the son of a Singapore Traction Company bus conductor moonlighting as a pirate taxi driver so that his family could survive.</p>
              <p>You did Harvard and Cambridge and whatever you fancy, the best I did was Senior Cambridge Certificate (today’s ‘O Level’ equivalent).</p>
              <p>Today you are the highest paid politician in the whole wide world earning $3.7m (excluding your BG and after-55-PM-pension), I’m making do with about $24,000 per annum hawking my skills as a self employed.</p>
              <p>I have no pension and I’m not entitled to any of the benefits which your <span>PAP</span> so often makes a song and dance about at every election and/or Budget Statement.</p>
              <p>Please do not tell me about my <span>GST</span> rebate as it’s nauseating since the <span>GST</span> went to your salary too.</p>
              <p>No, I’m not complaining of my state of being. Being rich and happy is where your mind is at, not what you can suck out of others!</p>
              <p>As my kids can take care of themselves, $2,000 a month is enough for me and my wife to have a simple comfortable life. My family and I are blessed with what we are happy with!</p>
              <p>How much is enough?</p>
              <p>Enough for what?</p>
              <p>It depends on the individual’s sense of value, contentment, greed, sense of power and one’s one-upmanship. Does it feel good to be paid 6 times the <span>POTUS</span>?</p>
              <p>You tell me!</p>
              <p>Though we are of about the same age, we were made differently. I guess the only thing we have in common is that we are, born-in-Singapore, Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>As much as I’m a pauper compared to your riches, I’m delighted that I do not have to bear the responsibilities that you do.</p>
              <p>My wish for you is that you’d be blessed with grandfatherhood which I’m most grateful for when my child gave birth to another child.</p>
              <p>When one loves life, when one truly cares and has the free will to do so without the hindrance of position, power and face value, one is always free . . . . . . . . even to blog until one is caught <img title="Smile" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile"></p>
              <p>I sincerely hope that the job you do now is the job that you love, not the job imposed by your father or whoever.</p>
              <p>Though I have been told by those who know you that you are not as useless (ie. for the magic salary you pay yourself, people expect magic performance too) and callous as you appear to be, I still have my doubt.</p>
              <p>From the pedigree that you were inseminated with (what with your dad laughing again at dummies like me for not having university education [Link]), I was shocked to hear of your “mee siam mai hum” and “fix opposition and buy votes”. Which devil made you do that?</p>
              <p>You were silent for many days when Mas Selamat jalan.</p>
              <p>You were silent for many days when Singaporeans were hurt by the Lehman fiasco and toxic financial products.</p>
              <p>You were silent for many days when Town Councils burned themselves with Lehman too.</p>
              <p>I have never written to politicians especially ministers level as I know what I write doesn’t mean squat to them . . . just another tiny voice in the wilderness.</p>
              <p>However, I’m writing now to do my part as a Singaporean before I die from my next heart attack.</p>
              <p>Mr Lee, please say something!</p>
              <p>Yes, before I’m fedtothefish, I hope that as highest paid prime minister of the universe, you will do the gracious thing of investigating why your <span>PAP MP</span> Dr Ong Seh Hong is in such a fix right now with the Ren Ci <span>CEO</span> Ming Yi saga.</p>
              <p>Silence may be golden but your reticence in commenting on the crucial happenings in Singapore lately is not helping you in your job.</p>
              <p>It is not helping people to “Staying Together Moving Ahead” It makes a joke of your <span>PAP</span> manifesto. If you are still at a loss on what to say, Singaporeans will be wondering, “WTF is he doing?”</p>
              <p>Please say something worthy of your salary and position for the benefit of all Singaporeans on Ren Ci/Dr Ong’s issue.</p>
              <p>Even if you were to tell us that “it’s not an issue at all as he became whiter-than-white MP only after he cleared the loan”, we would still be happier than to have you keep your mouth shut again.</p>
              <p>We look forward to it.</p>
              <p>Thank you.<br>feedmetothefish.<br><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7980823109190564557&amp;#38;postID=1743444996560671746">https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=798082…</a></p>

              <p><br>Ladies and Gentlemen,</p>
              <p>Please rise for the Prime Minister of Singapore,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>.......Please be seated....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Prime Minister Sir,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thank you Angel,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hello fellow Singaporeans,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I was having a massage therapy when my secretary informed me about this message, well, i am both glad and sad to read it, however, since you want to hear from me, so be it, afterall I am paid to do so.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>First, let not get personnal about family issues in regard to my historical background and living condition, I am just glad to see a gross income of a 2k man able to live in happiness with his family in Singapore, so not much of worry over the lower income peoples, they can survive these downtime with proudness. And I bless them with more happiness to come down the road.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As you see, even people of the lower 20% group are able to post such intellectually smart posting, very enlightening and indeed quite well written, you should expect that the above 80% must be very smart and wise, more so are the upper 20% rich class, they are not easy to deal with, it not a job for the tom and dick to handle, this isn't some Zimbalwee or Congo republican, this is Singapore, 1st world status, constant attaining the nos 1 seaport and airport of the world, one of the most vibrant economy in ASIA, peace and harmony with top talents and smart peoples running the show. If you want to govern this place, a 3.5millions paid per annual may not justify that, even the lower class can challenge you and therefore by right,  you need to pay a PM at least 10millions per annual to take care of all these intelligent peoples, but for the sake of my fellow citizens and my personnal patriotism to Singapore, I can take a cut. You dun hv to envy my paid, in actual fact, i am underpay, but as a PM, i got no unions to fight me.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In the case of Ren Ci or Ren Yau cases or even Aware or Unaware cases, let the courts and judges decide, they are paid to do the job, not me, unless they dun perform, then maybe I will step in, the society is governed by laws and orders, the usual is always there, but if someone try to play the unusual, that is to break the laws and orders, he/she have to face the music and answer for himself/herself. Let those lawyers and judges do their jobs, if not you paid them for what, shake legs?? And of course, as a PM, the security of Singapore is my top priorty, Mat Selamat escape is a mistake, action taken against the complacency and let move forward to look for the man, if we keep going back to the blaming culture, we are going nowhere. Let hold together, stay together and move on with our chest high for Singapore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"MEE Siam Mai Hum", I remember it was a NDP rally speech in the University, I was trying to think out of the box to get the audience attention, and i did it, even till today, most who attended my speech are very attentive to me just waiting for me to make something out of the box. You see, we need to be creative and imaginative, let me ask you "Can Mee Siam go with Hum"?? Yes, why not, if i wish to, i can just add in, we dun have to be so stagnatisation in our mind and believe that only Laksa and Cha kway teow got hum, why not mee siam, a new invention. But anyway, i managed to get the sleepy audience and adversaries to their attention. In another words, Listen when the PM talks.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Angel: Prime Minister Sir, your wife is waiting for you</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>PM: Oh!, so I hope that my speech can enlighten you all and wish to see that you cast a vote on me in our election. Greatly appreciated.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Angel: All rise, the Prime Minister will be leaving, all are to remain seated until the PRIME MINISTER LEAVE. Dinner will be serve with Prime Ribs and bakery from PRIME Deli, for the Muslim groups, we will serve Indian Rojak. Thank you all for Coming.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Angel Wish all a very Good evening. Bye bye</p>
