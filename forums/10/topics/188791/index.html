It should declare without partition interest whether such error is error on form or substance. It the error on form so critical that it cannot be verified by JG's IC.<br><br>Then if provisions in the GRC cannot be interpreted by the independent election office, then such provision which is likely to affect the outcome of election should be regarded as ambiquous and result may be declared null and void if election is proceeded with.<br><br>This is the kind of integrity of the whole system all should be talking about in implementing the GRC law not by calling JG names like liars or having lower standards. This is character assasination in the worse form imaginable.<br><br>If the non-partition election department also cannot interpret it except FM George Yeo then who is in charge of election and do we have integrity in the whole GRC election system.<br><br>No body should call JG name until any ambiguities in the GRC law regarding confirmation of race is established by a more independent Election office or the court.<br><br>To JG he has no problem in establishing his race but it was just that he might have made a slip-up in submitting a form which in the absence of dishonesty over his race should be a minor form error not substantive error going to the root of his entitlement to stand for election.<br><br>So will the error be error in form or substance and this has to be interpreted independently by the Election office and further confirmed by JG's IC.</div>

Without studying much, I only know that there is something vry wrong if our leaders keep talking about honesty, integrity, leadership and talents and qualifications when these are only basics in the first world or any country. First world people understand the purpose of discussions, criticism or challenges. These people in the first world enjoy a good debate to see whose ideas indeed are better. They could tolerate such free play and interactions between leaders and people to avoid narrow-minded self-centred unaccountable practices which may lead to bigger problems.<br><br>First world people are also people who live on a higher level of existence being concerned with actions and implementation rather than struggling with concepts and assumptions.<br><br>It is good to be honesty, reliable and have integrity but these are not something to talk about for politicking as they are basic qualities of leaders without which they would not succeed in being leaders.<br><br>Is GRC honestly done for balance racial representation or to entrench the ruling party to stay in power? If government elected to be just and equitable in looking after people's interest irrespective of creed or political belief? So what is honesty and integrity?<br><br>But sadly our leader in recent forum has only finally revealed that he does not believe in fairness or level playing field whether in estate upgrading or election processes so what is honesty and integrity?<br><br>The whole governing philosophy and manifesto are now upside down as everything said about honesty, integrity and all the values are now a mumbo jumbo not worth believing in by any one. That is what citizens have got to solve now as no one will solve them now. Citizens will need larger leaders who could see overall perspective from a larger radar screen and not only their own images.</div>
