              <p><strong>ASEAN shows the way to SCO</strong></p>
              <p>MOSCOW. (RIA Novosti political commentator Dmitry Kosyrev) - The
              foreign ministers of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) have
              met in the capital of Tajikistan for the last time before the SCO
              summit in August, to approve the agenda.</p>
              <p>The SCO is a regional organization comprising Russia, China,
              Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Uzbekistan. India, Iran,
              MongoliaÂ and Pakistan have observer status.</p>
              <p>Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and his Chinese colleague, Yang
              Jiechi, have come to Dushanbe from Singapore, where they attended a
              security forum held by ASEAN. Before that, they held bilateral talks in
              Beijing.</p>
              <p>Flying almost parallel courses to Dushanbe is not a coincidence. Major
              Asian powers, Russia and China are very active in Southeast and Central
              Asia and are full members of ASEAN and the SCO, a Central Asian
              organization similar to ASEAN.</p>
              <p>In Singapore, the foreign ministers concluded an interesting diplomatic
              project, which can and should be used at the SCO as a model and as a
              precedent.</p>
              <p>The United States and the European Union accused one of the ASEAN
              member states, Myanmar (formerly Burma), of failure to prevent a
              humanitarian catastrophe after Cyclone Nargis hit the south and east of
              the country on May 2 and 3, 2008, resulting in nearly 138,000 people
              dead or missing.</p>
              <p>One of the vulnerable elements in SCO history is the killing of unarmed
              protesters by the Uzbek government in Andijan in May 2005.</p>
              <p>There could be other similar incidents in the member states of both
              organizations, but is this enough for the Western public to demonize
              them?</p>
              <p>Myanmar knows that blows against one's reputation can be followed by
              airstrikes, like in Yugoslavia in 1999 or a softer but no less dramatic
              attack as in Indonesia, when it lost part of its territory in 1999, now
              called East Timor.</p>
              <p>The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) has so far refused
              to admit East Timor. The organization does not like the Myanmar
              military regime either, but it likes foreign interference in regional
              affairs even less. This is why Myanmar's partners and neighbors
              resolved to uncover the truth.</p>
              <p>Last May, the West launched a verbal attack at Myanmar, accusing the
              regime of inability to help hundreds of thousands of cyclone victims
              and refusal to accept Western humanitarian aid, inferring that
              "humanitarian intervention" was needed in this situation.</p>
              <p>This is when the government of Myanmar, ASEAN and the UN released the
              Post-Nargis Joint Assessment (PONJA) report, which provides the first
              comprehensive picture and objective analysis of the devastating impact
              of the cyclone on the Myanmar people. The report includes facts and
              figures, while media attacks on Myanmar are nothing but empty words.</p>
              <p>The PONJA report does not mention hunger or health epidemics, which the
              media alleges have begun and which they blame on the Myanmar
              government.</p>
              <p>The weeklong ministerial meeting in Singapore began with extensive
              discussions of Cyclone Nargis and the PONJA report. While ASEAN
              analysts were preparing the report, diplomats tried to convince Myanmar
              leaders to stop the hysterics and accept foreign aid. Illogically, the
              regime ordered troops to protect the country from U.S. warships
              carrying humanitarian aid.</p>
              <p>Singapore, which at present holds the rotating presidency of ASEAN,
              organized the diplomatic action. Foreign Minister George Yeo has given
              significant interviews before the report's publication, saying that
              ASEAN decided to "separate politics from humanitarian efforts and
              concentrate on helping the people first."</p>
              <p>Assistance to Myanmar, which is "part of the family," he said, "lays
              the groundwork" for change there, including the 2010 elections. ASEAN
              is doing its best to encourage such change.</p>
              <p>Nobody can accuse Singapore of anti-Western paranoia. "We must always
              keep our doors open to the Americans, to the Europeans, to everybody,
              this is an open house," George Yeo said, meaning that the action to
              help Myanmar was not anti-American but pro-ASEAN.</p>
              <p>The SCO has a similar ideology. The point at issue is not about
              allowing foreigners into Central or Southeast Asia; what matters is who
              calls the tune: regional, local or foreign politicians.</p>
              <p>The ASEAN ministerial meeting in Singapore also addressed the
              territorial dispute between Thailand and Cambodia, which is another
              useful example for the SCO, as Tajikistan again quarreled with
              Uzbekistan shortly before the meeting in Dushanbe.</p>
              <p>There are no regional associations where all member states love each
              other without distinction. On the contrary, the more there are
              neighbors, the more frequently they argue. But neighbors also have
              common interests, and their organizations should know how to protect
              these interests.</p>
              <p>The SCO should be <span style="text-decoration: underline;">grateful to Singapore for providing this example.</span></p>
