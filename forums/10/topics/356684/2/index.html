              <p><br> Frankly, i think if we do the maths the number of people suffering
              from the pain of illness too unbearable without painkillers or
              dehabilating diseases is probably going to far outnumber the horror
              cases.</p>
              <p>I'm not trying to be flippant or ignore the fact that there are
              abuses out there, but it's just going to be a mathematical
              certainty as you grow older you're going to get hit by a chronic
              disease, suffering from pain and discomforts where everyday is just
              struggling to take the next breath, not living in any sense of the
              word.</p>
              <p> I certainly would like the option open for myself of
              course. Euthanasia should really be only allowed with permission by
              the person suffering. There's already a procedure for coma
              patients, i think the Euthanasia the government is trying to
              push for is a different thing.</p>

              <p>I was using the instance of botched jobs to highlight the many loose ends that'll need tying up.</p>
              <p>Personally, suffering in whatever amount does not diminish the dignity of a person's life. It's a reflection of our society's worship of instant gratification that we abhor pain and would rather not take it head-on. And then we have to ask, why stigmatise suicide but not euthanasia, when in both cases the individual no longer holds out for hope or purpose in life? This is of course philosophy that I'm not trying to impose on others but rather share.</p>
              <p>What is of greater objective concern is that we should not open up avenues for ruthless and unscrupulous governments, if they come to power in the future, to conduct Nazi-style euthanisations of elderly and people. It's not far-fetched as a means of reducing the burden of the ageing population on taxpayers.</p>

              <p><br>I don't think we really have much in conflict, i'm sure we both can agree that Euthanasia needs to be well regulated to prevent its abuse but has situations where it is definitely applicable.</p>
              <p>However, i am also a believer that the worth of a human being is in the end, what we can leave for and contribute to the next generation. Any other purpose outside of this goal is pointless from an objective point of view.  </p>
              <p>While i do not advocate to do it for all elderly of prior generations, i want it to be available when my liability to society exceeds my contribution. I have no desire to live beyond an age where my existence prevents the next generation from being more fruitful with their time. Since i am also a believer of peak Resource, i want to be able to leave more so that they may undo our mistakes with.  </p>
              <p>Mother Nature, in the end never negotiates.</p>

              <p>If Gaia refuses to negotiate, we mankind will have to force our hand and bring her to the negotiating table.</p>
              <p>If she separates lands with rivers, we mankind will build bridges to cross such rivers, begining with flimsy rope and wood kinds to super steel structures works of arts!</p>
              <p>If she places mountains on our path, we will blow a hole into the mountain to go across it.</p>
              <p>If she refuses to send water or rain to cultivated fields, we will build irrigation canals to our fields!</p>
              <p>If our days are determined by her, then we will thru the advancement of science and technology extend our days.</p>
              <p>Throughout existance of mankind, we respect her, but we never allowed her to dictate how we must live, for the sake of our future generations. There is more than enough for each and every human to live a fruitful life, as promised by our higher plane of existant teachers. This is a bountiful Earth, and there is more than one Spaceship Earth in the Universe, for we as a humanity will become more than the stars in the skies.</p>
              <p>There is more to life than just waking up, going to work, back to sleep and live another day. There is love, joy, tears, fears, laughter, happiness and conquest of our basic emotions and rise above it, and bring meaning to another human as we courageously live our lifetime.</p>
              <p>There is no need to limit ourselves or demand that a limit be set to deny others a chance to live and love.</p>
              <p>Spaceship Earth exists for us, and not us for the spaceship. To leave this Spaceship, we must ensure that we contribute back more than what it had given us, through the building and expanding of our science and technological knowledge, so that more others may have a chance to live, love and move on other starships. That is our responsibility and the continuance of our race - the human race. Not kill others or even ourselves, denying such opportunities as selfish individuals tried to do, destruction of others or slavery, burning of books and sacred texts to deny mankind knowledge.</p>
              <p>No man alive knows his true worth to another until he expires, and even then, at the point of expiry, he knows not what he had contributed may shape another for centuries yet to come. Thus each life is precious and must be treasured and saved whereever and whenever possible. </p>
