            <div class='col-md body'>Â“ItÂ’s not that the elderly donÂ’t want to retire, many simply cannot afford to,Â” said Rick Lim in a letter.<br><br>He was responding to a government backbencher who had asked why the senior citizens could not just retire early and enjoy life, and he wondered if their expectations of life were too high.<br><br>Lim wrote: Â“Are the senior citizens working as cleaners because they are saving to purchase a condominium or a luxury car, or is it because they need to feed themselves and their families?Â”<br><br>This is the other face of prospering Singapore, which has one of the worldÂ’s fastest ageing populations.<br><br>Recently, a student from China who was interviewed said that he found it strange to see so many cleaners were elderly, compared to poorer China where they would be enjoying their retirement.<br><br>Blame it on globalisation, insufficient safety net or poor education when they were young (probably all together) but it has made old age synonymous Â– rightly or wrongly Â– with poverty and hardship.<br><br>This is why some Singaporeans who are 45 or older are not looking forward to the prospect of living in one of the worldÂ’s richest nations in 20 yearsÂ’ time.<br><br>The reason? By then they will be joining the unappealing ranks of the cityÂ’s greying population (aged 65 or more) even as the city moves upwards.<br><br>Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew painted the exciting scenario recently of a fast-developing Singapore moving Â“into the upper half of the First World. We can do this in the next 10-20 years.Â”<br><br>Even today growing old is not a good thing. Many employers consider 45-year-olds as over the hill, preferring to replace them with younger, cheaper workers.<br><br>(Making things worse is the large influx of foreign workers who are ready to accept lower salaries.)<br><br>The majority of aged workers are lowly skilled and make up the bulk of SingaporeÂ’s struggling class. In recent years, their income has either stagnated or declined, while the rich got richer.<br><br>This affects their ability to save for retirement, despite their mandatory Central Provident Funds.<br><br>Only 27% of Singaporeans between 25 and 75 said that they have sufficient funds to retire, compared with 61% of Thais and 47% of Malaysians, according to an insurance company survey.<br><br>Today one in 12 Singaporeans are 65 or older; by 2030, this will become one in five.<br><br>Like elsewhere, this age group has more than a higher rate of homeless and poor, the depressed, and the desperately sick. Many are becoming victims of cheating or crime; suicide rates are high.<br><br>In a post-mortem of the 2006 election, leaders of the ruling PeopleÂ’s Action Party attributed its large 9% drop in popularity to older votes.<br><br>If it is true, it doesnÂ’t augur well for its future because this base of senior citizens is growing very quickly.<br><br>The decision to increase its 5% Goods and Services tax (GST) to 7% will be an added blow to Singaporeans, especially the elderly low-income or retirees group.<br><br>To mitigate the impact, the government is offering GST credits of up to S$1,000 (RM2,296) to all over 21 years old, that will be apportioned according to income and home value.<br><br>In addition, the 2007 Budget also gave Singaporeans a bonus of up to S$1,000 to all Singaporeans who make S$100,000 (229,600) or less, with those over 55 getting the lionÂ’s share.<br><br>Two-thirds will be in cash and the rest in Medisave for healthcare.<br><br>But it is jobs that remain the bugbear for the seniors because many employers are reluctant to employ Â– or keep Â– people over 50.<br><br>Lee Seck Kay says that government efforts to keep elderly people gainfully employed are failing, citing a friend who was retrenched from a foreign oil company.<br><br>Â“When he applied to a local one, he was told that at 55 he was too old. They were looking for someone below 48,Â” he added.<br><br>Citizens over 55 are given discounts for public transport and entertainment places (non-peak hours), far short of what the public wants.<br><br>These Singaporeans have spent a lifetime working hard to build Singapore up, whether as coolies or managers, and should be looked after during their sunset years, many believe.<br><br>Singapore is one of the most expensive places in Asia to retire in, observes a grandmother of two. Â“The old should be enjoying their time, not working as cleaners.Â”<br><br>Singapore has the worldÂ’s highest rate of public home ownership. It may be establishing a new trend of downgrading, owners selling their flats for smaller ones to free up cash for retirement.<br><br>A newspaper reader, Lee Chin Wai, notices that official figures show potential up-graders (the opposite) still outnumbering down-graders by three to one.<br><br>If one rules out migration, this ratio could drop to one-to-one by 2017.<br><br>A retiree suggested the government dip into its reserves to pay each Singaporean over 65 a monthly S$200-S$300 (RM459-RM689) for the rest of his life so that he can enjoy his sunset years Â– an unlikely event.<br><br>(This article was publised im The Star on Saturday, Mar 3, 2007)<br><br></div>

How to move to the next level if we continue to work more?  There is only 24 hours a day and there is only so much you can give in a life time.<br><br></div>

That's the kind of bullsh|t the gov wants you to believe. We will lose our jobs to China or India if we don't let in cheap foreign labour to bring down our labour cost (steal our jobs), but the labour force isn't homogenous (just look around Beijing for the English translations), the infrastructure isn't the same (our infrastructure framework, ports, telecommunication, public utilities, transport, etc), geographical framework is different (only summer in Singapore, unlike other countries which might have winter affecting productivity).<br><br>Say two brands of car maker exist, Hyundai and Mercedes. Why is it that Hyundai is price sensitive and Mercedes is not price sensitive? One is an elastic demand, whereas the other is inelastic. Elastic being, demand is price sensitive. Inelastic being, demand is not price sensitive.<br><br>Asking Singapore to compete on labour cost with China for these low level manufacturing job is downright stupid.<br><br>Japan has always adopted a protectionist attitude (e.g. rice, beef, insurance, automobiles, etc) towards it's domestic economy, <a href="http://www.acojapan.com/japanesetax.htm" rel="nofollow">it has a corporate tax rate 30% (22% with structured offsets for small enterprises) </a>, <a href="http://www.fxstreet.com/news/forex-news/article.aspx?StoryId=9d2660b1-d529-4234-9fe0-bff6147c3ec2" rel="nofollow">yet it is still able to maintain a low natural rate of unemployment of 4.0%</a><br><br>France's unemployment rate is only about 1.5% off from it's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAIRU" rel="nofollow">natural rate of unemployment (which means full employment)</a> (which is around 8%), which isn't as shocking as what you make it out to be. <a href="http://www.econstats.com/weo/C058V029.htm" rel="nofollow">Since the 1980s, when Globalisation wasn't such a big buzz word then, the unemployment rate of France has been around 8%-11%.</a> Some of these European countries has a high natural rate (full employment) of unemployment, because of their generous social security benefits, they can afford not to work if they are being paid less than their social security benefits. The government ensures that they maintain an average level of livelihood if their pay is less than the social security. The government cares about it's citizens. Spain, Finland, Germany, Belgium and Italy has a similar natural rate of unemployment, but you don't hear of people starving to death in the streets or major revolutions to overthrow the governments. Perhaps if our government demands less pay for their work, we might be able to afford a higher natural rate of unemployment, where anyone above 65 can retire peacefully.<br><br>You are quite the propaganda parrot.<br><br>Polly want a cracker???<br><br>You better stick to paraphrasing replies taken from other websites about diabetes in your own forum.</div>
