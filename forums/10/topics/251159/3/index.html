Do our govt ministers have the same requirements, that they must get the nod of the Singapore population before paying themselves any more ridiculous pay? NO.<br><br>What you mentioned, about the pay of the Singaporeans, is NOT what the govt is advocating. Remember what our govt did, to ask Singaporeans to accept lower fixed pay and higher variable pay so that the companies will find it attractive to come to Singapore due to the lower fixed costs.<br><br>Do you know that there is no motivation for companies to pay higher variable pay, and many companies are exploiting this?<br><br>True, the world is not fair, God is not fair.

Aren't they behaving no different from the pigs in Animal Farm?<br><br>Please also think carefully, what justifies that they are talented, and we are mediocre? The word 'talented' is bestowed upon themselves thru their own mouths. We do not find them 'talented', and at times, they are even mediocre.</div>

You have to ask yourself: will the company lose money if you leave? Will the company lose you to its competitor if your boss does not increase your pay and will you be a big loss to your boss? If the answer is 'yes', it will be a stupid employer who won't pay higher wages.

They have to look at the big picture and ignore the rantings of a small vocal minority. Are they talented? The elections show how Singaporeans feel. Despite the high salaries that frustrate Singaporeans, most of us are still prepared to vote them in. Why? Because like the desperate employer who wants to keep a valuable worker, we want our continued economic success. I am desperate to keep a team of the best people who understands the economy and I am prepared to pay millions to keep them, rather than lose them to Morgan Stanley. And yes, I would rather pay 20 million to have graduates of Oxbridge and Ivy League colleges work for me rather than the peanuts it takes to pay CSJ.<br><br>There will always be those who lose out in the global market.

We have already said, that the elections in Singapore do not truly reflect the actual wishes of Singaporeans, becoz only a small minority of people get to vote. This DOES NOT reflect a strong mandate, because the sample size is too small<br><br>Please also do not miss the points again, that our leaders are the MOST HIGHLY paid politicians in the entire world. It is totally ridiculous, because if you compare apples to apples, our leaders should be comparing between political leaders, and NOT private sector. And we are a SMALL little dot.<br><br>Please do not also miss the point again, that many companies do not behave like what you said. Many companies (esp Singapore companies) do not treat talent properly. Again, many are brought up with the 'CHEAP AND GOOD' mentality of the govt, and would rather lose talents than to pay more for them. That's why till now, not many Singapore companies succeed in the international arena, becoz with their mentality,they cannot compete with other foreign organisations.<br><br>In fact, based on what you said, then I think you better plan emigration soon, coz I firmly believe PAP will see the wrath of the new generation, in the next election.</div>

In Blankfein's case, his achievements included presiding over a firm which yielded a record USD14.6 billion pre-tax profits.

Why don't you try asking one of the clowns in the current cabinet to defect to Morgan Stanley or Goldman Sachs then?
