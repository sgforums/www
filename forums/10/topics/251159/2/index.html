            <div class='col-md body'>Somebody wants statistics but refuse to accept the figures. Here's more statistics...an excellent article on the French economy:<br><br>AS AN American in Paris during the French presidential election last weekend, it was hard to understand what the big deal was.<br>'Huge turnout as voters set stark left-right duel' read a front-page headline in the International Herald Tribune following Sunday's first-round vote in which centre-right candidate Nicolas Sarkozy and socialist Segolene Royal emerged victorious.<br><br>Another read: 'Voters endorse two visions of the future.'<br><br>Excusez-moi, but isn't that always the case? The world is divided into left and right, with shades of grey in between and bursts of colour on the outer fringes. French voters' choice - between a conservative (seasonally adjusted for France, of course) former finance and interior minister and a female lawmaker, both of whom want to resuscitate France's economy - is really not different from the one faced by Britons in the late 1970s and Americans in 1980.<br><br>The impact isn't likely to be as dramatic in France's case.<br><br>'Sarkozy is not like Reagan or Thatcher,' said Mr Christophe Maillard, secretary-general of Liberte Cherie (Beloved Freedom), a classical liberal think-tank and grassroots organisation outside Paris. 'He's still in favour of big government. He's better than Chirac or Royal. That doesn't mean he's good.'<br><br>Mr Sarkozy, or anyone else for that matter, won't be able to implement his programme without first reforming France's powerful labour unions, said Mr Maillard. The unions represent only 8 per cent of French workers but have an influence that is disproportionate to their size.<br><br>It was one year ago that French students and unions took to the streets, blocking access to many universities.<br><br>The source of their angst? A new law that would have allowed companies to fire workers younger than 26 without cause, or severance within two years of hiring. The idea that the law would have improved the job prospects of college graduates - if companies can't fire they won't hire - seems to have lost something in translation. <strong>There's no point in worrying about job security when there are no jobs. </strong><br><br>Both Mr Sarkozy and Ms Royal, who received 31.2 per cent and 25.6 per cent of the first-round vote respectively, want to revitalise France's economy: Mr Sarkozy, with free-market reforms, including tax cuts and deregulation of the labour market; Ms Royal, with more state spending. She would raise the minimum wage, boost pensions and create more government-sponsored jobs.<br><br>We have a pretty good idea how her initiatives will work out. What we don't know is whether Mr Sarkozy will be able to implement his because of the unions.<br><br>Disproportionate influence<br><br>HOW is it that such a small percentage of French workers can virtually shut down the country? 'Their power comes from the fact that the French mentality is very statist,' said Ms Veronique de Rugy, a French citizen who is a senior research fellow at the Mercatus Centre, a free-market think-tank affiliated with George Mason University in Arlington, Virginia. 'They are untrained to think there is a solution outside of government.'<br><br>The media tends to be one-sided, censoring itself so the government doesn't have to. Unless there's a shift in public sentiment, with people voicing their discontent, the unions will still call the shots, said Ms de Rugy.<br><br>To many outside observers, the France of 2007 resembles the United Kingdom of the 1970s.<br><br>'People want money, but they don't want to work,' said Mr Laurent Tordgman, a Paris taxi driver who was shuttling me from office to hotel. 'People don't think to work.'<br><br>They don't think to work because there isn't much incentive. <strong>It's no coincidence that tax rates and unemployment are high while the number of hours the French spend at work is low. France's unemployment rate is 8.8 per cent, the highest among the 13 countries that share the euro. Some 2.3 million people are unemployed. </strong><br><br>'If Royal wins, it will be the same politics as Mitterrand,' said Mr Tordgman, referring to Mr Francois Mitterrand, another socialist and president of France from 1981 to 1995. 'If Royal wins - many, many taxes, security bad, immigration bad.'<br><br><strong>France's public sector eats up 54 per cent of the economy, the second highest among industrialised countries (behind Sweden). Tax revenues are 51 per cent of gross domestic product. Real GDP growth - 2.5 per cent last year - has lagged behind almost all of France's neighbours for the last three years as its share of world exports has fallen. </strong><br><br>The statistics are sending a clear signal that reform is needed, but until the French people hear it, change will come slowly.<br><br>'There's a deep-rooted resistance to abandoning the French social model' with its cradle-to-grave protections, said Mr Bernard Connolly, global strategist at Banque AIG in London.<br><br>He said the unions' hold on the government is not unlike the relationship between the trade unions and the Labour Party in 1970s Britain. Then British prime minister Margaret Thatcher stood up to the coal miners in 1984, stockpiling supplies in advance to keep power flowing in the event of a likely strike. She won concessions from the unions and proceeded to implement her programme of privatisation, freeing the economy from the unions' grip.<br><br>Mr Sarkozy, currently favoured to win the run-off in the opinion polls, should use the time between now and May 6 to revisit Lady Thatcher's memorable response when her economic reforms were challenged by her own Cabinet at the Conservative Party conference in 1980.<br><br>'Turn if you like,' she said. 'The lady's not for turning.'<br><br>BLOOMBERG<br><br>April 30, Straits Times<br></div>

I suppose, you could label that form of protectionism as the most hypocritical and ironic for such a myopic mindset clearly renders it anything but self-sustaining.

In the same way Hong Kong and Singapore took manufacturing jobs away from the Europeans in the 70s, so cheaper economies are luring businesses away from us. If Singapore companies do not hire foreign workers who are able and willing to work harder for less, these jobs will simply move to China ir India. More Singaporeans will lose their jobs.<br><br>In a globalised world, you have to watch your productivity. Customers are price conscious. If you cannot produce the same product or offer the same quality of service at a price lower than that of your foreign competitors, you lose your job.<br><br>So you say your market value has diminished because of foreign competitors. Perhaps it is because you have priced yourself out of the global market. Asking the government to protect local jobs by installing barriers against global competition is self-defeating. Singapore has done well by relying on the global market. We have [b]no significant domestic market. If you try to protect jobs for locals by keeping the foreigners out, they will move the jobs elsewhere. If you block cheaper foreign goods into Singapore, they can do the same to yours and with a small domestic market, Singapore will come out the loser. Protectionism is a lose-lose situation for us.<br><br>France tried that and look what it has done to their economy. Here's a quotation from the Telegraph. Read about why Frenchmen are flocking to the UK for work:<br><br>" Economic data published last week illustrated yet again a familiar EU correlation: <strong>countries with high tax and protectionism pay for it with mass unemployment.

Thank God our government understands the economy far better than the likes of you who will only drive the nation from the first world to the third.<br><br>Here's what a commentator says of France:<br><br>"Why are things so different today in the United States -- and so different among Muslim young men in France? That is where economics comes in.<br><br>People who are less in demand -- whether because of inexperience, lower skills, or race -- are just as employable at lower pay rates as people who are in high demand are at higher pay rates. That is why blacks were just as able to find jobs as whites were, prior to the decade of the 1930s and why a serious gap in unemployment between black teenagers and white teenagers opened up only after 1950.<br><br>Prior to the decade of the 1930s, the wages of inexperienced and unskilled labor were determined by supply and demand. There was no federal minimum wage law and labor unions did not usually organize inexperienced and unskilled workers. That is why such workers were able to find jobs, just like everyone else, even when these were black workers in an era of open discrimination.<br><br>The first federal minimum wage law, the Davis-Bacon Act of 1931, was passed in part explicitly to prevent black construction workers from "taking jobs" from white construction workers by working for lower wages. It was not meant to protect black workers from "exploitation"; but to protect white workers from competition.<br><br>Even aside from a racial context, minimum wage laws in countries around the world protect higher-paid workers from the competition of lower paid workers.<br><br>Often the higher-paid workers are older, more experienced, more skilled or more unionized. But many goods and services can be produced with either many lower skilled workers or fewer higher skilled workers, as well as with more capital and less labor or vice-versa. Employers' choices depend on the relative costs.<br><br>The net economic effect of minimum wage laws is to make less skilled, less experienced, or otherwise less desired workers more expensive -- thereby pricing many of them out of jobs. Large disparities in unemployment rates between the young and the mature, the skilled and the unskilled, and between different racial groups have been common consequences of minimum wage laws.<br><br>....France's unemployment rate is roughly double that of the United States and people who are unemployed stay unemployed much longer in France.<br><br>Unemployment rates among young Frenchmen are about 20 percent and among young Muslim men about 40 percent.<br><br>There is no free lunch, least of all for the disadvantaged."<br><br>(http://www.capmag.com/article.asp?ID=4472)<br><br>http://www.brusselsjournal.com/node/917<br><br></strong></div></blockquote><strong><strong>Have you replied my post?

            <div class='col-md body'>Why is it that so many French people would rather riot than work?<br><br>For nearly a fortnight, French students repeatedly have taken to the streets in protest of a modest labor reform proposed by Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin. It seems that Villepin had the audacity to suggest that companies hiring workers under the age of 26 have the ability to fire those workers in the first two years of employment. VillepinÂ’s far-from-Draconian reform is a reaction to the countryÂ’s government-planned entitlement state, overregulated labor laws, and sky-high jobless rate.<br><br>But French students apparently prefer their little workerÂ’s paradise just the way it is. The overall jobless rate in France hovers around 10 percent, so-called Â“youth unemploymentÂ” is 23 percent, and in some of the Muslim-heavy suburbs, joblessness is nearly 50 percent. Some paradise.<br><br><strong>In France, you see, companies donÂ’t grow because itÂ’s too costly to hire while itÂ’s against the law to fire. Hence, since they rarely add jobs, French businesses under-perform, under-produce, and under-employ. Think of it: ItÂ’s awfully tough to increase output without a growing workforce to produce it. </strong><br><br>The Villepin reform, of course, would make it a lot easier for firms to hire since they would no longer have to lock-in high wages and benefit costs without first confirming worker productivity, at least for two years. But in response to this mild capitalist reform, a reported 500,000 students have emerged in angry protest. ThereÂ’s now even a threat of a general strike, with government unions, trade unions, and student unions possibly teaming together to shut down the entire French economy (or whatÂ’s left of it).<br><br>Of course, it wasnÂ’t all that long ago that young Muslims rioted and vandalized urban centers across France. Their beef was cultural in nature, but it was also rooted in the fact that France is anti-opportunity, anti-wealth, anti-jobs, anti-markets, anti-work, and anti-capitalism.<br><br>Indeed, at the heart of the French problem is a statist-run socialist economy that is massively overtaxed and overregulated. FranceÂ’s public government sector, for instance, accounts for more than 50 percent of GDP. In other words, private business in France is in the minority.<br><br>Added to this, FranceÂ’s top personal tax rate is 48 percent, with a VAT tax of nearly 20 percent. So that means French laborers face a combined 68 percent tax rate on consumption and investment. No wonder France has created less than 3 million jobs over the past twenty years, compared to 31 million in the United States. Economic growth in Â“cowboy capitalistÂ” America has exceeded that of FranceÂ’s worker paradise by nearly 50 percent.<br><br><strong>In a dramatic speech to the European Parliament last summer, British Prime Minister Tony Blair hit the mark when he criticized all Western European economies for their inability to compete on an acceptable global level. Asked Blair, Â“What type of social model is it that has 20 million unemployed in Europe? Productivity rates falling behind those of the USA? That, on any relative index of a modern economy Â— skills, R&amp;D, patents, information technology Â— is going down, not up?Â”</strong><br><br><strong>Financial Times international editor Olaf Gersemann blames French and European unemployment on high minimum-wage requirements and overly strict employment-protection laws. </strong>Gersemann, who scathingly criticized Western Europe in his book Â“Cowboy Capitalism,Â” says these labor-market regulations have created millions of involuntary unemployed throughout Europe, affecting immigrants in particular. He writes, Â“Most French, German, and Italian voters simply refuse to accept the necessity of a Thatcher-Reagan style economic revolution.Â” He notes that per capita income in the U.S. now exceeds that of France by close to 40 percent, with Germany and Italy lagging even further behind.<br><br>All of this is reminiscent of the British disease of the 1960s and Â’70s. Back then, striking labor unions closed down the English economy again and again, and it took until the early 1980s for Margaret Thatcher to put an end to it. At one point, the Iron Lady actually called in tanks and troops to stop the print unions from shutting down Fleet Street. (This is what turned media-magnate Rupert Murdoch into a pro-capitalist Thatcherite.)<br><br>Is there a Thatcher that can save Gaul? Perhaps. French Interior Minister Nick Sarkozy is a strong law-and-order man. HeÂ’s the one who ended the Muslim riots. More, he is reputed to be pro-market and pro-American. The question is, can Sarkozy wake up this nation of economic sleepwalkers and bring them into the 21st century? He ought to take a big paddle to the collective French fanny. They sure need it.<br><br>Â— Larry Kudlow, NROÂ’s Economics Editor, is host of CNBCÂ’s Kudlow &amp; Company and author of the daily web blog, KudlowÂ’s Money Politic$.<br><br>http://www.nationalreview.com/kudlow/kudlow200603251037.asp</div>

By then they will be joining the unappealing ranks of the cityÂ’s greying population (aged 65 or more) even as the city moves upwards.<br><br>Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew painted the exciting scenario recently of a fast-developing Singapore moving Â“into the upper half of the First World. We can do this in the next 10-20 years.Â”<br><br>Even today growing old is not a good thing. Many employers consider 45-year-olds as over the hill, preferring to replace them with younger, cheaper workers.<br><br>(Making things worse is the large influx of foreign workers who are ready to accept lower salaries.)<br><br>The majority of aged workers are lowly skilled and make up the bulk of SingaporeÂ’s struggling class. In recent years, their income has either stagnated or declined, while the rich got richer.<br><br>This affects their ability to save for retirement, despite their mandatory Central Provident Funds.<br><br>Only 27% of Singaporeans between 25 and 75 said that they have sufficient funds to retire, compared with 61% of Thais and 47% of Malaysians, according to an insurance company survey.<br><br>Today one in 12 Singaporeans are 65 or older; by 2030, this will become one in five.<br><br>Like elsewhere, this age group has more than a higher rate of homeless and poor, the depressed, and the desperately sick. Many are becoming victims of cheating or crime; suicide rates are high.<br><br>In a post-mortem of the 2006 election, leaders of the ruling PeopleÂ’s Action Party attributed its large 9% drop in popularity to older votes.<br><br>If it is true, it doesnÂ’t augur well for its future because this base of senior citizens is growing very quickly.<br><br>The decision to increase its 5% Goods and Services tax (GST) to 7% will be an added blow to Singaporeans, especially the elderly low-income or retirees group.<br><br>To mitigate the impact, the government is offering GST credits of up to S$1,000 (RM2,296) to all over 21 years old, that will be apportioned according to income and home value.<br><br>In addition, the 2007 Budget also gave Singaporeans a bonus of up to S$1,000 to all Singaporeans who make S$100,000 (229,600) or less, with those over 55 getting the lionÂ’s share.<br><br>Two-thirds will be in cash and the rest in Medisave for healthcare.<br><br>But it is jobs that remain the bugbear for the seniors because many employers are reluctant to employ Â– or keep Â– people over 50.<br><br>Lee Seck Kay says that government efforts to keep elderly people gainfully employed are failing, citing a friend who was retrenched from a foreign oil company.<br><br>Â“When he applied to a local one, he was told that at 55 he was too old. They were looking for someone below 48,Â” he added.<br><br>Citizens over 55 are given discounts for public transport and entertainment places (non-peak hours), far short of what the public wants.<br><br>These Singaporeans have spent a lifetime working hard to build Singapore up, whether as coolies or managers, and should be looked after during their sunset years, many believe.<br><br>Singapore is one of the most expensive places in Asia to retire in, observes a grandmother of two. Â“The old should be enjoying their time, not working as cleaners.Â”<br><br>Singapore has the worldÂ’s highest rate of public home ownership. It may be establishing a new trend of downgrading, owners selling their flats for smaller ones to free up cash for retirement.<br><br>A newspaper reader, Lee Chin Wai, notices that official figures show potential up-graders (the opposite) still outnumbering down-graders by three to one.<br><br>If one rules out migration, this ratio could drop to one-to-one by 2017.<br><br>A retiree suggested the government dip into its reserves to pay each Singaporean over 65 a monthly S$200-S$300 (RM459-RM689) for the rest of his life so that he can enjoy his sunset years Â– an unlikely event.<br><br>(This article was publised im The Star on Saturday, Mar 3, 2007)<br><br></div></blockquote>lion note:i assume it is MY The Star,not the canadian one.<br><br>2.do i consider u love sg,hate sg or dunt know????<br><br>When i fully quote aussie reports from aussie main stream newspaper,<br>u label me anti--aussie.<br><br>Can i label u ''netural but with tendancy  hate sg''?</div>

No one told you we want a country where we can riot. This is so extreme a thinking (Just becoz we don't want an extreme, means we want another extreme???)<br><br>The issues at hand are simple:<br>Globalisation results in Singaporeans getting a lower std of living becoz they are told to accept lower pay to be more competitive, whilst those in the cabinet enjoy a kind of pay invulnerable to market conditions.<br><br>It's THAT simple. They don't practise what they preach. They don't walk the talk. They just talk the talk. They enjoy what globalization brings to Singapore, whilst the avg Singaporean has to suffer?<br><br>We are not talking about those that fall thru the gaps here. We are talking about Singaporeans in general. And it is a FACT that the avg Singaporean earns only 1.5k to 4k, which is extremely disproportionate to what the minister earns.<br><br>US has already put up a protectionism law to protect their workers. Its not an extreme law, just a partial protection, so I think its inappropriate for you to draw comparisons to full-welfare or full-protectionism countries. Once again, pls talk moderate, don't be an extremist.</div></blockquote>How about having a national unity cabinet? There are MPs from WP who have ministerial qualities. LTK could take the Education portfolio with ease, for starters.</div>
