Then at the age of 65-67, they will divide the total amount of Money you have by months till XX year old. If you live beyond XX years old, they will still pay you monthly. But if you pass on before that age, then the $$$ will go to those in your WILL.<br><br>Thats why i don't think i will even see my half of my CPF at 55.</div>
