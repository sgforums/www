It is just what kind of life you want to live. A elderly business associate of mine from HK moved his whole family to NZ in 1995, now he is back in HK and wanting to retire in shenzhen, and his children now live in HK. NZ is just a safe place in case HK turns commie. But that din happen, he realised a home must be safe but where it is safe may not be home.<br><br>so what so frightening about NS in Singapore? I went thru and my two sons will be going thru. Parents who are afraid of sending their sons to NS should migrate, we don't need them here. NS still serve its purpose for the sake of national security in singapore and it will not be changed just for a few ignorant and protective parents.<br><br>I am not surprised that your lecturer from US cannot understand many things that happened here, because most americans believe that everything should be done the way they do. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There are a whole host of reasons for people migrating out of this country.

We may not accept them and I certainly do not agree with many of them. But, if I want to challenge the limits and cross the boundaries, I calculate careful what I could achieve and at what price. In a small way, I have crossed sword with the immigration department, the ministry of manpower, but I make sure that police don't get involved and I finally got what I wanted. I don't want to challenge for the sake of challenge.<br><br>We should also work in our own way to change the systems, or at least to modify them. The important thing is HOW. If you want to change the whole system then you are talking about changing the government. We saw how people's power changed the government of the philippines, working? I don't think so. We are seeing how Thaksin's oppositions are trying to make changes. Do you think Thaksin should resign just because opposition takes to the streets, especially after they boycott the general election (which to me means they don't care about the views of other population)? But now, prolonged demonstrations causing daily massive traffic jams, affecting business of the hawkers, and in general, the ordinary people's life is affected now.  Is this the way? we will need a King like the Thai to step in case situation gets out of control. But if it is the King that they wanted to change, then....just joking. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Like it or not, we are a young country and to achieve what we tried to do, the people of singapore had reared a tiger, you can't then tame a fiece tiger overnight, you may even have to wait for it to grow old.<br><br>I think I am just being realistic, patriotic? if there is any in me, it is to the country Singapore.<br><br>cheers.</div>
