            <div class='col-md body'>Is a union between Singapore and Brunei more likely than unification with malaysia?<br>I know that the exchange rate of the currencies of Brunei and Singapore is fixed (1=1). Is that only due to ecomonic reasons are is there any long term perspective for a union? I think such a union would be very wise. Singapore would solve his shortage of land and Brunei would get democracy and economic advantages(they could ease their dependency from oil). Both countries are very rich, small and don't want to become part of Malaysia. Brunei only did not join Malaysia, because they didn't want to be a very small(meaningless) part of a huge state like Malaysia and because of poor diplomacy from the malaysian side. That wouldn't be obstacles for a union with Singapore. The only possible problem that could may arise is that Brunei is a malay majority country, but this would most likely dissolve due to massive immigration from Singapore and other countries, when Singaporian firms relocate or establish themselves at Brunei. It would also help both sides to stay independent, because it eases also the pressure from malaysia to become part of it. For Singapore it is in my view the only possibility to acquire (peaceful) territory, because I don't think, that indonesia or malaysia would sell territory to for a affordable price.<br>Is that a realistic idea?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Both sides will stay suspicious of one another in such a union. Both sides will think the worse of the other's motives especially the ulterior kind like racial or economic exploitation or domination.<br><br>In principle, it is beneficial for both sides to unite as one territory. In practice there will be a great deal of suspicions of one race against another.<br><br>It is only after some capable leaders are able to come up with a suspicion-neutralised common agenda that a good start can be made towards union. People-to-people union should precede such an final union agenda.</div>

You are forgiven. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  Let be friends.<br><br>Try to go round the world and visit some developed and developing countries, see and experience their life. There are good and bad. See what inside singapore is offering you. It's is only worth to die for a country if the country treasured you. Don't die so easily for nothing that my advise.<br><br>Let me share an amercian joke with you.<br><br>During an election rally: A General and A Private contesting for a seat:<br><br>General talk to the public: you know it's my leadership that lead america to victory in this war. Vote for me.<br><br>The Private speak to the public: We were on guarding his tend while he was sleeping in his tent and doing all the charging while he only command behind. Who had protected you.<br><br>The result of the polls: The private wons. Why - people wanted the one that  serve no the one to be served.<br><br>Lastly. Best of lucks to whatever you do. Cheer.</div></blockquote>I have been an SIA solitaire member for many years, I travelled to all continents except south america and Africa, I lived 3 months in Philadelphia and 2 months in Paris, 1 month in toronto and numerous short trips like 3 weeks in Koln, 10 days in Beijing....... my children call my home hotel but I have seen enough to decide where I would call home.<br><br>There is one thing that is common among the people of all these countries, their people are proud of their country regardless of what the countries have done for them or how rich or poor they are. Singaporean and Malaysians are the only lots who complain about their countries. Hong Kongers don't consider HK their country but they are also very proud to be a Hong Konger. I have even had a young Ethiopian studying in Minneapolis working as partime driver, telling me how he loved his country and was going back to help build his country. Even now I am meeting many mainland Chinese young people in America who want to go back to China. Call that nationalism or whatever, I see the zeal and fire of a youth.<br><br>Can't imagine what a country like Ethiopia, or a communist china can provide for their people, but their young people saw the inadequacies, they want to change and correct. Of course there are many others who settle down in a new place. But you don't hear them bitching and moaning about their countries, like many singaporeans here. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>It is not what you see, it is what you do after what you see.<br><br>Best of luck to you. cheers.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Talking about foreigner, this reminded me of a chinese worker that worked for one of my contractor last time few years back.<br><br>He held a degree, majored (unknown). Can write / count / work. So I told his boss that I wanted to give him some paper work to do. (assist me as my singaporean staffs were busy going out). I knew that he would be pay more if he is doing site work which got overtime, hence arrangement was done to  compensate his loss by adding more labour hour.<br><br>He, too loaned money to come here to work as there is no much work back home then. Luckily, his boss was a good pay master and managed to get a pay of $1600 including overtime. To him is about 8000RMP equivalent to a plant manager pay back home. However, he needed 1st year to recover loan and 2nd year is the earning and so on.<br><br>Did he stayed in Singapore. I think on the 3rd year his permit expired and he went back China with saving of about 200000 RMP (S$41,600) that he send back home. I understand that he started his own career and never came back since.<br><br>Did he not mentioned about jobless in China (no to use "complaint" - too sensitive).  Answer is yes and in search of a better career path, he came here.<br>As mentioned, no "O" level, "A" level but degree holder (bit of unusual).<br><br>Why he went back to China, I think some love for his nation, more than that the opportunities there is better when he had the capital to run some kind of business.<br><br>Personally,<br>I wondered is there any individual singaporean that had earned oversea (don't mention GIC etc) and comeback here to invest in singapore? (Don't include those that were deployed and return here to work)<br><br>Does it mean that they got no love for the nation, if they don't comeback?<br><br>What would have detered them from coming back?<br><br>Lastly<br>Can an average singaporean save S$41,600 in 2 years?<br><br></div>

I have even had a young Ethiopian studying in Minneapolis working as partime driver, telling me how he loved his country and was going back to help build his country.

Kuching capital of Sarawak is considered 3rd most developed cities...  but   still lacking in proper funding considering the amount of revenue generated and the amount returned.. 5% or less &lt; . Gas reserves recently found near our shores and i wonder where its going to go. Sarawak n Sabah has the biggest land mass.. yet the poorest road conditions. Improvements have been made alot during the years but still un-adequate. Monetary funded by private tycoons to better the state , also resulting in certain biased corruption. I say upgrading of infra-structures that is lagging 10 years behind KL to be upgraded would be better. Maybe coz Sarawak n Sabah are pre-dominantly non-bumi states.<br><br>Anyways..just my thoughts.<br><br></div>
