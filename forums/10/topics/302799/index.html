            <div class='col-md body'>Wilson presidency backed by elite bankers helped set up fed reserve in 1913.Hence the modern economies of inflation and deflation is set on the swing setting the stage for world domination.<br><br>"I am a most unhappy man. I have unwittingly ruined my country. A great industrial nation is controlled by its system of credit. Our system of credit is concentrated. The growth of the nation, therefore, and all our activities are in the hands of a few men. We have come to be one of the worst ruled, one of the most completely controlled and dominated Governments in the civilized world no longer a Government by free opinion, no longer a Government by conviction and the vote of the majority, but a Government by the opinion and duress of a small group of dominant men."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>"I believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies. Already they have raised up a money aristocracy that has set the government at defiance. This issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people to whom it properly belongs. If the American people ever allow private banks to control the issue of currency, first by inflation, then by deflation, the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children will wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered. I hope we shall crush in its birth the aristocracy of the moneyed corporations which already dare to challenge our Government to a trial of strength and bid defiance to the laws of our country"  Thomas Jefferson, 1791</div>

However this power lies in the hands of a few people.<br><br>This automatically begs so many questions like who are these people? What are their goals? are they managing it correctly? what checks are in place to detect abuse? what controls are in place to ensure a balance? Is there culpability?<br><br>One video on the internet you can google and watch for free is titled "Zeitgeist". I know that I found it interesting.<br><br>Edited: I think your link may have a problem.
