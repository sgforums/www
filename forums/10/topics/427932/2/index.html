              <p>The surprising thing about this elections is that SDP managed to
              get 2 highly qualified candidates - Dr. James Gomez and Dr.
              Vincent. I think the both of them certainly brings up SDP's
              standards by a lot.</p>

                                      consistency in pursuing the goal is something I admired. However
                                      due to his overly ambitious, rash act and muddle head, to be a

              <p>Chiam at that time, worked very very hard and turned the opposition into a credible alternative.. the opposition was moving up..</p>
              <p>until Chee decided he wanted the reins of the party and did not wait until Chiam handed it to him... he did what you will NEVER want anyone in power to do.. BETRAY the man who brought him into the position...</p>
              <p>if you don't know this simple thing, go ask the older people who saw that, not on some kind of delayed telecast on tv, but there, live.. as Chee went around the back of Chiam, got the people in the SDP to throw out the very man who founded the party...</p>
              <p>you want such running your constituency?</p>
              <p>and the other bullshit things he did.. you DO NOT go around heckling people even if they are your opponents by shouting at them.. that's the behaviour of hooligans... if you profess to want to "serve the people" you do not get yourself arrested for stupid attention whoring things, just to get yourself disqualified from the elections then blame everyone else except yourself for being disqualified..</p>
              <p>and he shits on about "democracy" but cannot accept that he was soundly and utterly humiliated and rejected by the people at the polls... it is a democracy.. and it is the responsibility of those who put their hands up to stand, to accept that they have failed to convince the voters..</p>
              <p>you do NOT slag off the people you profess to serve.. he has done so many times.. by his actions, by his words and by his attitude, he has proven to be nothing more than a wannabe-tinpot dictator who has delusions of being some kinda "revolutionary messiah"</p>

              <p>uh huh ...professional stabbing in career to get on top- no biggie - people do that to get on top. OPERATION SPECTRUM - arrest the people who were working in the interest of the less fortunate and exploited.
