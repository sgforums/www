              <p>As days go by we will see more an d more of internet postings of two distinct types.</p>
              <p>Why so?</p>
              <p>It is very simply that internet as Dr. Vivian Bala is now saying finally the future of politics.</p>
              <p>As announced sometime ago, Ministers are in charge of sending counter-insurgency teams using anonymous nicknames to counter all the views and opinions of ordinary often loyal citizens who were treated as anti-government nevertheless just because of their taking an active part in nation building through criticisms of wrongful or ineffective government actions or policies.</p>
              <p>So we will see more and more distinction of two groups of forumers :-</p>
              <p>(1) Unpaid active Citizen forumers offering views and opinions for nation building.</p>
              <p>(2) Forumers paid or holding positions connected to government or party or grassroot with vested interest to deny problems making the government less accountable, and more arrogant due to making them adopting a more adversarial wrongful anti-people approach aimed at serving their own narrow selfish interest.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ministers are paid servants of the people. They should concentrate on their declared ministerial duties or portfolio to serve the citizens and not waste public funds or their millions of salaries on petty nitpicking of doubtful import.</p>
              <p>They have no moral or legal right to spend any office or working time on such counter-productive anti-progress and anti-accountability covert unauthorised activities without unambiguous sanctioned by the citizens.</p>

              <p>I mean other than the plain citizens putting out their views on the net, as they see fit there is increasingly a group of forumers with vested interest to use standard or stereotyped propagandas of the type purveyed in the the controlled mainstream media to counter or bend any objective critical or even creative and productive views.</p>
              <p>If one is true master or true leader will he not be merrier to see such productive though critical views as they could help them in nation building to bring goodness and fairness to all.</p>
              <p>Forumers with critical views as all could no doubt see for themselves are being targeted by such counter-insurgency agents who even call such active citizens all sorts of names using vulgarities with arrogance.

              <p><br>No worries, im jus joking.</p>
              <p>I think it is wrong to engage in any public domain anonymously for the sake of party interest. it is down right dirty for any party to do so. It will also shame some forumners here because some forumners may stand along your viewpoint but doesnt share your idea on being an anonymous forumner with dirty interest.</p>
              <p>Although i agree with you on the above, i believe it is best to let things be. We have no prove on who is with who and what is their interest behind each post. Since we have no prove, i dont think we should point things out that way. It will just lead to alot of suspicion and ultimately a witch hunt.</p>

              <p>i think it is a narrow view of looking at it.</p>
              <p>Look at it this way, given the injection of Youtube and other online video basically it allow polarized values and views to be express publicly otherwise in the past PAP would have monoplorizing and express view thru out Radio, TV, newspaper network.</p>
              <p>Now it is a paradigm shift that PAP or other political entities have to seek out popular polarizes view and talks about whats important to net citizen. Rather than trying to sell the idea of what is important to the PAP. PAP probably could not make that connection.  Political entity have to sell harder to Net citizen. If the issue capture the net generation than it will escalate globally thru the net. And if the net citizen don't buy the political view they just have to "click" and you are off.  </p>
              <p>Look at the video clip of "Where the hell is Matt" gone global , The "battle of Kruger" 34 million viewer.  </p>

              <p>Besides the extremely good indication that the despots will die soon, the fact that the world is now so connected through the Internet; dishonorable, self-serving as-holes that think they have the right to rule in a despotic dishonorable manner will be seen as an oddity of history not to far into the future.</p>

              <p>that is why the minister now have to come out and try to discredit the view of Net Citizen. They find themselve difficult to get a grid on polarizes view on net citizen. And their PAP voice has been diminish.  I don't even think that Net Citizen is opposing PAP. Net Citizen basically don't buy political status quo.  </p>

              <p>Why so?</p>
              <p>It is very simply that internet as Dr. Vivian Bala is now saying finally the future of politics.</p>
              <p>As announced sometime ago, Ministers are in charge of sending counter-insurgency teams using anonymous nicknames to counter all the views and opinions of ordinary often loyal citizens who were treated as anti-government nevertheless just because of their taking an active part in nation building through criticisms of wrongful or ineffective government actions or policies.</p>
              <p>So we will see more and more distinction of two groups of forumers :-</p>
              <p>(1) Unpaid active Citizen forumers offering views and opinions for nation building.</p>
              <p>(2) Forumers paid or holding positions connected to government or party or grassroot with vested interest to deny problems making the government less accountable, and more arrogant due to making them adopting a more adversarial wrongful anti-people approach aimed at serving their own narrow selfish interest.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ministers are paid servants of the people. They should concentrate on their declared ministerial duties or portfolio to serve the citizens and not waste public funds or their millions of salaries on petty nitpicking of doubtful import.</p>
              <p>They have no moral or legal right to spend any office or working time on such counter-productive anti-progress and anti-accountability covert unauthorised activities without unambiguous sanctioned by the citizens.</p>

              <p>Are the  views on the net "petty nitpicking of doubtful import"? It is no wonder nobody takes any views here seriously.</p>
              <p>Sad to note you see only two views on this forum, group 1 are those against the government, group 2 are the government. And government means PAP. </p>
              <p>I agree with some of the government policies but against several others, I am group 2.</p>
              <p>I don't equate Singapore to PAP, I am group 2.</p>
              <p>I disagree with LKY but sympathetic over his wife's illness, I am group 2.</p>
              <p>If anybody pay a cent for people with such view for participating in this forum, the money is wasted.</p>

              <p><br>So to you what is a safe haven in Singapore for critical thinking?</p>
              <p>Our poorly rated internationally mainstream media?</p>
              <p>You're hilarious.</p>
              <p>Uncritical thinking exists everywhere, it is the responsibility of the individual to sort it all out.</p>
              <p>A good example of UNCRITICAL thinking would be an individual blaming one kind of unregulated media for uncritical thought.</p>
              <p>Since you potray yourself to be the paradigm of critical and rational thought, how come I look through your post history and also see basically pseudointellecutal posts and arguments?</p>
