            <div class='col-md body'>the US is anything but homogeneous, in fact in the more developed and richer states like california there is more racial diversity than in singapore, over there there's vietnamese, phillipinos, russians, kazakstanis, turks, many many chinese, japanese, korean basically all sorts of people compared to the largely chinese-indian-malay combination we have here. countries like the US do not really require such detailed classification of race because many americans have very mixed parentage consisting of german,irish,native american, english whatever blah blah blood it is impossible to state "race" accurately.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>it is not an issue of removing race from the ic, as long as people see each other differently there are bound to be discrimination.Besides, i rather there is race on the ic.
