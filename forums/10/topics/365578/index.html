              <p>Thursday, 25 June 2009</p>
              <p><em>Singapore Democrats</em></p>
              <p><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_j5BotyyITFg/SkDQLrzc_VI/AAAAAAAAAuU/-9xWvICHpOY/s1600/seelan2250.jpg" alt="" width="146" height="220"></p>
              <p>Mr Seelan Palay, maker of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17qhGIwyGj0">One Nation Under Lee</a> (ONUL), was called up yesterday for questioning by the police. The 24
                  year-old Singaporean filmmaker had produced the 40-minute video
                  narrating the rule of Singapore by Mr Lee Kuan Yew.<br>  <br> The film was screened at a private function last year at the
                  Peninsular-Excelsior Hotel when the police and Media Development
                  Authority officials barged in and seized the video. Since then ONUL has
                  been making its rounds on YouTube attracting tens of thousands of
                  views. <br>  <br> Below is the police interview as provided by Mr Seelan:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Police investigation regarding my film One Nation Under Lee</p>
              <p><br> <strong>Introductory question (Q):</strong> What do you know about the
                  facts of the case? (Posed to me as "Tell me about yourself" by the
                  officer but strangely printed as "What do you know about the facts of
                  the case?" in the version I was to sign at the end.)<br> <strong>Answer (A):</strong> I am an artist.<br> <br> <strong>Q1:</strong> Can you remember where you were on 17 May 2008 at about 2pm?<br> <strong>A1:</strong> I cannot recall.<br> <br> <strong>Q2:</strong> I am now informing you that the investigation into
                  this offence is of the incident that happened at Excelsior Hotel on 17
                  May 2008. Do you recall this incident?<br> <strong>A2:</strong> I do not recall it as an offence.<br> <br> <strong>Q3:</strong> Can you explain why you were at the Excelsior Hotel on 17 may 2008?<br> <strong>A3:</strong> I remember that I was at the Excelsior Hotel on that date to attend a private event.<br> <br> <strong>Q4:</strong> Are you aware of a film that was screened on this date at Tulip Room at Excelsior Hotel?<br> <strong>A4:</strong> Yes.<br> <br> <strong>Q5:</strong> Were you in the Tulip Room when this film was screened?<br> <strong>A5:</strong> Yes.<br> <br> <strong>Q6:</strong> What was this film all about?<br> <strong>A6:</strong> That is a private matter.<br> <br> <strong>Q7:</strong> Who is the one who is in charge of this event?<br> <strong>A7:</strong> It was a private event so that is none of anyone's concern.<br> <br> <strong>Q8:</strong> Do you know who brought the film to the Tulip Room on 17 May 2008?<br> <strong>A8:</strong> That is a private matter.<br> <br> <strong>Q9:</strong> Do you know who prepared this film?<br> <strong>A9:</strong> That is a private matter.<br> <br> <strong>Q10:</strong> How long was this film screened?<br> <strong>A10:</strong> I cannot recall.<br> <br> <strong>Q11:</strong> Can you remember what happened after the film was screened?<br> <strong>A11:</strong> Some uninvited guests entered the room.<br> <br> <strong>Q12:</strong> Do you know who these uninvited guests were?<br> <strong>A12:</strong> I cannot recall.</p>
              <p><strong>Q13:</strong> Can you explain what happened after the film ended?<br> <strong>A13:</strong> The uninvited guests asked for the DVD of the film. The DVD was given to them.<br> <br> <strong>Q14:</strong> How many copies were there in the room?<br> <strong>A14:</strong> I do not know.<br> <br> <strong>Q15:</strong> Who handed over the DVD to the uninvited guests?<br> <strong>A15:</strong> I cannot recall.<br> <br> <strong>Q16:</strong> What is your role in this private event?<br> <strong>A16:</strong> That is a private matter.<br> <br> <strong>Q17:</strong> Who was operating the systems when the film was screened?<br> <strong>A17:</strong> That is a private matter.<br> <br> <strong>Q18:</strong> Were you at Jalan Gelenggang on 16 May, one night before the incident?<br> <strong>A18:</strong> I cannot recall.<br> <br> <strong>Q19:</strong> I'm going to show you a document, can you tell me
                  if you have seen this document before? (Officer then shows me a letter
                  from MDA apparently sent the night before the event with a warning not
                  to screen the film. Films Act sections were quoted in the letter.)<br> <strong>A19:</strong> I cannot recall.<br> <br> <strong>Q20:</strong> The officers who served this letter at No.2A
                  Jalan Gelenggang claim that you were the one who received the letter.
                  What have you got to say about this?<br> <strong>A20:</strong> Did they identify themselves as police officers? If they claim it was me, did they ask for my name or IC?<br> <br> <strong>Q21:</strong> Did you remove the DVD from the player and hand it over to Madam ---? (Name undisclosed for the purposes of this post.)<br> <strong>A21:</strong> That is a private matter.<br> <br> <strong>Q22:</strong> Do you have anything else to add?<br> <strong>A22:</strong> The uninvited guests should be investigated for barging in to and disrupting a private event.</p>

              <h3 class="post-title entry-title">Seelan Palay not only mocks Lee Kuan Yew, he flaunts it with glee!</h3>
              <p>Ladies and Gentlemen,<br><br>You
              have to read the article in the Singapore
              Democrat,http://www.yoursdp.org/, Dr. Chee Soon Juan's website, who is
              Lee Kuan Yew's enemy number one, "Seelan Palay under investigation for
              One Nation under Lee" of June 25, 2009. <br><br>What you will see is
              the beaming face of Seelan Palay, a Singapore human rights activist,
              grinning from ear to ear with delight, immediately after he attended a
              police station in the island republic, accused of allegedly insulting
              the Singapore dictator or something equally silly as expected of Lee
              Kuan Yew and his minions.<br><br>The film as you will see is not only
              completely innocuous, it is a very truthful account of the human rights
              violations and injustices perpetrated by the strongman against his
              people in the island.<br><br>As is routine practice there, Lee Kuan
              Yew's police are yet again going after a young man who is merely
              showing non violent peaceful dissent against his one party rule. This
              time, the dictator's police are interrogating human rights activist and
              film producer, Seelan Palay, for privately showing this film on May 17,
              2008 at a hotel; a film which he personally produced and directed. The
              film was, to say the least, critical of the strongman and the way he
              runs the country. It can be freely watched on Internet youtube.<br><br>The
              article itself narrates verbatim the policeman's questions and Seelan's
              mocking, defiant answers. To almost all the questions put to him by the
              policeman, he not only refuses to answer, but appears to ask the police
              to go to Hell! The comedy of it all is not only his willingness to show
              his smiling face just after his police interrogation session, as if he
              had just knocked out the policeman in a boxing match; he goes on to
              mock and sneer him by publishing the questions and answers verbatim,
              telling the public that he cared two hoots for this police officer or
              for his master Lee Kuan Yew!<br><br>It is this sort of reaction from
              the people, who are expected to live in fear and obedience, that
              intolerably peeves Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore's supreme strongman. In the
              past, Lee Kuan Yew's "digits" (this is what he has called Singapore
              citizens) whenever he arrests or questions them, froze with fear and
              immediately rolled over in submission. But now, quite often, when he
              abuses the law to silence them, the reaction appears the opposite. They
              no longer appear cowed and submissive, silenced and kicked into
              oblivion; instead they appear overjoyed at making Lee Kuan Yew look
              silly, by smiling and celebrating, as if they had just gone to a party!<br><br>The
              reaction to Lee's strong handedness appears changing . Instead of being
              ashamed, frightened and going away quietly, they are literally laughing
              at Lee Kuan Yew; telling him very clearly that he has a stupid set of
              laws (laws that deny fundamental human rights), and they have not the
              slightest of respect for it.<br><br>Dr. Chee Soon Juan, the human
              rights fighter, of the Singapore Democratic Party has been bankrupted
              and punished in more ways than one. Instead of quietly going away, he
              continues to expose the dictatorship for what it is, an intolerant
              dictatorship, by writing daily in his blog which is now read by almost
              every Singaporean who can read! And all Lee can do is to look silly and
              stand idly by. It seems, he has finally given up going after Dr. Chee
              Soon Juan. <br><br>Recently we had a number of young activists who
              were sent to jail because, believe it or not, they wore T Shirts
              emblazoned with a picture of a kangaroo in the vicinity of the High
              Court Singapore (the Kangaroo T Shirt Case). Lee Kuan Yew's compliant
              judge Judith Prakash appears to have been offended and she sent the 3
              people to jail. I understand this woman is not taking any more cases
              and is in the process of leaving for Australia for good! Perhaps she
              can't take the heat anymore. She has now been known the world over as
              the "Kangaroo Judge". How appropriate that she is going of all
              coutnries to Australia, the only place in the world with kangaroos!<br><br>But
              I have digressed. What I should have said was that after the 3, John
              Tan, Izrizal and Shafi, the "kangaroo T shirt culprits" were released
              from Lee Kuan Yew's prison, the Queenstown, they were garlanded by a
              welcoming party and were seen singing songs and carried about as if
              they had just won first prize in the lottery! I understand they sang
              some kangaroo songs, filmed all of it and put in on Youtube. You can
              see their jubilation and merriment on the Internet.<br><br>It has been
              the same for each and every human rights activist which Lee Kuan Yew
              routinely sends to jail for violating his completely illegal laws; laws
              intended not to uphold the rule of law but to squarely break it. <br><br>You
              would recall that I myself was sent to jail for 3 months for pointing
              out the bias of judge Belinda Ang Saw Ean. When I was released from
              that prison, there was the usual welcoming party but since I had an
              American passport, I was whisked off to Singapore Immigration in a
              prison van. Otherwise I too would have had the opportunity for some
              merriment and party outside the prison.<br><br>Lee Kuan Yew's trying to
              intimidate guys like Seelan Palay is becoming a joke. No one cares for
              his politically motivated laws to stifle dissent. It is strange that
              his million dollar ministers do not see this. The dictator has for too
              long tried to abuse his powers to silence his people. Now they don't
              care anymore. <br><br>Gopalan Nair</p>

              <p>This is another infamous example of the kind of double standards that are being practised in Singapore - designed by LKY to curtail the rights of Singaporeans to easy and unfettered access to public information.</p>

                                          the 35th National Day celebrations on 9 August 2000. He is 
                                          contented as he watches Singapore grow day by day like any 
                                          loving father watching his son grow up. Thirty-five years 
                                          have passed by so quickly, the Singapore that he took over 
                                          back then was weak and abandoned...<br> <br> "Some countries were meant to be independent while some 
                                          successfully fought for independence but Singapore's independence 
                                          was forced upon it."<br> <br> "The place where I live is nice, she is a small island. 
                                          She is so small that you can hardly find it on the map but 
                                          the whole world knows her name."<br> <br> These are the lyrics from a Singaporean song "The Place 
                                          Where I Live" which expresses Singaporeans' pride. As 
                                          Mr Lee Kuan Yew looks out onto Malaysia from an elevated point 
                                          on the Johor-Singapore Causeway, he analyses that the ill 
                                          effects of not having the Malaysian island on Singapore and 
                                          reminisces about the difficulties that Singapore faced 35 
                                          years ago...<br> <br> <br> <strong> MOVIE REVIEW:</strong></span><span>   </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"> The Singapore education system has equipped me well with the 
                                          country’s history. And it has made me proud how our 
                                          little island has prospered from a little fishing village 
                                          to the bustling city of possibilities today. And one person 
                                          our countrymen have to thank is one of Lion City’s most 
                                          important politicians, Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">While 
                                          the above statement may sound like propaganda to some of my 
                                          angst-ridden countrymen, I sincerely think that Singapore 
                                          won’t be what it is today without Lee’s leadership.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Produced 
                                          in 2001 by a Hong Kong channel, this 89-minute two-part documentary 
                                          takes a look at how Lee brought Singapore to independence, 
                                          and interestingly gives viewers a glimpse into his personal 
                                          life.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">If 
                                          you had paid attention during your history classes, this documentary 
                                          presents you with not much new information, except that you’ll 
                                          be hearing interviews from the man himself. You’d be 
                                          hearing about how Lee managed the merger with Malaya from 
                                          1963 to 1965, and then its separation which led to our country’s 
                                          independence. The classic broadcast of Lee’s emotional 
                                          announcement of the separation on 9 August 1965 is one of 
                                          the high points in the disc. You’d also be hearing about 
                                          the controversies between Lee and opposition leaders like 
                                          Tang Liang Hong and Chee Soon Juan. For the sake of political 
                                          correctness, we shall not further make any standpoints on 
                                          this issue.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">The 
                                          more interesting moments of this documentary come during its 
                                          last 20 minutes. Did you know that male civil servants were 
                                          to keep short hair, and that anyone with unkempt hair was 
                                          to be inspected under suspicion? Did you know that Lee hated 
                                          the heat in the country and always kept his air conditioning 
                                          at 22C? </span></p>
