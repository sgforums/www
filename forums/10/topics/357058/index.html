              <p>The opposition has won! They have scored a decisive victory! The people could no longer stand the tyranny of Lee Hsien Long and overthrew the government by</p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Choose one</span></p>
              <p>1) A riot and seige of the Istana, the parliament house similar to thailand protest</p>
              <p>2) Winning more votes than PAP in an election in a peaceful manner</p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Choose and replace X with the new PM's name</span></p>
              <p>X has declared a cut in the salary of all the government officials of Singapore! the presidents salary now matches that of the US president. likewise, the cut in salary rippled through the ranks of the civil servent, with entry salary of these jobs to fall by 30%, and the salary increment to drop further more. Still, people are motivated to enter into civil service to work as they are motivated by X to make Singapore a better nation.</p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Choose one</span></p>
              <p>1) The quality of people who want to enter into politics improved as those who are only after the money are weeded out.</p>
              <p>2) The quality of people who want to enter into politics decrease as monetary incentive is low</p>
              <p>X ruled Singapore in peace, abolishing ERP, allowing peaceful protest, remove the 3/4 tank rule to enter malaysia, give the people subsidy on petrol, unbans chewing gum, captures Mas Selamat. GST and CPF is also abolished, and all the money is is given back to the people. The HDB is not pegged to market rate and is now cheap enough to afford.The people of Singapore rejoice and all is well.</p>
              <p>Also, the opposition to this new government is treated very kindly, and can slander X freely with no fear of legal law suit.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Just a fairy tale for now. Any points to improve?</p>

              a rare public interview in 1997 Radio Corporation of Singapore, Dr Toh
              passionately bemoaned the lack of idealism and creativity among the
              young and its implications for the future of Singapore. He said:</p>

              <p>“I
              would say the generation of the ‘50s and ‘60s took the plunge into
              politics without ever calculating the costs of the risk and the
              benefits to be gained. They were driven by ideology. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Today’s generation
              has no culture and averse to taking political risk. </strong></span>Really,<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> an interest
              in politics is very necessary for the future.</strong></span> But I cannot blame the
              present generations, because <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>they see the heavy-handed response by the
              government to dissenting views, even though they know that these
              matters involve their daily lives.</strong></span><br><br>So the result is that <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>we have
              produced a younger generation who are meek and therefore very
              calculating. They are less independent-thinking and lack in initiative. </strong></span>It <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>does not bode well for the emergence of future leaders in politics
              and business.</strong></span> Robots and computers can be programmed or if you like,
              can be trained. But the trouble, of course, is that computers lack soul
              and <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>what we need in Singapore is soul. Because it is soul that makes
              society.” </strong></span></p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"><strong>Lim
              				Hock Siew to pen memoirs<br></strong>James Wong Wing
              				On<br>Malaysiakini<br>11 Jul 07<br><br>Encouraged by the
              				determination of fellow former political prisoner Said Zahari to
              				unveil the other side of history, Singapore's Dr Lim Hock Siew
              				has also decided to publish his memoirs. <br><br>"Although I
              				have told my story in a documentary film many years ago, I have
              				decided to write it down myself in the form of memoirs like my
              				‘good brother' Said," he told malaysiakini during an
              				exclusive interview in Kuala Lumpur. <br><br>"I am now
              				conducting research to find out more newly declassified materials
              				in London to link up more dots," added the 76-year old
              				founding member of Singapore's now ruling People's Action Party
              				(PAP). <br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br>Lim was detained without trial for almost 20 years
              				from 1963 to 1982. (Which makes him the second longest-held
              				political prisoner in Singapore after Chia Thye Poh)</strong></span><br><br>According
              				to him, although he was alleged to have participated in the
              				activities of the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>so-called ‘Communist United Front'</strong></span> in
              				Singapore from the mid-1950s to early 1960s, he was never
              				formally charged in any open court of law for the allegation.
              				<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>"I still remember even my police interrogators told
              				me that they knew I had never been a member of any communist
              				party or group," said Lim</strong></span> who was a central committee member
              				of the opposition Socialist Front in Singapore at the time of his
              				arrest. <br><br>He was detained during the 1963 Operation Cold
              				Store, which saw more than 130 leaders of opposition parties,
              				labour and student unions and journalists deemed to be left wing
              				held as well. <br><br><strong>Serving British interests </strong><br><br>"Now,
              				from all the already released records in London as well as other
              				historical researches,<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> it is clear that in launching Operation
              				Cold Store, Lee Kuan Yew was serving the then strategic interests
              				of Britain which wanted Singapore to continue to provide a
              				forward military base in Southeast Asia," said Lim </strong></span><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br>"It
              				is also now an undeniable fact that Lee worked earlier for the
              				Japanese military during the Occupation making Britain's English
              				materials available in Japanese-language for the occupiers,"
              				he added. </strong></span><br><br>Lim was a graduate of Singapore's prestigious
              				Raffles College and a medical doctor trained in University of
              				Malaya, which was then located in Singapore. <br><br>"I was
              				also a founder of University of Malaya's Socialist Club which
              				became the cradle for many politicians and intellectuals in both
              				Malaysia and Singapore who fought for independence," he
              				recalled with a sense of pride. <br><br>"In those days,
              				anti-colonialism was a very powerful and popular sentiment even
              				in Singapore …<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> I helped found the People's Action Party
              				(PAP) to fight for the freedom of Singapore from British rule and
              				to reunite it with Peninsula to form an united, non-communal and
              				progressive Malaya </strong></span>but <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>when Lee turned right wing and started
              				serving British interests, the party split and I left to join the
              				Socialist Front," he explained. </strong></span><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>"We certainly
              				opposed to Singapore being maintained as a military base for
              				Britain and that was why Lee had to crush the Left in Singapore
              				at all cost</strong></span> … The Left in Singapore also opposed to the
              				1963 merger because we thought it was an <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>opportunistic adventure
              				on the part of Lee who wanted to exploit Tunku Abdul Rahman's
              				anti-communism to suppress the Left in Singapore … we
              				wanted merger but not in the 1963 version which proved to be an
              				utter failure just two years later in 1965. </strong></span><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>"I was
              				completely English-educated,"</strong></span> stressed Lim, which was
              				obviously a sarcastic and subtle rebuttal to the now stereotyped
              				and widespread notion that the Left in Singapore in the 1950s and
              				1960s was a "Chinese-educated" phenomenon. <br><br><strong>Political
              				conviction </strong><br><br>As for his detention, Lim said he did not
              				suffer any physical torture.<br><br>"But, detention without
              				charge or trial for an uncertain period of time is itself a form
              				of torture, albeit a psychological one," Lim said.<br><br>"When
              				I was first arrested in February 1963, my son was only
              				five-months-old but when I was released in 1982, he was already
              				studying at the Cambridge University in Britain. <br><br>"I
              				wish to thank my wife Dr Betruce Cheng for her understanding,
              				fortitude and solidarity for the entire period of my 20-year
              				detention and also for bringing up our boy," he added.
              				<br><br>Quizzed on what helped him preserve his sanity during his
              				detention, Lim replied: "Political conviction, intellectual
              				integrity and moral conscience". <br><br>"I certainly
              				have no regret for my involvement and participation in politics
              				although I had to pay a heavy price for it. I am still a
              				socialist who believes in democracy for the people and social
              				justice for the working classes," he stressed.</span></p>
