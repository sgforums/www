              <h1 class="storyheadline">Election debates on TV all style and no substance, so not for us</h1>
              <p>   </p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>I
                          REFER to Mr Lee Seck Kay's Forum Online letter recommending that
                          Singapore introduce television debates before the General Election,
                          similar to the series of three debates held recently in Britain ('Have
                          TV debates before election'; last Monday).</p>
              <p>Unfortunately,
                          Mr Lee has overrated the debates shown in Britain. While viewership was
                          above expectations, this was driven far more by the novelty of the
                          endeavour than the substance of debate.</p>
              <p>Far from
                          being a 'resounding success', the consensus is that television debates
                          have led to a greater emphasis on style over substance.</p>
              <p>For
                          example, the parties' manifestoes are no clearer to voters than they
                          were before the TV debates: the incumbent Labour Party and the
                          opposition Conservatives and Liberal Democrats have all failed to give
                          the electorate enough details about their spending-cut plans to reduce
                          Britain's structural deficit which is now close to &amp;pound1 trillion
                          (S$2.1 trillion).</p>
              <p>I and, I believe, other Singaporeans prefer our leaders to stick to substance over style when it comes to elections.</p>
              <p>In
                          the context of the global economic downturn, this means a government
                          that appeals to voters based on its solid track record, and its ability
                          to steer the economy out of recession and take the long-term measures
                          needed to place the country economically, politically and socially on a
                          sound footing.</p>

              <p>yes politics is like this all over the world, but the local press sit on some moral high ground that our politics have more substance... when they are the same...</p>
              <p>The nature of debate is adversial ( leading to personal attacks) and time controlled which gives little time to respond appropriately.. An interview would be more appropriate,no different from a job interview. Several interviews would give insights to the candidates personality and stand on various issues.. These interviews in media are available in countries with open media such as US and UK. There were many interviews given by potential candidates such as Obama, Ron Paul and of course the infamous Sarah Palin.</p>
              <p>In Singapore, we have them too, but mostly with PAP candidates with the state media cheering them on.At least now we know Mah Bow Tan is good at drawing graphs. Thats one candidate Singaporeans shouldnt be voting for.</p>

              <p>Singapore is unique in a way that we are a fragile small country without any natural resouces nor kampong to go back to, taking these as the backdrop of our struggle here, most people will not like to go into protest or riot or simply against the govt as the stake of a total breakdown/diseaster for this very tiny is high if we dun watch our step. To change govt is not easy here, it can lead to a revolution which will collapse the society and economyÂ that will eventually,Â makes our neighbour countriesÂ laughing and smiling all the way to the bank.</p>
              <p>My advises to fellow singaporeans who are against the ruling party, before taking any serious step, thinkÂ as a whole and not as individual interest. There are many countries that envy singapore and want very much to see it downfall. And Singaporeans can be easily be subdue to them while having a bewildered dream of getting rid of the present govt.Â Â </p>
