              <p>MOSCOW - WHILE the dialogue a day earlier had focused on the big
              picture and global policies, 10 students handpicked to attend a tea
              session with Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew in Moscow on Monday had very
              different sort of questions on their minds.</p>
              <p>They were more interested in his personal experiences.</p>
              <p>And MM Lee obliged, speaking frankly about the challenges he faced
              in his early years, his regrets in life and his approach to politics.</p>
              <p>He also responded to a question on whether he had anything to do
              with his son, Mr Lee Hsien Loong, becoming prime minister. But he could
              not resist taking a jab at the student asking it.</p>
              <p>MM Lee said: 'That question has been thrown at me a 1,001 times. I
              did not appoint my son. I appointed somebody else prime minister, who
              was my successor, and he stayed in the job for 14 years. And he chose
              my son to be his deputy. I did not arrange that.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">'After five years, nobody doubts that he is able to do his job
              better than anybody else, so the question has stopped being asked.'</span></p>
              <p>On Sunday, MM Lee was at a dialogue with students from the Skolkovo
              Moscow School of Management as he attended the opening of its new
              campus. One of the first questions posed was about his secret to
              motivating people. His answer: Speak their language.</p>
              <p>He spoke of his attempt to learn all the major languages in
              Singapore during the early days of the PAP: 'I learnt to speak the
              languages of the common man, which was Malay and basic English - not
              BBC English. In other words, disjointed grammar, Malay sentences with
              English words.'</p>
              <p>It was the same with Chinese. But he told students on Monday that
              the need to campaign in all three languages during the elections was
              exhausting, and it took its toll on him.</p>
              <p>He recalled an occasion when he did a multilingual broadcast at a
              radio station. He was so tired at one point that the staff thought he
              had disappeared from the studio: 'I was missing. They came to look for
              me. I was lying on the floor to recover my breath. It was really an
              effort,' he said.</p>

              <p>" He also responded to a question on whether he had anything to do with his son, Mr Lee Hsien Loong, becoming prime minister....<br><br>...MM
              Lee said: 'That question has been thrown at me a 1,001 times.... 'After
              five years, nobody doubts that he is able to do his job better than
              anybody else, so the question has stopped being asked."<br><br>5 years
              is about 1800+ days. If the question has really been asked to him a
              thousand of times, people must have been asking him the question about
              once every 2 days, how then can he say the question has stopped being
              asked? If people had asked him more times (e.g. 5-6 times a day) last
              time, then it can account for the questions having stopped - but then,
              it would also show that he never satisfactorily answered the question,
              resulting in people re-asking it.<br><br>Nonetheless, how can he try to
              justify himself by saying, "the question has stopped being asked", when
              someone just asked the question? It's quite apparent that people are
              still not convinced that things had been the way he said, and that's
              why young people still ask the question. The older ones probably
              refrain from doing so since we're under the impression that we won't
              get a truthful answer anyway.</p>
