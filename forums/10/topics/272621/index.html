            <div class='col-md body'>ST latest news<br><br><blockquote>S'pore's leadership not inferior to old guards<br>By Imelda Saad, Correspondent<br>Singapore's Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew does not think that the present leadership team is inferior compared to the old guards.<br>He was speaking on Monday at the first pioneers lecture series organised jointly by the Economic Development Board and The Straits Times.<br><br>Asked to give an assessment of the Singapore third generation leaders, Mr Lee said in fact, standards have gone up.<br><br>He added, 'inteligence, administrative capabilities and political sensibilities' have improved over the years.<br><br>What's missing, Mr Lee noted, is the 'combat experience' of Singapore's first generation leaders who have gone through the tumultuous indepedendent years.<br><br>'There's a vast difference between soldiers trained in actual combat who've seen casualty, blood and horror and soldiers trained in simulation. You can't recreate the same set of circumstances,' he said.<br><br>Despite this, Mr Lee said today's team 'is as good as you can get'.<br><br>He noted that the present leadership has gone through its own baptism of fire such as SARS and the Asian financial crisis without losing its nerves.<br><br>'People think I'm holding their hands but they're in charge,' Mr Lee said. 'From time to time, when I see something that will lead to dicey results, I ask them to think through.'<br><br>He said his hope is for the current leadership to find another team in the next one to two elections to replace themselves.<br><br>It takes five to 10 years to nurture a team, he said, and to get the public to accept them as leaders.<br><br>The concern however, is that it's getting harder to rope in good people.<br><br>Mr Lee noted even in the current team, there's going to be attrition.<br><br>Hence, there's a need to find younger leaders in their 30s and early 40s.<br><br>'The system is working but you need capable men to make it perform,' Mr Lee pointed out.<br><br>Turning reflective, the minister mentor closed the hour and a half dialogue session with this message to Singaporeans, 'There's no steady state of growth forever.'<br><br>Mr Lee said Singaporeans must be prepared to accept painful measures to ensure Singapore's progress.<br><br>He cited examples such as the CPF cuts and GST hikes as 'unpopular' policies.<br><br>Had the leadership flinched on such policies, he said, Singapore would not be where it is today.<br><br>Other special guests throughout the Pioneers series of seminars - to be held once every two months - include former Cabinet minister S Dhanabalan, and former top civil servants Sim Kee Boon, Ngiam Tong Dow, JY Pillay and Philip Yeo.</blockquote>that's why we need to pay top $$$  to keep them to "lead" us<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br></div>

Examples as of<br>1) Raise GST(consumption tax) by 2 % (fuel the rate of inflation) to help the poors.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br>2) Raise their paycheck by est 20% as so that they will not be corrupted   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Therefore given a choice, not taking oppositions parties into consideration.
