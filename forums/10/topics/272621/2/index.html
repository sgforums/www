Yes, we as 'the man in the street' are not understanding what is happening around us.

I am just disagreeable with their recent policies and their justification on its implementation.<br><br>I dealed with global economies for almost more than 18 years mainly G7 and some emerging markets. Of all these years, I came to learn something that is more fearsome that most of us actually realized i.e inflation and the disparities between the richs and the poors. It is the love of the country that we comment else why bother.<br><br>If the Pro PAP camp as of Gazelle and Toro,OM be able provides more factual findings instead of mindless blabbering, I will definitely gives much respect. Of course. not the likes of Lionnoisy who gives stats, bashing other countries. This in return gaining the adverse effects instead of the supposedly feel good ones.

This is like WOW!</div></blockquote>just a thought about the GST hike and thus a drop in consumer spending leading to a shrinking of the economy...<br><br>there are many factors affecting consumption and so it's not really meaningful to state as a whole spending on luxury goods may drop due to a 2 point hike in GST. Other factors like increased affluence, different sales tactics in response to a rise in GST may actually curb the drop in total spendings as an economy.<br><br>Personally, i prefer an increase in GST than an increase in Income Tax.
