I mean they should also enjoy this wonderful feeling.<br><br>We must not be so selfish as to limit the wonderful feeling to just the private sector. The hardworking performance orientated public sector should also welcome this competition.<br><br>Foreigner cannot work in public sector?<br><br>not true.  so many projects employ so many many many many many foreigners.<br><br>Public sector permanent employees can also be foreigners-turned-citizen. So easy.<br><br>Thus, Foreginer can become citizen. There is no problem.<br><br>Thus, we must not limit good talents from working as MPs and ministers, in my opine.<br><br>I propose we import 100 000 politicians who want to be loyal citizens to serve the people and have never seen before COMPETITION for our poloiticians especially the OPPOSITION which is said to be lacking a few good men.<br><br>what do you citizens say?  time to beef them up to serve you better? salary hiked already. But I like to see where is my cheese.  anyone who can impress me will get my support. As simple as that.<br><br>My friends dun wanna wait another 50 long years!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>wow not a bad idea.<br><br>Since the government love to emphasis that foreigner-turned-citizens are Singaporeans, they can work in public sectors and even take part in political elections for opposition.<br><br>And I bet if FTs turned SIngaporeans be ministers, we can give them lower wages!</div>

The OPPOSE have never won the ruling party for a straight , continuous, consistent, 50 long years or so, seldom seen in 1st worlds.  IF OPPOSE does lack talents enough to win, they may like to take note of my solution for them.<br><br>HIRE as many new politicians as possible from overseas who want to be a sg citizen. Filter and select like choosing FTs to become citizens here. From the whole world , there will be enough talents to beef up the OPPOSE.<br><br>sg talents chosen  from sg population is only the best out of so few people compared to large countries.<br><br>I propose advertising for politicians from all over the world to become new citizens in sg.
