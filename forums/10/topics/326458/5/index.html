              <p>oxford mushroom, I am a Singaporean.  I am asking fellow Singaporeans, including presumably you, to change their minds.  How are "Singaporeans" going to "decide" on changes in "societal and cultural norms" other than through conversation with one another?  Why do you retreat into some imputed notion of what "we" support rather than just making up your own mind as a person?  Do you support making both changes or do you not?  That's the important question, not what you imagine everyone else thinks.</p>
              <p>I find it bizarre that you think the situation where both sides are screwed over (women can be raped, men are subject to undue financial burdens) is preferable to a situation where only one side is screwed over.  Everyone in the misery together, somehow that's better?  For the record, I support gender-neutral maintenance laws REGARDLESS of whether marital rape is also criminalised.  But I likewise support criminalising marital rape regardless of the maintenance laws. Each is a separate injustice that needs to be dealt with.</p>
              <p>It is deeply anti-human to believe it's acceptable for society to have "package deals" where financial contributions justify non-consensual penetration.  What's the difference between marriage and sex slavery then?  Slaves get financially maintained as well, you know?  As do farm animals.  (And yes, I know where marital rape immunity historically came from.  Britain traditionally treated women like chattel.  It's now moving away from that I would hope that Singapore can do so too.)</p>

              <p>You did not post the complete Penal Code 375, what you have posted is the subsection (4) of the Penal Code 375 which only states that it is not an offence for a man to have sex with his wife with her consent. Refer to subsection (1).</p>

              <p>Well all I can say is that the militant misandy of 4Justice probably helps the cause of gender equality for the human race as much as the MCPs that she fights so strongly against.</p>
              <p>Which is really sad actually, life's too short to live in hate and contempt. It irony with some forms of militant feminism that in fighting for the rights of women they become so much like the very worst of men, the very things they were fighting against in the first place.</p>
              <p>All the bigotry, hate, violence and ignorance isn't removed one bit, it's just transfered from one gender to another.</p>

              <p>parn, subsection (4) is an exception to subsection (1).  Subsection (1) is subject to subsection (4).  In other words, rape is forced intercourse by a man with a woman <em>except where they are married</em>.</p>
              <p>Elementalangel, if you marry a serial killer and get killed, it is THE SERIAL KILLER'S fault.  Just as if your husband rapes you, it is YOUR HUSBAND'S fault.  The law should reflect this.</p>

              <p>elementalangel, so do you think we should make exceptions for the crimes of murder, theft, poisoning, knifing and beating someone, just because the victim is the husband or wife of the perpetatror?</p>
              <p>Obviously if you could tell in advance that someone was going to beat
              and rape you, if you had any choice you wouldn't want to marry them.
              But over time, people may change, or in different circumstances people may show sides to them you hadn't seen before.  Domestic violence happens. Murder between spouses does
              occur.  Nobody would dream of saying that a woman who killed her
              husband, or a man who broke his wife's arm, should be exempt from
              the laws against murder or assault.  Why change this for rape?</p>
              <p>Rape is already a crime under the law.  We all recognise (I hope!) this is necessary. But the Penal Code contains an <em>extra</em> provision saying that this does not apply when the rapist is married to the victim.  I'm saying get rid of the <em>extra</em> provision. </p>
              <p>The question is whether something which was wrongful violence outside of marriage, can suddenly become acceptable within marriage.</p>

              <p>Maybe my first post was not very clear.  At the moment, the
                      Penal Code says specifically that <strong>an act</strong> that would normally be
                      rape,<strong> is exempted from being rape, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">just because</span> the rapist <span style="text-decoration: underline;">is
                      married</span> to the victim.</strong>  I am <strong>suggesting that the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">exemption be
                      removed</span>.</strong></p>
              <p>Yes, there are other offences relating to sexual violence: for
                      instance, there is outrage of modesty.  However, rape is more
                      serious than outrage of modesty, and in every case where the
                      offender is not married to the victim the law now recognises
                      this.  But when it comes to spouses the classification
                      "rape" is suddenly removed.  So the only relevant
                      question here is <strong>whether marriage means we think a rape is somehow
                      less serious than it would be outside of marriage.</strong> </p>
              <p>Why would someone think that except based on old-fashioned and
                      sexist ideas about men owning their wives? </p>
              <p>The distinction <strong>cannot be based on <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the risk</span> of false
                      allegations.</strong>  At the moment a girlfriend who is not
                      married to her boyfriend can falsely allege rape; a woman can
                      falsely allege rape by her colleague; a student can falsely allege
                      rape by her classmate; a businesspersoncan falsely allege rape by a
                      business rival... just as all these people can falsely allege they
                      were slapped or kicked by the other person.  <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">In every crime</span> (NOT just rape, NOT just sex crime) with every set of people<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> there is ALWAYS the risk of false allegations.</span></strong>  We rely on
                      proper police investigation, proper screening by the
                      Attorney-General's Chambers, and proper examination of the evidence
                      by judges, to prevent injustices from being done.  <strong>Why should
                      rape within marriage be seen as so special<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> even where the evidence is overwhelming</span></strong> as to be taken outside
                      of this process, so that  it
                      is <strong>not considered rape?</strong></p>

                      divorce is not enough once the rape happens. And also, <strong>it's
                      not like you can file for a divorce in the minutes a martial rape
                      is committed right?</strong> You gotta be really stupid to think that in the
                      final moments when the wife has rejected sex due to any reason and
                      the husband disrespects that, she can file a divorce and <strong>be safe
                      from martial rape.</strong> What utter crap.</p>
              <p>Finally, rape is the act of a man <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>forcefully</strong></span> inserting his penis
                      into a woman's vagina <strong>without consent</strong>, <strong>whether that woman is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">his
                      wife or not</span>.</strong> Nowhere in marriage does it say that marriage means
                      the woman has given permanent consent. <strong>In fact marriage says to
                      respect each other, and that means if the wife says no, it means
                      no.</strong> If a guy can't respect that, he needs to be castrated because
                      he really needs to be removed from the gene pool.</p>

              <p>Jojobeach, evidence of physical arousal doesn't mean that the
              physically aroused person will always want to have sex with
              anything in sight.  Just because a man has an erection, or a
              woman is experiencing vaginal lubrication (for example), doesn't
              mean it's okay to try to engage in intercourse with them if they
              are non-consenting.  It's still rape.</p>

              <p>We the know.. that .. for a female to have sex.. without vaginal lubrication.. also can .</p>
              <p>But for the males.... it's not likely for male to have sex when his sex organ is not erected lah.........</p>
