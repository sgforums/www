              <p>Irrational is saying "omg im a man i am scared this law might be
              abused and used against me don't pass it even if there are victims
              out there who would benefit from it!" Guess who started saying "no
              because men can kenna" 1st?  Oh hey its you. To be
              irrational 1st and then accuse me of being irrational because I
              point out its worse to be raped than to be falsely accused of it?
              Thats some ironic bullsh1t you sprouting there boy <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">.</p>
              <p>Please don't make me laugh. And pray tell how are you going to

              <p>Thats like saying a sheep can kill a wolf. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>I say, enact the law, and THEN work on the methods of detection
              to minimise abuse of the law. Lie detector tests, physical
              examinations, whatever it takes, but pass the law FIRST.</p>
              <p>After that you want to debate on how to make sure innocent

              <p>Psychological abuse that leads to the ability to intimidate the wife resulting in martial rape. Psychological abuse itself is NOT martial rape my dear. Lol have you been misunderstanding those 2 sentences? Oh dear <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"> Well I'm glad thats clarified now.</p>
              <p>So are u going to start a thread asking for avenues of recourse for the psychologically abused? I'll go support if u do ^^</p>
              <p>As for being biased, even if I'm biased, the decision still has to be made for the sake of the victims, simply because the pros outweigh the cons by a lot.</p>

              <p>Can I ask in the most academic manner possible, if there are no visible signs of marriage instability or outward violence like in cases of psychological abuse, how do you ensure a PPO is obtained before martial rape happens, bearing in mind most victims of psychological bullying are too terrified to apply for one? How can you be sure that prevention is applied in time before cure is needed?</p>
              <p>And yes, either way someone loses out, and I feel that having an avenue for seeking recourse for actual, existing victims of injustice is a stronger case than worrying about non-existing, hypothetical victims of abuse of the law.</p>

              <p>this is where public education must come into place. if one feels that he or she is a victim of physical or psychological abuse, he or she must be aware that some avenues or places where he or she can seek help.</p>
              <p>even if they do not know where to seek help, friends and family must also play a part. for example if one day i see my sister being very troubled and with physical scarring, as her brother, i must be her voice to seek protection and redress even if she have no courage to do so. likewise for friends... public education plays an important role.</p>

              <p><br>I'm afraid that might not be a very good idea, and its not because its bias against the men or any sort.</p>
              <p>Rape is a very difficult crime to prove as most of the time the burden of proof lies with the prosecution. Since a married couple are mostly alone when they are having sexual intercourse, its basically her words against his. In the case of strangers however, its easier to prove that the guy did indeed rape the girl based on the scenario.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Currently husband who force themselves on their wives however, are not going scot free. They are just being charged under a different crime, assualt, which is a whole lot easier to prove.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So although I agree with the morality of criminalising marital rape, the legal technicality is such that its easier to punish an abusive husband with assualt than with marital rape.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Just my 2 cents</p>

              <p>Hi all,</p>
              <p>Like to apologise my typo of 'revenue' for 'avenue'.</p>
              <p>Anyway, I think why are there other laws enacted even though the potential for being abused, I guess every law enacts would have carefully been thought through.</p>
              <p>If UK can enact Civil Partnership Act which is the recognition of same gender marriages, I guess, what you're holding on to, the tradition of penis enter vagina then can constitute rape, should change too!</p>
              <p>In this manner.</p>
              <p>And as mentioned, there are already other sections in the law that can put justice in place.</p>

              <p>this is where public education must come into place. if one feels that he or she is a victim of physical or psychological abuse, he or she must be aware that some avenues or places where he or she can seek help.</p>
              <p>even if they do not know where to seek help, friends and family must also play a part. for example if one day i see my sister being very troubled and with physical scarring, as her brother, i must be her voice to seek protection and redress even if she have no courage to do so. likewise for friends... public education plays an important role.</p>

              <p>The theory is nice. The reality is different. Short of YOU forcing your sister to go to the police against her will, they will not seek help. Yes, that IS the reality of most victims of psychological abuse, they get to a point where they will refuse to seek legal redress out of sheer terror until it's too late (i.e. martial rape happens).</p>
              <p>Seems most of you are able to understand seeking redress in theory, but how many of you have experience of real life cases? If you do, you'll know that majority of the victims simply cannot be identified at the "prevention" stage because the reality is that they live in such terror they will not willingly identify themselves. And if you wish me to delve further into the mindsets of such victims, which I am able to do and will happily do so in order to further educate and inform, then here it is: Many victims also develop a sense of irrational shame and will engage in massive effort to make sure that their marriage appears normal on the surface. This sort of mindset is apparent in a wide variety of abuse victims, and has made identifying potential victims of martial rape very very difficult.</p>
              <p>Another point: It's nice to talk about prevention, but what about current existing victims? Seeing the perp put away for another crime means some, if not many victims won't get the closure they seek. Often the purpose of convicting a criminal serves as much as an acknowledgement by society of the injustice the victims suffer. If you let the errant husband be convicted of a "lesser" crime there is a high chance the victims will be left damaged and unable to move on for life. Theres a specific reason why rapists aren't charged with assault.</p>
              <p>Anyways like I said, the needs of existing actual victims should outweight the needs of non-existing hypothetical victims. Knowing the cruel realities of domestic abuse of women, I have to say that all the current laws simply do not do enough to address the victim's right to justice.</p>

              <p>Can I ask in the most academic manner possible, if there are no visible signs of marriage instability or outward violence like in cases of psychological abuse, how do you ensure a PPO is obtained before martial rape happens, bearing in mind most victims of psychological bullying are too terrified to apply for one? How can you be sure that prevention is applied in time before cure is needed?</p>
              <p>And yes, either way someone loses out, and I feel that having an avenue for seeking recourse for actual, existing victims of injustice is a stronger case than worrying about non-existing, hypothetical victims of abuse of the law.</p>

              <p>Usually the rape is the straw that breaks the camel's back, although it must be said that victims only break their silence after repeated rapes.</p>
              <p>But yes. Like you mentioned,</p>
              <p>"Hmm, but why is marriage the main factor in the discrepancies of such laws? it doesn't make complete sense that your married status determines which laws you are governed under"</p>
              <p>Thats what I wonder too! Why does being married to the rapist make a victim any less of a victim of a rapist? I think thats a major point we are in agreement about.</p>
              <p> Perhaps the more pratical course of action would be to make rape a chargable offence even though the accused is married to the victim.</p>
              <p>Would have to point out though, that even implementing that course of action still results in a similiar consequence as passing a martial rape law. And I still think the positive consequences far outweight the negatives.</p>
              <p>But I would like to bring one more point back into consideration. Your spouse is supposed to be someone you trust the most. Hence that is what makes martial rape a particularly heinous crime. That the rapist is not some random criminal, but the one person you probably trust most in life. That alone, might actually justify an even heavier sentence for a martial rapist, hence the need for a seperate martial rape law. What do you think?</p>

              <p>There is no obligation in marriage to have sex. Perhaps you're not too widely read or knowledgable, but there are people who are perfectly happy in romantic but non sexual relationships, many who are even married. A marriage is a life long commitment that covers a great many areas besides sex. It certainly isn't an obligation to have sex.</p>
              <p>If a woman has a headache that isn't apparent, or if she just isn't in the mood, its not something a husband would reasonably notice, so why would a husband who asks when shes not in the mood be a bad husband? Nobody is bad for asking, any reasonable man will say "its ok, your welfare is more important". A husband is bad when they don't take no for an answer AFTER asking.</p>
              <p>If the husband is unreasonable and commits martial rape, a divorce is not enough once the rape happens. And also, it's not like you can file for a divorce in the minutes a martial rape is committed right? You gotta be really stupid to think that in the final moments when the wife has rejected sex due to any reason and the husband disrespects that, she can file a divorce and be safe from martial rape. What utter crap.</p>
              <p>Finally, rape is the act of a man forcefully inserting his penis into a woman's vagina without consent, whether that woman is his wife or not. Nowhere in marriage does it say that marriage means the woman has given permanent consent. In fact marriage says to respect each other, and that means if the wife says no, it means no. If a guy can't respect that, he needs to be castrated because he really needs to be removed from the gene pool.</p>
              <p>"maybe we should also amend the law that forbid the wife to file for divorce if she decline to have sex with her and the allow the husband to look for other woman."</p>
              <p>"grey area? not grey? unless the mind of the wife is grey, meaning she doesnt know what is part of her responsbility as a wife is?"</p>
              <p>Anyone reading your retarded backwards comments know that you're just a male chauvanist pig.</p>
              <p>People who have common sense will see what I said perfectly correspond with my nick. I have no problems with people like you who fail to see the link between what I say and what my nick is. Maybe you'd like to consult with Dinky. He seems to be vastly your intellectual superior and can tell you how to use a spoon to eat.</p>
