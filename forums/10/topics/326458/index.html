              <p>I have heard about why some husbands go for prostitution because the wives don't want to have sex with them.</p>

              <p>very grey area. personally i think laws don't really protect people. ppl only try to manipulate the law to their own advantages. like yamizi said, the wife could frame the husband, and declare that he raped her etc.</p>
              <p>and the wife could use this law to punish the husband by refusing sex etc. i'm concerned with this as a christian, because for us, we believe that once a couple is married, it's really 2 bodies becoming 1. the husband body does not belong just to himself, but also to the wife, equally, and vice versa.</p>
              <p> or what if it becomes like the ah long movie, "buy the sack of rice, nv get a chance to cook it"</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>But since there is so much immorality, each man should have his own wife, and each woman her own husband.</p>
              <p>The husband should fulfill his marital duty to his wife, and likewise the wife to her husband.</p>
              <p>The
                  wife's body does not belong to her alone but also to her husband.</p>
              <p>In
                  the same way, the husband's body does not belong to him alone but also
                  to his wife.</p>
              <p>Do not
                  deprive each other except by mutual consent and for a time, so that you
                  may devote yourselves to prayer. Then come together again so that Satan
                  will not tempt you because of your lack of self-control.</p>

              <p>that's so untrue. the law has always favoured the women. that's why it's more impt to protect the men from false allegations. rape is a very serious matter, too serious to be used as a mean to spite the husband because of a petty quarrel.</p>
              <p>and yes, i think some women are capable of doing such things just to spite their husbands. or blackmail the husband into her point of view.</p>
              <p>wives are able to refuse sex to punish their husbands, then cry infidility when the husbands seek sex somewhere else, then divorce and get half of whatever he owns. the law obviously favours the women.</p>
              <p>but rape allegation is just too serious to be messed around with just petty disagreements.</p>
              <p>too bad that humans are like that, cunning and evil, if everyone was honest and pure in motive, i wouldn't have a problem with that law, because i wouldn't fear that it will be misused and manipulated.</p>

              <p>of course i don't condone it either. unfortunately i really do think that laws can be manipulated. like what yamizi says.</p>
              <p>and i think laws are never fair to the men la. if you want something to be a law, it must be equal to all, and cannot be manipulated.</p>

              <p><br>So because a law can be manipulated, we cannot have this law, so what path of recourse do women who HAVE undergone martial rape have then? I have yet to see any better suggestions from you guys. Anything less than actually being able to bring a man to court for the specific crime of martial rape is not acceptable. What if the husband never physically abused the wife but psychologically abused her? What if thats how he intimidated the wife into martial rape, then what? </p>
              <p>There is no certain degree of physical violence, hence it won't be sufficient to ask for a Personal Protection Order to keep the bad husband away. And since bad husband cannot be kept away, there is no legal means to resolve the issue, unlike what Yamizi mistakenly said.</p>
              <p>So how then? Husband cannot be charged for any physical abuse or assault, PPO cannot be taken out against him, there is ONLY the specific crime of martial rape, what recourse does the victim have in such a situation? Should the law be revised to provide a means of justice for such victims? I say yes, even if that means men are at a higher risk of abuse of a law, because being martial raped is far worse than being falsely accused of martial rape.</p>

              <p>that's so untrue. the law has always favoured the women. that's why it's more impt to protect the men from false allegations. rape is a very serious matter, too serious to be used as a mean to spite the husband because of a petty quarrel.</p>
              <p>and yes, i think some women are capable of doing such things just to spite their husbands. or blackmail the husband into her point of view.</p>
              <p> wives are able to refuse sex to punish their husbands, then cry infidility when the husbands seek sex somewhere else, then divorce and get half of whatever he owns. the law obviously favours the women.</p>
              <p>but rape allegation is just too serious to be messed around with just over quarrel.</p>

              <p>Hey well the law favours women, but that's cause the law was moslty written by YOU men. And why did men get to write the law? Because society favours men. So you win some, u lose some. If you don't want the law to favour women, maybe your entire gender has to be knocked a few pegs down in society 1st.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Also I find the justification of "chance of abuse of the law" laughably stupid as a justification. Then what about rape? Gfs can also abuse that law after a tiff with a bf, girls who regret after a ONS can also abuse that law, so is it justification to abolish rape laws? What about outrage of modesty laws? What about ANY laws then? They ALL have the potential to be abused, and some even more so than a martial rape law. If the potential for a law to be abused is not good enough a justification to scrap them, then why should it even be allowed as valid reason to not pass a martial rape law? Seriously.</p></div>

              <p>Wah, so here I'm suggesting something to make fairness to men and you label us barbarians, how '4Justice' can you be?</p>
              <p>Since the current definition of rape is that a penis has to enter a vagina, might as well ask the legislation to review the need to have another definition equal in protecting man from raped by a woman! If you're <em>really<em> '4Justice' in the first place.</em></em></p>
              <p>The point is that, rape, which relates to violence, would have been able (thought may not necessary mean adequate) addressed since it enables the victimised wife to apply for Personal Protection Order and the whatever follow-ups (ie. police investigation, trials, etc).</p>
              <p>The law may not be perfect in covering all ends, but that doesn't mean you're left with no options.</p>
              <p>You can consider to go for under Penal Code, Chapter XVI, Offences Affecting the Human Body, Offences Affecting Life, section <strong>320 (<strong>Grievous hurt) sub (i) that says 'penetration of the vagina or anus, as the case may be, of a person without that person’s consent, which causes severe bodily pain'.</strong></strong></p>
