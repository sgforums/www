              <p>No loser, you seem to fail to grasp that you've been asked to f*ck off for being a male chauvanist pig. We don't tolerate racists like the KKK, why should we tolerate you? Its laughable if you went up to someone who believes in racial harmony and is anti-KKK and told them "you're narrow minded because you tell people who encourage discrimination and falsehoods to go f*ck themselves". Its equally laughable that you're calling me narrow minded for calling out your sexism, male chauvanistic views and degradory view of women.</p>
              <p>You've proven nothing, but thanks for a pathetic attempt at sounding smart. Sorry. Reyes, you epic fail.</p>

              <p>Whats your justice then? No justice for victims because you're worried about some hypothetical victims who do not exist? I'm sure thats very very just. I don't mind people who're against me if they're people like Reyes and you. Smart people like Dinky can see the validity of my points. Heck he's even reinforced some of it. Who cares what some backwards, ignorant, unthoughtful or just plain sexist people think as long as its the smart ones who have the proper discourse. ^^ </p>
              <p>And I'm sorry, as you can see, I reserve my people skills for smart people like Dinky even though he has also pointed out similiar points to yours. I don't bother wasting it on people like Reyes that's for sure. People like him are for my sadistic amusement <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> I enjoy a nice civilized discussion with Dinky, I also enjoy a nice putting down of the males who think non-existing hypothetical victims carry the same weight as existing, suffering victims just because those hypothetical victims are also male.</p>

              <p>For the last wish "Entitled half of his assets" Probably there should be terms to go along with this enforcement.

              <p>you know, i was reading this article a few days back. someone slashed his wife. of course while it is the guy's fault for losing it and attempting to assault his wife, but the backstory is, the wife have been known to be verbally and (cannot remember) physically abusive to the husband for ages.</p>

              <p>It's very sad that anyone should see sex as an 'obligation' or to see the right to penetrate an unwilling women who feels neither pleasure nor desire as an important part of marriage.  You're never entitled to use someone else's body without their consent, and marriage doesn't change that.  If you want sex with someone, you have to see what you can do about getting them to want sex with you too; and if they don't, you just have to accept it.  It's their body.  You don't own it.</p>
              <p>And there are many barriers towards making false allegations - what exactly would women get out of it?!  Many people who report rape, especially by their husbands, are disbelieved and shamed by other people, as there is still (wrongfully) a stigma attached to being a rape victim, which discourages many people from coming forward when they are real victims, let alone inventing trouble for themselves by making false reports.  </p>
              <p>But even where false allegations are made, as with all other offences, if there is insufficient evidence, either the police will discontinue investigation, the prosecutor will decide not to take the case forward, or the courts will acquit.  This is the same for ALL offences, why should marital rape be specially exempt even from investigation? </p>
              <p>The effect of the current law is that even if the evidence is 100% clearcut - for example, the rape led to vaginal injuries and there is DNA evidence - the husband is STILL not considered a rapist.  This is totally unacceptable.</p>

              <p>I think there are some misunderstanding here. I believe those that who do not support in such martial rape act, do not support in such rape too. So by labeling us sexist would be a bit too fast a gun to jump with.</p>

              <p>But rather, the way 4Justice had put it, seems to imply there is totally no way of addressing such issue, which is not true.

              <p>Maybe my first post was not very clear.  At the moment, the Penal Code says specifically that an act that would normally be rape, is exempted from being rape, just because the rapist is married to the victim.  I am suggesting that the exemption be removed.</p>
              <p>Yes, there are other offences relating to sexual violence: for instance, there is outrage of modesty.  However, rape is more serious than outrage of modesty, and in every case where the offender is not married to the victim the law now recognises this.  But when it comes to spouses the classification "rape" is suddenly removed.  So the only relevant question here is whether marriage means we think a rape is somehow less serious than it would be outside of marriage. </p>
              <p>Why would someone think that except based on old-fashioned and sexist ideas about men owning their wives? </p>
              <p>The distinction cannot be based on the risk of false allegations.  At the moment a girlfriend who is not married to her boyfriend can falsely allege rape; a woman can falsely allege rape by her colleague; a student can falsely allege rape by her classmate; a businesspersoncan falsely allege rape by a business rival... just as all these people can falsely allege they were slapped or kicked by the other person.  In every crime (NOT just rape, NOT just sex crime) with every set of people there is ALWAYS the risk of false allegations.  We rely on proper police investigation, proper screening by the Attorney-General's Chambers, and proper examination of the evidence by judges, to prevent injustices from being done.  Why should rape within marriage be seen as so special as to be taken outside of this process, so that even where the evidence is overwhelming it is not considered rape?</p>

              <p>Criminal proceedings are separate from divorce proceedings.  It's already possible for wives to file for divorce now; making marital rape a crime doesn't affect that.  What isn't possible is for rapists (of their wives) to be punished under criminal law.  Also, we already recognise that spouses cannot hit each other.  At the moment wives could also falsely claim that their husbands hit them, but we rely on the legal system to make sure their claims are discredited.  Surely you don't think the risk of false allegations in divorce proceedings means we should allow men to hit their wives?  Why does the situation change when the beating is with a penis instead of a fist?</p>
