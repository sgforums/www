            <div class='col-md body'>A few things to note here. Quak was guilty and convicted.<br>Teo could be right in banning Quak from the camp as disciplnary measure. He could indeed be a bad influence on other kids and it is Teo's duty to protect the other kids. Footballers could be charged in court for brawling and be banned from the league as well for good measure.<br>It all depends on the stituation, such actions could be appropriate.<br>However, even if it is the right thing to do, Teo shld have sat down with Quak and communicated it clearly to him the rational for such discipline and follow up with counselling. If I were Teo, I would ask Quak to stop all his CCA and focus on his studies and rehab. I will personally get involve in the rehab process.<br><br>BTW banning someone from badminton camp is not death sentence. You will never die for not playing badminton. don't give in to such cheap rhetoric.<br>Quak needs to learn from this lesson and not blame others for his misfortune. He's still young, he can change.<br><br></div>
