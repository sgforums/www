              <p>This might actually work but i dont know what the government would think of it (i think both you and i know the answer). I would say it is a good idea but its contentious whether its feasbile on the counts of a detailed CBA(cost-benefit analysis). It would only be beneficial if the costs of creating such a council can ensure tax-payers get better 'care' from the government be it handouts, subsidies, upgrades, building of amenities or something along those lines. In my opinion such a council, even if established is likely to fall under partial (if not complete) influence of the government and at the end of the day defeats the purpose. Even if the council can keep the pay of governments in check, can we ensure that the millions saved would be put to better use? (of which i believe is you primary concern)</p>
              <p>Lets say you confer the council some power to assert what you believe should be done with the money instead. But this will complicate matters as its seemingly creating a government above the government and the cycle just goes all over again. Democracy is based on putting your faith in a representative government to run the country on your behalf. And to a certain extent i still think that at the end of the day, its more important to a certain extent be content with what the country has given you rather than criticize individual policies. Yes we need to take ownership and speak up (hence my nickname) when necessary, but sometimes things are just like that. No system is perfect honestly. (i know i sound a bit resigned to life but sometimes thats just the way life is)</p>

              <p>Lets assume a non-profit organization that has good corporate governance (ie means good auditing standards and good cost control measures in place). It's focus then would be to ensure that what is a good pricing system to be instil on public transportation that would address 2 primary needs</p>
              <ol>
              <li>Keeping costs as affordable as possible for the general population<br></li>
              <li>Maintaining certain amounts of surpluses that can be used to distribute to the poor, and to be kept for possible future improvements to service</li>
              </ol>
              <p>Given the above, transport costs would be kept to the bare minimum for the general population, and perhaps at a price of about 10-15% more than the at-cost pricing, so that the organization can retain 10-15% as surplus to be used for distribution to poor or improvements to service. To determine bare minimum, we can use past historical income statements, etc as a determinant for prices.</p>
              <p>Out of this surplus, can keep 50% for future causes, and distribute 50% to needy families.</p>
              <p>You gotta admit that some of the improvements we see on our buses and mrts may well be redundant. Might be something like an overexcessive move. I prefer them to keep costs down, rather than to instil TVMobile.</p>
              <p>To the 2nd aspect of your discussion, I would think you are now looking too much into the details of implementation. First of all, we should look at whether the idea is feasible, then we start addressing implementation concerns. Every idea has its pros and cons, and its up to the implementers to look at how to resolve the cons to bring about reality.</p>

              <p>If you can double your pay, then work would definitely increase, though if its corresponding increase or not, we won't know. After all, job scopes are defined by humans, and they err frequently.</p>
              <p>But I would say you would feel that doubling your pay is worth the risk won't it? :)</p>
              <p>PS: Just don't go back to local companies. They expect you to work 24/7 365 days a year</p>

              <p>To soul_rage, you have good ideas in terms of running the transport company as a non-profit organization. The trouble is how are you going to ensure you align the objectives of workers, managers and such with what you are trying to achieve? The concept of principle-agent problem is happening all around us. From your realtor to the people you lead in your company, there is always a problem of aligning one person's objectives with the others. Realtors are paid a percentage of the sale value of a house to encourage them to maximize the value they help their clients get (this mechanism despite good, is still flawed but its not the time to discuss this). Monetary incentives, whether you like it or not is often what motivates people to do certain things, particularly in jobs. Which is why i am pro-competitive market system because it creates the right benefits in the right places to make sure the objectives of principle and agents are aligned.</p>
              <p>Similarly, if you are chairing the board of this non profit organization and are tasked with the necessity to achieve the above mentioned goals how are you going to attain them while maximizing your own utility?</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Keeping costs as affordable as possible for the general

              </blockquote>
              <p>This is a problematic statement. How are you going to know if the costs is already 'as affordable as possible'. It is imperative for you to set profit motives for your managers running the corporation for you in a way such that they would be motivated to keep costs down for you. If you run as a non-profit organization and pay your managers fixed wages, how are you going to ensure they go the extra mile to keep costs down when status quo earns them the same amount of pay? Alongside that, the company as a whole has no incentive to keep costs down because if they lower costs, their revenue goes down correspondingly. What good would they do them if they spend so much effort lowering costs and the benefits are accrued to the people?</p>
              <p>I know the above once again sounds callous and $$$ driven but it is true. This is why managing your staff in a company and getting the most out of them is such a problematic thing and a topic economists have revisited time and again to understand the mechanisms of office life.</p>

              <p>Bill and Merlinda Gates Foundation also pay their people market rates to ensure they keep the foundation effective, so I feel that the above are issues that are addressable, only that we need to delve into the details.</p>
              <p>What I do not like about PAP, is that they just brush off any idea that does not make $$$. If I suggest the above, they would say "Oh this would not work coz there is pay issues". And then, that's it, they shut off from listening to the viability of the idea.</p>

              <p>Well, then aren't the problems with private organizations just as glaring? Corporate frauds of $50billion, unnecessary bonuses, hopeless greed that places self before others. Collapse of 100-year old organizations.</p>
              <p><strong>Seriously, your concerns above have been shown to be properly addressed in successful non-profit organizations. And since, they do exist, what then is causing you not to acknowledge their success, but your own individual biasness and doubts?</strong></p>

              <p>I quote from wikipedia a definition of non-profit organizations</p>
              <p>"Whereas profit organizations exist to earn and distribute taxable business earnings to shareholders,
              <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">the nonprofit organization exists solely to provide programs and
              services that are of public benefit. Often these programs and services
              are not otherwise provided by local, state, or federal entities. </span></strong>While
              they are able to earn a profit, more accurately called a surplus, such
              earnings must be retained by the organization for its future provision
              of programs and services. Earnings may not benefit individuals or
              stake-holders"</p>
              <p>Given the above, wouldn't you agree that in the context of public transportation, which is for the benefit of the general public, that a non-profit organization actually makes more sense, because the focus is on public benefit, and NOT on business earnings?</p>
              <p>To me implementation details can be sorted out. It's the suitability of the overall solution that is important before we even embark on an implementation of the solution.</p>

              <p>If non-profit organizations are that succesful, then why do most businesses suscribe to the profit-driven model? Clearly there must be advantages that outweigh the costs of the profit driven-models. Yes it may not be the most perfect model, and is prone to corruption, fraud and inefficiencies, it is model that is more efficient than non-profit ones.</p>
              <p>I agree that conceiving the idea is more important. But how can you justify that one is better than the other without pointing out the pros and cons, even if it means venturing into further detail? It is insufficient that history shows non-profit organizations can survive, and even profit-driven ones crash and burn. There is a need to observe the merits and demerits of the two models over a prolong period of time. There must be a clear reason why one is being suscribed to over the other. By quoting historical <strong>instances</strong>, i can similarly say that a coin is biased just because i flipped 6 heads out of 10 tries. The sample size is very important and obviously the best testimony for the merit of profit-driven businesses is that more businesses choose this model over the non-profit one.</p>

              <p>I agree with this, but the problem being the merits of running a transport company as a non-profit organization does not outweigh the inherent costs arising from inefficiencies. If you justify your argument based on that ground, then shouldnt we be nationalising and running the public utilities board, all hospitals as non profit organisations? There are so many things like public utilities and healthcare that are more important than transport but why aren't they run as non-profit businesses? Simply because privatisation and being profit-driven usually yields results that are <strong>closest </strong>to the desired outcome.

              <p>When Adam Smith conceived the idea of the 'invisible hand' he noted that people in the pursue of <strong>self-interest </strong>(in this case that would be profit motives) yielded a positive result to society that was no part of their original intention. Running on a profit-driven model is using this very concept of the 'invisible hand' to achieve a desired outcome for society by 'tempting' economic agents to act in a way that maximizes their own utility but at the same time achieve the overall desired result.</p>

              <p>No I did not say you are right or wrong. I am just pointing out to you that you are rejecting a notion outright and not accepting that running public transportation using a non-profit organization is also viable.</p>
              <p>You also seemed confused over the issue by asking me why most organizations choose the profit-driven model. Of course they choose the profit-driven model, because they have private investors who are seeking for profits, therefore the choice is obvious. But in areas like public transportation, where public interests is concerned, this is another story.</p>
              <p>You cannot justify good enough as well, that a private organization is the best choice, because whatever you tell me about how profit-driven is the best way out, I would always return you back to the same issue, that a public transportation network is for a NATIONAL purpose, and NOT as a private purpose. A public transport is for the general good of the public, correct? Therefore, already you cannot deny the fact that a non-profit's goal is more hitting the nail than a profit org.</p>
              <p>Achieving affordability for public transport IS the sole motive. Everything else, such as profit, is secondary. A country is made of 3 basic pillars - transport, health, and education. It is never correct to outsource these 3, because they should remain as national interests, and NOT converted into private orgs.</p>
              <p>If the basic pillars are no longer managed by the govt, then what is the govt for? IF you outsource everything, then again, I would tell you we are overpaying our leadership, coz other countries have so much more to worry about, whereas ours have already outsourced most of their problems.</p>
              <p>You keep going back to costs costs costs, I ask you to look at successful non-profit orgs, who remain viable with very good management of costs. Do not forget, that successful non-profit orgs have a senior management that may be as good (sometimes, if not better) than private orgs. I refer you back to the Bill Gates Foundation. In fact, NKF was actually run better than private orgs, until they got into the golden tap issue. I am not asking you to flip a coin. I am telling you that they EXIST, therefore they are viable options, and not to be rejected outright by you or the govt.</p>
              <p>When you bring in medical, I am also against the notion of privatising the hospitals, even though privatising the hospitals might be a better idea than public transportation due to the fact that hospitals offer similar services and therefore, having competition might be healthy. But let's not dwell into another focus.</p>
              <p>End of the day, as charlize said, you need to establish the focus. Countries should consider social welfare and make a balance between that and profit-making. It should not do everything the profit-making way, ESPECIALLY for things like public transporation.</p>

              <p>Like i pointed out to you currently our so called '3 pillars' are all under private management. I have been trying to put forward my point to you in terms of economic analysis but you dont seem to catch it at all.</p>
              <p>Im telling you that your motives such as minimal costs and achieving the lowest price is better achieved under a profit driven model to establish a competitive price equilibrium. I have mentioned this before that the First Theorem of Welfare Economics states that any competitive equlibrium leads to allocative efficiency where social welfare is maximized. Its as simple as that. Im not saying that non-profit is not viable, but that profit-driven yields better results at lower costs. You keep insisting that non-profit takes care of the people better, but Im telling you that just because you are profit-driven doesnt mean you exploit the consumers.</p>
              <p>And you really gotta define 'good management of costs' because if you let a sole company run the transport industry as a non-profit organization, you are going to face what is known as X-inefficiency which is a lack of competitive pressure resulting in a lack of incentive to maintain competitive service standards and prices.</p>
              <p>I do not understand why you and charlize both percieve profit-driven and social welfare as trade offs. If that were the case our free market and capitalist economic model would have died long ago. The best equilibrium whereby society's welfare is maximized is one whereby people are profit-driven (or incentive driven) to achieve an equilibrium that benefits society which was no part of their original intention (Adam Smith), which is the beauty of free market economics.</p>

              <p>And you are still retaining the shallow perception that competition only helps under a homogenous market. But what I can tell you here is that especially for healthcare vs transport, healthcare is even more heterogenous than transport is. Besides a heterogenous product would benefit more from competition as it pressures firm to differentiate products which can comes in terms of imaginary (think branding) or real benefits (increase comfort, increase service standards etc.).</p>
              <p>I have also pointed out to you that when you take control of services such as healthcare, the resultant inefficiencies would far outweight what you save in consultation fees. Using CPF to alleviate the burden of healthcare is a much wiser move here. I do not deny the need for government hospitals nonetheless but the thing is lacking a profit-driven motive <strong>often </strong>(not always) breeds inefficiency and industries like healthcare and transport cannot afford such things as inefficiency often manifests itself as long waiting hours or long waiting lists.</p>

              <p>Let's cut off the health discussion. After all, we can't even agree on the transport model, better not bring in more things to complicate the matters.</p>
              <p>Coming back to transport, you had already conceded that our transportation system is not a direct competitor of each other. They break up routes and assign routes separately to each transport operator in the bus system. SMRT serves the north, SBS serves other parts of Singapore. In this aspect, when territorial lines have already been drawn, there is no good competition coming out of it. Don't forget, PAP created competition by having 2 broadcasting operators, but gave up conceding that sometimes competition results in excess costs. Putting TV Mobile on the bus is not a good value-add to affordable transport to me. It's excessive.</p>
              <p>Basically, you do not want to concede the fact that a non-profit organization works. Non-profit organization serves in areas where there is no 'competition' per-se, and yet they can be effective. It all boils down to whether you believe in passion. That sometimes, passion drives progress, and not just $$$.</p>
              <p>This global crisis has already exposed the flaws of the profit-driven model. Auditing can only do so much. There are many ways to beat the system. Even the theorem you raised has been proven to be incorrect at times, though in general, it applies.</p>
              <p>In short, just put it this way, you are right, and I am right. The world is mostly driven by profits, but in certain aspects of society, there exists non-profit orgs that do a better job than if we were to put a profit-driven org in that area. And to me, public transporation is just one of them, because of the PRIMARY objective of public transportation, which is an EXACT match of the objectives of non-profit orgs, and that is to serve the interests of the public first and foremost, and not profit first.</p>
              <p>By the way, there is also no true free-market economics. With the govt coming in to lend a hand to ailing private orgs, it's no longer free-market 100%. A free market is when these orgs should be left to die a natural death.</p>

              <p>When you say you want it to be a non profit organisation, who is it responsible to? I'm assuming you want the government to take charge of it yes?</p>

              <p>Non-profit organizations can be like profit orgs. They can be run like a private org, and subject to strict auditing rules. The govt can still act as the authority.</p>
              <p>Alternatively, the govt also can say it wants the non-profit org to report to them.</p>
              <p>It's dependent on which model that they want to utilize.</p>
              <p>Anyway it's pretty fun debating with you both. We agree to disagree, and ideas can be tested from both ends. However, it can also be tiring, which is why I realized there are quite a few people posting one-liner useless comments in forums</p>

              <p><br>Meh my personal philosophy is there are no definitely wrong or right systems, simply because once you inject the human component in it will immediately become flawed.</p>
              <p>The best you can go for is to constantly guard against adhering to an idealogy. It is my opinion that the PAP and LKY is committing that mistake now. The initial philosophy worked, but when you have a system staffed by people who benefitted from the system they would naturally be unable to identify the fundamental flaws in it.</p>
              <p>I don't know man, the whole idea of non profit organizations seems to open the gates of antrophy and corruption. When the organisation does not have to report profits it seem so easy to just sit there and abuse the system. It's a nice idea, but seems to go against the human nature so much it's just asking to be exploited.</p>
              <p>If the idea does take root though, i don't think you can put men in charge.  I'm a man, but even i can't picture any male manager to be able to run a non profit organisation without getting itchy fingers (*cough* Durai *cough* Mingyi)</p>
