              <p>You know speakup</p>
              <p>And you still do not understand what Bill Gates is doing. It's
              NOT social obligation. It tells me how myopic your views are. It's
              his calling to put his wealth into good use for the benefit of
              mankind, NOT because he thinks he's obliged to, but because he
              believes in what he is doing. Please don't insult Bill Gates, like
              how you insult all of us. Just coz you don't have a gracious spirit
              doesn't mean others cannot have a higher calling.</p>
              <p>There is nothing wrong with what I am comparing. You say there
              is no such thing as higher calling. I merely tell you that there
              are volunteers who believe in higher calling. I did not compare
              them to whether it is a job or not. Again, you are losing your
              bearings.</p>
              <p>Anyway, I am too lazy to address your other views coz you just
              go round and round the same old poisoned thoughts. Not to mention
              you can't even answer why you think a govt with a focus on higher
              calling will fail. You just conveniently hide and delude
              yourself</p>
              <p>What makes you think that it must be that one makes sense, and
              the other perspective does not make sense? It could be that both
              perspective make sense, just that again, you are poisoned with the
              "0" or "1" extreme views that MM Lee has. "It's either you vote for
              PAP, or Singapore will collapse"</p>
              <p>You can continue, but you still cannot give a good reason why
              you think their pay is acceptable. You cannot even give examples of
              mindblowing ideas that our leaders have implemented that justifies
              how good they are.</p>
              <p>Again, you are nothing but a product of propaganda, because you
              can't even say why you think they are good, except that MM Lee
              tells you so. They got the job done? Tell us which part?</p>
              <p>And between paying $2,000,000.00 and $400,000.00 (market rate)
              to get the same amount of work done, I will choose the latter. Why?
              Coz the 1,600,000.00 can be better used to help the lower income
              group.</p>

              <p>While i can understand where you're coming from, i still think it's rather naive or unrealistic to believe public offices would be filled with people who has intentions of social obligations who would not care much about salaries.</p>
              <p>I do not think that it is the person who is corrupt, but the power and authority that the position holds itself is corrupting. You may feel you would act differently in that position, but i retain my belief that you would behave differently when you get a taste of the power ( And the hidden "responsibilities").</p>
              <p>So i would agree with that ministerial salaries should be high, even above other global politicians' equivalent. At least it would discourage corporations from being able to bribe them to do things beneficial to the corporation but bad for the citizens.</p>
              <p>I can see what the PAP (and most probably LKY) is trying to do with Temasek and the GICs. Rather than allow a foreign bank or corporation to bribe the politicians into doing things for them the government (PAP and LKY) would provide that bribe.</p>
              <p>I don't like having to arrive at this conclusion, i find it distasteful to the extreme but at the very least i see the reasoning.</p>
              <p>However, i would disagree in the increasing number of redundant senior positions. Why the hell do we need so much Ministers of State and Senior Ministers for? Why is a Minister Mentor position with no direct responsibilities commanding equivalent salary with the President?</p>
              <p>If they are indeed so good wouldn't it made sense to release more of them into the private sector to spurn growth instead of leaving them clogging the pipelines and creating an extremely bloated bureacracy ?</p>
              <p>With the Internet and Globalisation, knowledge and information is growing at a rate never seen before. What these ministers initially scored high marks for in their youth might even be horribly wrong conclusions in the first place. The same way how so much of the theories and mathematical formulas prominient Economists have lauded as undeniable have crashed and burned in the recent Depression.</p>
              <p>Identifying talents when they are young in their schools might have worked when Singapore is building itself up.</p>
              <p>But furthur researchs into how the human brain perceive information and knowledge have proven that such conceptions result in a self fulfilling prophecy. (Since you've decided the individual is ministerial material, you intentionally give him/her more access to material and experience so that in the end they would naturally make good ministers, or at least the illusion that they know their job)</p>
              <p>It's the same as in the Army, where men are judged to be Officers or Specialists out of BMT (Though i heard this has changed somewhat). In the end you get clueless officers who frankly couldn't lead anyone but still get promotions and better salaries by virtue of their original training.</p>
              <p>What LKY original developed as a strategy worked wonderfully for Singapore the first few decades of his career. But it is my opinion that he has started to believe his philosophy to the extent of a religion where Faith trumps Proof.</p>

              <p>Too sleepy to respond in length to both of you (Speakup and Stevenson101), but I appreciate the debate that is going on between us here.</p>
              <p>We may have disagreements but it's fine. I just want to summarize a few things here:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>How much is enough? Stevenson, you yourself said so, they are happily adding more and more ministers to their list of redundant people. So long as there is no check in place, our leaders will continue to reward themselves needlessly. Think AIG.</li>
              <li>I am not naive to think of ideal leadership. Without ideals, there is no vision. Without vision, there is no progress to implementation. I just feel that our Singaporeans are too programmed to think that there is no other alternative but to pay crazy salaries to ministers to ensure they are not corrupted. But the irony is that these people who hold high posts are supposed to be men of integrity. The way we do it, is like saying that if they are paid any lesser, they will immediately become corrupt. Then, we have chosen the wrong leadership in the 1st place, din we not?</li>
              <li>Sometimes the path less travelled may well be the better option. Our leaders have reached a stage of contentment that they think they have every right to sit there and take the $$$. It's like Newcastle saying that they do not deserve to get relegated because of their proud tradition. So what if you have a proud tradition, or if you have done a lot for Singapore in the past? The past is the past. We appreciate the past, but it does not mean that automatically, you can continue to sit on that position for the future.</li>
              <li>Speakup, I too like you, appreciate the country we are in. But it does not mean we make compromises just because the past was all glory. </li>
              <li>Negative policies: ERP gantries, GST upped to support the poor (huh???), COE, etc. <br></li>
              <li>Commendable move: Job Credit, commendable, unsure if it's very useful, but at least we don't dump $$$ direct into companies like AIG without any control.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Either way, continue discussion tomorrow</p>

              Just a thought:  If you are paid high salaries for being a leader, then what is going to stop you from accepting bribes ( which is more $$$ ) from corporations to do their bidding?  Integrity? conscience?  If you had those, then why are you accepting huge amounts of money as salary for your post?

So how do we know there is corruption or not? It may be going on a long time ago like NKF (which is reported by public, remember MP Khaw &amp; SM's wife stand on the side of Durian) etc. Even if PAP found corruption among their members, would they report it out? If they report it, that mean "high pay prevent corruption " would be invalid. So do you think they will risk reporting it out? Some may laugh at other countries (taiwan president etc) for being corrupted but remember they manage to catch the culprit . For us, we may never know the truths.</p></div>

              <p><br>Just a thought: If you are paid high salaries for being a leader, then what is going to stop you from accepting bribes ( which is more $$$ ) from corporations to do their bidding? Integrity? conscience? If you had those, then why are you accepting huge amounts of money as salary for your post?</p>

              <p><br>I think soul_rage has answered your question.</p>
              <p>If i am earning a cool 1.94 (Minister) million per year (140k+ per month), i am discouraged from dealing in shady dealings because that would be stupid. There is a chance i might get discovered and lose everything whereas if i just engage in safe transactions and sit on my ass looking important at every meeting i still earn more than most Singaporeans earn in a year, perhaps even in a decade if you include bonuses and pensions.</p>
              <p>I have read a bit on how foreign banks and corporations screwed around with the policies of our surrounding neighbours (Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, Indonesia). So yes, i see the reason why Singapore is able to be relatively  free of foreign influence, trading foreign tyrants for local ones.  </p>
              <p>While i see the reasoning in this, i do not see the need to create so much positions that make little sense (Minister of State, Senior Minister, Minister Mentor). We simply cannot afford to keep so much "Ministers" on payroll to the point where they die or retire.  </p>
              <p>I think we've already pretty much hit past 100 million on their salary annually. Ministers should serve a maximum amount of years then be given a forced retirement to the private sectors.</p>
              <p>Granted, there is the possibility they might take one big bribe for that last burst of glory. But how long can the country itself keep this up ? I see the number of ministers and redundant positions increasing not decreasing.</p>

              <p>oi auntie, you like calling everyone uncle hor, must be very young hor?</p>
              <p>Well, why I am so vocal about my opinions is because I care for this country. If I don't care, I would just shut up. Seriously, as I said, I could just shut up coz I have very strong earning power, but I somehow still have that overriding urge to raise my opinions because I feel the need to. I don't raise just to this forum, I raise it to my PAP friends in the hope they can bring it up.</p>

              <p>Okay after like half a day and a night being away from the forums, at least i see some common ground established between soul_rage and i (dude the discussion yesterday was painful lol but yes fruitful nonetheless ;)) and of course stevenson who just joined into this intellectual discussion too (welcome :)).</p>
              <p>Yes soul_rage i particularly like your point about appreciating 'the country we are in. But
                                      it does not mean we make compromises just because the past was all
                                      glory.' I believe there is a need to renew the faith that the people have in the leaders. Many may not agree but as far as im concerned, i dont see Singapore sliding back where we come from. Instead i see our economy growing better to face tomorrow's challenges. Perhaps the lay person still feel left out from the plans of the government and that they arent taking care of us enough. But things i mentioned earlier bout the safety and such about your country are still being maintained today. Maybe our leaders can do more to improve the lives of the people and make more pro-people changes. But honestly i still do not get a sense of what most of you here want when asking for 'better' policies maybe you all can mention bout that.</p>
              <p>Using high pay to deter politicians from corruption is sound based on the concept of opportunity costs. By increasing their pay, you are increasing the opportunity costs of losing the job. Rationally people would not risk $2 milllion to gain $50k (either they are damn poor with math or they are just plain stupid). The odds are not right. For people who play poker and other gambling games you will understand the significance of odds. This is one of the reasons why i support the high pay of politicians. Maybe to some greed is insatiable and no matter what you pay the politicians they are prone to corruption. True. Its just like no matter how harsh the penalty for murder is, people still kill. But by raising the pay, you lower the probability. Thats all we can do really, we cannot read minds, we cannot constantly supervise our politicians. So all we can do is to put the right incentives in place and hope they respond to them.</p>
              <p>What im definitely critical of is the unnecessarily many minstrial posts as brought up by stevenson. While it is necessary to retain many 'brilliant minds' ( i know this is contentious) in the government, i agree there should be more forced retirements and allow these people to flex their brains in the private sector to contribute more directly to the economy as they close in on retirement age. It makes no sense to keep someone for 2 over decades drawing high pay and still expect him to churn out the same quality of work as he was in his younger days.</p>

              <p>Can u quote his monthly salary at OCBC? It seemed that whenever people mentioned that ministerial salary is lower that pte sector salary, they refused to state their</p>

              <p>As I said before, serving the nation is, well, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SERVING</span></strong> the nation. It's not a job. It's a servant to the people. Just as in non-profit organizations, the people go in knowing that they won't earn as much as if they were in corporate, but they go in anyway, with the passion to change things.</p>
              <p>Either way, this is a point we cannot agree on. While your camp argues it based on a career perspective, I view it more as a serving the people perspective. Therefore, we will always not be agreeable.</p>
              <p>Moreover, to remind you not to be a "0", "1" again, we don't pay people peanuts to serve the nation. We pay people reasonable amounts to serve the nation, not pay diamonds and cosmic rocks.</p>
