              <p>If a taxi driver dares to tell customers to f--k off, all customers need to do is to lodge a complaint, and the taxi driver will be disciplined or in worse cases, strike off the list of registered drivers.</p>
              <p>If a hawker tells people to f--k off, well, their food better be good, otherwise, the only person affected by this callous attitude, is the hawker himself (loss of revenue).</p>
              <p>In fact, you are over-simplifying the private sector. You feel like all of us in private sector are bosses, so we can tell the customer to f--k off.</p>
              <p>Ask any customer service officer if he dares to do that in his company. He will probably be sacked the next day. In the public sector, this person may be counselled or disciplined, and still have a job, but in the private sector, due to the pressures from shareholders and revenue figures, the errant customer service officer has a higher likelihood of being sacked immediately.</p>

              <p>Nowadays, with mega GRCs, election deposits are much larger for that GRC. Not as affordable liao. Also, almost no chance for independents to run for elections; they have to form a group to contest for a GRC.</p>
              <p>Also, PAP uses stewarts like LKY and GCT to contest in mega GRCs, making it harder for others to break. If you realise, the other MPs that contest together with LKY or GCT in the same GRC are usually newer ones with little battle/combat experience in the political arena.</p>

              <p>now i ask you a simple question, no quotes no nothing, you just answer straight. public and private, which one gets more pay, on average.</p>
              <p>average also covers time, so not only starting pay, but throughout.</p>

              <p>If altruism and passion is everywhere a form of human nature, then our market economies are all bullshit. But it is precisely because we are motivated by <strong>self-interest </strong>that today's market economies thrive under a meritocratic system and allow people to accumulate unprecedented wealth. To soul_rage, even if i do not doubt that you have so much passion to serve our nation even for a peanut pay, i doubt there are sufficiently many such people that are willing to do it. And it is not offending to ask, what is your current pay? Has it occured to you that because even half a public servant's pay is more than your current, you are willing to accept that pay cut? Assume now that the government offers you a job to "serve the people so very passionately" but offers you only 75% of your current pay. What is your take now?</p>
              <p>Market conditions should not be considered as relative. Just as prices of goods across borders does not equilibrate due to other external factors affecting cost conditions and correspondingly the demand and supply, using the pay of other politicians in other countries to determine whether our politicians are overpaid is not justified.Simply put it is because there are a shortage of willing politicians here that jack up the wages that they command. Simple economic theory: scarcity is power. If you need the demand and supply diagram I can draw it for you. While it is true that you cannot compare public and private sector wages across the board to determine whether politicians are overpaid, the private sector alternative is very real to someone choosing between a job as a public servent and as a private investor for example. There are <strong>opportunity costsÂ  </strong>to be incurred and more specifically in this case, <strong>transfer incomes</strong>. For any rational worker, he would only switch from one job to another when the alternative pays him the equivalent or better than the current job, assuming the absence of all other non-pecuniary incentives. If you dont put the right incentives in the right place, how do you ensure that you are getting the right people for the right job? If you want monkeys pay peanuts, you want mice you pay cheese, simple logic. And honestly not that I doubt your credentials but if you are in a position of lets say a CEO and you can earn $5 million a year. If the government you offer a place as president for $400k you think you will take? What you are willling to recieve for a job is not just an arbituary value but what you can actually command in the job market based on your qualifications. A beggar on the street can easily say 'wah the government pay me $1000 a month i also willingly be minister'. That is ludicrious if you are smart enough to realize but this example is not far off from your claim that you would be willing to take up a post in the government for less than what the existing ones are drawing. You know what is in it for you and compared to your current post the government job would be an improvement. So you are afterall rational and selfish like everyone else is. There is nothing wrong with pursuing material gratification. It is out of this selfishness and competition in the economic marketplace that we can see unprecedented growth in the world and income levels.</p>
              <p>And soul_rage if i could draw your attention to the following data http://www.scribd.com/doc/328232/United-Nations-Gini-Coefficient, our gini is not as you have mentioned but close to that of the United States in fact. Just compare Namibia and Singapore you'll get what i mean when i suggest that the state of inequality here is not severe.</p>

              <p>Ok, I stop poking fun at you.</p>
              <p>Sometimes, the simple question is not a simple question, your question</p>
              <p>"Public and private, which gets more pay, on average" is not easy to answer, coz you are making it too general.</p>
              <p>First of all, a starting job in the public sector mostly can be higher than the private sector.</p>
              <p>Overtime, the private sector pay may catch up coz increments <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">can </span></strong>be larger depending on company performance. For example, in this horrible crisis, public sector pay should be better than private sector pay right now.</p>
              <p>Basically, if you want a stable job, go to public for its stable increments and job security, but private offers more risks and benefits as well.</p>
              <p>So like I said, there's no sacrifice of one over the other.</p>
