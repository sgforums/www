              <p><br> Meh my personal philosophy is there are no definitely wrong or
                  right systems, simply because once you inject the human component
                  in it will immediately become flawed.</p>
              <p>The best you can go for is to constantly guard against adhering
                  to an idealogy. It is my opinion that the PAP and LKY is committing
                  that mistake now. The initial philosophy worked, but when you have
                  a system staffed by people who benefitted from the system they
                  would naturally be unable to identify the fundamental flaws in
                  it.</p>
              <p>I don't know man, the whole idea of non profit organizations
                  seems to open the gates
                  of antrophy and corruption. When
                  the organisation does not have to report profits it seem so
                  easy to just sit there and abuse the system. It's a nice
                  idea, but seems to go against the human nature so much it's
                  just asking to be exploited.</p>
              <p>If the idea does take root though, i don't think you can put men
                  in charge.  I'm a man, but even i can't picture any male
                  manager to be able to run a non profit organisation without getting
                  itchy fingers (*cough* Durai *cough* Mingyi)</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Well, the truth remains that even if you report profits, people STILL abuse the system (*cough* Madoff *cough 50billion cough cough*). I would say that it's not a question of whether an org is profit or non-profit, but that adequate INDEPENDENT controls are in place to act as a deterrent to human nature of greed.</p>
              <p>Anyway, I agree with you on the current govt issues. They are a little blinded to everything except for $$$, they may have already forgotten why they got there in the 1st place. KMT in Taiwan, started off with strong support, seeped off to corruption and dirty politicking, and then got kicked out. They got the opportunity to self-reflect, and now they are back stronger than ever. Sometimes, sitting at a top position for too long tends to cloud the mind (absolute power clouds absolutely), that a replacement is due in order for everyone to wake up their idea.</p>
              <p>And yes, I agree with your personal philosophy, that there is no definite right or wrong systems. I am just asking friend speakup to recognize that a non-profit org can work and succeed as well, and not to just reject the notion outright, so long as it doesn't make $$$ (which is what our leaders frequently do, throw out non-profit making ideas even though it might hugely benefit the people)</p>

              <p>To you two, I agree there are no right or wrong or best model. I do not disagree that non-profit orgs do work but just let me have the right to think that as far as transportation is concerned, private works better. Yes maybe someday the government will scrape the current system and adopt yours and maybe by then we can make better comparisons. However for now given the status quo, we can only discuss possibilities.</p>
              <p>To me the problem about collusion between SMRT and SBS is a problem about market failure due to monopoly and not due to privatisation per se, but i dont wanna delve into that cause I really had enough of quoting and stating theories. I recognize that you have a right to believe that non-profit orgs do work and I do agree that in the right hands such a method may flourish and far exceed the current standard of provision for the public.</p>
              <p>Nonetheless as you all have brought up examples, Man is often greedy by nature. Even with auditing you all have conceded that such things may be insufficient. I believe in the need for institutions to keep things in check, but I believe they should act as markers and signals for corporations to act in the right manner and not act in an intrusive way (close monitoring, going through books etc).</p>
              <p>And yes soul_rage I agree that amidst the current financial crisis we do see the US government extending helping hands to their auto-makers and large financial institutions and hence you conclude that there is no true free market, which I agree to a certain degree. All I can say is that the market is like a kite. Leave it to fly until it runs into trouble then bring it back. If you restrict too much of its freedom, you cant see its beauty; on the other hand give it too much slack and it runs amok. Bhagwati once said that the 'invisible hand is flawed, but the visible hand is frail.' I agree with this thats why I suscribe to capitalists and meritocratic ideals. Nonetheless when really confronted with a crisis as large as this, the 'visible hand' may intervene on grounds that there is a larger picture to care about. It is debatable whether such mega-corporations should have been allowed to have such large socio-economic influence to begin with, but i believe the US govt is doing the right thing to give suitable rescue in light of a greater purpose to revive the economy.</p>

              <p>Is it cheaper to fly first class on a commercial airline or charter a whole plane for your trip? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It cost <span style="font-size: medium;">£245</span> million to operate a fleet of 43 Hercules C-130 a year, which puts the cost of operating a C130 for a day at S$35,000.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>How much does it cost to fly First Class return from Singapore to an Asian destination? S$2,000?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The main reason why he took C130 is more of security rather than cost saving measure, if anything happens, the C130 can be deployed immediately, there are also countermeasures available for use. If he really wants to cut cost, he will be taking Tiger Airways or Air Asia. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Private transport? Taxis seems to operate as a cartel. Buses seems to be operating as a monopoly. Yes i know, there are 2 public bus service operators. But they hold a monopoly in different areas in this country. Maybe i should say its a monopoly on bus routes, since no 2 bus services run the exact same route. Yes, you indeed have a choice of changing buses/mrt. But the cost/time is an issue. I believe that a monopoly is not efficient and produces deadweight loss.</p>
              <p>I believe that sg government is worldclass. Because our great country generally follows the global trends. We are not trend-setters. We are not world-beaters. But definitely world"class". Like this recent recession, we are like all countres. What happens to the world happens to us. We are in that class. We cant beat it but we are there. hmm, we are world beaters, the politicians pay definately beats all.</p>

              <p><br>So, u like our taxis and buses to be like Malaysia standard ar?? no price control one,..can anyhow charge peoples and usually overcharge. By controlling our transport system we are in better position to follow the global trends.

And of course to hold up it with dignity and pride we need to pay ministers compatible to the corporate market value, otherwise how to attract them. If peoples are jealous and angry with our ministers paid, they can alway migrate and search for a govt whose paid is very low, Zimbalwe, Congo or Papua New G. where the president is damn rich and the rest is poor.</p>

              <p><br> Meh my personal philosophy is there are no definitely wrong or
              right systems, simply because once you inject the human component
              in it will immediately become flawed.</p>
              <p>The best you can go for is to constantly guard against adhering
              to an idealogy. It is my opinion that the PAP and LKY is committing
              that mistake now. The initial philosophy worked, but when you have
              a system staffed by people who benefitted from the system they
              would naturally be unable to identify the fundamental flaws in
              it.</p>
              <p>I don't know man, the whole idea of non profit organizations
              seems to open the gates
              of antrophy and corruption. When
              the organisation does not have to report profits it seem so
              easy to just sit there and abuse the system. It's a nice
              idea, but seems to go against the human nature so much it's
              just asking to be exploited.</p>
              <p>If the idea does take root though, i don't think you can put men
              in charge.  I'm a man, but even i can't picture any male
              manager to be able to run a non profit organisation without getting
              itchy fingers (*cough* Durai *cough* Mingyi)</p>

              <p>Thats because in a monetary system, people are forced to behave in corrupt ways. Instead of thinking of human beings as flawed beings, why not think of our environment as corrupting us? Put an ethical and law-abiding man into a ghetto with nothing else but the clothes he is wearing and he'll resort to cheating and lying to survive. As long as the mechanism for survival in our environment, a monetary system, is corruption and exploitation, then whatever system you have, be it democracy, socialism etc etc, it will still be corrupt.</p>

                      yea they are ethical and compassionate (especially at times nearing

              <p>Thats because in a monetary system, people are forced to behave
              in corrupt ways. Instead of thinking of human beings as flawed

              ethical and law-abiding man into a ghetto with nothing else but the
              clothes he is wearing and he'll resort to cheating and lying to
              survive. As long as the mechanism for survival in our environment,
              a monetary system, is corruption and exploitation, then whatever
              system you have, be it democracy, socialism etc etc, it will still

              <p>The way i see it, modern monetary systems are only the latest representation of that flaw. A good concept when initally conceived but warped beyond anyone's expectations.</p>
              <p>We are only the products of that environment. We may look like we are conquering Nature, but in the final analysis Mother Nature will always win the war, especially when we fail to understand the traits that made us such excellent survivors would bite us in the ass in the end. </p>
              <p>I do agree with the ghetto scenario, that is how survival has always worked. I just disagree how you seemed to think the monetary system is somehow the foreign culprit when control systems has always existed one way or the other.</p>

              <p>To you two, I agree there are no right or wrong or best model. I
              do not disagree that non-profit orgs do work but just let me have
              the right to think that as far as transportation is concerned,
              private works better. Yes maybe someday the government will scrape
              the current system and adopt yours and maybe by then we can make
              better comparisons. However for now given the status quo, we can
              only discuss possibilities.</p>
              <p>To me the problem about collusion between SMRT and SBS is a
              problem about market failure due to monopoly and not due to
              privatisation per se, but i dont wanna delve into that cause I
              really had enough of quoting and stating theories. I recognize that
              you have a right to believe that non-profit orgs do work and I do
              agree that in the right hands such a method may flourish and far
              exceed the current standard of provision for the public.</p>
              <p>Nonetheless as you all have brought up examples, Man is often
              greedy by nature. Even with auditing you all have conceded that
              such things may be insufficient. I believe in the need for
              institutions to keep things in check, but I believe they should act
              as markers and signals for corporations to act in the right manner
              and not act in an intrusive way (close monitoring, going through
              books etc).</p>
              <p>And yes soul_rage I agree that amidst the current financial
              crisis we do see the US government extending helping hands to their
              auto-makers and large financial institutions and hence you conclude
              that there is no true free market, which I agree to a certain
              degree. All I can say is that the market is like a kite. Leave it
              to fly until it runs into trouble then bring it back. If you
              restrict too much of its freedom, you cant see its beauty; on the
              other hand give it too much slack and it runs amok. Bhagwati once
              said that the 'invisible hand is flawed, but the visible hand is
              frail.' I agree with this thats why I suscribe to capitalists and
              meritocratic ideals. Nonetheless when really confronted with a
              crisis as large as this, the 'visible hand' may intervene on
              grounds that there is a larger picture to care about. It is
              debatable whether such mega-corporations should have been allowed
              to have such large socio-economic influence to begin with, but i
              believe the US govt is doing the right thing to give suitable
              rescue in light of a greater purpose to revive the economy.</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>Either way, speakup, we won't agree on the grounds of whether the current transport model is good or not. To me, I personally feel that the current model is wasting money excessively on frills, when public transporation is all about minimal frills and focused affordability. Anyway, I just wanted your acknowledgement that there MAY be better ways to run our transportation network, and I have gotten it, so no complaints from me there.</p>
              <p>Coming back to your belief on saving the economy by govts, only time will tell if they are right. I have looked into the history books and never have I seen such drastic intervention as this round. Therefore, it means that we DO NOT have any means to understand the possible consequences, since it has never happened before. I only hope that you are right, because I don't dare to think about the consequences if it was otherwise.</p>
              <p>Some possible consequences are increased inflation, or a full true collapse of the system after only a few years, shortening the economic cycle of ups and downs.</p>
