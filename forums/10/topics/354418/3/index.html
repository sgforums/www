              <p>True, some citizens can be quite nuisance towards public

              <p> </p>
              <p>They don't ask citizens to fuck off. They just ignore, or direct
              you to another department, then another, then another and another,
              and finally back to the first department, who will direct you
              again. Happened before to someone I knew when the person went to

              <p><br> Justifications for paying huge amounts of money to entice / retain
              them in govt seems crap to me. Comparing their salaries with top
              executives is even more crap.</p>
              <p>Motivating them with huge amounts of monetary rewards to do well
              in their job kinda reminds me of parents motivating their children
              to do well in their exams by rewarding them with money, gifts etc.
              This is flawed in the sense that they are doing the job ( serving
              the people / country ) for a lot of money instead of passion. The
              same applies to the children that want to do well in exams for the
              sake of money, gifts etc.</p>
              <p>Serving the people / country should not be a job or a career, it
              should be a service. Only then can the person do it with passion
              without huge amounts of monetary rewards in mind. Unfortunately,
              this is not happening at all.</p>
              <p>So are they serving the people / country with huge monetary
              rewards in mind or with passion in mind?</p>

              <p>yup, good for you.</p>
              <p>sacrifice 1.</p>
              <p>For all levels, public sector will generally make less money,
              and less bonus. even the LHL cannnot compare.</p>
              <p>sacrifice 2.</p>
              <p>You will need to deal with member of public that will demand
              alot based on this one reasoning: they pay taxes. you will hear
              this everytime, and they will conveniently forget the fact you are
              paying taxes too.</p>
              <p>sacrifice 3.</p>
              <p>In private sector, you just try to make money., and provide
              service as best as you can. if customers not happy, they can fuck
              off. in public sector, you cannot pleased everyone. there is
              always some group of people that is not happy. that will always be
              a fact. You cannot ask citizens to fuck off.</p>

              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Public sector earns more than private sector</span></strong></p>
              <p>Wrong count on that one. Many areas in the public sectors can make more money. Their starting pay is actually higher than that of private sectors. Not to mention that public sector has more stability compared to private sector.</p>
              <p>LHL earns more in private? Are you very sure about that? Why do you think he can take up a top position in the 1st place if he is in the private sector? Is he really a top talent? Maybe you should name what he has achieved to justify he is a talent in the 1st place.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Dealing with Members of Public</span></strong></p>
              <p>I don't understand. Is this a sacrifice? If you work for a private company, you answer to the shareholders and stakeholders. If you work for the public sector, you answer to members of public. If you cannot handle the public, then it's not a sacrifice, but only that you are incapable of handling interpersonal relationships</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Private Sector. Asking customers to F--k Off</span></strong></p>
              <p>Wrong on this count as well. Customers are the most demanding (Sometimes even more than the public), and there will always be unhappy customers. A top talent do not just tell the most demanding to f--k off (that shows the incapability of the person to handle interpersonal relationships again), but to be able to manage the expectations of the customer.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>From the above, I still feel you do not know enough of both sides to comment. But, I commend your efforts to try to justify the difference. At least it's a fruitful discussion, rather than those who think that our leaders are justified in their astronomical pay, but yet, do not even know WHY. Sad.</p>

              <p>i see that you are demanding alot of answers from me, but simply

              your "students will never understand" attitude.</p>

              <p>I will tell you what should I be paid. I should be paid Market Rate, meaning that the market range that is paid to <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">my peers in the same sector or similar position as me</span></strong>. It means I do not compare myself with doctors, lawyers, engineers because I am not in their sector.</p>
              <p>So since you say you should be paid $3+k, why do you think you should be paid $3k+? Is it only because that's what the starting pay is for your domain, and that also equates to market rate for starting grads in that domain?</p>
              <p>So do you now know what Market Rate is? Do you agree that our govt should be paid market rate for their work too?</p>

              <p>starting pay is everything ah? you go out to the street and ask
              anyone who gets more money, public or private, see what is the

              <p>public is more nuisance than private. shareholders don't breathe
              down your neck every minute. the public do. and they will post
              stuff on forum, on STOMP about it. more scrutiny from public.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you are the boss, and the customer piss you off enough, you
              just tell them fuck off... ask any taxi driver or hawker center
              boss... But not so for trolls against the government. They will
              always be breathing down the neck of govt.</p>

              <p>Cool. I started off in the public on a bond, and now in the private.</p>
              <p>Seriously, both has its pros and cons. I wouldn't say that the public job sacrifices more than the private job. I think it all boils down to attitude and passion.</p>
              <p>My concern is that because the leaders of our country are overpaid, and too much emphasis is on $$$, they have also lost their bearings, and are only there for the $$$. They have forgotten that a politician should be passionate to the people, and not to $$$</p>

              <p>Wrong, if my points are not valid, you can say so. but saying my
              points are not valid because i have limited experience, that is
              being juvenile.</p>
              <p>so, same 3 sacrifice points, i made the rebuttal, are they
              valid? do you really think that public make more than private?</p>
              <p>I will throw in an example: army pilots have better benefits
              than commercial pilots?</p>

              <p>Yes you have limited experience, therefore your points hold not much water. In fact, when you 1st started off on the 3 sacrifices, I had already pointed out that your points are incorrect, because you do not know the pains of the private sector, and you are making sweeping remarks, such as things like asking customers to get lost (This attitude <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">IS JUVENILE</span></strong>)</p>
              <p>I am inclined to stop my discussion with you till you acknowledge what I have said first.</p>
              <p>And coming to your point on army pilots and commercial pilots, you are losing the bearings again. Are you asking about salary, or are you asking about benefits? If you cannot even define what you are asking properly, its very difficult to discuss on a similar level.</p>
