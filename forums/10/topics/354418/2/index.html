              <p>It is really unfair to criticize our politicians of "sucking"
              money from their people and leave them to poverty which is
              certainly untrue. Compare yourself to countries like Iraq where the
              late Saddam Hussein decorated his quarters with gold toilet seats
              while his people struggled to make ends meet. That is despeicable.
              However in Singapore, the story is different. Yes the lay person
              may not be very well-off, but we are not several from adverse
              poverty just like China experiences in some part of their country.
              Zimbabwe under Mugabe was a sorry sight too. We play our
              politicians well to encourage them to do a good job and be less
              prone to corruption.</p>
              <p>Ask yourselves, if the job does not pay well would you be
              motivating yourself to work hard to be a politician? Just because
              the source of revenue for the government comes out of your pockets,
              you are feeling sore about their hefty pay-packets. Why not
              complain that private corporations are raking in bonuses by the
              millions? Yes by comparison our country's politicians do earn
              several times compared to other countries but every country's
              political system differs. How much do you hear of corruption in
              Singapore as compared to overseas? Look at Chen Shui Bian or even
              those nominated to take posts in the Obama administration's
              treasury. Several of them fail to make the mark due to questionable
              tax histories and such.</p>
              <p>Our labour pool is rather small and attracting talents to join
              the government is no easy task. Ask yourself, if the pay of a
              politician is $400k (the equivalent of Obama's) whilst as a doctor
              you can rake in $600k. What would your choice be? Our pay has to be
              competitive compared to what other alternatives these people who
              choose to be politicians have. Dont be hypocritical when you say
              the politicians are greedy. Dont you wish you could have a bigger
              house, drive a bigger car or earn a larger wage? Arent these traits
              of greed? Greed and selfishness is everywhere a human phenomena, an
              innate nature in fact. Father of economics Adam Smith recognized
              this as a fundamental driving force behind the market system. By
              the pursuit of self-interest people promote an end (benefit to
              society)which was never part of their intention that makes today's
              market economies possible. To scorn justified pay packets is to
              condemn the market system and meritocracy. Ask yourself would you
              rather a system whereby your hard work does not merit an equivalent
              portion of monetary reward.</p>

              <p>Here comes 1 of the 66.6% population who voted for PAP in the last election, and demonstrating to the entire world how stupid Singapore citizens are, by supporting the unbelievable pay that our ministers pay themselves.</p>
              <p>Ask yourself. The gap between position 1, and position 2 in the top 10 highest paid politicians, is so huge. You really believe this is acceptable, when the No. 1 well-paid politician is actually running a small tiny city-state?</p>
              <p>Do you also know that the gini-coefficient (used to measure the divide btw the poorest income group versus the highest income group) for Singapore is as bad as 3rd world countries? So I hope you moderate yourself when comparing us with 3rd world countries</p>
              <p>In addition, Politics should NEVER have been considered to be a career in the 1st place. (Just as AWS, our 13-month wage supplement was NEVER a bonus, and should have been a compulsory payment to us, but our expensive govt is now advocating that our AWS is also a bonus). Anyone who treats politics as a career should not be in politics at all.</p>
              <p>Yes, you may start shouting, who's going to join the govt if the pay is lower? I will tell you, ME. I will join the govt if the salary is at least halved. The point is, there are TRUE people who want to serve the people, but do not want to enter politics now because PAP has made it so rewarding that it has tainted the ideals of being in the govt.</p>
              <p>In short, you are talking nonsense. By equating everything to only pay, our govt is showing the next generation of Singaporeans that all other things such as compassion, graciousness, non-monetary stuff, are NOT IMPORTANT. Our Govt is telling us that they don't give any concern about anything else other than $$$.</p>
              <p>That's how our society has evolved to this state of being uncaring, and only being pragmatic.</p>
              <p>As I said again, I can't believe that there are actually jokers who believe that our PM's pay is justified when his pay is 3 to 4x more than ALL OTHER leaders in the world.</p>

                                                <p>It is really unfair to criticize our politicians of "sucking"
                                money from their people and leave them to poverty which is
                                certainly untrue. Compare yourself to countries like Iraq where the
                                late Saddam Hussein decorated his quarters with gold toilet seats
                                while his people struggled to make ends meet. That is despeicable.
                                However in Singapore, the story is different. Yes the lay person
                                may not be very well-off, but we are not several from adverse
                                poverty just like China experiences in some part of their country.
                                Zimbabwe under Mugabe was a sorry sight too. We play our
                                politicians well to encourage them to do a good job and be less
                                prone to corruption.</p>
                                <p>Ask yourselves, if the job does not pay well would you be
                                motivating yourself to work hard to be a politician? Just because
                                the source of revenue for the government comes out of your pockets,
                                you are feeling sore about their hefty pay-packets. Why not
                                complain that private corporations are raking in bonuses by the
                                millions? Yes by comparison our country's politicians do earn
                                several times compared to other countries but every country's
                                political system differs. How much do you hear of corruption in
                                Singapore as compared to overseas? Look at Chen Shui Bian or even
                                those nominated to take posts in the Obama administration's
                                treasury. Several of them fail to make the mark due to questionable
                                tax histories and such.</p>
                                <p>Our labour pool is rather small and attracting talents to join
                                the government is no easy task. Ask yourself, if the pay of a
                                politician is $400k (the equivalent of Obama's) whilst as a doctor
                                you can rake in $600k. What would your choice be? Our pay has to be
                                competitive compared to what other alternatives these people who
                                choose to be politicians have. Dont be hypocritical when you say
                                the politicians are greedy. Dont you wish you could have a bigger
                                house, drive a bigger car or earn a larger wage? Arent these traits
                                of greed? Greed and selfishness is everywhere a human phenomena, an
                                innate nature in fact. Father of economics Adam Smith recognized
                                this as a fundamental driving force behind the market system. By
                                the pursuit of self-interest people promote an end (benefit to
                                society)which was never part of their intention that makes today's
                                market economies possible. To scorn justified pay packets is to
                                condemn the market system and meritocracy. Ask yourself would you
                                rather a system whereby your hard work does not merit an equivalent
                                portion of monetary reward.</p>

              Justifications for paying huge amounts of money to entice / retain them in govt seems crap to me.  Comparing their salaries with top executives is even more crap.
              
              <p>Motivating them with huge amounts of monetary rewards to do well in their job kinda reminds me of parents motivating their children to do well in their exams by rewarding them with money, gifts etc.  This is flawed in the sense that they are doing the job ( serving the people / country ) for a lot of money instead of passion.  The same applies to the children that want to do well in exams for the sake of money, gifts etc.
              
              </p><p>Serving the people / country should not be a job or a career, it should be a service.  Only then can the person do it with passion without huge amounts of monetary rewards in mind.  Unfortunately, this is not happening at all.
              
              </p><p>So are they serving the people / country with huge monetary rewards in mind or with passion in mind?</p>

"<span style="color: #0000ff;">The board, in a fairly cozy relationship oftentimes with the executive, hires an executive compensation firm, which surprisingly tends to think that it's necessary to retain the best talent to pay people $20 million or $30 million a year</span>."</div>

              <div class="p">"You can still have outsized rewards and success for successful business people, but it'll be based on not short-term performance, not three-month performance, not your ability to flip quick profits off products like derivatives that don't turn out to be particularly productive to the company, but based on sustained effective growth," Obama explained.</div>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="p">"It doesn't mean that we want the state [to] dictate the salaries. We don't," he said.
