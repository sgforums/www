              <p>To the many who have said that the government policies are
                          undeserving of their pay, may I humbly enquire what kind of
                          policies would be considered as justifying their wages?</p>
              <p>I cannot emphasize more about the flaw of comparing the so
                          called 'market rate' with what our politicians are drawing. Its not
                          about whether higher pay ensures risk taking or not or whether our
                          politicians have been accountable to us. Its simple logic of demand
                          and supply. When supply of politician low, price high. Simple.
                          There are no tricks no foul-play whatsoever. In such a small
                          populace, those with high capabilities, intellectually gifted and
                          have strong characters capable of being in the government are far
                          and few within. Whilst there is so much talk about servant
                          leadership and passion to serve, the truly pressing problem is how
                          to attract people to give up a corporate job for a public one. It
                          really is simple logic. Let me ask you soul_rage how would you
                          compare yourself to Barack Obama? Its as simple as if I offer
                          US$400k, I get someone like Obama to run the nation. If i offer
                          US$40k I would probably get someone like soul_rage. It is not about
                          the politicians sitting there and setting their pay. It is
                          precisely because of the pay and that their qualitifications
                          command it that they are sitting there in the first place! Peopl
                          are getting lost in the idea that people get into the cabinet and
                          say ' okay this year we shall draw $2.7m'. It works in exactly the
                          reverse manner and you all out that got to understand this logic.
                          The jobs attract the people, not the people attract the jobs.</p>
              <p>And honestly those who call our politicians or anyone
                          money-minded for that matter are mere hypocrites.Go and ask
                          yourself why you are even here criticizing politicians for their
                          seemingly exhorbitant pays. It is precisely because you are
                          money-minded yourself! It pinches you to see the money go to them!
                          Do you think you would complain if you were in their shoes? Its
                          okay to complain if Singapore's present economic state is like
                          Malaysia, then they are not doing your job. Youth today and young
                          adults are so comfortable with life, they have the luxury of
                          sitting behind computers to criticize bout people who have made
                          their environment they are sitting in possible. Yes our government
                          is not infallible, but neither are many around the world. It is
                          easy to sit here and say oh build casino who dont know. But are you
                          recognizing the magnitude and impact of such a move? Have you done
                          a thorough socio-economic analysis on the repurcussions? Have you
                          asked yourself about the purpose and number of jobs created? What
                          about the problem of gambling addicts? What is the optimal size of
                          the casinos and what rules need to be in place to maintain the
                          social fabric? You think the above are questions solvable by a chat
                          over coffee?</p>

              <p>You just don't get it, don't you? Going into a country's leadership is NOT A CAREER. It's just like a nonprofit organization, where its purpose is for a higher calling. The same goes for leaders of a nation. It's a calling for a higher purpose. If you can't even understand that, don't come here and give us stupid arguments.</p>
              <p>In addition, your standards of writing and arguments are very poor, lacking in terms of direction, objectives and clarity of thought, which shows you are probably worth less than half of that US$40k you attempted to insult me with. Sad. I won't pay more than $2k a month for a person like you who cannot write properly and justify your arguments properly, and are completely blind to the other side of perspective.</p>
              <p>So you are saying that we should not have market rates, and that people are free to name their price no matter how high that be? You realize that you are now making yourself look even more stupid by declaring that the standards of economics are all bulls**t, since market rates and competition is what drives the progress of people, organizations and nations. Don't tell me that our population is limited and we have no choice. OUTSOURCE. You just ignore those points you cannot address. OUTSOURCE our govt and bring in the New Zealanders, who are proven more ABLE, AND CHEAPER than our govt in running a country. After all, our Temasek is now run by a foreigner isn't it?</p>
              <p>And kindly not insult those who see the true nature of our politicians. We are questioning their pay NOT because we are jealous of their pay, but because we are the SHAREHOLDERS of this country, and we PAY for their services. I pay my taxes (and probably I pay much more than you), so I have every right to ask for accountability. So stop your stupid and rude remarks to people who DARE to question, unlike you.</p>
              <p>What is so great about the idea of building a casino, seriously? You just try to make an ant out of a molehill, and insult fellow citizens who have better ideas than those leaders up there (though our leaders would censure us for suggesting pro-citizen ideas, ideas that will even benefit silly people like you). Before you ask us to reflect, I think the person to reflect is you, you better think carefully whether you are nothing but just a product of the govt propaganda.</p>

              <p>Should you would prefer a scenario whereby only 5 people come forth to heed your 'higher calling' to undertake the role of governance? Is that your definition of democracy and something you believe would make Singapore succeed? Outsource politics? That must be the biggest joke a hear. Politics is like your army; you dont get others to do it for you!Temasek is afterall still strictly a corporate enterprise and different from the government itself. Can you trust a foreigner to make decisions in YOUR favour when you are insinuating that your OWN people ruling you are failing to do it?</p>
              <p>And I thought you said politics should be a noble undertaking then where is there a need to say that its cheaper to employ new-zealanders? You are merely lowering the wage to attract the new-zealanders. There is no way you can divorce the lure of money from any occupation for that matter. Call it what you want, whatever charity you think the government out to be. Get a reality check. We are doing what we are doing for a living. And charity does NOT give you food on your table. Everyone is in it for the money, whether you wanna recognize it, or whether you like it or not.</p>
              <p>Im not saying there shouldnt be a market rate but your definition of market rate is wrong to begin with. If the market equilibrium for government wages is at $2 milllion in Singapore then so be it. Are you going to make a big fuss out of a McDonald's meal costing 7 swiss francs in Switzerlands but SGD7 in SIngapore? The theory here is precisely the same. Different markets have different conditions and that accounts for the price discrepencies. Difference in prices is not a result of INEQUILIBRIUM. The reason why we have a field day comparing our politicians wages with other countries' is because people do not understand this simple logic. That is not the way you should be comparing.</p>
              <p>And once again you missed the point that they are not the one NAMING THE PRICE. I repeated myself in my argument so many times that Im sick of it alreadyy. Jobs attract workers not the other way round for god's sake. People do not sit there and decide their pay. The pay decides if they sit there or not.You offer your employment but it is up to the employer whether to hire you or not.</p>
              <p>You said Im narrow and product of propaganda but look at yourself. You are absorbed in the idea of a 'higher calling' and a 'noble cause' that you have lost sense of reality. Life as a politician is still a career whether you wanna treat it as one or not. Choosing to be a politician incurs opportunity costs in the form of giving up your alternative careers. Thus it is pertinent for a post in a government to be enticing enough for you to give up your alternative. Isnt this just simple logic?</p>

              <p>Im not saying there shouldnt be a market rate but your
              definition of market rate is wrong to begin with. If the market
              equilibrium for government wages is at $2 milllion in Singapore
              then so be it. Are you going to make a big fuss out of a McDonald's
              meal costing 7 swiss francs in Switzerlands but SGD7 in SIngapore?
              The theory here is precisely the same. Different markets have
              different conditions and that accounts for the price discrepencies.
              Difference in prices is not a result of INEQUILIBRIUM. The reason
              why we have a field day comparing our politicians wages with other
              countries' is because people do not understand this simple logic.
              That is not the way you should be comparing.</p>
              <p>And once again you missed the point that they are not the one

              round for god's sake. People do not sit there and decide their pay.
              The pay decides if they sit there or not.You offer your employment
              but it is up to the employer whether to hire you or not.</p>
              <p>You said Im narrow and product of propaganda but look at
              yourself. You are absorbed in the idea of a 'higher calling' and a
              'noble cause' that you have lost sense of reality. Life as a
              politician is still a career whether you wanna treat it as one or
              not. Choosing to be a politician incurs opportunity costs in the
              form of giving up your alternative careers. Thus it is pertinent

              <p>Why not? After all, our govt brings in lots of "Foreign Talents" who make decisions for Singapore employees on a daily basis, why is it any different on their level? So for yourself and us fellow citizens, you practise 1 standard, but for the leaders, they are special so they must not be judged on the same standards? How's that for double standards?</p>
              <p>FYI, I was talking politics on YOUR sad level. Since you talk about it as a career, and liken it to a JOB (these are your own words, don't try to hide from it), then why not bring in even better talent that are at extremely affordable rates? They are PROVEN (ABLE in your words again) to be better than our leaders, and they cost MUCH LESSER. Businesses forever are always looking for the best deal. So I don't see why we cannot outsource our leadership jobs to foreigners?</p>
              <p>Call it whatever you want, you just don't seem to get it. Temasek and the Govt are the same. You yourself said so. Govt is a JOB, Temasek is also a JOB, so they are the same. Stop kidding yourself and falling over your own claims</p>

              <p>Hello, you are changing your stance again.This is quoted from you</p>
              <p><em>"I <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">cannot emphasize more about the flaw of comparing the so
                                      called 'market rate' </span></strong>with what our politicians are drawing. Its not
                                      about whether higher pay ensures risk taking or not or whether our
                                      politicians have been accountable to us. Its simple logic of demand
                                      and supply. When supply of politician low, price high. Simple.
                                      There are no tricks no foul-play whatsoever."</em></p>
              <p>Now you are stepping over yourself to say there should be a market rate? SO having a market rate is no longer a flaw?</p>
              <p>Ok, let's discuss on your new stance then, lest you start accusing us for catching your loopholes. What market equilibrium is there? There is no market here. It's just a monopoly, and we all know that when Singtel monopolized the market, we paid 3-4x the price of the same phone in this new competitive market. Please, don't kid yourself, there is no market here.</p>
              <p>Charlize just informed you there is no market rate. They just happily peg their pay to the private sector.</p>
              <p>The reason why you lost all your bearings is because you do not understand the true nature required for a nation's leadership, and keep insisting that this has to be treated as a career. You are just poisoned by the current propaganda sung by MM Lee, who insisted that ideals (no one did mention to you that these ideals were ideals that he identified with when he was much younger) on leadership is not realistic, and that we must pay them crazy amounts of $$$ in order to have realistic leadership.</p>
              <p>Go read about his past, when he sacrificed to bring Singapore to what it is today. He was a leader then, he's now no longer a leader, coz all he cares about now is for himself.</p>

              <p>Bill Gates devotion is called social obligation as a result of wealth accumulated over many years. If he was a chartitable saint he would not have spent the first huge part of his life building Microsoft and sitting on the pinnacle of the earning tree as the world's richest man. You have just used a wrong example. Volunteer work is noble. I do my fair share of community service too. Go ahead and doubt about my intentions and mindset when Im doing it it doesnt really bother me. But volunteer work is not your job. First is job. When you take care of yourself you do volunteer work. Do you see beggars doing voluntary work?</p>
              <p>Okay fine you wanna talk about pegging. But do not forget under a demand and supply mechanism even a minimum wage is affect by demand and supply movements. Demand drives the wage higher than the minimum wage dictates.A minimum wage just installs a duo mechanism but it does not alter the basic movements of demand and supply. Singtel is Singtel, labour market is labour market. Dont lump the two as one cause they are not the same. In the earlier days Singtel as a monopoly is a case of natural monopoly. A labour market monopoly is just ludicrious.</p>
              <p>Yes both a job in Temasek and the Government are both jobs. But as with all jobs, there are different job requirements and expectations. In a corporate environment, your objective is just one: profits. When you hold a government post, it is necessary for you to make decisions that benefit your people, your own country, something that someone not born and raise here cannot do. Yes the foreigners may come cheaper, but the money safe doesnt warrant putting our lives and our future in the hands of foreigners. How dense can you get to even make such a suggestion. Why establish the SAF? Cause we need to defend ourselves. And now you are suggesting we let foreigners get involved in our politics and possibly control our national defence?</p>

              <p>Go read about his past, when he sacrificed to bring Singapore to
                                      what it is today. He was a leader then, he's now no longer a
                                      leader, coz all he cares about now is for himself.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Dont be so naive to assume he did not foresee the wealth he would get if Singapore would succeed and honestly if you ask me, I dont think there is anything wrong with it. I dont think there is anything wrong with being motivated by money. As long as you get things done, so be it. Its not as if when the government earn less money, you get a tax break or such. Your taxes remain the same. Perhaps it could be better spend on other things you say but then thats another issue altogether about what kind of 'spending' is good. Then we can have another tirade about their exhorbitant expenditures.</p>
              <p>To me you have a very naive opinion about leaders and rulers.To you they must be heeding a noble calling and not think about money and all. Just ask yourself, is it important to debate about all this or care more about whether they get the job done?</p>
              <p>You just keep saying that Im poisoned, Im a produce of propaganda, I lack the ability to question. How about just saying that I agree with what MM Lee says cause it makes sense? He has been a great leader for us because of his economic foresight. As much as you disagree with him, his line if reasoning runs along economic lines, that leaders need to be paid to be enticed to serve. Being versed with economies is also why Obama defeated McCain. Economic reasoning may seem ruthless and heartless and not 'noble' at times. But it makes things work. It puts the right incentives in place to motivate people to produce the right results in a bid to get it. What matters is whether our politicians are doing their job and whether our live is peaceful and good, not whether their pay is atrocious.</p>

              <p>You know speakup</p>
              <p>And you still do not understand what Bill Gates is doing. It's NOT social obligation. It tells me how myopic your views are. It's his calling to put his wealth into good use for the benefit of mankind, NOT because he thinks he's obliged to, but because he believes in what he is doing. Please don't insult Bill Gates, like how you insult all of us. Just coz you don't have a gracious spirit doesn't mean others cannot have a higher calling.</p>
              <p>There is nothing wrong with what I am comparing. You say there is no such thing as higher calling. I merely tell you that there are volunteers who believe in higher calling. I did not compare them to whether it is a job or not. Again, you are losing your bearings.</p>
              <p>Anyway, I am too lazy to address your other views coz you just go round and round the same old poisoned thoughts. Not to mention you can't even answer why you think a govt with a focus on higher calling will fail. You just conveniently hide and delude yourself</p>
              <p>What makes you think that it must be that one makes sense, and the other perspective does not make sense? It could be that both perspective make sense, just that again, you are poisoned with the "0" or "1" extreme views that MM Lee has. "It's either you vote for PAP, or Singapore will collapse"</p>
              <p>You can continue, but you still cannot give a good reason why you think their pay is acceptable. You cannot even give examples of mindblowing ideas that our leaders have implemented that justifies how good they are.</p>
              <p>Again, you are nothing but a product of propaganda, because you can't even say why you think they are good, except that MM Lee tells you so. They got the job done? Tell us which part?</p>
              <p>And between paying $2,000,000.00 and $400,000.00 (market rate) to get the same amount of work done, I will choose the latter. Why? Coz the 1,600,000.00 can be better used to help the lower income group.</p>

              <p>How about you tell everyone here how it would work since you brought it up. I did not say that its bound to doom, im just saying basing a system of governance or any type of organisation on altruism is highly unreliable. Your system may work, but my money lies in the current one and you gotta pay me good odds to change that choice. Just because I base my reasoning on sound economic logic which happens to concur with MM's, you say Im poisoned. I suscribe to economics which is a very practical and pragmatic school of thought. Like I say it may not be as noble as what you like, but you cant deny what the forces of economics and the recognition of market incentives have done for our economy. My reasoning is punctuated with economics which probably you dont suscribe to or dont understand so you choose to ignore but I believe my trust is not misplaced and that my reasoning is perfectly sensical with a clear direction unlike what you suggested.</p>

              <p>So you believe that revolutionary ideas are what justify good governance? Do not forget that in this day and age, politics and progress are more stable than what it was before. You wanna see revolutionary change go to Africa. The leader who can lift them out of poverty would be revolutionary. In developed nations such as our own, what is important is not mindblowing changes. It simple things like security and peace. How would you feel if you were ousted from your current job and planted in the midst of a war with Iraq. Or how would you like to worry about your safety on the streets once night fell? There are things in other parts of the world not conspicuous to you that they are suffering for and we are insulated from. I wouldnt say i travelled a lot but i have been to Japan, Korea, Australia and many of our neighbouring ASEAN countries. Maybe its because where i take to be home, or because of my sense of rootedness. However nowhere I have visited so far give me the sense of safety and the standard of cleanliness Singapore gave me. Particularly for living environments and safety, our neighbouring countries are nowhere near what we get. Children living on the streets, scavenging the rubbish heaps, dark alleys where you see the poor congregating. These are sad sights, something that we do not see here and many cannot appreciate our fortune. Even for the US, racial bias is still deeply entrenched in their society, the streets are not safe, not even schools as evident from the shootings are stuff. This are the things that truly matter. Would it matter to you whether the government is earning $2 million a year when you even have to worry about whether your parents can come back safely from work everyday? Its cliche, but it really is the little things that make a world of difference.</p>
