              <p>Ok, I stop poking fun at you.</p>
              <p>Sometimes, the simple question is not a simple question, your
              question</p>
              <p>"Public and private, which gets more pay, on average" is not
              easy to answer, coz you are making it too general.</p>
              <p>First of all, a starting job in the public sector mostly can be
              higher than the private sector.</p>
              <p>Overtime, the private sector pay may catch up coz increments
              <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">can</span></strong> be larger
              depending on company performance. For example, in this horrible
              crisis, public sector pay should be better than private sector pay
              right now.</p>
              <p>Basically, if you want a stable job, go to public for its stable
              increments and job security, but private offers more risks and
              benefits as well.</p>
              <p>So like I said, there's no sacrifice of one over the other.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>i think in terms of starting, private is not that far behind, if you take into account bonuses.</p>
              <p>public sectors bonus is usually quite standard, 1 month, at best 2.</p>
              <p>for private, some bankers and engineers get up to 9 month bonus. at worse, it could be 0, but that should be quite extreme. if you mixed it up, starting about the same, long run private wins.</p>

              <p>It really depends</p>
              <p>Don't forget you have Mandarins in public sector, that can earn up to $30,000 in their mid 30s.</p>
              <p>Basically, if you talk about bankers and top engineers, then you should compare these top people to the Mandarins (the equivalent top talents of the public sector)</p>
              <p>And for bankers, there is a huge portion that is also variable (based on the business they can bring in).</p>
              <p>Compartively, the stress in private can also be much higher. Bankers' performance are reviewed quarterly, and they may be ask to go if they do not bring in enough. Their job is only safe for 3 months interval.</p>
              <p>In my job, I must consistently justify the need for my team to be around. The private is consistently looking for ways to cut costs.</p>

MySingaporeNews.<br>Apr 3, 2009<br><br>As the economic crisis worsens and thousands are being retrenched, the huge salaries of Singapore's political leaders have come under the spotlight not only here - but overseas.<br><br>With G20 leaders gathering in London to work out solutions to the global crisis, the Times compiled a list of "the 10 best-paid politicians in the world" - naturally with Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong taking the top spot.<br><br>The story was picked up by The Australia, which also works out their salaries when ranked against population.<br><br>Mr Lee earns S$3.76 million (US$2.47 million) a year, excluding bonuses, allowances, pensions, etc which add on a significant bit.<br><br>This is about 54 cents per head of population. In second position was his counterpart from New Zealand at 9 cents. The rest of the world are all down there, below even the lowest-ranking minister in Singapore.<br><br>But Singaporean blogger redbean's "My Singapore News" carries a calculation from its reader, Green Peas, expanding on the UK and Australian reports.<br><br>It pointed out that the world's 30 best-paid politicians (a definition that will include ministers, elected president, etc) are all from Singapore.<br><br>Here's what the blogger says:<br>The TOP 30 highest paid politicians in the world are all from Singapore:<br><br>1.

              <p>Simply put, once you start earning, you will find that you have many responsibilities, it gets worse when you have a family. And then every year, they come to you and demand income taxes from you. And not to mention, they raise the GST to make your burdens get worse.</p>
              <p>There will come a time when you question why you are paying taxes, whether the taxes are being put to good use. And then you see reports of them rewarding themselves with our money, and of course, you will start to get frustrated.</p>
              <p>Like I said, you will only start to comprehend when you experience being squeezed by taxes. When you realized that compared to them, you are earning peanuts, and you are taxed endlessly, and then they self-reward themselves with such exhorbidant amts...</p>

              <p>As our MM said, we need good quality and able people with good paids to sustain our country growth. Our paid is transparent to all, because we knows that thru corruption, we can much much more than this..but we are not.</p>
