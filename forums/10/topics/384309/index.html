              <p>During a speech made last night at the 40th anniversary of the Harvard Club, Law Minister Mr K Shanmugam said that the presence of foreigners here, far from taking jobs away from locals, helps to generate more jobs for Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>Due to the ruling party’s liberal immigration policies, the number of foreigners in Singapore has increased by more than 100,000 a year in recent years.</p>
              <p>According to Home Affairs Minister Wong Kan Seng, there are more than 90,000 PRs and 20,000 new citizens in 2008 alone. Two out of every three PR applicants are successful.</p>
              <p>Foreigners now make up 36 per cent of the population, up from 14 per cent in 1990.</p>
              <p>Despite rising discomfort and resentment on the ground at the rising number of foreigners which leads to direct competition for limited jobs, school places and opportunities, the ruling party is adamant that foreigners are essential for Singapore’s growth.</p>
              <p>Mr Shanmugam made an open plea to Singaporeans to understand that the need for foreign talent comes against the backdrop of a global ‘war for talent’ by citing a YaleGlobal Online article published in The Straits Times yesterday on how India and China are wooing their talented nationals back from the United States.</p>
              <p><em>‘To succeed, we need to get investments into Singapore, encourage local entrepreneurship, become a sophisticated service centre and ensure safety, security and stability. Achieving this, in turn, requires a government that thinks long term, a talented population and collective effort between the people and the Government to implement these policies,” </em>he said.</p>
              <p>While Singaporeans understand the need for a small country like Singapore without any natural resources of its own to rely heavily on foreign talent, what they don’t understand is some foreigners who are competing with them for mid-level or lower income jobs are considered as “talents” as well.</p>
              <p><strong>The Straits Times reported last week of a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Singapore PR and Chinese national Liu Gui Ling </span>who was jailed for nine weeks <span style="text-decoration: underline;">for throwing two lighted match</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">sticks at her lover’s fish farm</span>. She works as a cleaner.</strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Another PR</span>, Song Jing was fined $1,000 <span style="text-decoration: underline;">for stalking</span> a Singapore man who once patronized her for “special services”. Her occupation is a masseue.</strong></p>
              <p>How these non-English speaking foreigners who are not really considered as “talents” can become Singapore PRs is anybody’s guess.</p>
              <p>Mr Shanmugam reassured Singaporeans that the government will ensure the system is not abused’, and that Singaporeans continue to benefit from the country’s progress, a point reiterated frequently by senior cabinet ministers as the next general election approaches.</p>
              <p>Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew urged Singaporeans to bear with the “tide” of foreigners lately which has since become a “flood”.</p>
              <p>At this rate the ruling party is mass importing foreigners from elsewhere to become new citizens, native Singaporeans will soon find themselves in the minority.</p>
              <p>Not that they care much anyway since new citizens are usually pro-government and thereby will ensure their continued political hegemony for many years to come.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>There's a difference between <strong>FOREIGN TALENT AND FOREIGN WORKERS</strong>.</p>
              <p>1. Every foriegn talent won over by us means more jobs for our citizens. Talents mean people who can solve a company's problems, increase productivity and profits. Otherwise they  wont be called talents.</p>
              <p>With increased profits and capabilities, companies will be able to expand, thereby creating jobs for fellow citizens, mostly desirous of the mid management levels and work their way up, learning from such talents and taking over the jobs, if not this generation, would be the next.</p>
              <p>I would personally vote to have more talents, even hundreds of thousand of them, and give them citizenship if they pay allegiance to our flag, vow our pledge with honesty and improve our lives.</p>
              <p><strong>Better the foreign talent works together with us within our shores, than to work AGAINST US, from other shores.</strong></p>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p>2. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Foreign workers, such as E and S pass holders are another issue.</span> It would be understandable for citizens, who are educated to shun certain jobs in the employment market, and rightfully be held by such foreign workers. We do need road sweepers and construction workers for our massive infrastructure project.</p>
              <p>However, there must be a qouta in place, otherwise it may end up foreign workers by the millions flood our shores and take over jobs which could be held by citizens, as they would be willing to settle for lower pay.</p>
              <p>Employers would love such people, but it is <strong>not fair</strong> to citizens, espacially the older generation who had contributed weallth and children to our society. There is a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">social price</span> to be paid by employers for the stability that our country offers and that is to hire our workers by increasing their salaries if there is not enough supply to meet employment demand.</p>
              <p>Their economic theory of fighting competition by hiring cheap workers is flawed. It is the product that must be cheap and good that a company lasts. Labour costs is but only one factor, no doubt of a higher value,  in the final product output cost. A lack of foresight, strategies,etc ensures one to be fully dependent solely on cheap labour to compete.</p>
              <p>Many spit on china made products, reasons fully known. Consumers only end up paying more for replacements. More competitors mean more corners will be cut to make money, and ultimately destroys the market for similar product or service and waste crucial resources such as labour, space, and materials.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Singapore is only a small island</span> and there is <strong>NO</strong> way we can offer more space than the current avaliability without causing more social problems with the invasion of low value add foreign workers introduced by irresponsible employers.</p>
              <p>Cars were a problem in the past as more were buying cars, resulting in gridlocks at traffic points. ERP were then introduced to ease traffic flow. With human, what next, ERP gantries to ease HUMAN flow?</p>
              <p>MPs and govt understood this, but it is <strong>some cheapo EMPLOYERS who are socially irresponsible, hiding behind govts, crying to them that citizens shun their jobs, and at the same time blaming and pushing  the govt for increasing the foreign worker qoutas, when they are out of their biz suits.</strong></p>
              <p>Thus the grouse and problem lies with issue (2). This is the clear and present danger posed by irresponsible employers. Whomever can solve this issue with credible and pragmatic solutions gets my vote, guaranteed, regardless if ruling party or opposition.</p>
              <p>Just my contribution, for consideration, if anyone so wishes.</p>
              <p>.</p>

'I give them $140 a month for lodgings, they give me rubbish to eat,' he said.<br><br><a rel="lightbox" href="http://tnp.sg/mnt/media/image/launched/2009-06-08/NP_IMAGES_KCFREE-UY1.jpg"><img src="http://tnp.sg/mnt/media/image/launched/2009-06-08/NP_IMAGES_KCFREE-UY1.jpg" alt="" width="288" height="126"></a><br>FROM ALL WALKS OF LIFE: The lunchtime crowd attracts mainly foreign workers but others also turn up for the free food. TNP PICTURES: KELVIN CHNG<br><br>It is lunchtime on a Thursday at the soup kitchen in Singapore Buddhist Lodge, which gives out free vegetarian meals and Mr Huang is relishing his meal.<br><br>'Here, I can choose. (At the hostel), I can't even recognise what they put in the soup,' he said, in Mandarin.<br><br>Ever since the recession hit - and thanks to publicity from previous newspaper reports - the Lodge has become a much busier place, said its president, Mr Lee Bock Guan, 64.<br><br>From 1,100 hungry people on weekdays, it now has close to 1,600 to feed. Weekends see a surge from 4,000 to 6,000.<br><br>Many are foreign workers like Mr Huang.<br><br>As it is, the Lodge at the quiet Kim Yam Road, near River Valley Road, already spends $7 million a year on its various charitable endeavours.<br><br><a rel="lightbox" href="http://tnp.sg/mnt/media/image/launched/2009-06-08/NP_IMAGES_KCFREE-HFE.jpg"><img src="http://tnp.sg/mnt/media/image/launched/2009-06-08/NP_IMAGES_KCFREE-HFE.jpg" alt="" width="288" height="202"></a><br>FREE: The Lodge does not allow anyone to pack and take away the free food but looks like the herbal tea is too good to resist.<br><br>But its popularity with workers has also incurred the wrath of hawkers.<br><br>'A lot of them call and scold us, saying we affect their business. One woman was very fierce,' he said.<br><br>But he is quick to point out that it is not only the poor who eat here. It also attracts devotees, the rich and the curious.<br><br>Mr Lee has no problems with people who do not donate after eating, even if they are well-to-do.<br><br>It is the rude, unappreciative and ungrateful that upset him. 'Some even want to choose what rice to eat - some say they only eat AAA rice,' he said.<br><br>One wasteful visitor took a plateful of fruits, ate half, and threw away the rest.<br><br>Such wastage angers Mr Lee because he knows of donors, such as older folk, who take public transport from afar just to donate a bag of rice to the Lodge.<br><br><img src="http://tnp.sg/mnt/media/image/launched/2009-06-08/NP_IMAGES_KCFREE-3IL.jpg" alt=""><br>A man enjoys the vegetarian food provided.<br><br>But he also has heartwarming stories.<br><br>He has seen former frequent visitors climb out of poverty and start donating after becoming businessmen or restaurant owners.<br><br>Even the recent newspaper report of a mysterious donor who gives $40,000 to $50,000 every month is not unusual.<br><br>The biggest sum they have ever received is a cheque for $5 million.<br><br>He also often receives lawyer letters from people bequeathing property to them.<br><br>But some of those who enjoy the free food don't seem to understand the sacrifices others make so they can have a meal.<br><br>Source: <a rel="nofollow" href="http://tnp.sg/news/story/0,4136,204477,00.html?"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #417e15;">http://tnp.sg/news/story/0,4136,204477,00.html?</span></span></a></div>

              than 90,000 PRs and 20,000 new citizens in 2008 alone. Two out of
              every three PR applicants are successful.</p>
              <p>Foreigners now make up 36 per cent of the population, up from 14
              per cent in 1990.</p>
              <p>Despite rising discomfort and resentment on the ground at the
              rising number of foreigners which leads to direct competition for
              limited jobs, school places and opportunities, the ruling party is
              adamant that foreigners are essential for Singapore’s growth.</p>
              <p>Mr Shanmugam made an open plea to Singaporeans to understand
              that the need for foreign talent comes against the backdrop of a
              global ‘war for talent’ by citing a YaleGlobal Online article
              published in The Straits Times yesterday on how India and China are
              wooing their talented nationals back from the United States.</p>
              <p><em>‘To succeed, we need to get investments into Singapore,
              encourage local entrepreneurship, become a sophisticated service
              centre and ensure safety, security and stability. Achieving this,
              in turn, requires a government that thinks long term, a talented
              population and collective effort between the people and the
              Government to implement these policies,”</em> he said.</p>
              <p>While Singaporeans understand the need for a small country like
              Singapore without any natural resources of its own to rely heavily
              on foreign talent, what they don’t understand is some foreigners
              who are competing with them for mid-level or lower income jobs are
              considered as “talents” as well.</p>
              <p><strong>The Straits Times reported last week of a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Singapore PR and Chinese national Liu
              Gui Ling</span> who was jailed for nine weeks <span style="text-decoration: underline;">for throwing two lighted match</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">sticks at her lover’s
              fish farm</span>. She works as a cleaner.</strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Another
              PR</span>, Song Jing was fined $1,000 <span style="text-decoration: underline;">for stalking</span> a Singapore man
              who once patronized her for “special services”. Her occupation is a
              masseue.</strong></p>
              <p>How these non-English speaking foreigners who are not really
              considered as “talents” can become Singapore PRs is anybody’s
              guess.</p>
              <p>Mr Shanmugam reassured Singaporeans that the government will
              ensure the system is not abused’, and that Singaporeans continue to
              benefit from the country’s progress, a point reiterated frequently
              by senior cabinet ministers as the next general election
              approaches.</p>
              <p>Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew urged Singaporeans to bear with the
              “tide” of foreigners lately which has since become a “flood”.</p>
              <p>At this rate the ruling party is mass importing foreigners from
              elsewhere to become new citizens, native Singaporeans will soon
              find themselves in the minority.</p>
              <p>Not that they care much anyway since new citizens are usually
              pro-government and thereby will ensure their continued political
              hegemony for many years to come.</p>

              <p>Shanmugam should tell the parliament to open cabinet minister positions to FT. Much cheaper, faster and better than current ministers.</p>

              <p>There can be denial of doubts the benefits of foreign talents and foreign workers can bring. It is the balance that is the issue.

              <p>Rather than rant and rave here, eveyone can help. Solutions are needed. My perception is to increase the salary ceiling for supervisory to mid-management to help majority of our educated citizens, for jobs that can be and should be filled by citizens, leaving the lowest salary possible to the foreigners for unskilled jobs, to work in stacked up factories, reducing land space. These people are dime a dozen in asia. Let them fight for jobs here.</p>
              <p>With increase salaries, our citizens will be able to support SMEs and service entreprenuers set up by the lower educated, circulating money within our economy. I would admit there may be better ways by others that I may not know of yet. Thus a need to find solutions.</p>
              <p>Please appeal to your MPs NOW, to strike the balance before it is too late.</p>

              <p>Your points may be valid, but there is a distinct difference between the foreigner and US, as much as the generalization of my fellow citizens you portrayed.</p>
              <p>I grew up with them, schooled with them, shared a warm cup of coffee in rainy jungles of foreign lands with them in defence training of our homeland, chase beers over EPL with them, and I know them well.</p>
              <p>What you think of the foreign guy capable of, so too my fellow citizens if not better, infact 95% of them which are currently employed.</p>
              <p>Thus my fellow citizens should be given a chance at employment over the foreigner, who is only a mercenary, here only because of opportunity, at a salary considered heavenly back in his failed state.</p>
              <p>If there is only 1 piece of bread left, I will share it with my fellow citizen, not the foreigner, for I owe it to him. It was his forefathers who created Singapore what it is today, the schools, the infrastructures, the social welfare, etc. Without such, I would not have the opportunities i have today. My debt is to my fellow members of our society. </p>
              <p>Without our roots and a place we call home where our forefathers lived, broke their backs for us,  and where we can feel secure for our next generations to come, we would only be mercenaries. This is the bond we citizens share, and our common future we seek together. Break this bond and trouble will loom.</p>
              <p>Employers best know this fact. Either we rise together as one or in the end, if our dependence on foreign labour is heavy at the expense of our fellow citizens, we will ultimately sink as one.</p>
              <p>Better the labour intensive companies close down, or shift elsewhere and leave room for more higher value add capbable companies come and offer better opportunities for all. </p>

              <p>how can a group of skilled citizens being fed by govt and family takes on a global economy comparing to a group of skill foreigners who had been thru padi field and rubbish life and will fight for every bit of a bread to share for??</p>
              <p>Like it or not, I would said, "Singaporeans are overly pampered, and they dun move their butts but expect something to move inorder to change their condition" Personally, when i employ a skill singaporeans, he dun works long, he will job hop here and there, trying to get the best working condition and the fastest way of going up the corporate ladder, most got nothing to loose, because the family dun really need his income, unlike a foreigner, he got a reason to prove his coming here, he has a duty to perform, and he knows he cannot fail, because there is no safety net behind him, no one is helping him, only he can helps himself, he will takes on whatever pays and works given to him.</p>

              <p>Yes, it is my family business, but that does not mean I talk shit mah...and i am no silver spoon kid, I had been the poorest Singaporean and taiwanese in my childhood days, a broken family with lots of stormy weather before we get into these position, that is why i am street smarter than most of the young gals in singapore, matured faster and able to understand what is life, at time even better than some oldies.</p>
