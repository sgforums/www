              <p>how can a group of skilled citizens being fed by govt and family takes on a global economy comparing to a group of skill foreigners who had been thru padi field and rubbish life and will fight for every bit of a bread to share for??</p>
              <p>Like it or not, I would said, "Singaporeans are overly pampered, and they dun move their butts but expect something to move inorder to change their condition" Personally, when i employ a skill singaporeans, he dun works long, he will job hop here and there, trying to get the best working condition and the fastest way of going up the corporate ladder, most got nothing to loose, because the family dun really need his income, unlike a foreigner, he got a reason to prove his coming here, he has a duty to perform, and he knows he cannot fail, because there is no safety net behind him, no one is helping him, only he can helps himself, he will takes on whatever pays and works given to him.</p>
              </div>
              <p> </p>
              <p> I agree with you that most gen-Y singaporeans are job hoppers. But instead of criticizing the emerging trend which you dun have power over it, bosses in today's world should be putting more effort in talent retention IMO. But that's difficult to achieve because even the govt could not solve the problem of talent  leaving for greener pastures.  You cant really blame singaporeans for job hopping. Every individual has his/her own aspirations. If they find that the current job does not satisfy his/her needs, he/she will leave the current company and join the one which can satisfy them more. The same goes to foreigners. They come to singapore because they wanted a better life. Why dont they remain loyal to their jobs in their countries? </p>

              <p><br>I think to be fair to people, it is not that Singaporeans are not fighting for a job, it is the paid wise issue. As an employer, i definitely would like to lower my wage cost, and if a foreigner and Singaporean come for an interview for a particular with the same qualification and working experiences but when come to resume expectation, the foreigner put $1000 and the Singaporean put it $3000, who do you think i will employ.</p>
              <p>As i would had love to employ the local, my fellow singaporeans, they are know to be the best worker under BERI survey, better quality, more productive and good leadership. But if I would to ask him to lower his expectation to $1500, he will just walk out.</p>
              <p>So Your Brutal Truth must also carry some substance in it, we have to look at various issues before we really can pinpoint why our local labour competitive edge is losing ground. First, they demand higher remuneration, because of high cost of living, second, they are more older than foreigner and third, they are more arguemental than a foreigner, which usually displease their superiors.</p>

              <p>Simply put, the real issue lies with opening our floodgates too wide.</p>
              <p>If USA opened their doors 110% to the Chinese,and allow every Chinese from every province and city to enter their country, this immediately puts a downward pressure on every American's salary.</p>
              <p>Have you seen the govt doing that?</p>
              <p>That's why I said that, if I were to take away that choice for you (by not allowing you to choose a foreigner), doesn't that make life easier for you?</p>
              <p>As I said, in every system, foreigners should be welcomed. They should either be those that performs jobs that the locals do not want to do, or at the very top where there is a gap in talent. Other than that, locals should be hired first and foremost.</p>
              <p>In Singapore, it doesn't happen...</p>

              <p>Like it or not, I would said, "Singaporeans are overly pampered, and they dun move their butts but expect something to move inorder to change their condition" Personally, when i employ a skill singaporeans, he dun works long, he will job hop here and there, trying to get the best working condition and the fastest way of going up the corporate ladder, most got nothing to loose, because the family dun really need his income, unlike a foreigner, he got a reason to prove his coming here, he has a duty to perform, and he knows he cannot fail, because there is no safety net behind him, no one is helping him, only he can helps himself, he will takes on whatever pays and works given to him.</p>

              <p><br>You are asking for loyalty to a company when you are also not loyal to your worker. You will not hesitate to replace workers with cheaper ones. So how can you ask for loyalty, when you yourself cannot offer any?</p>
              <p>2nd, your statement that "Singaporeans are overly pampered, and they don't move their butts but expect something to move in order to change their condition", and the statement "he will job hop here and there, try to get the best working condition..." are in conflict with one another.</p>
              <p>Job hopping requires adapting to a new environment, new expectations, and therefore I don't think you would consider that as "not moving their butts" and being "overly pampered"</p>

              <p><br>I think to be fair to people, it is not that Singaporeans are not fighting for a job, it is the paid wise issue. As an employer, i definitely would like to lower my wage cost, and if a foreigner and Singaporean come for an interview for a particular with the same qualification and working experiences but when come to resume expectation, the foreigner put $1000 and the Singaporean put it $3000, who do you think i will employ.</p>
              <p>As i would had love to employ the local, my fellow singaporeans, they are know to be the best worker under BERI survey, better quality, more productive and good leadership. But if I would to ask him to lower his expectation to $1500, he will just walk out.</p>
              <p>So Your Brutal Truth must also carry some substance in it, we have to look at various issues before we really can pinpoint why our local labour competitive edge is losing ground. First, they demand higher remuneration, because of high cost of living, second, they are more older than foreigner and third, they are more arguemental than a foreigner, which usually displease their superiors.</p>

              <p>Nothing. That cheap foreigner came from a country that had failed him, which is why he is begging on our shores. He would sell his soul at any price to get a job, because he needs to survive. But our society owed him nothing.</p>

              <p>You see the problem you are raising just on labour issue alone?

              <p>For once, I just would like to comment, it's the same issue I have with angel7030 as you do.</p>
              <p>Foreign labour (NOT foreign talent) come here just for a duration of time, to drain us of our resources, and then remit everything back home. They spend very little in Singapore in a bid to save all the $$$ to bring home.</p>
              <p>How many times have I heard of an Indian from India keeping as much $$$ as possible in order to bring it back to his motherland?</p>
              <p>That employers like angel7030 should not be given a choice to choose cheap labour, coz its natural that a business will look for the lowest cost. Rarely do they consider other aspects of employing a person.</p>
              <p>But then again, angel7030 is not a singaporean, so this probably doesn't concern him or her.</p>

              <p>I'd at best partially agree with you, cos u've over-generalised a lot. I dun know you well enough but I gather that you are in the F&amp;B services industry and based things on your specific experience. In my previous life, when I was fresh out of uni and working for an MNC, I've hired and fired service staff as well and can empathise with the employers' difficulties. It is true that the temptation is always there to hire a foreigner (if one can get round the foreign pass issue then). Its amazing what wonders relative pay disparity does for a foreign worker's desire and motivation to work hard.</p>
              <p>Some years ago, it was the pay differential between S'poreans and M'sians. Nowadays the gap between what PRC nationals get in China is even greater.</p>
              <p>But I feel that peering through rose tinted glasses at this development is dangerous and misses a lot of pertinent points.</p>
              <p>Yes, there are Singaporeans who dun work hard (or as hard) and have expectations that are unrealistic but there are also those who could match the foreigners in endeavour and attitude at the same pay! The services industry tends to have a high turnover rate in general but to say that only Singaporeans job hop is fallacious.</p>
              <p>I'd caution you to think your foreign employees have any loyalties to you. Many of them treat a couple of years working experience here in Singapore as a mere item on their CV so that they can go back to China to claim they've worked in a developed country. They will quit on you once they've found that higher paying job elsewhere or that comparable thing back home. Hotels in Singapore have faced incredible levels of staff desertions to the IRs - that's lateral job hops and horizontal poaching for you.</p>
              <p>I've seen even worse mercenary traits among the more highly skilled &amp; educated foreigners, such as the masters and PhD holders. If they can be attracted to Singapore for the jobs and pay, what makes you think they won't leave S'pore at the drop of a hat when another country (or their home country) offers better prospects?</p>
              <p>Hell, if you and your family can take root here to take advantage of the great conditions here for your business, who is to say that you won't take flight and go back to Taiwan tomorrow?</p>
              <p>I always say this, when there is war - who are the ones who will stay and fight?  I always say that it is only when the bullets start whistling and the bombs start going off that you will see who are the ones who head straight to the airport or ferry terminal. I hasten to add that I quite despise those who claim to have the ready answers. Ppl, let's not  even try to say that if your family is here, u'd surely stay and fight. Cos your family may well be the reason that prompts you to wanna pack the family away and leave.</p>
              <p>xtreyier is right with his impassioned post you know. Singaporeans have a stronger reason than most foreigners to stay, not a certainty mind, juz a higher propensity. Us men sacrificed 2.5 yrs of our youth to give S'pore the security to base its prosperity on. So that people like yourself can enjoy it. Increasingly the question is being asked, what is the difference between PRs and Singaporeans. Beyond some GST rebates, NS allowances and housing preferences please.</p>
              <p>I've been away from Singapore a few years but when I came back recently the change has been amazing. I did not remember the MRT trains being so packed 3-5 yrs ago. I did not remember there being so many PRC nationals in the hawker centres and services industries.</p>
              <p>There is a cautionary tale in what has happened in the UK with overly lax/liberal immigration policies too fast too soon.</p>
              <p>During the Tony Blair yrs, the UK decided on a wave of unprecedented immigration. The rationale was the exact same developed country syndrome that prompted Singapore to do the same - low birth rates, locals perceived as unwilling to work or work hard, jobs that locals purportedly did not want to take, need to lower labour costs, need to boost population numbers to compensate for emigration outgoings (brain drain).</p>
              <p>So many low skilled immigrants came from all over Europe in light of liberal EU travel  and free movement of labour laws (no visas required etc), especially the east europeans (Polish especially) that the UK has serious integration problems - racial tensions, crime, social unrest etc. The Polish are quite hated, especially since they do not bother to integrate with the British society - they do not speak or learn English, they stick to their Polish enclaves and communities, they set up their Polish shops, restaurants, print their own Polish newspapers, dun socialise with Brits, have bad manners, can match the worst of the Brits in alcohol and drug addictions, introduced their own Polish mafia etc. The Polish bus drivers who suddenly commandeer most buses are rude, cannot speak to passengers nor answer any questions. The Polish commercial truck and lorry drivers cannot read English road signs nor ask for directions, so they always get lost.</p>
              <p>Sounds familiar? The UK has since reversed the immigration policies drastically.</p>
              <p>We celebrate all holidays and respect diverse cultures well enough as our own to integrate foreigners better than most countries. We have strict criminal laws to regulate citizens and foreigners alike. We have 4 national languages, so the foreigners seem to be able to speak at least one of them.</p>
              <p>We won't have situations like in the UK where East Europeans deliberately migrate to the UK to find the first woman to rape and brutalise on the street so that they can get a life sentence in UK prisons. There they get their own TV set and DVD player, plus free meals everyday without work - much cosier than starvation and unemployment in Poland for instance.</p>
              <p>It was a mismanagement of epic proportions which wouldn't happen to Singapore but nevertheless still a timely reminder to beware.</p>

              <div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Preternatural.stuff:</div>
              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>I'd at best partially agree with you, cos u've over-generalised a lot. I dun know you well enough but I gather that you are in the F&amp;B services industry and based things on your specific experience. In my previous life, when I was fresh out of uni and working for an MNC, I've hired and fired service staff as well and can empathise with the employers' difficulties. It is true that the temptation is always there to hire a foreigner (if one can get round the foreign pass issue then). Its amazing what wonders relative pay disparity does for a foreign worker's desire and motivation to work hard.</p>
              <p>Some years ago, it was the pay differential between S'poreans and M'sians. Nowadays the gap between what PRC nationals get in China is even greater.</p>
              <p>But I feel that peering through rose tinted glasses at this development is dangerous and misses a lot of pertinent points.</p>
              <p>Yes, there are Singaporeans who dun work hard (or as hard) and have expectations that are unrealistic but there are also those who could match the foreigners in endeavour and attitude at the same pay! The services industry tends to have a high turnover rate in general but to say that only Singaporeans job hop is fallacious.</p>
              <p>I'd caution you to think your foreign employees have any loyalties to you. Many of them treat a couple of years working experience here in Singapore as a mere item on their CV so that they can go back to China to claim they've worked in a developed country. They will quit on you once they've found that higher paying job elsewhere or that comparable thing back home. Hotels in Singapore have faced incredible levels of staff desertions to the IRs - that's lateral job hops and horizontal poaching for you.</p>
              <p>I've seen even worse mercenary traits among the more highly skilled &amp; educated foreigners, such as the masters and PhD holders. If they can be attracted to Singapore for the jobs and pay, what makes you think they won't leave S'pore at the drop of a hat when another country (or their home country) offers better prospects?</p>
              <p>Hell, if you and your family can take root here to take advantage of the great conditions here for your business, who is to say that you won't take flight and go back to Taiwan tomorrow?</p>
              <p>I always say this, when there is war - who are the ones who will stay and fight?  I always say that it is only when the bullets start whistling and the bombs start going off that you will see who are the ones who head straight to the airport or ferry terminal. I hasten to add that I quite despise those who claim to have the ready answers. Ppl, let's not even try to say that if your family is here, u'd surely stay and fight. Cos your family may well be the reason that prompts you to wanna pack the family away and leave.</p>
              <p>xtreyier is right with his impassioned post you know. Singaporeans have a stronger reason than most foreigners to stay, not a certainty mind, juz a higher propensity. Us men sacrificed 2.5 yrs of our youth to give S'pore the security to base its prosperity on. So that people like yourself can enjoy it. Increasingly the question is being asked, what is the difference between PRs and Singaporeans. Beyond some GST rebates, NS allowances and housing preferences please.</p>
              <p>I've been away from Singapore a few years but when I came back recently the change has been amazing. I did not remember the MRT trains being so packed 3-5 yrs ago. I did not remember there being so many PRC nationals in the hawker centres and services industries.</p>
              <p>There is a cautionary tale in what has happened in the UK with overly lax/liberal immigration policies too fast too soon.</p>
              <p>During the Tony Blair yrs, the UK decided on a wave of unprecedented immigration. The rationale was the exact same developed country syndrome that prompted Singapore to do the same - low birth rates, locals perceived as unwilling to work or work hard, jobs that locals purportedly did not want to take, need to lower labour costs, need to boost population numbers to compensate for emigration outgoings (brain drain).</p>
              <p>So many low skilled immigrants came from all over Europe in light of liberal EU travel and free movement of labour laws (no visas required etc), especially the east europeans (Polish especially) that the UK has serious integration problems - racial tensions, crime, social unrest etc. The Polish are quite hated, especially since they do not bother to integrate with the British society - they do not speak or learn English, they stick to their Polish enclaves and communities, they set up their Polish shops, restaurants, print their own Polish newspapers, dun socialise with Brits, have bad manners, can match the worst of the Brits in alcohol and drug addictions, introduced their own Polish mafia etc. The Polish bus drivers who suddenly commandeer most buses are rude, cannot speak to passengers nor answer any questions. The Polish commercial truck and lorry drivers cannot read English road signs nor ask for directions, so they always get lost.</p>
              <p>Sounds familiar? The UK has since reversed the immigration policies drastically.</p>
              <p>We celebrate all holidays and respect diverse cultures well enough as our own to integrate foreigners better than most countries. We have strict criminal laws to regulate citizens and foreigners alike. We have 4 national languages, so the foreigners seem to be able to speak at least one of them.</p>
              <p>We won't have situations like in the UK where East Europeans deliberately migrate to the UK to find the first woman to rape and brutalise on the street so that they can get a life sentence in UK prisons. There they get their own TV set and DVD player, plus free meals everyday without work - much cosier than starvation and unemployment in Poland for instance.</p>
              <p>It was a mismanagement of epic proportions which wouldn't happen to Singapore but nevertheless still a timely reminder to beware.</p>

              <p>With no doubts, some foreigners are taking this pad as a stepping stones, but as an employer, we need to reward the those who are good, even if he step out and move on to work in other or his own country, to me, we had helped the world in training someone, same goes to UK, Aussie and other western matured economy, they had training so many Asians and even the world, so to speak, from unskill to skill, from managers to entrepreneurs, from technician to Engineers, because they understand that for the world to move on, we must be selfish, we must move on together, today, we may train and nurture a PRC gal working as a bartender in one of my pub, a permit holder, i sponsor her to study english and service skill courses at the migrant centre created by learning of NTUC, she is ambitious, she already told me, she is going for Shatec diploma and hope end up be a PR of Singapore and remain a citizen of China, thereby giving her more opportunities to from both side. As a boss, i would had stop sponsoring here or even dun care about here, permit end, send back, but my Dad enlighted me. We give for the better of the world tomorrow, when he was doing his study in Australia, he worked as a partime waiter, and people there taught him how to serve and all, tho they knew that he is only temporary, they still taught him, and now he opens pubs in Singapore, and doing wines business with the Aussies, because he know aussie well, he is connected there, and for those Aussies who taught him wine brand, taste and servicing standard,  in one way or the other, if you look at it, they are been paid now, as their decendents got jobs to do, and maybe a few of them is working with my Dad.</p>
              <p>That is one part that i love the western culture, they tends to give out their technology and skills so as to have a better living for all, unlike our oriental kind of thinking, abit selfish indeed, even how cook a nice prawn noodle also dun wan to teach completely to his most loyal disciple.</p>
              <p>Coming back to the PRC gal, if one day, she become successful in China, opens pub like we do here, and when customers in her pub is coming to visit Singapore, she may recommend our pubs to them, and that is where we gained.</p>
              <p>Just like many Singaporeans asked me why we need to give so much scholarships to foreigners, especially the Chinese and Indian from china and india?? the reason is the same as above, whether they are loyal to us or not, or whether they are going to be citizens here or not, is not an issue, but govt hope that in near future, those singapoeans studying with them and become bosses or MD or CEO, met their counterpart in China or India turns out to be their old classmate, that will be pay day time. And also, being trained here, Foreigners returning to their homeland to seek better future will have think of Singapore and we hope that they think of doing business with Singapore. Just like a Singaporeans going overseas to work, train and study, they will have a feeling for that particular for the rest of their life, and you clearly also have that in mind.</p>
