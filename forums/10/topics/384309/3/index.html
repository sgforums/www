              <p>With no doubts, some foreigners are taking this pad as a stepping stones, but as an employer, we need to reward the those who are good, even if he step out and move on to work in other or his own country, to me, we had helped the world in training someone, same goes to UK, Aussie and other western matured economy, they had training so many Asians and even the world, so to speak, from unskill to skill, from managers to entrepreneurs, from technician to Engineers, because they understand that for the world to move on, we must be selfish, we must move on together, today, we may train and nurture a PRC gal working as a bartender in one of my pub, a permit holder, i sponsor her to study english and service skill courses at the migrant centre created by learning of NTUC, she is ambitious, she already told me, she is going for Shatec diploma and hope end up be a PR of Singapore and remain a citizen of China, thereby giving her more opportunities to from both side. As a boss, i would had stop sponsoring here or even dun care about here, permit end, send back, but my Dad enlighted me. We give for the better of the world tomorrow, when he was doing his study in Australia, he worked as a partime waiter, and people there taught him how to serve and all, tho they knew that he is only temporary, they still taught him, and now he opens pubs in Singapore, and doing wines business with the Aussies, because he know aussie well, he is connected there, and for those Aussies who taught him wine brand, taste and servicing standard,  in one way or the other, if you look at it, they are been paid now, as their decendents got jobs to do, and maybe a few of them is working with my Dad.</p>

              <p>No wonder it will help "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">nurture a PRC gal working as a bartender in one of my pub</span></em>" and do all that is necessary, "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">thereby giving her more opportunities to from both side</span></em>" - with the truth hidden in the flesh trade that the Taiwanese 'hum' indulges in what it had claimed that "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">whatever it cannot sell at night, it sells in the day</span></em>"</p>

              <p>Only a dumb Taiwanese 'hum' will have anyone believing that anyone will "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">give out their technology and skills</span></em>" - when huge sums of money are spent to pay for the overseas training at the tertiary levels.</p>
              <p>If "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">our oriental kind of thinking</span></em>" is "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">abit selfish indeed, even how cook a nice prawn noodle also dun wan to teach completely to his most loyal disciple</span></em>" - is the Taiwanese 'hum' claiming itself to be from some Western cultured 'hum' that it claims to be generous ?</p>
              <p>If "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">our oriental kind of thinking</span></em>" is "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">abit selfish indeed,</span></em>" - why is there an "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">english and service skill courses at the migrant centre created by learning of NTUC</span></em>" ?</p>

              <p> What makes the Taiwanese 'hum' believe that the PRC gal will continue with the flesh trade in its own place of domicile ?</p>
              <p> Is it not surprising that the Taiwanese 'hum' will conduct its flesh trade in Singapore, and not in Taiwan ?</p>
              <p> Does anyone needs to be in the flesh trade disguised with a front image as a Bar - as practised by the Taiwanese 'hum' ?</p>

              <p>Just like many Singaporeans asked me why we need to give so much scholarships to foreigners, especially the Chinese and Indian from china and india?? the reason is the same as above, whether they are loyal to us or not, or whether they are going to be citizens here or not, is not an issue, but govt hope that in near future, those singapoeans studying with them and become bosses or MD or CEO, met their counterpart in China or India turns out to be their old classmate, that will be pay day time. And also, being trained here, Foreigners returning to their homeland to seek better future will have think of Singapore and we hope that they think of doing business with Singapore. Just like a Singaporeans going overseas to work, train and study, they will have a feeling for that particular for the rest of their life, and you clearly also have that in mind.</p>

              <p> Yes, "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">why we need to give so much scholarships to foreigners, especially the Chinese and Indian from china and india??</span></em>"</p>
              <p> Are we not supposed to be "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">oriental kind of thinking</span></em>" and is "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">abit selfish indeed, </span></em><em><span style="color: #0000ff;">even how cook a nice prawn noodle also dun wan to teach completely to his most loyal disciple ? </span></em>"</p>
              <p>It is obvious that the Taiwanese 'hum' will advocate that - "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">whether they are loyal to us or not, or whether they are going to be citizens here or not, is not an issue</span></em>" - as it has no intention to stay permanently in Singapore too.</p>
              <p>Its conduct to disrupt all the threads here as a clear sign to negate any criticism towards its PAPa as long as it can - as a form of gratuituous services to enable itself to perpetrate its illegal flesh trade under cover of a legitimate bar operation..</p>
              <p>The ultimate goal is to satisfy itself first with its daily orgasmic fix before retiring to sleep to prepare itself again for the next event as an "Attention Seeking Whore".</p>
