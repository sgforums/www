            <div class='col-md body'>I totally agree, no other troops in SAF has to undergo such a long training course like CE. I still keep my old notes which fill up 4 thick books for memory. Only people who sweat thru this course will know the hardship. The worse part is the final passing out exercise which you have to perform a series of CE task without any sleep for 5 days 4 nites. Worse still they deliberate select days that rain. I remember the first day of the exercise, my fellow platoon training mates has to manually construct a 2E+12 under heavy thunderstorm in mud shit condition within a given timeframe. At the end of the bridge construction, all just drop dead sleep in the mud.<br><br>I still remember the minimium of 12 standard chinup before any meal or carry 6 dummy landmines (each about 8kg!!!)  with U everywhere U go. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by silkmagic:</div><div class="quote_body">Combat Engineer are specialised soldiers whereby technology plays only a little role in its effectiveness.

            <div class='col-md body'>bigballs11 you really lead a charmed life in going through the three units (four if include SOCE), first being a beaver, then a polar bear after become an alligator and then an elephant. I thought that I have already gone for a lot of courses but you are really the man. But you get to enjoy life and know most aspects of the SCE.<br><br>Although I went to Plant Coy after my field engineer training, but I know how heavy the MGB can be as we tend to give a helping hand if required. Moreover a dozer is required to push the bridge across the gap and sometimes we have a certain situation whereby the dozer have to strain to push the bridge across or the dozer is actually lifted up by the weight of the bridge.<br><br>I understand how hard is it to work in the rain as the Plant Coy hates the rain because our vehicles tends to get bog down in the soft mud. Imagine the soil reaches your kneecap and you have to think of a way to get your vehicle out of the mud. Normally we will use a towing cable and use other vehicle to pull the vehicle out. Heh it is like being a mechanic except that you are carrying a rifle.<br><br>I can understand your feeling of doing pull up before every meal as we are still practicing it but we donÂ’t get to carry the mines everywhere we go as it is a stupid idea in the first place.<br><br>But the most thrilling and sian part is the activation drill. Being in a operational unit, we will have standby platoon who will be activated if there is an emergency. So in order to keep us alert, we will be activated at least once a week to check on our equipment. The thrill is that something may actually be happening so the suspense is there. But if it just a routine check whereby you have to lay out all your equipment and operate it then it is a yawnÂ…..Imagine that you have to keep all your equipment which may take a few hours under the hot sun. One time, we were activated because of fire in Stamford Tyres factory, which is near the camp. Boy, there was apprehension all round as we are combat engineer and not firemen!!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Once an engineer, always an engineer.</div>
