Ever seen a tree fly 4 stories into the sky?! or ever seen a succession of 12-14 trees blown sidesways, falling down together on the same side simultaneously to cerate an abbattis? or the hole left after a cratering charge has gone off! wah! the biggest damned hole i ever saw man! and the feeling of feeling the earth shake as you explode all the LFMs, Claymores, ADMS, Cratering charges and empty 2 magazines on auto into the target area from the hill top...better than sex man! haha<br><br>For all those who served, toiled, and bled, wept and bonded as engineers, advance and overcome!<br></div>
