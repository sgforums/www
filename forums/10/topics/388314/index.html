              <p>Monday, 11 January 2010, <em>The following is Part One of a special three-part focus on the Housing and Development Board’s public housing policies. Parts Two and Three will be published on Tuesday and Wednesday respectively. </em></p>
              </div>
              <p><strong>Leong Sze Hian</strong></p>
              <p><img class="alignleft" style="margin: 13px; float: left; border: black 3px solid;" src="http://i140.photobucket.com/albums/r19/theonlinecitizen/Pictures%20Posted%20on%20TOC/Housing/300px-Yishun-SG.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="220">I attended the HDB’s Resale Seminar which was attended by over one hundred persons.</p>
              <p>Judging from the 75 minutes Q &amp; A, during the 3 hour 45 minute seminar, and mingling with the crowd during the break, I estimate that about 80 per cent  of the attendees were permanent residents (PRs).</p>
              <p>Many questions centred on when PRs could sell or rent out their flats, and when they can repatriate profits from the sale of their HDB flats, when they leave Singapore.</p>
              <p>To what extent has HDB policies led to undesirable outcomes for Singaporeans, relative to PRs?</p>
              <p><strong>Minimum Occupation Period (MOP)</strong></p>
              <p>A PR can sell his or her resale HDB flat after just 1 year’s MOP.</p>
              <p>A Singaporean who buys a resale flat with a bank loan, can also sell after just 1 year.</p>
              <p>However, many Singaporeans buy new flats, or resale flats with a CPF Housing Grant, which have a MOP of 5 years.</p>
              <p>For resale flats with a HDB loan, the MOP is 2.5 years.</p>
              <p>The increasing “headache” for some Singaporeans may be that they cannot afford the Cash-Over-Valuation (COV) on a resale flat.</p>
              <p>Since foreigners do not need to contribute to CPF, they generally may have more cash to pay for the COV, when they become PRs.</p>
              <p>As to new flats, since a typical Build-To-Order (BTO) is about 3 years, plus another 5 years MOP, it may be about 8 years before a Singaporean can sell his or her flat.</p>
              <p>What if you can’t service your mortgage before your MOP?</p>
              <p>What if you need to be divorced without children before your MOP?</p>
              <p>Let me use an analogy. You want to invest in a property and also need a house to stay.A property developer offers you a private property at a discount of 20 per cent, using its unique “market subsidy pricing” policy, but it will take 3 years to build, and you cannot sell it for the next 5 years.</p>
              <p>Another developer offers you a similar property that you can stay in immediately (and save on your rental for 3 years), and allows you to sell anytime.</p>
              <p>Which property would you buy?</p>
              <p>I think the developer with the “subsidy” may hardly get any customers at all.</p>
              <p>But, many Singaporeans are fixated with the notion that a new flat is sold with a “discount”.</p>
              <p>Imagine you had applied for a new BTO flat in 1990 and saw your flat appreciate greatly in value until the last peak in 1996, and then declined in price by as much as 40% for the next 13 years.</p>
              <p>Your headache may be that you couldn’t sell when the price was high, because of the MOP.</p>
              <p>Will PRs ever have this “headache”? No, because they can’t buy new flats. A blessing in disguise perhaps – no need to wait, can buy immediately and sell after just 1 year.</p>
              <p><strong>Resale Levy</strong></p>
              <p>When a Singaporean buys a second new flat, the resale levy has to be paid, based on the first flat type sold earlier.</p>
              <p>For those who may be financially stretched, who can’t afford to pay the Resale Levy, they will have to purchase a resale flat instead.</p>
              <p>Do PRs have this “headache”? No.$</p>
              <p>In fact, when they become citizens, they can buy their second flat, which is considered as their first subsidised flat, with a 1st-timer grant as well.</p>
              <p><strong>HDB Concessionary Loan</strong></p>
              <p>When a Singaporean buys a second flat, he can only get a second HDB loan if the flat purchased is a bigger one.</p>
              <p>This may entice him to buy a bigger flat than he can afford.</p>
              <p>PRs don’t have this “headache”.</p>
              <p>When they become citizens, they can buy their second flat of any size and get a HDB loan.</p>
              <p>Since bank loans are typically lower than the HDB loan’s 2.6 per cent interest for the first  3 years of the housing loan, a PR who becomes a citizen within say 3 years, may actually pay a lower interest than HDB’s in the first 3 years, and then convert to a HDB loan when they become citizens, say before the 4th year.</p>
              <p><strong>Income Ceiling</strong></p>
              <p>Singaporeans are subject to the $2,000 and $3,000 Income Ceiling for the purchase of new 2-room and 3-room flats. This may in a sense “force” Singaporeans to buy a bigger flat than they can afford.</p>
              <p>For example, if your household income is $3,001, you must buy a 4-room or bigger flat, as you have exceeded the 3-room Income Ceiling.</p>
              <p>Why is it that the Income Ceiling is $8,000, instead of $3,000, for 3-room flats in mature estates like the recent Queenstown (Dawson) where the prices of flats are very high?</p>
              <p>Since the lower the household income, the higher is the Additional CPF Housing grant, Singaporeans may be tempted to buy a flat before they can really afford it.</p>
              <p>For example, a household with monthly income not exceeding $1,500 gets the highest grant. But, how many households earning less than $1,500 can really afford to buy, and run the risk of default over the next 30 years?</p>
              <p>So, to buy earlier so as not to cross the Income Ceiling and get a higher grant may be a “headache”, if you can’t pay in the future.</p>
              <p>Buy later when you can afford, but risk crossing the Income Ceiling, and be “forced” to buy a bigger flat, also a “headache”.</p>
              <p>PRs don’t have this “headache”. They just buy any size resale flat that they can afford. Even if a PR earns $1 million, he can buy a 2-room resale flat as there is no Income Ceiling for resale.</p>
              <p><strong>CPF Housing Grants</strong></p>
              <p>Some Singaporeans also perceive that it is better to get a CPF Housing Grant. But you may have noticed in recent years that every time the grant is increased, the prices of new flats increase by even more.</p>
              <p>So, is an increase in a grant that is less than the increase in the price, really a benefit?</p>
              <p><strong>Renting Out Rooms</strong></p>
              <p>PRs may generally have smaller families as they may not have their parents in Singapore, or not have children yet.</p>
              <p>So, some may rent out rooms immediately after they buy a flat. [PRs can rent out rooms immediately but not for the entire flat.]</p>
              <p>Some foreigners may also be accustomed to sharing a flat before they become PRs.</p>
              <p>So, they may be able to pay higher prices for resale HDB flats, because they plan to rent out the rooms for income.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans, on the other hand, generally buy flats to stay without the intention to rent out rooms immediately, as they may generally have larger families of parents and children.</p>
              <p>I think most Singaporeans see a HDB flat as their home for life, and not as a temporary investment, providing income as well as saving on housing costs whilst in Singapore.</p>
              <p>How can our housing policy allow PRs who own private property to buy a HDB resale flat and   rent out the rooms immediately, as long as they stay in their HDB flat as well?</p>
              <p>Are these some of the possible contributing factors to why HDB resale prices are skyrocketing?</p>
              <p>In this connection, HDB resale prices rose about 8 per cent last year, compared to only about 2 per cent for private property.</p>
              <p>Why is it that two PR siblings of any age can buy a resale flat, whereas two Singaporean siblings must be either orphans or age 35 and above before they can do so?</p>
              <p><strong>Review HDB Policies</strong></p>
              <p>HDB policies could be reviewed, with a focus on the undesirable outcomes for Singaporeans, and at the same time vis-a-vis PRs.</p>
              <p>Policies should not be maintained for reasons of solving a problem – like PRs need housing too, IR foreign workers need housing too, etc.</p>
              <p>Policies should also not be maintained for reasons of avoiding a problem – such as if new flats are priced lower on a cost-plus basis, the property market will crash and HDB resale prices will not grow.</p>
              <p>This reasoning is in my view fundamentally flawed, as even if new flats’ prices are gradually reduced on a cost-plus basis, it will be about 8 years (3 years BTO plus 5 years MOP) before they can be sold in the open market.</p>
              <p>So, it may not cause resale prices to drop.</p>
              <p>Instead, it may help to moderate the current skyrocketing prices which may be an increasingly unsustainable asset bubble.</p>
