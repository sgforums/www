Yet there is another saying that one should not knock one's head on the wall.<br><br>So when one is in politics it is better to go with the tide, or else one will be swept away. So politics is a game of survival the fittest, so politicians must not speak too much to hurt protocol or one's own career advances.<br><br>Knowing that it is immoral to write one's own pay cheque, yet they must say "pay me more and I will avoid corruption". "Pay me more I will avoid selling state secrets".<br><br>Actually it is not just immoral but illegal to write one's own pay cheque differently from the salaries stated in one's letter of appointment without any votes by the board or legal sanction as any audit firms will tell you or under the penal code under any pretext especially those in special positions of trust whether it is to retain talents or prevent one's own corruption.<br><br>Judiciary should know the general law has prohibited taking monies from any shareholders or trusts in this manner but so far it is not commenting on such practices of taking monies.<br><br>Citizens will be left wondering why there were two sets of law one the general laws and one for the politicians. Obviously the managers or CEOs in the private companies would be jailed for taking monies due to conflict of interest or for wrongful conduct by those in fiduciary position or trust.</div>

So politics is a game of survival the fittest, so politicians must not speak too much to hurt protocol or one's own career advances.<br></strong></blockquote>Their behavior is very much similar to many managers I have seen in my career.<br><br>They protect themselves and are most willing to sacrifice their subordinates to the sharks just to protect their own skin.<br><br>A good manager (the ones that protect their subordinates, and willing to speak up if they find something wrong with the company), usually will end up finishing last.<br><br>The truth is, few people TRULY can take criticism. Most of them enjoy hearing good words and good comments and enjoy others sucking up to them.<br><br>Thus, if being a good manager has no good result, then why be good manager? Just be bad manager.</div>
