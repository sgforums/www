They even have a SG domain name...check out www.rafale.com.sg<br><br>They have been sending real flying Rafales to Singapore since Asian Aerospace 1996, and flying displays since AA98, the consortium only send 2 wooden 1:1 scale models in 2000 and 2002.<br><br>As for merits of Rafale vs Typhoon, this has been debated in the Singapore at War thread, starting from Page 42 onwards.

So in the next decade or so, we should see F-5, F16 and the next gen to replace all the skyhawks. That doesn't mean that skyhawks won't be used as trainers or even some sort of UCAV. The F-16s were initially bought to replace the Hunters, but as the Vipers were really good at both air-to-air and strike roles, plus the sudden afforability of the latest Block 50s, it became logical that the Vipers are going to become the most numerous aircraft like the Skyhawks were in the 70s to 90s. Given that the present 3 types of frontline planes are F5, Vipers and Skyhawks; as the Viper number increases, the Skyhawk decreases. Essentially, the new next gen fighters that RSAF will be purchasing will almost be a 1 to 1 replacement of Skyhawks (at present active sqn figures). eg. 40 planes.<br><br>When JSF becomes common and affortable, then we should see the F-35 replacing the F5. Depending on the timeframe, the F16 then becomes the oldest of the 3 types of plane and they will slowly be "cycled out"  just like the Skyhawks are today. Basically, RSAF purchasing strategy clearly outlined in the book "Defending the Lion City".<br><br>As to the question about what should replace S211,  I don't think S211 will be replaced anytime soon since they are still relatively new and suitable for basic jet training. Supposedly RSAF becomes very well funded and decided on a new trainer, I would think that the front-running should either be Hawk 100 or Korean T50.<br></div>
