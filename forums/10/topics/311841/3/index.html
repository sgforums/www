              <p>Questions we should be asking:</p>
              <p>a) Is the source of our unhappiness structural or internal?</p>
              <p>b) Are Singaporeans depressed because of the oppressive and uncaring policies implemented by the PAP or simply a state of mind?</p>
              <p>By the way, 'unhappy' is a generic term and covers a broad spectrum of emotions ranging from 'aww... I am unhappy because mommy did not get me a pony for Christmas'</p>
              <p>to</p>
              <p>'I lost my job to a 'FT', now I can't pay the mortgage for my HDB flat and my wife just left me. I think I will go kill myself'.</p>
              <p>Instead of asking Singaporeans if they are 'happy', a more accurate question would be: Are Singaporeans throwing themselves in front of incoming trains because they live under an oppressive regime and see no possibility of change?</p>
              <p>'Happy'! Hah! Trust the PAP to trivialise the lives of Singaporeans with one word. They are truly the masters of disinfo!</p>

              <p>To the TS,</p>
              <p>allow me to comment.</p>
              <p>I think even if someone is generally happy living here does not mean they are happy with all the things. We must not be confused about being happy (eg. due to being rich) does not mean you as human being should ignore the plight of other humans. To do what is right and humane. To uphold justice.</p>
              <p>Being happy is circumstantial and individuals have different levels of EQ and life experiences to handle life.</p>
              <p>Even if one is happy, it does not mean letting INJUSTICE get away with DISHONESTY. I mean this in a general way , not accusing anyone specifically.</p>
              <p>Even if happy, one should put in effort to make things better:</p>
              <p>1. balance what needs to be balanced.</p>
              <p>2. demand excellence as the minimal requirement - no free lunch world.</p>
              <p>3. CEOs must perform or else get the f-off!  CEOs are not indispensable and like you and me, are employees getting money from a INC. No one owes CEOs a living. This has to be clear 1st and foremost. Else end of discussion.</p>
              <p>4. You want Honey$ you better show me the money$!</p>
              <p>5. Learn to lead by example and not double standards.</p>
              <p>6. Take up responsibility as democratic citizens, if we agree that democracy is what we want. Else, why have it?  </p>
              <p>7. Against communism , marcism, cronism and smuto'ism.</p>
              <p>8. We need to ensure the PRESS is neutral . Not that there is not one existing. This includes all writers and editors and interviewers and news reporters, radio DJs and columnists. This will be an eternal effort. Always need to ensure this is maintained if not someone is controlling your minds. Must not encourage the practise of providing 1 side of the story and not providing at all or providing a weak argument of the other side of the story, as long as one exist. Not that something like this has ever happened.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>9. Where there is proposition, there has to be an equally strong and competent opposition to ensure balance. This part I dare say it is lacking and yet feel safe in saying so. (must learn how to play this 'game' right ;)   ) </p>
