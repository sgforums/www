              <p>Case Study -</p>
              <p>When DPP in Taiwan came to power 8yrs ago... I cheered for then, newly elected President Chen <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="icon_question.gif"> I saw in him, a charming &amp; Charismatic leader who is out to bring more Democracy to Taiwan. Plus I support his idea to make Taiwan an Independent Country <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="icon_exclaim.gif"> KMT at that time, was largely thought of as the Old Corrupted Regime that was abusive of their power.</p>
              <p>Yet 8yrs later.... we see a 180deg change in voting back the KMT. For all the 'democracy' President Chen had promised..... It still got Taiwan nowhere nearer to be admitted into UN. Because of President Chen's position towards China.... their businessman find it hard to do business in the World's Hotest Market.</p>
              <p>But I would be the 1st to admit that one good outcome after the KMT's defeat 8yrs ago..... is that they now knows - the Old Fashion Way of Governing won't work now. <strong><em><span style="color: #ff0000;">Something all of us would agree that PAP better learn quickly or else</span></em></strong>.</p>
              <p>Poh Ah Pak.... I don't agree with your views that the system "Must Be Destory" or a certain person "Must Die"..... <strong>But I do believe in your RIGHTS to said it here <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/thumbs_up.png" alt="thumbs_up.png"></strong>. But I wouldn't want to risk 8 or even 4 years of my already limited life, in supporting CJS. For in him.... I see nothing good <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/thumbs_down.png" alt="thumbs_down.png">. Chaim or Low I would risk..... not ever Chee.</p>

              <p>Case Study -</p>
              <p>When DPP in Taiwan came to power 8yrs ago... I cheered for then, newly elected President Chen <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="icon_question.gif"> I saw in him, a charming &amp; Charismatic leader who is out to bring more Democracy to Taiwan. Plus I support his idea to make Taiwan an Independent Country <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="icon_exclaim.gif"> KMT at that time, was largely thought of as the Old Corrupted Regime that was abusive of their power.</p>
              <p>Yet 8yrs later.... we see a 180deg change in voting back the KMT. For all the 'democracy' President Chen had promised..... It still got Taiwan nowhere nearer to be admitted into UN. Because of President Chen's position towards China.... their businessman find it hard to do business in the World's Hotest Market.</p>
              <p>But I would be the 1st to admit that one good outcome after the KMT's defeat 8yrs ago..... is that they now knows - the Old Fashion Way of Governing won't work now. <strong><em><span style="color: #ff0000;">Something all of us would agree that PAP better learn quickly or else</span></em></strong>.</p>
              <p>Poh Ah Pak.... I don't agree with your views that the system "Must Be Destory" or a certain person "Must Die"..... <strong>But I do believe in your RIGHTS to said it here <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/thumbs_up.png" alt="thumbs_up.png"></strong>. But I wouldn't want to risk 8 or even 4 years of my already limited life, in supporting CJS. For in him.... I see nothing good <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/thumbs_down.png" alt="thumbs_down.png">. Chaim or Low I would risk..... not ever Chee.</p>

              <p>i think this so-called true or real opposition of singapore now remain faceless, nameless. for the simple reason that he/she has no place in singapore now, given the iron grip a few individual has on the political system. when LKY eventually pass on and LHL grip on power loosens, that is where i think the so-called uprising will happen. however, i think it will be a peaceful uprising.</p>
              <p>Chiam is already in poor health, I think Low is clueless in running beyond a constituency, and i, like you, will not bet on Dr Chee. From the opposition point of view, i think the best is yet to come.</p>
              <p>However, the is a real chance that PAP can reinvent itself, post-Lees. If so, there is a real hope for a smooth political evolution in Singapore. Nobody can predict the future, just as what we do not know what post-Lees PAP will become.</p>
              <p>If all we talk is about the opposition, we are only seeing one side of the coin. </p>
