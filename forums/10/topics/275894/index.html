Details of the borrowing are being finalised," the ministry said.<br><br>The project has been criticised as too expensive, particularly after its price tag ballooned from a reported RM1.1 billion at the time of its inception in 1999 to a level that has left the PKA deeply in debt.<br><br>In a breakdown of the free trade zoneÂ’s costs, the ministry said the PKA had bought the land from Kuala Dimensi Sdn Bhd at RM25 per sq ft, based on a valuation conducted by the Valuation and Property Services Department.<br>Kuala Dimensi, an "associate" of Wijaya Baru Global Bhd, had bought the undeveloped property in 1999 from a local co-operative for RM95 million or RM3 per sq ft.<br><br>The ministry said the PKAÂ’s purchase price was reached because of work done on the site, including land reclamation, drainage, construction of access roads, installation of street lights, water services and payment to various utility agencies.<br><br>"The repayment period to Kuala Dimensi is 15 years at an interest rate of 7.5 per cent and the land cost came up to RM1.807 billion."<br><br>It also explained that an initial plan to develop PKFZ in two phases had been merged into one on the advice of the then PKFZ operator, Jebel Ali Free Zone Authority (Jafza).<br><br>Jafza exited the management contract signed in October 2003 last month, citing "strategic" reasons.<br><br>Upon JafzaÂ’s recommendation, the development costs of PKFZ totalled RM1.845 billion, comprising four blocks of eight-storey leased office buildings, 512 light industrial units, three-storey free zone authority office, three-storey Customs office and checkpoint, 175,000 sq ft exhibition centre, a multi-storey car park, security building and ancillary buildings.<br><br>It also included infrastructure work such as landscaping and security fencing, the upgrading of roads leading to the PKFZ, construction of a 135-room business-class hotel, electrical works and construction of a 42km concrete trenching.<br><br>"Taking into account the land acquisition and development costs, as well as 7.5 per cent interest rate, 10 per cent professional fee and 20 per cent variation order, the entire development cost of PKFZ is RM4.632 billion."<br><br>It maintained that the PKFZ, which opened for business last November, was a viable national project to enhance Port Klang as a loading centre, stimulate the economy, create spin-off activities and provide jobs.<br></blockquote>--www.nst.com.my<br><img src="http://www.nst.com.my/Friday/Frontpage/20070824075632/insidepix1"><blockquote>The deserted Port Klang Free Zone (PKFZ) in Pulau Indah has racked up a RM4.632 billion bill, including development costs and interest payments.</blockquote><strong><a href="http://www.pkfz.com/" rel="nofollow">Port Klang Free Zone or PKFZ in Port Klang</a></strong><br><img src="http://www.pkfz.com/images/header-edit.jpg"></div>

Once an investigation has been made, I will meet other PAC members and get to the bottom of this," he said.<br><br>According to sources in the PAC, the parliamentary watchdogÂ’s upcoming meeting on the PKFZ controversy will focus on two questions: Whether the soft loan amounted to a government bailout and whether the pullout by the Jebel Ali Free Zone Authority (Jafza) has affected foreign investor confidence in Malaysia.<br><br>Jafza withdrew from a contract to manage the PKFZ last month.<br>The project first raised eyebrows when PKA bought the 405ha in Pulau Indah in 2002 for RM1.088 billion or RM25 per sq ft from Kuala Dimensi Sdn Bhd.<br><br>The land purchase was followed by RM1.845 billion in costs for the development of the free trade zone.<br><br>On Thursday, the Transport Ministry said the government had agreed to extend a loan of an unspecified amount to the heavily-indebted PKA to help cover the total cost of RM4.6 billion, including interest and other charges, for the PKFZ.<br><br>The ministry maintained that the PKFZ was a national project which would enhance Port Klang as a loading centre, stimulate the economy, create spin-off activities and provide jobs.<br></blockquote><img src="http://www.nst.com.my/Saturday/National/20070825075844/insidepix1"><br>Datuk Shahrir Samad says an investigation will be carried out</div>
