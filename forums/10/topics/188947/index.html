            <div class='col-md body'>Taken from <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Sg_Review/message/2382" rel="nofollow">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Sg_Review/message/2382</a><br><br>I refer to your report  "Mah to SDA: Want to build flats for me?" (May 2).<br><br>It has been rightly described that our private home prices are "obscene" while HDB flat prices are  "sky-high".  Indeed, the exorbitant cost for something as basic as a roof over our heads is a major factor behind our high cost of living.<br><br>Some 90% of Singaporeans (ranging from managers to low-salaried workers) are thus resigned to living in HDB flats.  Hence, they have every right to know whether HDB flats are priced with a true cash subsidy or a cleverly-disguised profit.<br><br>Over the past five years, various writers in newspaper forums have rightly questioned why a new  HDB 5-rm flat is priced upwards of $200,000 when its construction cost is around $50,000 (as revealed from actual HDB construction contracts).<br><br>As HDB flats are now built higher and closer together i.e. many units occupying a tiny plot of land, it is a lame argument for the HDB to say that the hugh difference of $150,000 is accounted for by land cost and other related costs.<br><br>The HDB's standard dodgy reply has been  that a so-called  "market subsidy" is provided for new HDB flats to make them "affordable" i.e. they are priced below their equivalent market value.<br><br>This is how the "market subsidy" pricing approach works.  The HDB will first look at the prevailing market value of a 5-rm resale flat (say, $260,000) and then  "pluck from the air" a slightly lower figure (say,$200,000) as the selling price of the 5-rm new flat --- never mind even if its total breakeven cost is probably around $120,000!<br><br>The HDB can then boast that the new flat buyer is getting a $60,000 "market subsidy" --- when there is actually no  "true cash subsidy" at all.<br>Instead, from the example given, the HDB is raking in a handsome profit of $80,000 for each new flat sold.<br><br>Indeed, this ingenious "market subsidy" approach had resulted in new flat prices and resale flat prices chasing each other in an upward spiral --- to the detriment of all buyers of both new and resale flats.<br><br>During this election, our educated thinking voters were not amused (much less impressed) by the never-ending nagging and nitpicking over an administrative form-filling issue.<br><br>Compared to this childish hullabaloo, how HDB flats are priced is certainly a larger national issue related to First-World transparent governance.<br><br>Mr Mah Bow Tan should thus seize this golden opportunity to demonstrate to our citizen-voters his ministerial mettle and justify his handsome remuneration in providing simple honest answers to these pertinent questions:<br><br>&gt;    Since HDB flats are supposed to be low-cost mass public housing, why is the HDB not helping our citizens in home ownership by passing on to them the cost-savings from economies of scale in massive HDB developments through pricing new flats on a cost-recovery breakeven no-profit basis?<br><br>&gt;    Are HDB new flats priced with a  "true cash subsidy"?<br>If the answer is No, say so directly and openly.<br>If the answer is Yes, convince the people with detailed numbers and indicate the amount of the true cash subsidy.</div>

May be ST special editor has withdrawn it. Now it is for Minister Mah to say whether HDB has made the $14 billion. If he keeps quiet that silence is consent.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually, there's another fear involved in reducing the price - the fact that the entire secondary market might collapse. Now *that* would have terrible consequences upon the popularity of the ruling party.</div>

On the other hand was he misleading the public when he claimed to be able to withold or delay estate lift upgrading (if ruling party candidate is not elected) from citizens who pay the same tax from the common fund of the government owned by all citizens in equal share.<br><br>Do residents of PP not have a right to know more about this infringement of their constitutional right?<br><br>So is GCT not behaving as dictator or "misleading the public"?<br><br>Is GCT able to confirm that Minister Mah is not misleading the public when telling people that HDB is subsidising the selling price of HDB flats when HDB itself actually revealed that its flat selling price is based on "% Income of 2 working adults and market value". There is no true subsidy at all as HDB is making monies as much as $14 billion over 12 years from 1990.<br><br>If GCT wants to accuse any one of misleading the public his own ministers should not be quilty of the same.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>to say 14 billion is an understament, don't forget HDB has to pay the "Land Authority" that's why sometimes they say HBD earn "not much" is a half truth statement. Assume a unit make $100K times that with 500K units. This will be much more than 14 billion. Most of Govt revenue comes from here, rather than from income tax or gst.</div>
