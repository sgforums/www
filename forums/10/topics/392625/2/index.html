              <p>I think the better solution is not to give empowerment to the employers. Because it is the local employers themselves, who at their discretion, are able to do whatever they like to the employees.</p>

              <p>Do you know employers can turn nasty and think fo how to dispose their employees one by one?</p>

              <p>The people who think they are intelligent are the ones ending up with nothing ya...learn to act blur abit, you will gain more from it. Just like our govt, the way they rule this place is like acting blur, they will alway question thing like "Oh! is it" "Oh, really!" "Oh no, i am sorry, i have no idea that this happen" "Very good, thanks that sweet lady for bringing up this question, we will look into it" etc etc..by acting blur, they evade alots of problems, and by and large, they, the govt, know us very well, they know singaporeans are septical to forget and forgo issue as time goes by, they also know that we are not cooperatives in a sense that they can manipulate us more individually, and lastly, they also know that we are bound to awards and glamours.</p>
