              <p>The people who think they are intelligent are the ones ending up with nothing ya...learn to act blur abit, you will gain more from it. Just like our govt, the way they rule this place is like acting blur, they will alway question thing like "Oh! is it" "Oh, really!" "Oh no, i am sorry, i have no idea that this happen" "Very good, thanks that sweet lady for bringing up this question, we will look into it" etc etc..by acting blur, they evade alots of problems, and by and large, they, the govt, know us very well, they know singaporeans are septical to forget and forgo issue as time goes by, they also know that we are not cooperatives in a sense that they can manipulate us more individually, and lastly, they also know that we are bound to awards and glamours.</p>

              <p><br>Of course my dear sister, they can be our guardian angels, but winthin my colleagues of angels, there are good and bad angels around. Taking Govt as our enemy give us an added advantage to be wary of them, taking them as good Guardian will end up paying more and more. As the laws of physical kindly prove to us, for any force, there must be a resistance, so far, we played the resistance role...and some resistance are good for the mechanism of movement. We need to instill that resistance mechanism into the govt, so that they know that they cannot play play with us hor</p>

              <p>"Oh Father," said a little Frog to the big one sitting by the side of a pool, "I have seen such a terrible monster! It was as big as a mountain, with horns on its head, and a long tail, and it had hoofs divided in two."</p>
              <p>"Tush, child, tush," said the old Frog, "that was only Farmer White's Ox. It isn't so big either; he may be a little bit taller than I, but I could easily make myself quite as broad; just you see." So he blew himself out, and blew himself out, and blew himself out. "Was he as big as that?" asked he.</p>
              <p>"Oh, much bigger than that," said the young Frog.</p>
              <p>Again the old one blew himself out, and asked the young one if the Ox was as big as that.</p>
              <p>"Bigger, father, bigger," was the reply.</p>
              <p>So the Frog took a deep breath, and blew and blew and blew, and swelled and swelled and swelled. And then he said: "I'm sure the Ox is not as big asBut at this moment he burst.</p>

              <h1> </h1>
              <h1>Lim Swee Say to Low Thia Kiang: We are deaf to all these
              criticism</h1>
              <div>
              <div>
              <p><span>March 4, 2010</span></p>
              <p>After being embarrassed in Parliament by WP MP Low Thia
              Kiang’s demolition of the labor movement’s ineptitude to help lower
              wage workers in Singapore, one would expect Minister Lim Swee Say
              and NTUC Secretary-General to come up with a robust argument to
              counter him.</p>
              </div>
              </div>
              <p>Instead, he used an unheard fable about a “kingdom of frogs” to
              brush aside Mr Low’s criticisms.</p>
              <p><em>“The story goes that in a kingdom of frogs, the tallest
              tower in the world is built for an annual competition. And when the
              event is held, many aim to become the champion by making it to the
              top, but fail as they are discouraged by the audience, who warn
              that the climb is too dangerous. All except one frog who did reach
              the top. And when asked afterwards why he ignored the crowd, the
              frog said: ‘I’m deaf. I can’t hear them’”,</em> he said.</p>
              <p>The gist of Mr Lim’s message: Despite criticisms from Mr Low,
              the labour movement will continue to address problems faced by
              low-income Singaoreans.</p>
              <p><em>“We never give up. We are like the little frog. We are deaf
              to all these criticisms. So instead of telling us that low-wage
              workers are having problems, why not be part of the
              solution?,”</em> he was quoted as saying in the Straits Times.</p>
              <p>As expected, the Straits Times tried to portray Mr Lim as the
              “victim” and pinning the blame on Mr Low for criticizing without
              offering solutions.</p>
              <p>Being paid almost $2 million dollars a year, Mr Lim ought to
              realize that it is the duty of MPs to ask questions and criticize
              if necessary in Parliament as in all modern democracies in the
              world. If he cannot stand the heat in the kitchen, he should get
              out of it!</p>
              <p>The onus is on Mr Lim to answer the questions posed by Mr Low
              and not to counter-challenge him to be “part of the solution”. The
              key role of the opposition is to check on the ruling party and to
              hold it accountable for its words and actions and not to do offer
              solutions for it to govern the nation.</p>
              <p>If Mr Lim wants Mr Low to offer solutions, then he should be
              prepared to give Mr Low a job in NTUC or other government
              committees and pay him a salary commensurate with his services.</p>
              <p>Mr Lim also reminded Mr Low that “the government always paid
              special attention to low-income earners and had introduced
              programmes like Workfare to supplement their income”, but the fact
              remains that low wage Singaporeans are still struggling due to
              direct competition from cheaper foreign workers.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, Mr Low did offer a solution to scrap the foreign
              worker levy and to refine the dependency ratio to moderate the
              inflow of foreign workers.</p>
              <p>Mr Lim’s attitude epitomizes a wider problem pervading the
              entire PAP – the inability to listen to others and accept feedback
              and criticisms in good faith.</p>
              <p>As the recent parliamentary sessions had shown, the PAP MPs are
              completely out of touch with the ground. It will be apt to describe
              them as a “kingdom of frogs” living in their own wells.</p>
