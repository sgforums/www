The lights were vandalised recently but Mr Sitoh said he had to return the land to the Government, while the opposition MP said the are a where the lights are does not come under the jurisidction of his town council.<br><br>Said Mr Mah yesterday: "At this point in time, it is important for the elcted respresentatives, whether it is PAP or the opposition, to get on with the job of serviing their residents.<br><br>"The PAP MPs have already started work to draw up plans to fulfil the promises they made during the election. I think the opposition MPs should do likewise and stop playing games. "<br><br>Mr Mah was speaking after attending a National Day observance ceremony in the Botanic Gardens.<br><br>Mr Sitoh declined to repair the lights as he said the land's lease will run out on Oct 31.<br><br>Mr Chiam told Shin Min Daily News earlier this week he wanted to find out the terms of the lease agreement for the land, which he believed may include certain conditions like maintaining the lights.<br><br>However, the HDB has declined to reveal the terms of the lease, saying it is private information between the board and Potong Pasir Citizens' Consultative Committee, which Mr Sitoh advises.<br><br>Yesterday, Mr Mah accused Mr Chiam of "trying to divert attention from the real issue " .<br><br>"The main issue is this is a problem in the constituency.... the Member of Parliament should try to solve the problem as quickly and as efficiently as possible, " he said.<br><br>Mr Chiam is now seeking to lease the land to build a covered walkway for residents.<br><br>Meanwhile, Minister in the Prime Minister's Office, Mr Lim Boon Heng, told reporters at a separate event yesterday: "In Potong Pasir, you cannot have your cake and eat it. You've decided on Chiam See Tong, so he should solve your problems. You have rejected Sitoh, so don't expect him therefore to continue serving you.<br><br>"For all he has done, you have rejected him and you wanted Chiam See Tong. You've got a problem, then you go to Chiam See Tong."<br></blockquote></span><br><br><span style="color: darkred;">This must be unique in Singapore's political history, where a Ruling Party starts a problem in an opposition ward - and will not resolve the problem that it has created, and will use that problem to show up the supposed incompetency of the oppositon MP in resolving issues.<br><br>Now that Chiam See Tong has applied to the URA to lease the same piece of land to build a covered and lighted footpath - an improvement to the uncovered footpath built by the Ruling Party - will the Minister of National Development Mr Mah Bow Tan approve such an application from Mr Chiam; or will Mr Mah expect Mr Chiam to spend on the repairs of a failed PAP footpath project - (which even its own candidate will not spend money on) - before approving the application to build the proposed New Covered and Lighted Footpath ?<br><br>Here is a lesson for the newcomers to Singapore Politics on how the <span style="font-style: italic;">"Truth is distorted"</span>; and putting the word into action to the statement - <span style="font-style: italic;">"A Lie spoken often enough by Prominent Persons, can become the Truth"</span>.<br><br></span><br></div>

Mabok Tongue is again being used as the disgraceful fawning idiot who does what his masters tell him...<br><br>"petty politics" ?<br><br>all i see, even in the article in ST, shows that Chiam is just knuckling down to get the job done.. and the losing candidate showed that it was the ruling party that was involved in petty politics by refusing to fix the goddamned lights!<br><br>now Chiam is going to fix the thing... because his constitutency people asked him to.. and the thing needed fixing...<br><br>that's getting the job done..<br><br>times like these, show the people what is going on..<br><br>and if the people are too dense to see it, maybe it's not the lights that are broken around them.. it's just that they've also warped gravity and things around them are pretty dim...</div>

He refuses to disclose information concerning the agreement over the land lease between HDB and Sitoh so as to clear up any misunderstanding betweem the arrangement, then goes on a presumptious campaign against Chiam that to disclose such info is to invite cannon fodder for Chiam to take pot shots at the Ruling Party.<br><br>Deja Vu anyone? During elections 2006, SDA applied to HDB for the flat building costs after Mah Bow Tan threw down the gauntlet to SDA to build 'cheaper' flats. Ironically, he then deliberately blocked their attempts by instructing HDB to withhold the information. He then proceeded to lambast them for being naive and not doing their research, using terms as 'insincere' and gaining 'political mileage'.<br><br>Is our Mah Bow Tan changing his goalposts once too often after the originals are beaten?<br><br>Not only is he making a goof of himself, he's taken over Yeo Cheow Tong as the No. 1 dimwit of the Ruling Party.<br><br>His current weight-lending to the Potong Pasir incident smacks of sour grapes and brings to light his past failed campaign against Chiam. At this point, he's probably taking any advantage available to discredit Chiam.<br><br>And our local media is an excellent platform, having 'superfluously' published his comments in BOTH the ST and TODAY papers. </div></blockquote>Hey, don't see him no up.<br><br>He came up with the erm "Get Singapore into the World Cup soccer finals by 2010" target. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br></div>
