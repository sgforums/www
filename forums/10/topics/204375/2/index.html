With the more serious cases being reported in the papers, one can only imagine the number of under-reported cases pending abitration.<br><br>Such ridiculous arrangements, especially for new buyers, simply mean that HDB is taking any opportunity to throw the ills back at the resident, a <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>new-age govt trend</strong></span>, only considering serious cases which can be <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>proven</strong></span> that HDB slipped on quality issues.<br><br>Is it any wonder why the public's confidence in HDB's 'quality' have fallen significantly? With Mah at the helm, how many new 'ingenious' policies is he prepared to enact (as a typical govt scholar would) during his tenure before he is once against swiftly 'rotated' to a new portfolio within the govt?<br><br>As it is, this rotational policy is based on the pretext to expose govt scholars to newer challenges and 'fast track' them to greater things. Funny that no govt body has yet imposed the condition that the <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong><span style="color: darkblue;">challenge needs to be <span style="text-decoration: underline;">beaten</span> first</span></strong></span> before one can proceed to the next phase.<br><br>With questionable high pay and a somewhat aloof and ineffective style, surely it is perfectly fair to question whether Mah is serving the people or simply self-serving for his own career advancement.<br><br>And it seems he has suddenly decided to douse the fire in which he started? Being one of the first, alongside Lee Boon Yang and Seetoh Yih Pin, to openly criticize Chiam See Tong over his 'apparent failure' to address the superfluous solar lights, he has suddenly changed tact after Chiam responded calmly and venomously, rocking his boat and questioning his own integrity.<br><br>Suddenly, he prefers to continue this argument in parliament where he, with an army of white shirts behind him, will feel more at ease? Does he think that a parliament setting gives him more of an edge? That instead of Chiam vs Mah, it will favourably become Chiam vs the 'white T-shirt Gang'? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>It is more surprising that no one questioned why, in the first place, Seetoh Yih Pin would spend unnecessary money on a 'solar power' lighting system when a much cheaper one would have sufficed?<br><br>This is a clear example of how our taxpayer's money is extravagantly indulged by the white T-shirt gang. And how they continue to bully those who would question their motives.</div>
