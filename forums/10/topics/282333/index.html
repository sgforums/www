            <div class='col-md body'>Because they are united and work as one ? No !!! This is easy said than done for there are many sects and denomination within their religion. There are many disagreements among themselves too just like the disagreements dominating the many forums with many forumers flaming among themselves instead of sticking to the main issues and establishing common modus operandi.<br><br>There is a need to avoid too much individualism or petty differences of opinions.<br><br>Ever watch the show "Water Margin" or "Sui Hu Chuang". How did Song Juang succeed in rallying the many opinionated mountaineering rebels into a united force which finally helped to overthrow the corrupted regime. Cut out pettiness and concentrate on one common objective and one common physiological and physical togetherness of strategy which will attract all to stay cohesive and move in one big march or direction.<br><br>Mao Tse Tong has similarly been practical enough to employ the peaceful long march to achieve uniting his people to fight against the decadence and corruptions of the older regimes in his time.<br><br>The Monks' long march is not accidental. It has been a big well planned event which reminds us of what Gandi has done too in his days rallying the pre-independent Indians, against so much differences of petty opinions to achieve India's final independence.<br><br>The Monks are seen to have acted responsibly with self-discipline deliberately keeping to peaceful demonstration staying out of violence cumulating into a peaceful long march modus operandi capable of uniting people of all strata against potential differences of opinions to join in the movements with a clear physical direction from point A to B which closes all ranks and will endure into a big force eventually to cause the final change.</div>

For now we just have to grow or mature as a people. May be another Song Jiang will be thrown up by circumstances one day to unite and lead the diverse individualistic people.

            <div class='col-md body'>Major factor why the monks are so successful. They have influence. Buddhism is like a state religion in Burma, and they are highly revered.  Due to their influence through religion, they can be a political force to be reckoned with if not for the fact they usually stay out secular affairs.<br><br>This is not the first time the Burmese monks have taken to the streets in protest.   Unfortunately, they're faced against a rather hard handed opponent who has no qualms about imprisoning them.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Influential as monks may be outwardly but this in itself being social or cultural influence may not be enough yet to gather enough momentum and impact to cause change.<br><br>This is because they are up against a determined and ruthless and brutal dictatorship who were known to shoot down unarmed opponents by the thousands. The dictator has shown once again that it is prepared to shoot thousands again and the monks will have to weigh the heavy losses of human lives in its follow-up program.<br><br>The Monks will need a strategy which will work - peaceful nation-wide follow-through long purposeful peaceful march aimed at rallying large masses for change.<br><br>For a start peaceful long march seems to have worked as a trigger. Momentum will have to be built on a peaceful transition program of change with concrete demands including peaceful election put forward for change.<br><br>Ang San Suki will have to die a Martyr unless she is so supported by the masses.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I doubt there will be a second chance for this.<br><br>After what the monks have pulled off, they have to topple the military government.  Failure is not an option.<br><br>Should they fail, the military govt will sure to clamp down and restrict them to prevent similar situations from arising.  Regimes can change the laws to support their actions as and when they want.  IMO, the monks bought a one way ticket.</div>
