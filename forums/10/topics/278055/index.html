            <div class='col-md body'>i do admire his courage, but i wish he get himself elected into parliment first rather than creating attention that PAP is authoritarin the world already knew that no big secret.  Sporean is not that kind of voters to support if u r nail sticking out. I think Sporean voters are passive protester once he is in parliment everyone will continue to vote him to be remained in the parliment. Also he would do a lot more effective if he speak out from inside the House.<br><br>anyway that is just my thought.<br><br></div>

It's based very much on the legal theory of natural law as opposed to that of legal positivism. Still, Martin Luther King's arguments had substance, and there was a glaring human rights infringement then.<br><br>For csj's case, i truly have no idea what he's barking about.

            <div class='col-md body'>Normally, I try not to pour cold water on any efforts. However, the comparison with Mandela, Gandhi and King in some cases may be out of point, in my opinion.<br><br>They, along with most other well-known civil rights activist, fought against acute racism.<br><br>In Singapore, racism, to any extent, is not acute. I have worked under Malay and Indian bosses who were my superiors because they were graduates and more capable in the first place. This is arguably meritocratic minus acute racism.<br><br>Hardly any labelled or self-proclaimed civil rights leader in Singapore fought anything along those lines.<br><br>There are, of course, civil rights leaders who fought for political freedom. But their names do not stand out compared to Mandela, Gandhi and King at the international level.<br><br>The concept of non-violence also does not come without flaws. In Gandhi's case, non-violence became the catalyst for violence. Else, why did he have to fast? One needs to read Gandhi's story or watch the movie starring Ben Kingsley for a quick briefdown. But I surmise that all the bloodshed was necessary.<br><br>Regards</div>
