A mixed crowd made up of couples in their 30s, retirees, housewives and grannies turn up in taxis at an otherwise deserted Tanah Merah Ferry Terminal, just in time to hop into the last ferry to Batam.<br><br>Their destination is Leisure World, a casino ship anchored in international waters off the coast of Batam, where they will forgo sleep for the chance to win a fortune at the jackpot machines and gaming tables.<br><br>There, they gamble right through to the next morning, when they take the first ferry back home at 6.15am.<br><br>In a bid to lure more gamblers to the ship last November, its operator, New Century Cruise Lines, lowered the fare of the last ferry ride on off-peak days (Sunday to Thursday) from $42 to $12.<br><br><strong><span style="color: red;">Depending on how much money punters change on the ship, they can even get a rebate of up to $40 worth of chips to help subsidise the cost of the ferry ticket. Buffet meals are also provided free of charge.</span></strong><br><br>Two other casino ships, Lucky Star and Omar III, which offer day/night cruises, are offering similar incentives.<br><br><strong><span style="color: red;">In fact, the rebate can sometimes exceed the cost of the ferry tickets, which means the casinos are effectively paying the gamblers to gamble.</span></strong><br><br>Lawyer Amolat Singh said: "Paying people to go on board is basically a sales tactic, like shopping centres giving out money vouchers to shoppers. Legally, there's nothing wrong."<br><br>But social workers The Sunday Times spoke to were concerned about these marketing tactics.<br><br>"It is very dangerous," said Mr Jonathan Siew, a senior counsellor at the Care Corner Counselling Centre. "The elderly gamblers are the least likely to get help, especially since their children are usually there to give them more money to feed their addiction."<br><br>They are also highly susceptible to falling for such cheap deals and are easily sucked deeper into the gambling trap, he added.<br><br>In the 2005 Gambling Prevalence Survey conducted by the Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports (MCYS), 58 per cent of all Singaporeans said they have participated in at least one form of gambling activity in the past 12 months.<br><br>Only between 2 and 4 per cent of people surveyed had played jackpot machines or table games in cruises or casinos overseas, making them among the least popular activities.<br><br>About 2.1 per cent of those surveyed were probably problem gamblers.<br><br>Even though the proportion of such gamblers is small, the National Council on Problem Gambling (NCPG) wants to make sure the figure does not grow.<br><br>Said NCPG chairman Lim Hock San: "Our Responsible Gambling Sub-committee is actively engaging gambling operators to implement responsible gambling practices. Thus far, we have met with Singapore Pools, Singapore Turf Club and several private clubs with jackpot rooms. Cruise ship and IR operators are next in line."<br><br>Measures will include displaying counselling helpline numbers and other information on problem gambling on their premises and training employees to identify and refer gambling addicts to counselling centres.<br><br>"Ultimately, public education on the harmful effects of problem gambling is key to empowering people to act responsibly," said Mr Lim.<br><br>The NCPG has set up two pilot counselling centres for problem gambling.<br><br>Those who need help can visit the centres or call the helplines: Thye Hua Kwan Moral Society (1800-X-GAMBLE) and Care Corner Counselling Centre (1800-6-668-66<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>People may also visit the National Council on Problem Gambling website at www.ncpg.org.sg for more information.<strong></strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Non-Stop Gambling From Dusk To Dawn</strong><br><br>The Sunday Times<br>28 Jan 2007<br><br>The buffet is free but the Singaporeans on board the casino ship are not interested in the food.<br><br>Instead, when they are there they often eat at the gaming tables to save time. Many stay overnight, too, especially during the weekends.<br><br>When The Sunday Times went on board Leisure World - one of the most popular casino ships among Singaporean gamblers - on Wednesday at about 9.45pm, the assorted party of grannies, housewives, middle-aged men and couples in their 30s wasted no time changing their cash and hitting the tables.<br><br>After all, it had taken them two ferries and 1 1/2 hours to get to the ship.<br><br>They park themselves at a table - baccarat, roulette or blackjack - and remain glued to their seats for hours, with at least $300 worth of chips in front of them.<br><br>When they are hungry, they would signal to runners standing around the tables to "ta bao" (pack) food or get a cup of noodle for them.<br><br>To save the money on booking a room, some choose to catch a little shut-eye by lying on lounge chairs or sitting on the stairs. Most, however, gamble through the night.<br><br>When The Sunday Times left the ship in the morning for the 6.15am ferry, three elderly women in their 50s and 60s were still rooted to the same seats at the same roulette tabel where they had been playing all night.<br><br>To these gamblers, the ships are the closest they can get to legitimate casino gambling.<br><br>"Genting is too far away," said a Leisure World regular, who gave his name only as Mr Tan.<br><br>"It costs more too because I have to stay there for a few days to make it worthwhile."<br><br>The 39-year-old who is in the seafood business, used to frequent the ship during weekends. Now that the promotional ferry rate is on offer, he goes on weekdays as well.<br><br>He said: "I go to the ship in the evening, play overnight, then take the first 6.15am ferry back to Singapore and head straight to work."<br><br><strong><span style="color: red;">Will the opening of the integrated resorts (IRs) put a dent in the casino ship business?<br><br>Most of the 15 casino shipgoers The Sunday Times spoke to did not express much interest in the IRs. However, three were adamant they would not enter the casino there.<br><br>A newcomer to the ship, who wanted to be known only as Mr Li, said: "It's like I have lost $100 (the entry fee for local people) even before I start playing. Of course I won't go."</span></strong><br><br>He went to Leisure World only after he learnt of the $12 promotional ferry rate from a friend, he said.<br><br>But one Leisure World veteran, a 55-year-old retiree who gave his name as Mr Mar, said: "I'll go try my luck when it opens. If I win, I don't mind going again. If not, I'll come back here."</div>
