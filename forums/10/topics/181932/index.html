            <div class='col-md body'>From: Law Sin Ling<br>09 March 2006<br>Hoodwinked By Government Price-Fixing<br>Sg_Review<br><br>Following a series of shrill public complaints that some medicines<br>sold at government-run polyclinics are more expensive than similar<br>products sold at public hospitals, the Minister of Health Khaw Boon<br>Wan reluctantly admitted a horrible truth, and allowed Singaporeans a<br>sneak glance of yet another elaborate Made-In-Uniquely-Singapore<br>controversy.<br><br>The Minister confessed that drugs dispensed at polyclinics are sold at<br>a fixed price of $1.40 for one week's supply, regardless of how cheap<br>or expensive the drugs are. The bill of one patient showed that 6 out<br>of 9 of his medicines cost more at the polyclinic he visited than at a<br>public hospital (National University Hospital).<br><br>It is highly probable that the majority of polyclinics patients are<br>unknowingly paying more than necessary. An overall surplus is hence<br>expected from the sales of drugs alone.<br><br>The Minister faintly justified that the systematic fixing of price<br>allows 'profit' made from their sales to be channelled to help<br>patients who need more expensive drugs, by depressing the cost of such<br>drugs.<br><br>This form of "Robin Hood" scheme the Minister proclaimed and practised<br>is flawed and deceiving.<br><br>It is a sort of distribution of medical financial liability among the<br>people who patronise polyclinics, largely the middle and lower income<br>group. Patients in this group comprise the families of no less than<br>60% of Singapore income earners. The latter have incidentally<br>experienced little or negative average earning increment over the<br>years. They and their families are the ones most in need of State<br>assistance.<br><br>The scheme essentially translates to getting the poor to finance the poor.<br><br>Another problem is the inaccurate assumption the Minister makes on<br>payment proportion. If the excess amount paid for drugs (through<br>overcharging) is not exactly balanced by the amount of subsidy<br>(through undercharging), then one would have either a surplus from the<br>sales of drug, or a deficit.<br><br>In either scenario, the weakness of the scheme raises hard questions,<br><br>On one end of the outcome, it unfairly penalises those who take pain<br>to stay healthier, and potentially reward those who do not.<br>Furthermore, any net revenue (surplus, as the current situation would<br>produce) will need to be accountable, which is not the case currently.<br>This will also necessitate a review of the current fixed price.<br><br>At the other end of the outcome, a net shortfall will mean that<br>additional fund has to be sought from somewhere else if the price of<br>drugs to the patients is to remain affordably low. Critically, it also<br>indicates that despite the overpaying by the majority, the price of<br>drugs sold in polyclinics is distressingly high, or that popular but<br>expensive drugs are in high demand.<br><br>Generally, the scheme distorts the market principle which is applied<br>to the component of the medical bill not subsidised by the government.<br><br>Taking from those (among the economically challenged) who should be<br>paying less to help subsidise those who could be paying more is an act<br>that does not enshrine the nobleness of the Sherwood legend (It is<br>even more inappropriate for the Minister to compare his act to that of<br>the latter).<br><br>The scheme reduces the commitment of the government to provide<br>effective and cheap health care services to the masses who do not need<br>the more costly specialised treatments in hospitals. It passes the<br>responsibility of health care subsidy from the government to the<br>people, which in this case are the poorer 60% (by conservative estimate).<br><br>The scary aspect is not knowing where the 'profit' derived from those<br>who overpay are heading. The situation is exacerbated by how it took a<br>few sharp observers to ferret this irregularity while the government<br>kept silent on it for years.<br><br>Adding salt to insult is the Minister's boast about lowering overheads<br>on the purchase of drugs through its group purchasing office, without<br>adequately addressing the continual need to saddle the people with<br>devious cost-recovering technique.<br><br>Instead, the Minister advised the public to focus on overall savings<br>at polyclinics as compared to hospital. He even casually added that<br>"Otherwise, there will be no incentive for patients to move out of<br>expensive acute hospitals".<br><br>This argument is moronic and irrelevant.<br><br>Polyclinics and hospitals cater to different financial classes,<br>especially where common clinical ailments are concerned. Improving the<br>services in polyclinics (such as solving the long waiting time) will<br>also draw the patients back. More importantly, patients do not<br>patronise hospitals if cheaper and more effective alternatives are<br>available.<br><br>The gradual evolution in the priority of the government on public<br>health care service from one of essential public service to one of<br>economic and business imperative is disturbing.<br><br>In 2005, Khaw rejected the proposal to offer joint public-private<br>tenders to buy drug in bulk which would have reduce the cost overhead<br>of the private health-care sector, allowing the latter to become more<br>competitive to the point of potentially offering more cost-effective<br>health services than that in polyclinics.<br><br>In the same year, night clinic services at polyclinics were abruptly<br>terminated with the usual cursory explanation that "resources are<br>finite and (MOH) have to prioritise". Singaporeans fondly recalled<br>that the services were initially offered "for poor residents who<br>worked during the day." The size of this latter group is still increasing.<br><br>Polyclinics have effectively become government-run competitors to the<br>private sector clinics. As such, the government deems it sufficient to<br>offer a more competitive price by lowering overall bill for<br>polyclinics to ensnare clientele (patients).<br><br>This goes against the spirit of fair competition since the polyclinics<br>have the advantage of leveraging on government resources to economise<br>where it can. Besides, polyclinics were not established to compete<br>against the private sector, and much less the hospitals.<br><br>The government protectionism, erratic policies, and deliberate<br>pernicious price-fixing, leaves the health Minister's verbally<br>articulated good intentions to lower health care cost conclusively<br>untrustworthy.<br><br>(Mr) Law Sin Ling<br><br><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Sg_Review/message/2262" rel="nofollow">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Sg_Review/message/2262</a></div>
