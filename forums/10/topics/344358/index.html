              <p>Thats because he wants you to invest in commodities, of which he has a fund...and commodities performance last year was comparable to equities..in the sense that it nosedived...and he came out to ask ppl to buy more...and prices went down more.....</p>
              <p>He is also famous for saying that he would rather sell options then buy them as 90% of options expire worthless....</p>

              <p>Thats because he wants you to invest in commodities, of which he
                                      has a fund...and commodities performance last year was comparable
                                      to equities..in the sense that it nosedived...and he came out to
                                      ask ppl to buy more...and prices went down more.....</p>
              <p>He is also famous for saying that he would rather sell options
                                      then buy them as 90% of options expire worthless....</p>
              <p>The only thing he is famous for..if you guys noticed...is being
                                      George Soros' partner...everytime got article about him..they must
                                      state that.</p>

              <p>Jim Rogers was right on the rise of Japanese Yen and collapse of the banks.</p>
              <p>As for commodities,  If you read his book , he did not ask people to buy commodities blindly. <strong>His book has already mentioned a correction of 50% on commodities is not uncommon.</strong> When he gave advice to buy commodities, he didnt ask investors to buy his fund. There are many Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) that tracks the commodities index he created, <strong>which does not benefit him at all. Investors can buy into commodities easily without buying his funds.<br></strong></p>
              <p>If you watched the videos i posted or any other interviews he gave on television, was he introduced as the partner of George Soros?</p>
