            <div class='col-md body'>A letter in today's ST (25th Mar) forum page by a reader stating how it would be better if an MP were to be an "average Singaporean".  Such an MP would better understand the needs/concerns of the man in the street.  Someone who is a CEO, company director, doctor, lawyer and the like would be less likely to be able to relate with the difficulties faced by the average Singaporean.  Relying on the feedback by grassroot people isn't always prudent.  If the candidate for the coming election is an average Singaporean, I will be more inclined to vote for him.  What do you think?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>How to have "average Singaporean MPs" when all MPs are paid an allowance in excess of $13k/month, and given some high post in NTUC which will earn them somemore on top of their MP allowance?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>These perks will straightaway catapault them from HDB heartlander to District 10 bungalow dweller, from Nissan Sunny driver to BMW owner. They will no longer be 'average', they will no longer squeeze for the MRT, they will no longer go to coffeeshops... till election time. It really doesn't make a difference what bloody background they come from.. the perks are so lucrative that they wouldn't dare to speak up against the govt (Party) and risk losing their new found wealth and status.<br><br>That's why i wanted to laugh when i read about the 3 new PAP candidates who said they would not think twice to speak their views, even if they run contrary to the Party's opinions. And what do they have to offer? Something about helping the needy should be a govt-led rather than a govt-supported effort blah blah blah. I was like, <span style="font-style: italic;">come on</span>, do you have something better to offer?? We already have enough sleepers in Parliament, who totally don't deserve their allowance. PAP better go do some Q/C on its candidates, and not try to 'smuggle' them into Parliament by hiding them in big GRCs fronted by a Minister.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>Personally, i've NEVER seen my MP(s) at all.. in fact i don't even know who the hell they are. It's only during election time that they come around in that white lorry with the blaring loudspeakers asking me to vote for them. Frankly I don't care what background they come from, but if they are not interested to serve, they deserve a boot up their asses.<br><br></div>
