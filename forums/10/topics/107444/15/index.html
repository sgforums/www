Casino is a "pien man" in chinese..irregardless of wat u called it, an integrated resort. I already give u the disneyland example, why we lose out to HK n Shanghai..is disneyland a casino, hve u seen any casino in Disneyland..if we hve won Disneyland...do we still need casino...remember there r 200 million pple in Indonesia...big enough market rit..so we lose it, n then now casino. Why, if gahment acknowledge it, it means tat they hve run out of ideas n need the easy money....Hve the casino rit, but speak the truth..how many times must i getr thr yr thick skull.<br><br>There are good pple in gahment n i do not bash them unneccesary but if they r like u...singapore is dead...cause we need to fit into the world..not the world around Singapore...wat Singaporeans maturity to hve or not to hve the casino..we need casino because of the economy.. </blockquote>so u think the gov is lousy, and so ? Had anyone deny tat casino will bring in money from tourism ?<br><br>And ruined our hard-earned reputation of Singapore....wat audacity....<br><br><blockquote>Those experience i listed down r true...in fact...just having dinner with a mainland chinese boss, who just came back from holidaying in Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand, he told me tat windows in Genting Hotel are completely sealed, even the hanging fans are removed as many pple hang themselves aft losing money.....mainland women selling their bodies as they piled up debts.... </blockquote>did he tell also u tat genting used to be a village and the people there were poor. Now they were beter off with employment and malaysia manage to bring in much money from tourism ?<br><br>Yes, money..money...money....is tat all to it<br><br><blockquote>I am not a moralist...but speak the truth 4 goodness sake, hve the casino, tell the pple the truth, tell them how gambling tax money is going to be used in health, infrastruture etc...softsell...not like those #&amp;!&amp; tat comes frm u. </blockquote>they will tell u in every year's budget. If there is no casino, then the budget we get from every year will be lesser.<br><br>Ya, blah.blah..blah..wat do u expect frm these bright-eye scholars..<br><br><blockquote>enough of yr stupidity...really...i cannot believe tat we hve such "bumpkin'' in Singapore...</blockquote>I guess being rude is a way u like to communicate huh ?<br><br>How else, stupid..where i cannot c the tree frm the forest...<br><br><blockquote>That is a big IF and which marketing report leads you to be sure it will pull in more. Gamblers want gambling and good pay-off and easy credit, why would like care about the theme park. They are gamblers, they are taling the risk going to all these places now. If they worry they wouldn't have gone there. </blockquote>they like to care about the theme park as wel. There r many people going to genting and these people do visit the theme parks as well. Gamblers r not crazy fanatic tat only want to gamble and not do other things such as playing in a theme park or eating. I tell u gamblers r like people around u. They do not go there becauise they r addicted but they go there for som fun or escape from a stressful life.<br><br><blockquote>I hope you realize, gambling, drugs and sex are alway good companions. </blockquote>No, I don't realise why does gambling be associated with drugs and sex. U think gamblers r bad hats with tattoos and gangs tat go around having sex and taking drugs ?<br><br><blockquote>How do they blacklist Batam and local illegal gambling dens. Why gov is not blacklisting casino operating cruise. Sex alone will be enough to ruin families. Drugs and sex are not profitable? Strange? Is gambling legal on cruise? If they can offer gambling what stop them from offering others. </blockquote>i am saying banning the cruise ships if they provide drugs to the people there. If they just provide proper gambling, then why ban them ? Gambling is legal on cruise. The authority can stop them from operating in singapore if they r offering other dubious services such as providing drugs.<br><br><blockquote>Because there is no gambling profit cap in other countries. Where did I say "gambling tax in sigapore is higher elsewhere". I already answered: "Other gambling operators (cruise, Batam, illegal operators) have few rules to observe and do not pay gambling tax. They can use these savings to provide better services including but not limited to illegal drugs and sexual services to attract and retain gamblers." It cost more gambling and social problems. That is the big cost we have to pay with the casino. If it fails, does the gov has the gut to admit failure or it will pump in money and remove all safeguards to keep it afloat to save face. How much money we are pumping in to keep the Durian afloat. </blockquote>u think batam do not pay any tax to anyone ? Why do u think sex and drugs will be better service, if they get to offer it at all ? And did u answer why does a bigger and more posh casino fails to attract gamblers but a lousy small old one can ? Why do u think these the casino here will not attract people when experienced casino operators bvelieved it do ? Why do u extrapolate so far as saying singapore has to pay to keep a foreign casino from operating ? Why do u think the durian is a failure ?  There r people going there occasionally to go for the performance and play etc. Why do u compare the casino to the durian ?<br><br><blockquote>Ok, so having a Casino in Singapore can be good in terms of Tourism Dollars.<br>But what about the man who murdered his entire family, and jumped to his death because of gambling??? </blockquote>Before the casino is here there r already people jumping off floors and killing themselves. U think by not building one singaporean will not gamble ? They still go to genting as well isn't it ?</div>

From the time a gambler places a bet to the time the bet is<br>settled, gratification occurs in mere seconds.

            <div class='col-md body'>Dec 17, 2004<br>Casinos: Economic costs as big as any benefits<br><br>By Yeoh Lam Keong<br>For The Straits Times<br><br>THE integrated casino resort project (ICR) has been proposed<br>principally to re-energise Singapore's flagging tourism industry.<br><br>On its surface, the model looks seductive. Only 30 to 50 per cent of<br>the project is supposed to be centred on gaming. The bulk of the<br>revenues from the $2 billion investment, we are told, should, as in<br>Atlantis or Las Vegas, come from an alluring infrastructure of<br>high-end hotels, world-class entertainment, restaurants and convention<br>facilities that would also synergistically benefit tourism as a whole.<br><br>.......................<br><br>Tempting<br><br>LIKE its high rolling namesake, the ICR project looks tempting. A much<br>darker picture, however, emerges if one looks at its economic costs.<br><br>First, while the benefits are potentially large (Prof Koh estimates<br>the ICR can add 0.3 to 1 per cent of GDP), the costs are equally big.<br>Cost benefit studies of Australia's experience in gaming estimate a<br>sum of between A$1.8 billion (S$2.3 billion) and A$5.6 billion on both<br>the benefits and costs sides of the ledger.<br><br>Australian Productivity Commission (APC) listed the following among<br>the main costs: Bankruptcy, loss of work productivity, job losses,<br>police incidents, court cases, divorce and violence. The impact on<br>family dysfunction and breakdown is obvious.<br><br>The APC found that 96 per cent of problem gamblers suffered from<br>depression, 58 per cent have considered suicide and 14 per cent had<br>attempted it. Half spent over 50 per cent of their income on their vice.<br><br>.......................<br><br>Can regulation reduce these costs? Can limiting access to casinos to<br>high-rolling tourists or to rich citizens, for example, reduce the<br>number of problem gamblers? Can't Singapore have its cake and eat it too?<br><br>Unfortunately, the economics of the gaming industry work against this.<br><br>To begin with, the bulk of most casinos' clientele tend to be local<br>residents - usually 70 per cent to 80 per cent even in<br>tourist-intensive locations like Australia or Genting, in Malaysia.<br>Atlantis and Las Vegas, which rely principally on non-residents or<br>foreign tourists, are not at all typical examples.<br><br>In Singapore's case, the greater the regulation of locals, the greater<br>will be the implicit 'tax' on its ICR as compared to less regulated<br>regional gaming establishments. Over time, the more intense the<br>regional competition gets, the more financially unviable will local<br>regulation become. After sinking more than $2 billion into such a<br>project, there is likely to be increasing pressure to relax or dilute<br>restrictions on local clientele so the ICR can be competitive with<br>other casinos in the region, subject to fewer restrictions. The<br>financial viability of the local casino may require the acceptance of<br>high levels of local misery.<br><br>Unseen threat<br><br>IN ADDITION, the ICR, by its very nature, will pose an unseen threat<br>to the very tourism infrastructure it is designed to energise. This is<br>because ICR-type operations typically subsidise the hotel,<br>entertainment and other facilities attached to the casino. Often, such<br>facilities barely break even or may even lose money, but the project<br>as a whole is supported by the gaming profits from the clientele that<br>such facilities draw.<br><br>.......................<br><br>It is in these more common cases that the ICR could become a Trojan<br>horse, with a potentially destructive impact on the local hospitality<br>industry because of its massive non-gaming infrastructure. Being<br>heavily subsidised, these facilities could damage surrounding hotels,<br>entertainment venues or convention places. Around Sky City, Auckland,<br>for example, hotel rates have fallen around 10 per cent due to<br>competition from the casino's cheap subsidised hotels.<br><br>.......................<br><br>Given these risks, to describe the ICR as an 'option' that Singapore<br>might like to buy, as some of its defenders have described it, may be<br>misleading. Instead, the project is perhaps more accurately<br>characterised, in financial market parlance, as the selling of an<br>'uncovered option'. Besides the certain social costs and the big<br>initial investment involved in purchasing this 'option', the total<br>losses to the economy as a whole could be unexpectedly large,<br>open-ended and extend over an indefinite time horizon, as in the case<br>of the sale of an 'uncovered option' gone wrong.<br><br>.......................<br><br>Would we not be diluting our tourism branding by moving closer to the<br>niches occupied by gaming cities like Las Vegas and Macau? Is this<br>what we want as a key part of our tourism strategy, let alone in<br>setting the tone for Singapore's social policy?<br><br>ICR proponents argue that gambling of all sorts is already rampant in<br>Singapore. Professor Peter Collins, Director of the Centre for the<br>Study of Commercial Gaming in Britain, estimates that gambling per<br>capita in Singapore is already among the highest in the world.<br><br>Establishing an ICR, its proponents argue, could capture some of the<br>business now lost to cruises and foreign casinos, and raise tax<br>revenues that can be used for social good as well as to rehabilitate<br>the worst effects of problem gambling.<br><br>Regulation<br><br>FRANKLY, I find this argument rather weak. The existing scale of<br>gambling is primarily determined by social policy and regulation<br>rather than dictated by local consumer taste.<br><br>In regulated France, for example, spending on gaming forms only 1.3<br>per cent of GDP. Compare this to a similarly rich, but less regulated<br>country like Japan, where 'pachinko' gaming turnover alone forms a<br>whopping 6.7 per cent of GDP.<br><br>Unlike Japan, Singapore is not desperate for alternative fiscal revenues.<br><br>To my mind, the admittedly high existing per capita spending on<br>gambling in Singapore is not an argument for establishing yet another<br>gaming venue in the form of a legal high-end casino.<br><br>Rather, it is a much stronger argument for a careful review of<br>regulation of existing gaming facilities - including legal 4D,<br>'football clubs' with their gaming machines and illegal gambling - as<br>well as of the adequacy of counselling, education and community<br>support for existing problem gamblers.<br><br>Although superficially compelling, the ICR project, with its dark and<br>hidden costs, is a Faustian bargain. And as with most such bargains,<br>the devil lurks in the details.<br><br>The writer is Director of Economics and Strategy at the Government of<br>Singapore Investment Corporation (GIC) and Vice-President of the<br>Economic Society of Singapore (ESS).

Buying 4-D or Toto<br>takes from a few hours to a few days to achieve gratification.<br><br>Would it be a surprise if I tell you that research shows that the<br>shorter the time to gratification, the higher the chance of addiction?<br>Hence, there are more people addicted to 4-D and Toto than there are<br>those addicted to Singapore Sweep.<br><br>Now imagine the time-frame shortened by an order of magnitude in a<br>casino.
