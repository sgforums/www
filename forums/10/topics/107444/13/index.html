When people go for tour, they either go for theme park or scenary or beach. Which is something singapore is not good at now. If u talk about expatriates, they r concerned with safety and cleaniness, however how much will it deteriotes after the casino is open ? They r also complainig singapore is too boring. A casino will make singapore more interesting.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Our Dear Leader PM Lee Hsien Loong &amp; Chief Justice Yong Pang Howe recently said, times have changed. We now have to be flexible and adjust our way of lives.<br><br>Three years ago the 4 mega casino companies namely, Caesars Palace, MGM Grand, Venetian &amp; Wynn Resorts from Las Vegas were invited to Macau to develope 4 integrated resort casinos. They invested in the region of 6-7 billions US Dollars. Their projections were to get their investments back in 3-5 years, but to their surprise they got their investments back in 6 months.<br><br>The mainland Chinese wealth and their gambling habits are phenomenal. If we don't seize this opportunity to tap this source of revenue, our neighbours Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia will be more than happy to do so.<br><br>Just last week it was reported in the Straits Times that the world's 2nd largest hard disk manufacturer, Maxtor are shifting their operations to China. In the coming months you can expect to read more of such news. We just can't compete with China's cheap labour, land &amp; resources.<br><br>Without one or two integrated resorts/casino in S'pore, our tourism arrival will stagnate at its present level of 7-8 million visitors a year. Don't forget these figures include the huge number of foreign workers who arrive to work in S'pore.<br><br>Las Vegas 50 years ago was a desert town with a population of 2,000 people. Today it's tourist arrival is in the region of 38 - 40 millions visitors a year and it's the fastest growing city (current population - about 2.5 million) with the lowest crime rates in the US.<br><br>S'pore is strategically located to attract gamblers from the region. Also we have the infrastructure, logistics &amp; commuincation to support an international casino operations.<br><br>Giving our tourism a boost would also help the growth of our National Airline, SIA which otherwise has also reached its stagnation point.<br><br>Instead of worrying about whether casino will be set up or not, I suggest that we should focus our attention on investing our money on Temasek listed companies who are in JV with the mega casino companies bidding for the casino development.<br><br>To the successful operators &amp; S'pore it's a sure win-win situation. Gambling taxes in Macau have been levied at 40%, while in S'pore it's only 15%.<br><br>S'poreans, you have to try to abstain from gambling in casinos; be it in S'pore or elsewhere.<br><br>Every time you make a bet, the house advantage over your bet is about 2.5%.<br>So for every $100 you bet, like it or not the casino gains $2.50, $1000 &gt; $25, $10,000 &gt; $250, $100,000 &gt; $2500 and so on.<br><br>It's a zero sum game and at the end of the day you must loose.<br></div>

Back up your claims that for years singapore has asked people to invest in an integrated resort here (without a casino) but no one did?<br><br>May I suggest you go read the ST today, Tuesday 8 Mar 05, Page H20:<br>Fiscal Argument for casino here overplayed?<br><br>A MEGA-RESORT could still hit the jackpot in Singapore even if it does not have casino, according to a report from United States investment bank Morgan Stanley.<br><br>The report also questions some of the assumptions underlying the arguments<br>for a gaming palace, including the notion that it would attract large numbers of foreign punters and provide funds to cross-subsidise other attractions.<br><br>It conceded that a resort as a whole would boost the economy with an initial start-up investment of 0.9 to 1.9 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) and the addition of 6,000 to 9,000 jobs.<br><br>It also estimated that if the mega-resort is built and Singapore meets its tourist-visit targets, the GDP by 2015 will be 15.4 per cent higher than it was last year. Without the resort, the GDP would grow by just 6.1 per cent.<br><br>But whether a casino is crucial to these gains remains questionable.<br><br>"The key question is whether the resort and the economy could do just as well without the casino. We think the answer is probably yes." said Morgan Stanley economists Deyi Tan and Daniel Lian in the report.<br><br>They also examined the Government's view that revenue from a casino could be used to "cross-subsidise the other non-gaming attractions, which in turn attract the large number of visitors."<br><br>Calling this argument "somewhat shaky", the report argued that if the resort's non-gaming components - hotels, convention centres and luxury retail outlets - command a price premium and generate profits, "it detracts from the need for cross-subsidisation to attract tourists".<br><br>The Atlantis in Bahamas - a model the Government has cited - is a case in point, the paper said.<br><br>Non-gaming revenue accounts for over 70 per cent of total revenue and there does not appear to be any cross-subsidisation for accommodation and food, both of which had sizeable profit margins of 84.2 per cent and 33 per cent respectively in 2003.<br><br>As well, the report also questioned whether a Singapore casino would be able to attract the base of foreign tourists it is targeting.<br><br>It cited the fragmented Asian market, wth casinos in Genting and Australia relying largely on locals. Even in Las Vegas, in the year ended June 2003, only 9 per cent of casino visitors were foreigners, the paper said.<br><br>A casino in Singapore would also face competition from Macau, which opened up its gaming industry to foreign operators in 2002 and enjoys first-mover advantage.<br><br>"This suggests to us that Singapore's proposed casino would by itself struggle to attract a critical mass of foreign clientele, thus undermining the economic logic of this project," the paper said.<br><br>And Hong Kong has approved to build a bridge to connect Hong Kong with Macau.....NewsRadio 93.8.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

We now have to be flexible and adjust our way of lives.<br><br>Three years ago the 4 mega casino companies namely, Caesars Palace, MGM Grand, Venetian &amp; Wynn Resorts from Las Vegas were invited to Macau to develope 4 integrated resort casinos. They invested in the region of 6-7 billions US Dollars. Their projections were to get their investments back in 3-5 years, but to their surprise they got their investments back in 6 months.<br><br>The mainland Chinese wealth and their gambling habits are phenomenal. If we don't seize this opportunity to tap this source of revenue, our neighbours Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia will be more than happy to do so.<br><br>Just last week it was reported in the Straits Times that the world's 2nd largest hard disk manufacturer, Maxtor are shifting their operations to China. In the coming months you can expect to read more of such news. We just can't compete with China's cheap labour, land &amp; resources.<br><br>Without one or two integrated resorts/casino in S'pore, our tourism arrival will stagnate at its present level of 7-8 million visitors a year. Don't forget these figures include the huge number of foreign workers who arrive to work in S'pore.<br><br>Las Vegas 50 years ago was a desert town of 2,000 population. Today it's tourist arrival is in the region of 38 - 40 millions visitors a year and it's the fastest growing city (current population - about 2.5 million) with the lowest crime rates in the US.<br><br>S'pore is strategically located to attract gamblers from the region. Also we have the infrastructure, logistics &amp; commuincation to support an international casino operations.<br><br>Giving our tourism a boost would also help the growth of our National Airline, SIA which otherwise has also reached its stagnation point.<br><br>Instead of worrying about whether casino will be set up or not, I suggest that we should focus our attention on investing our money on Temasek listed companies who are in JV with the mega casino companies bidding for the casino development.<br><br>To the successful operators &amp; S'pore it's a sure win-win situation. Gambling taxes in Macau has been levied at 40%, while in S'pore it's only 15%.<br><br>S'poreans, you have to try to abstain from gambling in casinos; be it in S'pore or elsewhere.<br><br>Every time you make a bet, the house advantage over your bet is about 2.5%.<br>So for every $100 you bet, like it or not the casino gains $2.50, $1000 &gt; $25, $10,000 &gt; $250, $100,000 &gt; $2500 and so on.<br><br>It's a zero sum game and at the end of the day you must loose.<br></div></blockquote>Hi ppp,<br><br>Yes, i agree, hve the casino..though i personally do not like it in our backyard...but pls, do not point to Singaporean's maturity as an excuse to hve or not to hve a casino.<br><br>Gahment need the money as our economy cannot be substained..mfg is hollowing out, retail is dead.....lifescience is work-in-progress..where does it leads us to...how many Sim Hong Woo do we hve...most scholars are co-opt into gahment...they do not "streetfight", r not "streetsmart", n we tons of minister, mps to "manage" Singapore 4 million..<br><br>Yes i know it...chinese mainland spend USD72 billion in gambling last year...<br><br>Its a political decision which is a "done deal". So, what gives...just speak the truth tat we need the casino to "pump" up the economy....short n sweet...</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>The principal argument against the casino is that the social cost is too high in terms of gambling addiction and consequent impacts on the family and society. The fact is that gambling in various forms already exists in Spore, be it Toto, big sweep, 4D, stock market, etc. It is also impossible to prevent Sporeans from visiting and gambling at casinos elseqhere.  It is debatable whether a casino in Spore will make a fundamental difference to our gambling habits.<br><br>However, I recall a radio interview with a  guy relating their experience with a casino outlet in NZ. IIRC the results are mixed and there is evidently an undesirable social impact on the community. He has advised that we should tread carefully on implementation. Some safeguards will probably be built in, perhaps in the form of an entrance fee or deposit. Question is, is it going to be enough and if these safeguards works well, will it also work against commercial success?<br><br>Clearly, the government has no intention of subjecting the issue to a referendum or a vote in parliament with the whip lifted and the money's on the casino going ahead (no pun intended). The opposition parties are going to make this an election issue and the government must think carefully about the political price, particularly should it adversely affect a significant number of the population.</div>
