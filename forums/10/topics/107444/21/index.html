            <div class='col-md body'>The 20 problems of autocracy as posted in another thread sadly were precisely caused by the constant propanganda and brainwashing that we have great leaders and they know how to make decisions. Let them decide everything.<br><br>What happen? When problems come all the leaders do will be to make denials and justifications that they have consulted the public of the matter or the younger leaders were the ones who made the casino decisions. This is in answer to the thinking that leaders will admit mistakes and take responsibility for any future erosions of work ethics or losses of economic competitiveness.<br><br>The most serious of these 20 problems - high costs of living and loss of economic competitiveness due to over-promoting meritocracy to the neglect of broad-based education were caused by such thinking that leaders are leaders and they should lead by making decisions on their own. It is sad that the population can be brainwashed into unquestioned belief that the leaders know best and how to be fair.<br><br>Incidentally, the Americans went crazy with electing their latest idols and came out strongly to participate in such event because you know what - judges like Simon Cowe are not too much in a hurry to decide but only lead the americans into voting and deciding who they want. What is wrong with such a government - lead from behind like the shepherd tending to the sheeps.<br><br>This then is only my view. No one should feel hurt about what I say.<br></div>

Because, ultimately, long-term risks matter more than short-term ones. And, yes, they insist - we're talking money here, not morals.<br><br>Even with a resort-cum-casino projected to pull in nearly $5 billion a year in revenues and taxes, adding as much as 1 per cent GDP growth and spinning off 10,000 jobs or more, the economic numbers eventually won't hold up.<br><br>The simple reason: Long after the high-rolling visitors have left our shores, the locals will end up mopping the bill for the broader fallout - bankruptcies, job losses, crime, divorces, dysfunctional families, rehabilitation programmes.<br><br>Australian and US studies, after all, have shown that even if tourists are the prime targets, some two per cent of locals will almost always become problem gamblers - with or without 'social safeguards' in place.<br><br>In the Singapore context, according to a government survey released this week, that adds up to 55,000 residents, not counting the spillover impact on their families.<br><br>So no, society won't 'break down' overnight. But looking ahead, the casino's detractors stress, it's not a gamble worth taking.<br><br>Has the Government heard them loud and clear? Well, their hope is, once D-Day is over in the next 24 hours, it'll be a case of 'all bets are off'.<br><br>Literally.<br></div>

PSA case he flop, SIA case he flop. HDB case he flop again??? well we sure have a "strong" union.</div></blockquote>10000 jobs might not be a big deal.. but if u look at the bigger picture, creating the buzz &amp; vibrancy will definitely draw more tourists in, whether they are here for the casino or not..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>[Just questioning whether is there a "pre-post" study done? or is this just a mere correlational study?<br><br>who knows.. this 2% might already be inherent in the society, with or without the casino.. this is esp true if there's gonna be a $100 entrance fee to the casino.. going to genting will cost less than that..]<br><br>in the case of our society, i think 2% is just the tip of the ice berg.  but even as we deem those 2% as 'hopeless' with or without the casino, it just makes it so much more convenient for them to find a place to lose money as opposed to travelling up north.<br><br>more importantly, what would be the effect on the next 20% to 50%?  this group of people who wouldn't otherwise take the trouble to travel to gamble might just end up gambling once you take away the travelling hassle.<br><br>$100 might make people think twice before trying their luck but once they've entered, perhaps won once or twice and experienced the thrill, you can be sure they'd be back for more.  and that $100 barrier soon becomes in the eyes of a gambler in the making, $50, then $25 ... and when he loses, all the more he'd want to win back ... human psychology ...<br><br>bottomline is no one can guarantee that $100 is good enough deterrence and putting the blame on the gambler is only half right (and half wrong) especially when that blame comes from the very person setting up the gambling table.</div>
