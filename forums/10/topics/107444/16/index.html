            <div class='col-md body'>I have just read through all 16 pages in this thread. I shudder at the comments of fellow Singaporeans such as  and the likes. Perhaps you reflect the people in office up there, who think there is nothing wrong to build a casino (whether it is integrated with other family entertainment or not is beside the point) that can reap economic benefits, and that gamblers are the ones who ruin themselves so it has nothing to do with the evils existing in their environment. Really? That simple?<br><br>To  - you mentioned time and time again that your dad bets on 4D too. well, perhaps his betting habit has not hurt your life. at the very  least, he didn't kill you like what simon lee did to his kids. But what if it is your wife or kid who is the addict? What will you feel? Will you brush it off as a small matter?<br><br>In my case, I have tried 3 years to wean my hubby off his gambling habits. These 3 years were also the hardest years in our 10 years of marriage.  At first, he started gambling to 'buy a hope' (like everyong else) to have a better future, but after striking some consolation prize (4D), he started betting even more vigorously. To him, that isn't Greed, that is Hope coming into view.  That is when obsession started. He has only one obsession in that entire 3 years - To Win. He spent at least a third of his pay on betting alone, and left a meagre sum for other expenses and bills. Power supply was stopped, kids withdrawn from Kindergarten, tons of reminders and lawyers' letters were received, maggi mee only for lunch and dinner. Yet, he didn't want to admit he is having a problem, and thought going for counselling is stupid. He settled his accumulating debts and bills with his bonus each year. Deep down, he knew he was being stupid, but the obsession to win big bucks took over.<br><br>Everyone talks about 'gambling addiction', but nobody mentions about 'obsession to win'. I do not worry very much about addiction because it can be eventually weaned off. But obsession is much harder to be dealt with. He was quite alright on days when there weren't 4D or Toto, but on the days which had, he will spend long hours after work checking out 4D forums to look for 'winning numbers'. I hate to think what a 24/7 casino can do to him.<br><br>It does not mean with a casino, people who are now betting on 4D and ToTo or horse racing or soccer will shift their addiction to gamble in the casino. They will still bet on 4D etc beside gambling in casino.<br><br>Honestly, I do not care very much for economic benefits, as being in the lower middle class for so long now, I reckon whether the economy is good or bad, life is still gonna be hard (maybe even harder in future) for folks like us. Whether the government earns tax $$ from the casino or not also doesn't concern me very much too, as I believe, whatever they earn won't be trickling down to us. I am a very contented person and would be happy as long as i have only enough money to survive. As for jobs, they will never be enough as long as there are Foreign Talents. Are we going to build more casinoes if the unemployment rate rises further?<br><br>Yes, it is really easy to say that gamblers are responsible for their own actions, and that they have to face the consequences themselves. THAT is only said by people who do not have gamblers among their close kins. As a matter of fact, gamblers do not only ruin themselves but their loved ones too.<br><br>Ask yourself - would you dig out your life savings to help your parent or spouse (or even your kid in future!) to repay their gambling debts? Would you rather wait till then to realise how wrong it is in helping to build a casino now?<br><br>Recently, I have started worrying again about 'what if my hubby rekindle his addiction and obsession????' . And I am posting this because I know, this is the least I can do in my capacity to stop a casino from opening on our shores.<br><br>Every voice counts and I jolly well makes some noise too before it is too late. And before I regret.<br><br>-=sorry for the long and quite disorganised post. My mind is not quite where it should be.=-<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Unlike Japan, Singapore is not desperate for alternative fiscal revenues</blockquote>Tat is a funny statement made.. u think economically speaking singapore has more better options than japan ? U think US is deperate for alternative fiscal revenues ? U think england is dying economically tat it had to depend on casinoes ? U think south korea had ran out of ideas to pull in revenues ? U think malaysia had ran into a brick wall in developing his country ? I will be frank to u, Singapore is more desperate than the above mentioned countries for alternative fiscal revenues. We have nothing to offer<br><br><blockquote>To  - you mentioned time and time again that your dad bets on 4D too. well, perhaps his betting habit has not hurt your life. at the very least, he didn't kill you like what simon lee did to his kids.

However everything in life we have, there r good sides and bad sides of the picture to look at. U can probably hear stories about accidents victim and how their loved ones was killed or maimed by traffic accidents etc. It is probably one of the leading killers in a lot of countries. Just because we want to prevent traffic accidents from happening and these people from being killed, then we should banned all vehicles ? Drinking also poses much problems as well. People were killed because of some people drinkign and driving. It brought much grieve to the victim, perhaps much more than u as well. So should the gov banned drinking ?<br><br>How will I feel if my family member is an addict ? I will feel dissappointed with him but I don't blame the casino for it. There r probably 1000 times more people who had gambled and still lead a normal life. The problem lies more on his character and personality and not on the establishment. If your husband is an alcoholic, u blame the beer company, government or your husband himself ?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Stupid (joking <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> ),<br><br><blockquote>I will feel dissappointed with him but I don't blame the casino for it. </blockquote>This is a bit of the "it's not the gun that kills, stupid"  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> argument.  It will be hard to argue that the proximity of a casino in Spore will increase frequency of visits by locals. Whether it will lead to more gambling addiction is IMO, debatable. Like you, I believe psychology is the more important factor. However, I recall there is a post in this thread suggesting that response time to gratification can be a key factor. If so, we'll have to think of an appropriate solution, eg. make em spend all their money on F&amp;B and games before allowing em into the casino, or something like that. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br><blockquote>I will be frank to u, Singapore is more desperate than the above mentioned countries for alternative fiscal revenues. We have nothing to offer<br></blockquote>I agree that Spore is more desperate than the other mentioned countries for tourist dollars; however, IMO this has more to do with job creation than  generation of revenue. Without jobs, there will be a lot more dissatisfaction and more young ppl emigrating elsewhere. That is IMO a far more serious problem than having to deal with a few more gambling addicts. This is not a callous and uncaring view of this problem and one can say there are other ways of creating jobs than having a casino. However, I think it is getting more and more difficult to do so as Spore move more into services.<br><br>If the gov does go ahead with the casino, I hope it will do so with great care and ensure there are safeguards for those vulnerable. In the longer term, I think the key lies in having educated and informed ppl able to avoid vulnerability to this and other evils.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

"Last time, we all lend people money to pay<br>off their gambling debts," he explained. "Now, with the casino, we can<br>also offer them high interest loans to afford to pay the entry fee to get into the casino in the first place."<br><br>Dr. Chao also predicted a rise in their traditional service of debt recovery. "I would definitely invest in pork futures. With more gamblers, it makes sense that here will be more debtors, and a corresponding surge in demand for pigs' heads."<br><br>Dr. Chao, who also pens an occasional advice column for TalkingCork.com,<br>also announced that Hoot U hopes to sign a memorandum of understanding<br>with the proposed casino. "The casino sure need bouncers to keep the<br>riff-raff out, ah lians to attract the high rollers, heavies to hoot cheaterbugs, that sort of thing, and Hoot U is the region's premier producer for manpower in these sectors. So we hope to establish an internship on-the-job-training programme."<br><br>In other casino-related news, legendary Las Vegas casino operator Harrah's has announced that it will be changing its name to "Harry's" (LKY is also known as Harry Lee) in order to improve its bidding prospects for the Singapore project.<br><br></div>
