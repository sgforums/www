That does not cause more people to lose their shirts off their backs.<br><br>Are we going to deprive the rich from helping our economy because of dead set principles that gambling (even for the rich) is not good? The choice to gamble is an exercise in freedom, something that is indicative on how far we have progressed as a society.

Until Dr. Balakrishnan is able to put forward a comprehensive economic plan to show how Singapore will benefit from having a casino in terms of how many jobs created and which industries will be correlated or integrated to draw on casino factor to stimulate growth, we really should not proceed with the decision of having a casino yet. </blockquote>To find out how much benefit singapore could get from casino depends on the proposal submitted by the companies interested in participating in bidding for it. It is like knowing how much people can reside in a plot of land only after the bidders submit their proposal( building a high rise condo or semi detached housing can differ the number of people living in it). However according to initial estimate, it could bring in 1.5 billion in profit anually, increase tourist number by 15%, increase their time in singapore as well as increasing the number of job employment by the thousands<br><br>I also want to put down the statistic on how gambling had already been part of singapore life<br><br>$20 million spend on online gaming<br>$2 billion spent on places like batam, genting etc anually<br>$3.5 billion on 4D anually<br>$2 billion horse betting<br>$0.5 billion toto<br>$0.18 billion soccer<br>$0.6 billion slot machines<br>$0.06 billion singapore sweep<br><br>and all these does not include the gambling amount on the 200 estimated underground gambling den here.

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually, have any of you been to casinos abroad????<br>Or have any of you stayed abroad long enough to know what's life with a casino in the country??<br>The truth is, it's really nothing!!! Just another entertainment complex!!! Gambling addicts will still be gambling addicts, non gamblers will still be non gamblers....<br>Gambling addicts are risk takers, and if you talk to them long enough, you will probably find out they are very business minded, and like to take risk!!!<br>Non-gamblers are not risk takers, they are too afraid to let go, that makes their nature unsuitable. Some would calculate too much the probability, and some feel so burnt after losing $20, they dare not try again..<br>But there are many people who gamble just for small trills, they would spare probably $10 or $20 just hoping they get a little lucky. And when they start to lose more than $50, they start to feel heart burned.<br>For those non risk takers who lose more than $100, they get so heart broken, they start to swear they never gamble again.<br>Then after sometime, the gambling trill start to subside, becos the casino is just another landmark.<br>For foreigners who have lived long enough in countries with casinos, they don't really think about it that much. There ain't too much trill in what they see as normality. Those who gamble are just that type, and those who don't are just not that type.<br>If you ask me, in 10 yrs down the road after (let's say!) the casino is built, we would treat it with nothing much more than a social complex, where we can watch movie, eat in restaurants and chit chat with friends.<br></div>

It can create much jobs, pull in more tourists and revitalise many other industries related to it such as hotels and restaurants. For the other types of gamblers, it become a more convenient venue for them to gamble as well as prevent tis cash flow into other countries such as genting</div>

It will be held on Saturday, 5th March 2005 from 2 pm - 5pm at the WorkersÂ’ Party Headquarters, 216-G Syed Alwi Road, #02-03, Singapore 207799.<br><br>Following the Consultation Exercise the WorkersÂ’ Party will collate the views from the meeting and deliberate the issue at the party level.<br><br>There will be two speakers who are party members. Goh Meng Seng, aged 34 is a Singaporean graduate operating a company based in Hong Kong. He comes back regularly for WPÂ’s grassroots activity and writes for the Hammer.<br><br>Chia Ti Lik, aged 30 is a litigation lawyer and partner in the firm where he practices in Singapore. He is also assistant to Mr. Low Thia Khiang, MP for Hougang and a WP Youth Action Committee member.<br><br>Since the announcement of the Public Consultation Exercise in early February, the WorkersÂ’ Party has received a steady stream of email opinions on the casino issue. The views in these emails include those for and against the Casino proposal. These emails are from Singaporeans both residing in Singapore and abroad.<br><br>Given the number of views The Workers' Party has received via emails, the party will continue to solicit views on the Casino Proposal even after the Public Consultation Exercise.<br><br>Members of the public are invited to send their views to the Party via e-mail at pcc@wp.org.sg or by regular mail to: PO Box 15, Toa Payoh Central Post Office, Singapore 913101.<br><br>The Consultation Exercise will be moderated by James Gomez, Assistant Secretary-General (2nd).
