            <div class='col-md body'>dear Kheldorin, if it appears to you that we have all been whining then that is most unfortunate.  we are here to express our concern about a fundamental change in our core values, of what seems acceptable and what is not, of crossing the boundary that separates right from wrong and going down the path of no return.<br><br>if a family has reached such a state of destituteness that it has no choice but to engage in questionable means of making a living, it can at least say it has no choice.  but if a man in desiring to maintain his lifestyle of extravaganze chooses to inculprit the entire family, then that is something altogether different.<br><br>as for suggestions about the 'integrated resort', details of the various proposals are sketchy, so there's nothing much we can do about.  we are neither distinguished architects nor experienced 'resort' operators so it's best we leave the conceptualisation to the experts.  we can make simple comments like not too much glass or we risk having another durian but beyond that, i think we wait and see.<br><br>as for gambling problems, if they really care, they can set up an IRAS booth at the entrance and allow only citizens with annual income greater than half a million to go in.</div>

Import more educated Indians and Chinese and beg them to take up PRships.<br><br>If the indebted poor get addicted, their medisave will be emptied into psychiatric therapies. Govt will feel a pinch from the subsidies but think how it will boost the pharmaceutical and medical industry here. With world class medical facilities here, can woo rich tycoons Dads who are interested in sending wayward heirs for addiction-therapies and 5-star suites and services in the medical centers.<br><br>If suay suay the IR don't make money, always got the chance that govt can sell it at high price to the emerging Chinese powers eg CTI (zhong xin) corporation?<br><br>IR will be a success, just like 117th IOC ceremony!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Singaporeans are not stupid when it comes to $$$$$. They will smarten up after being bitten once or twice. They will hold on to their pockets after that. But look at the long term. The $$$$$$$ that the casinos will bring in for Singapore year after year after year . In fact, every Singaporean should become a Tour Guide and bring tourists and guests to the IRs without restrictions. They should proudly stand behind the Great Lion City Spinning Wheels and watch them bring in the big $$$$$$bucks from overseas with gleaming faces and certainty of better times ahead.</div>
