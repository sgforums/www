I think tis is a bit... off...  as said before, tis is anti competition. Why stop a bigger shopping centre to be built just because it will take out other shopping centre business ? If other country also built bigger shopping malls, our smaller shopping malls will face a tougher time coping with it rather than the proposed larger one isn't it ?
