Otherwise why will even the ultra conservative china go about building a casino ? If every country is gonna build a casino, why should singapore be special by not building one itself ? At tis moment of time, there r still attraction for a casino. The sooner we have it, the better we get a share of tis business.

But u need to look at different side of the picture. u talk about gambling conveniently, it is already legal in 4D toto. U talk about addiciton turf club have it. U talk about jackpot all country clubs or other misc clubs have it as well. U talk about serious casino gambling, singaporean r not shield away from gambling cruise ships or genting either. How expensive is it to go to genting and cruise ship ? Less than a hundred and less than a day with the availiability of chepa airlines now. In fact some cruise ship let u go for free. I mean we r just making it tat little bit easier to gamble. With proper control of casino, the end result may be similar. We r not making radical changes.<br><br><blockquote>The obvious facts remain; not many people will go to loan sharks just because they want to buy 4D or Toto; some who gamble on the race course will do that.

Turf club is a major place where people loses big money as well. Maybe a better solution is to curb loan sharks instead.<br><br><blockquote>It is not possible for us to be "MORE ATTRACTIVE" to tourists with a casino in Singapore.

If singapore make sentosa a big entertainment resort, it may make things different. Lookng at malaysia, wat is the most fun thing about them ? Isn't tat the sand and the theme parks ? If we make a theme park with a casino, we may at least have a chance.<br><br><blockquote>This is not even from a moral point of view.

Going to gamble in a casino is already tat simple. We r just making it slightly easier only. So why stop it ? Since singaporean r gonna gamble, might as well spend the money in our own casino than other countries casino. Other countries do not fear the repurscussion of a casino. Even malaysia, who is suppose to be more religiously against already have one donkeys years ago. R they not afraid of soceity ills ?</div>

I guess in some countries going to their casino is further than us going to genting. Is trip to nowhere far ? U just need a weekend, nope a day is enough and u can go over to there as well. I admit tat a casino will be nearer to home, but then again it is not going to be a radical difference from current sitution now. Since u have a computer with an internet connection in front of u, u can even gamble in internet as well. U can gamble everyday if u want, big games with almost instant result.<br><br><blockquote>just because the gabrament is filled with people who were scholars, does not negate the possibility that they screwed up.. or worse, someone in there has a vested interest in seeing the casino built... </blockquote>True, they do screw up sometime.

U can get there within hours. there r so many hotel rooms there u don't even really need to book. If not how about trip to nowhere ? U don't even need to pack and going on board a ship is as convenient as going to sentosa. How about internet gambling ? All these things r already here.

Grinols, an economics professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.<br><br>Grinols and Attorney General J. Joseph Curran Jr., a staunch gambling foe, appeared before the House Ways and Means Committee to offer their views on the impact of legalizing slots.<br><br>Grinols told lawmakers that allowing thousands of slot machines at horse racing tracks is no different from creating casinos. And, he said, they create the same kinds of problems and costs to society.<br><br>Those problems include an increase in robbery, embezzlement, fraud and other crimes, he said, and social ills such as lost productivity in the workplace, bankruptcy filings and gambling-related suicides.<br><br><span style="color: red;">Grinols, whose research findings have been criticized by the gambling industry, said the state can expect $3 in costs for each $1 in benefits. </span><br><br>He also said slots are the "most addictive and most problematic form of gambling," far more than the lottery or horse racing.<br><br>"You can't easily lose $30,000 on the lottery in a night, but you can on a slot machine," Grinols said.<br><br>Several Ways and Means Committee members questioned Grinols closely about his research.<br><br>Del. David G. Boschert, an Anne Arundel County Republican and a slots supporter, said prohibition doesn't work.<br><br>"I just feel people are going to do what they want to do if they want to do it," he said.<br><br>He and other committee members said Marylanders who want to gamble can cross the state's borders to gamble where slots are legal.<br><br>Grinols said that bringing slots closer to Maryland population centers would create many more pathological gamblers in the state because they would be able to make daily trips to nearby slots parlors instead of occasional trips on weekends.<br><br>He said a racetrack casino or slots emporium can be expected to draw the vast majority of its patrons from a 35-mile radius.<br><br>Grinols said casinos rely on pathological gamblers for 30 percent to 50 percent of their revenues. The cost that each such gambler imposes on society is conservatively estimated at $10,300 a year, he said.<br><br>Del. Jean B. Cryor, a Montgomery County Republican, told Grinols that his research seemed to illustrate basic "human frailty." She said people are just as likely to embezzle money "to buy furs, jewels, whatever" or for some other purposes as they are to steal money to gamble, and that some people also abuse prescription drugs.<br><br>"What we're not looking at is what this [slots] revenue will do," Cryor said. "We've come a long way from talking about education funding."<br><br>Curran said legislators can't look at revenue from slots without also considering costs.<br><br>"Clearly, there are downsides, and to suggest there are not is wrong," he told the legislative panel.<br><br>Curran also warned that legalizing slots in whatever limited form inevitably leads to proliferation, much as the lottery grew from a single weekly drawing to daily games, instant tickets and Keno drawings every four minutes.<br><br><a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/local/bal-md.slots14nov14,0,2202951.story?coll=bal-home-utility" rel="nofollow">Copyright Â© 2004, The Baltimore Sun</a><br><br>----------<br><br>and this is only from slot machines!! imagine if and when you have Baccarat, Blackjack, and whatnots...</div>
