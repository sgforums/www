Where did I say "gambling tax in sigapore is higher elsewhere".  I already answered: "Other gambling operators (cruise, Batam, illegal operators) have few rules to observe and do not pay gambling tax. They can use these savings to provide better services including but not limited to illegal drugs and sexual services to attract and retain gamblers."  It cost more gambling and social problems.  That is the big cost we have to pay with the casino.  If it fails, does the gov has the gut to admit failure or it will pump in money and remove all safeguards to keep it afloat to save face.  How much money we are pumping in to keep the Durian afloat.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by stupidissmart:</div><div class="quote_body">money also flows in ! Why will they ask them to go to other region when they can ask them to gamble in singapore ? why do u say tat the gambling tax in sigapore is higher elsewhere when it is shown to be much lower than macau ? Why do u think batam etc can offer better deals than singapore ? If their offer is so good then the effecot of their gamblig alrady set in NOW. I don't see a good reason to go against casino. If it fails, he wat have we got to lose fiancially since it is the foreign investors tat sink in the money ?<br></div></blockquote></div>
