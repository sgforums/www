            <div class='col-md body'>I wonder if Singapore Pools and Turf Club outlets in the heartlands are the real threat rather than the casion resort. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br><blockquote><strong>Gambling in heartland cause for concern</strong><br><br>Nov 5, 2005<br>The Straits Times<br><br>THE report, 'Hooked on gambling? Help coming to the heartland' (ST, Oct 2<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">, is turning out to be a very big irony.<br><br>The Government seems very concerned that the coming integrated resorts (IRs) will pose a serious threat to citizens' ability to resist gambling, but are we not already gambling up to our eyeballs, and right in the heartland?<br><br>Let's face it: Singapore Pools, with its hundred over outlets, has successfully brought gambling to our doorsteps. It's almost impossible to find a Singapore Pools outlet without a long queue on any day.<br><br>If gambling is bad for our financial health, why did the Government allow Singapore Pools to open so many outlets in the heartland?<br><br>And did we ever hear an MP raise objection to this infestation of gambling in the heartland?<br><br>The easy accessibility to placing bets is not only eroding our work ethic and churning out thousands of addicts, but it is also a very bad influence on the thousands of teenagers who live so close to these betting outlets.<br><br>Some may argue that wagering a little money on 4D every draw is quite harmless, but are they aware several billions of dollars are lost to Singapore Pools, plus another billion or two to illegal operators?<br><br>Could this be one of the causes of the emergence of the New Poor in Singapore, and also the average 350 personal bankruptcies every month?<br><br>In fact, when you compare the 'house advantage' of a typical casino game like roulette (2.7 per cent) to that of 4D (40 per cent), you will realise why we are so broke playing 4D.<br><br>If you take a good look at the people patronising the Singapore Pools outlets you cannot help but conclude that most of them are low-income earners and poor housewives.<br><br>Why talk about helping the poor and the gambling addicts when, on the other hand, the Singapore Pools outlets make it so easy for them to lose their last dollar?<br><br>Another very bad sign I have observed among young people is that more and more of them have taken to soccer betting, thanks in no small part to the creativity of Singapore Pools in offering a wide variety of bets, and right at our doorstep.<br><br>Have we forgotten the saying that it is easy to pick up a bad habit in three days, but impossible to give it up forever?<br><br>If our future generation is more interested in making a quick buck than an honest living, what hope do we have to preserve the prosperity of the nation?<br><br>I am not totally against gambling, because all of us have a little bit of risk-taking in our genes, which experts say will help us to progress.<br><br>In fact, the coming IRs are good for our economy, although a few lives may be ruined. But then again, we are old enough to know what we are walking into, and IRs are not free to get in, and not so accessible too.<br><br>The way I see it, the only Exclusion Order we need to take out is to ban Singapore Pools from the heartland.<br><br>Mike Wong Kee Meng<br></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Will Casino Have Negative or Positive Net Effect?<br><br>Greetings.<br><br>I'd like to ask this following question, will casinoes have negative or positive net effect? From socio-economic perspective.<br><br>Let me start off with my position. That it's a negative net effect.<br><br>Everybody knows you can't win when u gamble. Because the casino has 'house edge' meaning the probability and the risk-reward is always better for the house.<br><br>OK so people lose money. To the casino.<br><br>Now the casino is owned by a minority/ select group of people. And foreign too. That means money will flow from the society towards a minority foreigner.<br><br>So far so good.<br><br>Now, SG government of course apply tax. And SG government is representative of the society.<br><br>So money out....to the minority foreigner....then money in again, to the government.<br><br>But of course the amount of money has dwindled right????<br>And now it's collected at government coffers, the government needs to reimburse through fiscal spending to spread it out again to wider society.<br><br>How come they say casino is good for the economy leh?? leh? leh?<br><br>Is it because part of the money is already imbursed by job creations like hiring waitresses, card dealers, etc?<br><br>But wait, casino runs a business. They always make profit and labour costs are lower. Which means....same thing what....money out from society....to minority foreigner.....goes in partly back to society again......and goes in partly to SG govt in tax.......<br><br>How can it be that its a positive net????</div>

It must have been really agonizing during the thinking and evaluating process. So ladies and gentlemen, straighten your eyebrows and put on that famous Singapore smile for the $loaded visitors to our shores. Let us plunge the sword to the hilt, move on and make our IRs a roaring success in Singapore.<br></div></blockquote>Yes, by the time when the casinos are commissioned...it will be over someone's body already. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Lottery business and casino business are similiar. Remember that there is case in singapore about the husband killed the wife in the flat with their two kids playing at the corridor??? Reason of killing, the wife has an insatiable appetite for money. She becomes greedy for monies after his husband had won the big sweep. When the monies is used up, she began to brat at her husband. The husband cannot take it anymore, kill her. Dirty monies kill a happy family.<br><br>The  intention of building casino is to earn more monies. But such dirty monies will not bring happiness. We compare ourselves to US. They can do it so could we. Such arrogent mindset is absolutely wrong as they are big nation and the people are educated differently from us.<br><br>Prositution in singapore is another trade that kills us. We know that  prositutes spreads diseases. However, out of the intention of monies, it is allowed. Leaving the people who can't resist the temptation to suffer and die in the diseases in hospitals.<br><br>So, has monies bring us happiness? Absolutely not, why can't we focus on having our own agriculture than thinking of immoral trades?<br><br>I absolutely dislike the idea of casino and prositution.</div>

Such freaking small space to develop....how to make it like second Las Vegas?  Are we far too behind to develop the IR?<br>Sg govt said the IR will be ready and commissioned by 2009....you believe?....or partial completed or half or three quarter completed.......develop into what degree of expectation in terms design and asthetic, how fantastic? I'm indoubt with the sg govt in this matter.</div>
