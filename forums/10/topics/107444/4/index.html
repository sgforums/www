            <div class='col-md body'>I quote the first sentence from goh meng seng first post <strong>"It is strange indeed. Nobody in his right mind would want their children to be gamblers but there are people who would support Casino!".</strong><br><br>For a person who had seen many families had been broken because of the gambling habit of a family member, it is disheartening to see the many legalised gaming outlets in Singapore.  It is alarming to see the looming casino in Singapore.<br><br>Just wandering how many who support the casino had seen the sorry state of the broken families of a gambler?<br><br>Who is behind the existing legalised gaming organisations and clubs?  Government = Singaporean.  Are we given a chance to object?<br><br>Yes, there are jackpot machine around but are sort of controlled and limited in number in each of the gaming outlets.  The illegal ones are being hunt down relentlessly.  The government has sort of "limit / control" the fallouts from these gaming outlets.  Just like prostitution, legalised but not advertised.<br><br>This is not true of casino.<br><br>Do you want to be tested, be a gambler, be an addicted gambler, and let your family members suffer the consequence?  You think you are mature enough to resist the lure.<br><br>Do you think your children will be mature enough to resist the temptation and pass the test?<br><br>I do not think I will/can.  But I am very concerned for those who will try, now that it is so near, make so attractive, with a lot of covers like family theme etc, and sanctioned by the highest authority, the "government = singaporean".<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br><br>Harms of Legalized Gambling<br>by Ken W. Karouzos, Legislative Coordinator<br><br>http://www.azpolicy.org/html/legalizedgambling.html<br><br>Numerous research studies and other statistical information have identified a strong link between our nationÂ’s recent increase in legalized gambling and increased societal problems.  These problems include increased bankruptcies, suicides, addictions, divorce, child abuse, domestic violence and the exploitation of the poor.<br><br>Increased Bankruptcies.<br><br>Bankruptcies during the mid- and late-1990Â’s have approached record levels despite their paradoxical occurrence during a period of sustained economic growth.<br><br>A national study found that counties having at least one gambling establishment averaged 18% more bankruptcies than those counties without gambling. If the county had five or more gambling facilities, the increased rate was 35% higher.[1]<br><br>A five-year Iowa study found that counties having a casino, racetrack or riverboat casino had a bankruptcy rate averaging 21% higher than the rest of the state.[2]<br><br>Nevada, being the 35th most populous state, ranks 4th in terms of total bankruptcies.[3]<br><br>Atlantic County, New Jersey, home of Atlantic City, has a substantially higher bankruptcy rate than any of New JerseyÂ’s 21 other counties. Prince George's County, Maryland, the only Maryland county where casino gambling was legal in 1996, bankruptcies rate was also substantially higher when compared to MarylandÂ’s 24 other counties.[4]<br><br>Of CaliforniaÂ’s 58 counties, the two with the highest bankruptcy rates, Riverside and San Bernardino, are both adjacent to Las Vegas.[5]<br><br>Gambling-related bankruptcies in metro Detroit increased by as much as 40-fold within a year and a half of the opening of Casino Windsor.[6]<br><br>Various studies of pathological gamblers show that 20% or more eventually file for bankruptcy.[7]<br><br>Increased Suicides.<br><br>Gambling-related suicides are becoming an increasingly common. The extent of this phenomena remains largely unrecognized due to reasons ranging from a desire by family members to protect privacy to attempts by suicide victims to make their deaths appear accidental for insurance purposes. Even so, the evidence paints a grim picture of the depth of despondency which often accompanies gambling habits.<br><br>According to University of California-San Diego sociologist Dr. David Phillips, Las Vegas Â“displays the highest levels of suicide in the nation, both for residents of Las Vegas and for visitors to that setting.Â” In Atlantic City, N.J., Phillips found that Â“abnormally high suicide levels for visitors and residents appeared only after gambling casinos were opened.Â”[8]<br><br>In Gulfport, Mississippi, suicides increased by 213% (from 24 to 75) in the first two years after casinos arrived.  In neighboring Biloxi, suicide attempts jumped by 1,000% (from 6 to 66) in the first year alone.[9]<br><br>The National Council on Problem Gambling, citing various studies, reports that one in five pathological gamblers attempts suicide and that this rate is higher than for any other type of addictive disorder.[10]<br><br>At least 140 clients at MinnesotaÂ’s six gambling addiction treatment centers have attempted suicide, according to the Minneapolis Star Tribune.[11]<br><br>A survey of nearly 200 Gamblers Anonymous members in Illinois found that 79% had wanted to die, 66% had contemplated suicide and 45% had a definite plan to kill themselves.[12]<br><br>The Illinois Council on Compulsive Gambling reports that more than 20 Illinois residents have killed themselves as a result of a gambling addiction since the arrival of riverboat casinos.[13]<br><br>Increased Gambling Addictions.<br><br>Gambling promoters frequently maintain that there is little, if any, relationship between the availability of gambling and gambling addiction. However, testimony from experts and data from gambling communities indicate otherwise.<br><br>The number of Gamblers Anonymous chapters in the United States has nearly doubled in the last eight years.[14]<br><br>According to Dr. Rachel Volberg, researcher who has overseen the majority of compulsive gambling prevalence surveys in the United States, gambling problems have increased noticeably in recent years as gambling has become more widely available.[15]<br><br>The percentage of Minnesota adults who demonstrated a serious gambling problem climbed 76% from 1990 (the year when Minnesota introduced its lottery) to 1994 (the year when a 17th Minnesota casino began operations).[16]<br><br>The percentage of Iowa problem and pathological gamblers rose by over 300% over the six-year period after casinos began operations.[17]<br><br>A court-ordered temporary shutdown of video lottery machines in the state of South Dakota resulted in a drastic reduction of people seeking treatment for gambling addictions.  Before the machines were shut off, addiction treatment centers averaged 11 gamblers treated per month.  During the shut down, the average monthly number of plummeted to less than one per month. Once the machines resumed operations, the average monthly number immediately jumped to 8.[18]<br><br>The percentage of New York individuals who reported having had a gambling problem increased 74% during the decade when gambling opportunities greatly expanded.[19]<br><br>In Oregon, the number of Gamblers Anonymous chapters increased 1,000% within five years of the introduction of video poker machines.[20]<br><br>Increased Divorces<br><br>28% of Gamblers Anonymous members reported being separated or divorced as a direct result of their gambling.[21]<br><br>The National Gambling Impact Study Commission reported that it received "abundant testimony and evidence that compulsive gambling introduces a greatly heightened level of stress and tension into marriages and families, often culminating in divorce and other manifestations of familial disharmony."[22]<br><br>A nationwide survey of divorced adults found that Â“2 million adults identified a spouse's gambling as a significant factor in their prior divorce.Â”[23]<br><br>The number of divorces in Harrison County, Mississippi, which is home to ten casinos, has increased by almost 300% since the introduction of casinos.[24]<br><br>Increased Child Abuse and Neglect<br><br>The National Gambling Impact Study Commission reported: "Children of compulsive gamblers are often prone to suffer abuse, as well as neglect, as a result of parental problem or pathological gambling."[25]<br><br>In Indiana, a review of the state's gaming commission records revealed that 72 children were found abandoned on casino premises during a 14-month period.[26]<br><br>In Louisiana and South Carolina, children died after being locked in hot cars for several hours while their caretakers gambled.[27]<br><br>An Illinois mother suffocated her infant daughter in order to collect insurance money to continue gambling.[28]<br><br>Cases of child abandonment at one of the nation's largest casino, Â“FoxwoodsÂ” in Ledyard, Connecticut, became so commonplace that authorities were forced to post signs in the casino's parking lots warning parents not to leave children in cars unattended.[29]<br><br>Increased Domestic Violence<br><br>According to the National Research Council, studies indicate that between 25% and 50% of spouses of compulsive gamblers have been abused.[30]<br><br>Mississippi domestic violence shelters reported increases between 100% and 300% in requests for assistance after the introduction of casinos on Mississippi's Gulf Coast,.[31]<br><br>A University of Nebraska Medical Center study concluded that problem gambling is as much a risk factor for domestic violence as alcohol abuse.[32]<br><br>Domestic violence murders in at least 11 states have been traced to gambling problems since 1996.[33]<br><br>Increased Rates of Overall Crime<br><br>The crime rate in Minnesota counties with casinos increased more than 200% faster than counties without casinos.[34]<br><br>The overall number of crimes within a 30-mile radius of Atlantic City increased over 100% during the nine years following the introduction of casinos.[35]<br><br>AU.S. News &amp; World Report analysis found average national crime rates in casino communities to be 84% higher than communities without casinos.[36]<br><br>The number of court cases filed in Tunica County, Mississippi, increased by over 1,600% during the five-year period after casinos began operating.[37]<br><br>The annual number of police calls to the Ledyard, Connecticut, jumped over 400% within the five years after the opening of the nearby Foxwoods Casino.[38]<br><br>Nevada ranked first in crime rates among the fifty states in both 1995 and 1996, based on an analysis of FBI Uniform Crime Report statistics.[39]<br><br>University of Nevada-Las Vegas researchers concluded that the state of Wisconsin experiences an average of 5,300 additional major crimes a year due to the presence of casinos in that state. They also attributed an additional 17,100 arrests for less-serious crimes each year to the existence of casino gambling.[40]<br><br>Half of Louisiana District Attorneys surveyed in 1995 noted gambling as a factor in rising crime rates in their jurisdictions.[41]<br><br>Exploitation of the Poor<br><br>A study of 1,800 Minnesotans in state-run gambling treatment programs found that over half had yearly incomes of $20,000 or less. The study also discovered that the amount of debt, as a proportion of income, was highest among the poorest gamblers seeking treatment.[42]<br><br>University of North Florida researchers reported: "Gambling expenditures in Las Vegas indicate a regressive pattern for gambling taxes because the percentage of household income devoted to gambling falls consistently as income rises."[43]<br><br>Half of Illinois casino gamblers with annual incomes below $10,000 reported losing over $1,900 to the casinos in the previous year.[44]<br><br>In New York, those living in the most impoverished areas of the state spent 800% more of their income on lottery tickets than did those living in affluent sections.[45]<br><br>An Associated Press survey of Wisconsin lottery purchases found that residents living in the poorest neighborhoods in the state spent 400% more of their income on lottery tickets than those in wealthier neighborhoods.[46]<br><br>A University of Louisville study showed that Kentuckians with annual incomes less than $15,000 spent $9 per week on lottery tickets, while those earning twice that amount only spent $7.[47]<br><br>A Texas A&amp;M study found that residents earning 2% of the state's total income, provide 10% of the stateÂ’s lottery's revenue.[48]<br><br>[1] "The Personal Bankruptcy Crisis, 1997: Demographics, Causes, Implications &amp; Solutions," SMR Research Corporation, 1997, p. 117.<br>[2] John McCormick, "Many IowanÂ’s Going for Broke," Des Moines Register, June 15, 1997, p. 1.

Only 13 states had lotteries. There was no such thing as a Native American casino. Altogether, Americans wagered about $17 billion on legal commercial gambling.<br><br>Between 1976 and 1988, casinos were legalized in Atlantic City and the number of state lotteries more than doubled. Then, from 1989 to 1994, gambling casinos were legalized in 21 additional states, and slot or video gambling machines were legalized at racetracks and bars in 10 states.<br><br>All told, Americans legally wagered $550 billion on legal gambling in 1995 an astonishing 3,200 percent increase in gambling since 1974.<br><br>Overall, Americans gambled away more than $40 billion in 1995, up from $10.4 billion in 1982. Of all legal betting in America, commercial casinos account for about 76%, Native American tribal gambling 9%, state lotteries 7%, pari-mutuels (including horseracing, dog racing and jai alai) 4%, and charity gambling 4%.<br><br>In 1995, more money was spent on casino gambling than was spent on movie tickets, theater, opera and concerts combined. In 1993, Americans made more trips to casinos than they did to Major League baseball games, NFL football games, symphony concerts and Broadway shows combined.<br><br>* 23 states allow casino gambling. (AZ, CA, CT, MI, MN, MT, NM, NY, NC, ND, OR, WA, WI have tribal casinos; CO, IA, LA, MS, NV, SD have both commercial and tribal casinos; IL, IN, MO, NJ have commercial casinos only.)<br><br>* 2 other states, FL and GA, host casino "cruises to nowhere" where the gambling takes place in international waters.<br><br>* 11 states allow slot or video gambling machines at locations outside of gambling casinos (DE, ID, IA, LA, MT, NV, OR, RI, SC, SD, WV).<br><br>* 37 states and the District of Columbia have a lottery.<br><br>* 10 state lotteries operate Keno games (CO, GA, KS, MD, MA, MI, NY, OR, RI, WA, WV). California's Keno game was recently ruled unconstitutional.<br><br>* Every state except two (Hawaii and Utah) allows some form of legal gambling. While Tennessee allows only pari-mutuel betting, there are currently no legal betting establishments in that state.<br><br>* 46 states permit bingo.<br><br>* 33 states allow betting on horse races.<br><br>* 11 states allow betting on dog races.<br>GAMBLING IS BAD FOR BUSINESS<br><br>The expansion of legalized gambling is a major threat to business in the United States because gambling steals revenues. As Donald Trump candidly explained to the Miami Herald: "People will spend a tremendous amount of money in casinos, money that they would normally spend on buying a refrigerator or a new car. Local businesses will suffer because they'll lose customer dollars to the casinos."<br><br>Cannibalization in Atlantic City:<br><br>In Atlantic City, casinos were legalized in 1976. Four years later, the number of retail businesses in the city had declined by one-third. The number of restaurants in Atlantic City declined from 243 in 1977, the year after casinos were legalized, to 146 in 1987. Only about 10 percent of the businesses nearest to the casino locations in 1976 are still open today. Instead, just off the beach, there are dozens of pawn shops for losing gamblers to sell their jewelry for cash.<br><br>Cannibalization in Minnesota:<br><br>In Minnesota, where Indian casinos are found across the state, restaurant business has fallen by 20 to 50 percent within a 30- mile radius of casinos with food service.<br><br>Cannibalization in South Dakota:<br><br>A study conducted for the State of South Dakota found that, after casino gambling was legalized in 1989 within the town of Deadwood, business declined significantly at nearby restaurants, clothing stores, recreation services, business services, and auto dealers. Within two years, legalized gambling constituted one of the leading causes of business and personal bankruptcies among South Dakota residents.<br><br>Gambling leads to loss of jobs:<br><br>A 1995 report by the Maryland Department of Business &amp; Economic Development estimated the establishment of gambling casinos in Baltimore would result in the loss of 23,000 to 31,000 jobs from the cannibalization of local industries, including "restaurants, retail, other entertainment, and horse racing and breeding." The casinos would add only 14,000 to 15,000 jobs, so the net impact on employment in Baltimore would be a loss of 9,000 to 16,000 full-time jobs. Maryland Department of Business &amp; Economic Development, Office of Business and Economic Research, report on the Economic and Fiscal Impacts from the Introduction of Casino Gambling in Maryland, October 1995.<br>GAMBLING ESTABLISHMENTS ATTRACT CRIME<br><br>In 1994, when their state was considering legalized casino gambling, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, Florida Sheriffs Association and Florida Police Chiefs Association issued a joint report which concluded, "Casino gambling will mean...that crime rates will go up. It means the community will see--and have to confront--more vagrants, prostitutes, domestic violence, and gambling addiction. It means our communities will be less safe and secure."<br><br>In 1995, the Attorney General of Maryland issued a report entitled "The House Never Loses and Maryland Cannot Win: Why Casino Gaming is a Bad Idea." That report explains: "Casinos would bring a substantial increase in crime to our State. There would be more violent crime, more crimes against property, more insurance fraud, more white collar crime, more juvenile crime, more drug and alcohol-related crime, more domestic violence and child abuse, and more organized crime."<br><br>Gambling attracts street criminals:<br><br>Atlantic City's crime rate rose an incredible 258 percent within ten years of the legalization of casinos. In Gulfport and Biloxi, Mississippi, the site of 11 out of 13 casinos in that state, crime increased in every category in 1994, with murder, rape, robbery and car theft at least doubling. Three years after casinos were legalized in Deadwood, South Dakota, felony crimes increased by 40 percent, child abuse was up 42 percent, domestic violence and assaults rose 80 percent.<br><br>Pathological gamblers feed their addiction:<br><br>More than half of all pathological gamblers will commit crimes in order to pay off gambling debts, particularly financial crimes like embezzlement, check kiting, credit card fraud, loan fraud, insurance fraud, and tax evasion. Pathological gamblers are responsible for an estimated $1.3 billion worth of insurance- related fraud per year. In addition, problem gamblers will commit domestic violence and child abuse. For example, since casinos came to the Mississippi Gulf Coast, domestic violence has increased 69 percent, and it is estimated that 37 percent of all pathological gamblers have abused their children.<br><br>Legal gambling benefits organized crime:<br><br>William Jahoda, who formerly managed illegal gambling operations for the Chicago mob, testified before the House Judiciary Committee in 1995 that "any new form or expansion of existing State-controlled licensed gambling always increased our market share" because advertising greatly increased the number of gamblers.<br>GAMBLING IS BAD FOR FAMILIES<br><br>Legalized gambling triggers the mental disorder of pathological (or "compulsive") gambling. Pathological gambling destroys the lives of thousands of Americans and devastates their families, friends and employers. The most common argument in favor of gambling expansion is that it will yield government revenues which can be used for programs to "help" people. But helping some people by exploiting and destroying others is bad social policy, and simply unethical.<br><br>More gambling means more gambling addicts:<br><br>Experts on pathological gambling believe that the prevalence rate of this disorder is linked to the accessibility and acceptability of gambling. In short, the more legalized gambling a state makes available, the more pathological behavior is triggered. And fast-paced gambling that maximizes the number of wagering opportunities (like casinos and video gambling machines), also maximizes gambling addiction.<br><br>In Iowa, a study released in July 1995 found that 5.4 percent of the state's adults (roughly 110,000 residents) are lifetime pathological or problem gamblers. Before riverboats came to that state, only 1.7 percent of Iowans were lifetime pathological or problem gamblers. In other words, the legalization of casinos has more than tripled the addiction problem.<br><br>The 1995 Iowa study concluded: "The hypothesis that increases in the availability of legalized gambling lead to increases in the prevalence of gambling-related difficulties in the general population is clearly demonstrated."<br><br>Creating a generation of problem gamblers:<br><br>Researchers now call gambling the fastest growing teenage addiction, with the rate of pathological gambling among high school and college-age youth about twice that of adults. According to Dr. Howard J. Shaffer, Director of the Harvard Medical School Center for Addiction Studies, "Today, there are more children experiencing adverse symptoms from gambling than from drugs...and the problem is growing."<br><br>Casinos profit from gambling addiction:<br><br>In his testimony before the House Judiciary Committee in September, Professor Earl Grinols presented evidence that pathological and problem gamblers, representing only 4 percent of the adult population, account for 52 percent of an average casino's revenues. "In this respect, casino gambling resembles alcohol for which 6.7 percent of the population consumes 50 percent of all alcohol consumed."<br><br>NCALG Information Library</div>

Notice some of the keywords by the MD: "skilled", "control", "not addicted", "patiently wait" are used to sum up what it takes to be professional gambler. Unfortunately most of us are impatient, lack the proper skill &amp; think that we are very smart or lucky = losers!<br><br>Robert L. Custer, M.D., identified six types of gamblers:<br><br>1) Professional gamblers<br>Professional gamblers make their living by gambling and thus consider it<br>a profession. They are skilled in the games they choose to play and are able<br>to control both the amount of money and time spent gambling. Thus,<br>professional gamblers are not addicted to gambling. They patiently wait for<br>the best bet and then try to win as much as they can.<br><br>2) Anti-social or personality gamblers<br><br>In contrast to professional gamblers, antisocial or personality gamblers<br>use gambling as a way to get money by illegal means. They are likely to be<br>involved in fixing horse or dog races, or playing with loaded dice or marked<br>cards. They may attempt to use a compulsive gambling diagnosis as a legal<br>defense.<br><br>3) Casual social gamblers<br><br>Casual social gamblers gamble for recreation, sociability and<br>entertainment. For them, gambling may be a distraction or a form of<br>relaxation. Gambling does not interfere with family, social or vocational<br>obligations. Examples of such betting are the occasional poker game, Super<br>Bowl bets, a yearly trip to Las Vegas and casual involvement in the lottery.<br><br>4) Serious social gamblers<br><br>In contrast, serious social gamblers invest more of their time in<br>gambling. Gambling is a major source of relaxation and entertainment, yet<br>these individuals place gambling second in importance to family and<br>vocation. This type of gambler could be compared to a "golf nut," whose<br>source of relaxation comes from playing golf. Serious social gamblers still<br>maintain control over their gambling activities.<br><br>5) Relief and escape gamblers<br><br>Custer's fifth type, relief and escape gamblers, gamble to find relief<br>from feelings of anxiety, depression, anger, boredom or loneliness. They use<br>gambling to escape from crisis or difficulties. Gambling provides an<br>analgesic effect rather than a euphoric response. Relief and escape gamblers<br>are not compulsive gamblers. They are identical to relief and escape<br>drinkers.<br><br>6) Compulsive gamblers<br>Compulsive gamblers have lost control over their gambling. For them,<br>gambling is the most important thing in their lives. Compulsive gambling is<br>a progressive addiction that harms every aspect of the gambler's life. As<br>they continue to gamble, their families, friends and employers are<br>negatively affected. In addition, compulsive gamblers may engage in<br>activities such as stealing, lying or embezzling which go against their<br>moral standards. Compulsive gamblers cannot stop gambling, no matter how<br>much they want to or how hard they try.</div>
