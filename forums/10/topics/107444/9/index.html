You people will only say..oh...is his responsibilty...who ask him to gamble? Let me ask you, if there were no casino; will he be fell into this evil trade?? If you say; same thing, he can go illegal gambling den. If you were to be him you think you dare to go to the illegal gambling den??? Chances are very Vey Very slim right??? So what's your point???<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>So how ? Do your friend decide to study in china since china do not have casinoes ? Face it man, most developed countries have casinoes. London, america, australia, japan, korea, malaysia. Heck, even china have casinoes since macau is part of china.

Instead, it is the usual casino consisting of hotel, leisure etc and probably 500 gaming tables.<br><br>This casino thing is the last chance to turn around the Singapore's traditional pro-foreign investment economic strategy to revive its recent years of decline in its economic competitiveness.<br><br>To seize this opportunity, I thought our scholars would be putting up a well-considered overall economic master plan with casino as kingpin to strategize international marketing and networking e.g. any Fortune 500 companies may want to set up total business windows here to sell products and services to the world. Call centres run by EDB will facilitate setting up of businesses here and linking to all SMEs. Businessmen all over the world, may want to park their monies here to benefit from our financial hubbing and banking network.<br><br>I only see social problems ahead and the casino remaining a cut-off and isolate operation since there is no such networking strategy to integrate casino to businesses or investments opportunities to and from Singapore.<br><br>What is the point of making promise to set up integrated casino if there is no accountable and transparent plan being put to implementation up to this late stage.<br><br>Do we have scholars or talents or master economic plan to run the next lap?<br><br>How to revive the weakening Singapore domestic sector of the economy which now needs the utmost help because of high costs?<br><br>What is the government's concept of integrated casino? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"></div>
