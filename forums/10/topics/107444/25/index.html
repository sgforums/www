            <div class='col-md body'>Speaking of credibility, the leaders have been talking about plan to increase the population from 1990s but failed. The last year of the dragon saw the highest birth then population growth came back down.<br><br>Then came the double whammy to the population growth in the form of migration of the educated due to erroneous elitist education policy.<br><br>Thousands are migrating every year to Australia, USA, Canada, even China ..Net population will continue to be insignificant and small.<br><br>The post-war baby boomers who started businesses and set up factories during the 1970s and 1980s are retiring at 55-60 in large number from 2001 to 2006. These founding entrepreneurs were not being helped due to high-cost, pro-foreign business policies and government going into businesses to compete against them. Therefore the economy is going to slow down further.<br><br>Past economic strategy was to (1) set up Jurong to industrialise --1960s (2) graduate from labor-intensive to capital-intensive --1970s (3) upgrade to value-add sectors -- 1980s.<br><br>The economy since 1980s were heavily dependent on foreign investments without pursuit of any parallel plan to build own capabilities. One hundred and one reasons will be given not to help the locals and SMEs. Under such short-sighted economic planning, any value-adding plans would only be nothing but ad hoc or random.<br><br>Yet, without an overall economic master plan to leverage our strengths and counter our weaknesses, the economy is basically directionless. The local businesses are suffering and suffering without much help from the government.<br><br>As I see it, Singapore past policies are causing the economy to flounder badly during the last two recessions. Other Asian economies are recovering faster than our economy. The standard of living of the people are dropping back to the 1970s due to unemployments, lower salaries and asset bubble bursts.<br><br>South Korea has gone through the same Asian Financial crisis and recessions. It has come up on top with better manufacturing growths. Its own MNCs are churning out large number of world-beating products and keeping up the economic race.<br><br>The local businesses are dying and MNCs are progressively moving out to less costly destinations.<br><br>Leaders are not consistent and focused in implementing a creative economic master plan to provide directions to help all to compete in world market. They are truly running out of ideas despite all the claims of their own talents.<br><br>The above-stated reasons i.e. loss of economic planning strategy etc, are precisely why we need to go for increasing the population growth, more participation by youths in politics etc. If the fundamental errors as posted are not corrected our leaders will have to do all the unnecessary things like trying to get more babies or set up a casino.<br><br>Where is the true leadership and talents among them to grow or nurture more entrepreneurs or overcome our loss of economic competitiveness due to high costs created by them or simply lack of ideas.<br><br>Now that the economy is having a "back to the black" correction in 2004 after two prolonged recessions of 1996-1999 and 2001-2003, the leaders will be quick to claim credit for the recovery when actually such a recovery is part of the cyclical up-and-down of world economy.<br><br>More ideas are needed to revive the present economy. The first task is to come up with a vibrant economic master plan and produce a strong team to carry out the plan if Singaporeans are to maintain their asset values or earn a better living.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">The figures may not be all bluff. But they are doubtful, same as the 35,000 jobs predicted to be created by casino. </span></strong><br><br>So far some of the figures given by the government may be at most misleading, but it do contain some honest statistically truth in it<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">The onus is on the government making the decision to build casino to prove its arguments on facts and logics not the anti-casinosites to do so. The worse decision is to make it and ask the people to try it out to see what happens. Such an attitude verges on downright irresponsible - 72,000 lives in danger of being destroyed !!! </span></strong><br><br>I believe in the Gov view, they had already presented the necessary facts and logic to build a casino. It is difficult to conduct studies on the effect of casino on its people when it was not built yet. If I am not wrong, most of the reports are based on studies after the casino were built. Furthermore, different regions report of vastly different conclusion. The result gathered from Las Vegas or Macau may be vastly different from the result gathered from regions which you had described. We do not know if such studies have been done either<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Why not conduct a more objective study to make a really good decision acceptable to all without getting in the casino operators to pull wools over our eyes. Evaluate the whole gains and losses and then decide at the end indeed whether casino will create 35,000 jobs after offsetting job losses arising from negative impacts, bankruptcies etc over say 5 years. For all anyone knows, casino may lose its attraction after one year as tourists decide that our casinos are not that attractive after all. There is also the question of how many jobs will go to the locals. </span></strong><br><br>I am unclear on these few points... How should the studies be conducted if we do not know what form of casinoes is going to be built ? How accurate will this study into the future 5 years be we do not have a casino ?

Every country is battling hand and foot to improve their economy capabilities and they became competitors with each other at almost all economy front to gain a niche.

The pro-casino people may be projecting a totally different future scenario such as life in Singapore improves, more fiancial welfare is given to the people, tourism improves, city become more lively and became a global metropolis, local gambling problem tackled by education and restrictions given, long term economy values such as productivity were not affected as what most countries with casino do not experience such problems etc. Truth is no one really knows what will happen in the future. It may really become as bad as you described and it may very well performed as expected by the Gov. Almost every economy decisions involves certain risks. We can not just stop here and never take any risks which may improve on our life. All talk and no actions is a sin by itself. Since the decision is to build casinoes, which to a large percentage of the population is the most sensible thing to do, we should now focus on trying to maximise the advantages that can be gathered from the building of such casinoes and minimise the impact of them.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">for these short terms gains, what are the eventual long term sacrifices? what are a few more buildings if they are empty or devoid of soul? </span></strong><br><br>What are the eventual long term sacrifices is unknown, but at least the short term gains are clear.

We are lagging behind.<br><br>For your second question, in terms of tourism, we are increasing lagging behind since there are no new interesting tourism spot in here.<br><br>For your third question, there may really be nothing else that will improve the situation significantly left to do.

If we don't fix it now, then when should we fix it ?<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">that is what the govt wants us to believe. it is their Â‘justificationÂ’ for setting up another jackpot machine. if you want my ideas about tourism, look under the thread Â“super globalÂ”. </span></strong><br><br>I have briefly browse through and if I am not wrong, you are trying to say that we should drop off tourism and focus on other economy isn't it ? Personally, I think that there is room for improvement in our tourist sector and having a more diversified economy (including tourism) will aid Singapore in the long run. Tourists money will be increasing from this point onwards due to increasing affluent people in the world and cheaper airfare. It will not be prudent to forsake this pie<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">as a nation-wide initiative concerning the lives of every singaporean, Â“mayÂ” is really unacceptable. given the fundamental mismatch between this initiative and our core strengths and values, the downside risks outweigh whatever possible upside gains.</span></strong><br><br>"May" is the answer for almost all economy decisions. There is really no such things as "confirm win" in the world we are living in now. As said before, you believe that the downside outweigh whatever possible upside gains. But there are many people, such as me myself, believes that the upside gain beats whatever downside disadvantages.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">when you let your imagination be confined by official arguments, youÂ’d be left with only two choices, take a big gamble or starve to death. if we follow their arguments unquestioningly, we unwittingly end up blindfolded. ask yourself are we really starving to death? there are reasons why they say what they said. itÂ’s meant to simultaneously tug at our heartstrings and numb our brains</span></strong><br><br>Personally, our standard of living here is stagnant for a long time. We are not starving to death (only the very poor country suffer this), but we are pinning for increase in pay, improve in bonus and increase in employment for a long time now. And frankly, either it is the mismanagement of Singapore Gov in the past or because our resources are really too limited, I don't think we have any good solutions to our economy problems where MNC are continuously moving away from Singapore. A casino indeed do help our economy and it may acts as rain to a land facing drought for a long time now. If we don't make any bold decisions, we are indeed dying a slow death.</div>
