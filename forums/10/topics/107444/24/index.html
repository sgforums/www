            <div class='col-md body'>It is a long time since I have written anything at the forums<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Remember this, SM Goh said after signing the FTA with the US President last year that the overall benefits of signing a US FTA will amount to a projection of an increase of 50,000 jobs in the local job market. But what has happened in the year passed the FTA signing and later US congressional approval? </span></strong><br><br>My personal opinion is, it is really difficult to say that the FTA have not added 50,000 jobs to the local job market. According to reports on umemployment, it was stated that in 2004 alone 66,200 jobs were created in Singapore. If we look at the year after the FTA was signed between Singapore and USA, there have been a flurry of activities in the international committees to sign up FTA with each other. Personally I think that the FTA is overall a good policy to improve the economic situation in Singapore. Can I enquire how do you conclude the figure is all bluff ?<br><br><a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/01/31/bloomberg/sxsing.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/01/31/bloomberg/sxsing.html</a><br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">By calling on operators to present, perspective will definitely be biased. We will see casino full of benefits and will end up with a biased positive look-good picture. This kind of approach in decision is not good for debates and if we accept the casino decision, we are in effect supporting casino for casino or casino operator's sake. Our economy cannot benefit very much from such an approach in making the casino decision. </span></strong><br><br>There is a doubt I need to clarify... how do you know that the statistics given by the government were figures given by the casino operators and not from studies from a neutral party ? I do agree with you that the government should provide us with where he get its source of information. Whether is the figure correct, no one can really know but it is probably an approximation to answer questions from the people who demand to know the actual benefits to the economy. On the long term social problems, it really do get mentioned in such as 35,000 jobs added. If asked on the actual figures for the problems, they do states that 2% of the gamblers are expected to be pathological gamblers an more help will be given to these group of people. On whether is any master plan presented, they do tell of scenaros where the IR will become the hype of Asia, the liveliness of the city will increase and more business will be brought in. It had been mentioned, but it is not accepted by the anti-casino people as tey do nto knwo where it comes from. As said before, now the only thing the Gov can do is approximate. The casino is not built yet and any studies done on it by any organisations or people is at best approximation. Please suggest what form of studies should be conducted and by which organisation or people.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">It is a poor decision not supported by true objective debates of those who take part in real debates. There may be jobs created but there will also social problems and negative impact of casino on non-tourism sectors. More monies may be drained out to foreigners from Singaporeans over the long term. The anti-casino people are not necessarily wrong. </span></strong><br><br>There are valid arguments from the pro-casino side as well as valid points raised by the anti-casino sides. Truth is both sides are merely speculating, the pro-casino side painted a very optimistic picture while the anti-casino side painted a bleak one. We can't go on like this debating on what the future is like forever because nobody really knows. A year has gone since the debate on the IR and I believe a quicker response and decisiveness is important to deal with the changing world. In the end a decision had to be made on deciding which is the lesser of the 2 evils, and it was decided to be building the IR. Whether is it a poor decision remains to be seen.<br><br><strong>[I]The government should present the casino debate to the people and not to ramp it down. It can be more objective in its study not colored by casino operators' interests in this matter. The figures of job creation when balanced against potential job losses and social problems, may not be that great to support the casino decision. [/I]</strong><br><br>I don't really see any ramping down on the debate on casinoes. I see many internet forums discussing casineos openly, I hear radios talk shows on the casino and I also watch TVs show on the casino as well. On it being more objective, may I enquire on the means to achieve that.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">A better way to present the casino debates should be to consider it from an overall economic master plan and show how the government will use casino coupled with our excellent location advantages (as compared with other casinos) to stimulate overall economic growth. </span></strong><br><br>I thought the stated master plan is that the IRs will add in the vibrancy of the city. Tourism will improve, companies be attracted and so Singapore will overall become a better nation. What else should we need ? May I enquire more details on your idea of masterplan; how long should it be projected, what constitute a master plan, how flexible should the masterplan be in this everchanging environment and how realistic can it be.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">People have been informed that the pathological gamblers are about 2% of the gamblers. This figure is hard to believe by common sense. It looks biased as presented by pro-casino camp without the inputs of concerned citizens. A more objective study and presentation has not been given as stated in the forgoing. </span></strong><br><br>Personally this figure appears to be very believable. How many Singaporean had went to Cruise ships and Genting before ? Are a bulk of these people becoming pathological gamblers ? How do you know the figure is presented by the pro-casino sides and not projected from the anti-casino side ?<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">If government has the concern of citizens at heart, it should come clean. Do not present the whole issue through the casino operators' perspective or proposals received. Be more objective and neutral by letting non-casino people conduct their own arguments based on facts and studies done which clearly show that casino has a serious impact on population. Let the facts be more clearly presented in perspective and not so constrained by cabinet's own desire or wishes. </span></strong><br><br>The Gov is not denying that there may be serious impacts to the casino, and they do propose measures to curb it. Even the anti-casino people acknowledge that a casino do bring in certain advantages to he people as well. Therefore, why not try to harnest the potential good advantages the casino will bring to Singapore while minimising the potential problems linked with it and brought us to more favourable situation. That will be the best scenario to our country isn't it ?</div>

You can't let your disappointment that you failed to prevent the PAP administration from agreeing to a casino cloud the fact that your views definitely were heard.<br><br>Whether they did take it into <strong>serious</strong> consideration is a totally different matter.<br><br>For that I am sure they did, because all along our country was opposed to a casino that when the question was tossed in the air again, they surely needed to study the population's reactions to the casino.

            <div class='col-md body'>So much for defending the govt's decision on having IRs isn't it?<br><br>I've read through everything, everything that is pro-casino and it's all abt the same. <span style="font-style: italic;">"The IRs will succeed, S'pore tourism will improve, jobs will be added, and everything will be fine and dandy! Yeah, high fives man!"</span><br><br>My question is this- what if it fails to succeed? What happens if- obviously after an initial surge of curious visitors for the first few mths- the tourists start to go back to other places such as Bangkok, Malaysia or Macau because they feel S'pore do not offer any variety?<br><br>My issue is not about morals by the way- my issue is on two things:<br><br>1) The govt has had made their decision 1 yr ago to have IRs. So the debate from that point till last monday was just a wayang. So really since they weren't gonna consider any more, then why have a yr long debate?<br><br>2) What if the casinos fail and tourists fail to come back in the long term? Sure some will come back initially because they will get curious abt a casino in S'pore- but I'm talking long term. Because casinos operate on profit- if the tourists decides that there's nothing on offer on a S'pore casino, they will go back to Macau.<br><br>Long term means 5 yrs, 10 yrs down the road. And if the IRs fail to attract tourists on a long term basis, then these IRs will be a costly mistake. And who will then bear the burden? Unfortunately, it won't be those at the top- it will always be the people at the grassroots- yes, I'm referring to us.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by socrates:</div><div class="quote_body">It is a long time since I have written anything at the forums<br>[b]<span style="font-style: italic;">RT:Remember this, SM Goh said after signing the FTA with the US President last year that the overall benefits of signing a US FTA will amount to a projection of an increase of 50,000 jobs in the local job market. But what has happened in the year passed the FTA signing and later US congressional approval? </span></div></blockquote><blockquote>SOC:My personal opinion is, it is really difficult to say that the FTA have not added 50,000 jobs to the local job market. According to reports on umemployment, it was stated that in 2004 alone 66,200 jobs were created in Singapore. If we look at the year after the FTA was signed between Singapore and USA, there have been a flurry of activities in the international committees to sign up FTA with each other. Personally I think that the FTA is overall a good policy to improve the economic situation in Singapore. Can I enquire how do you conclude the figure is all bluff ? </blockquote>The figures may not be all bluff. But they are doubtful, same as the 35,000 jobs predicted to be created by casino.<br><br><blockquote>RT:<strong><span style="font-style: italic;">By calling on operators to present, perspective will definitely be biased. We will see casino full of benefits and will end up with a biased positive look-good picture. This kind of approach in decision is not good for debates and if we accept the casino decision, we are in effect supporting casino for casino or casino operator's sake. Our economy cannot benefit very much from such an approach in making the casino decision. </span></strong></blockquote><blockquote>SOC:There is a doubt I need to clarify... how do you know that the statistics given by the government were figures given by the casino operators and not from studies from a neutral party ? I do agree with you that the government should provide us with where he get its source of information. Whether is the figure correct, no one can really know but it is probably an approximation to answer questions from the people who demand to know the actual benefits to the economy. On the long term social problems, it really do get mentioned in such as 35,000 jobs added. If asked on the actual figures for the problems, they do states that 2% of the gamblers are expected to be pathological gamblers an more help will be given to these group of people. On whether is any master plan presented, they do tell of scenaros where the IR will become the hype of Asia, the liveliness of the city will increase and more business will be brought in. It had been mentioned, but it is not accepted by the anti-casino people as tey do nto knwo where it comes from. As said before, now the only thing the Gov can do is approximate. The casino is not built yet and any studies done on it by any organisations or people is at best approximation. Please suggest what form of studies should be conducted and by which organisation or people. </blockquote>To present a good and objective debate on casino, it would be best to keep an open mind. By inviting casino operators so early even before evaluating job gains and job losses and social problems to present their proposals on number of jobs to be created, the debates have missed something very critical. The debates were biased not objective or balanced.<br><br>Why not publish the original full survey results regions by regions of negative impacts from casino not just the 2% supposed pathological gamblers given by the ministers. Many existing casinos in UK were not doing well and have to be upgraded or regrouped to make them viable. Has the government considered this fact? It was revealed unwittingly by the ministers that the existing pathological gamblers were already 2 %. Once the casinos were set up, by proximity factor, surely the pathological gamblers will be higher or much higher than 2 % lah. Has the minister Dr. V considered told the complete fact?<br><br><blockquote>RT:<strong><span style="font-style: italic;">It is a poor decision not supported by true objective debates of those who take part in real debates. There may be jobs created but there will also social problems and negative impact of casino on non-tourism sectors. More monies may be drained out to foreigners from Singaporeans over the long term. The anti-casino people are not necessarily wrong. </span></strong></blockquote><blockquote>SOC:There are valid arguments from the pro-casino side as well as valid points raised by the anti-casino sides. Truth is both sides are merely speculating, the pro-casino side painted a very optimistic picture while the anti-casino side painted a bleak one. We can't go on like this debating on what the future is like forever because nobody really knows. A year has gone since the debate on the IR and I believe a quicker response and decisiveness is important to deal with the changing world. In the end a decision had to be made on deciding which is the lesser of the 2 evils, and it was decided to be building the IR. Whether is it a poor decision remains to be seen. </blockquote>The onus is on the government making the decision to build casino to prove its arguments on facts and logics not the anti-casinosites to do so. The worse decision is to make it and ask the people to try it out to see what happens. Such an attitude verges on downright irresponsible - 72,000 lives in danger of being destroyed !!!<br><br><blockquote>RT:<strong>[I]The government should present the casino debate to the people and not to ramp it down. It can be more objective in its study not colored by casino operators' interests in this matter. The figures of job creation when balanced against potential job losses and social problems, may not be that great to support the casino decision. [/I]</strong></blockquote><blockquote>SOC:I don't really see any ramping down on the debate on casinoes. I see many internet forums discussing casineos openly, I hear radios talk shows on the casino and I also watch TVs show on the casino as well. On it being more objective, may I enquire on the means to achieve that. </blockquote>Why not conduct a more objective study to make a really good decision acceptable to all without getting in the casino operators to pull wools over our eyes. Evaluate the whole gains and losses and then decide at the end indeed whether casino will create 35,000 jobs after offsetting job losses arising from negative impacts, bankruptcies etc over say 5 years. For all anyone knows, casino may lose its attraction after one year as tourists decide that our casinos are not that attractive after all. There is also the question of how many jobs will go to the locals.<br><br><blockquote>RT:<strong><span style="font-style: italic;">A better way to present the casino debates should be to consider it from an overall economic master plan and show how the government will use casino coupled with our excellent location advantages (as compared with other casinos) to stimulate overall economic growth. </span></strong></blockquote><blockquote>SOC:I thought the stated master plan is that the IRs will add in the vibrancy of the city. Tourism will improve, companies be attracted and so Singapore will overall become a better nation. What else should we need ? May I enquire more details on your idea of masterplan; how long should it be projected, what constitute a master plan, how flexible should the masterplan be in this everchanging environment and how realistic can it be.</blockquote>I cannot see integration to tourism in passing as an economic master plan at all. Without a total master plan to integrate to all business or major business sectors to upgrade our economic competitiveness, how can the MM say "without casino, our economy will be worse off" Such utterances were obviously without basis.<br><br><blockquote>RT:<strong><span style="font-style: italic;">People have been informed that the pathological gamblers are about 2% of the gamblers. This figure is hard to believe by common sense. It looks biased as presented by pro-casino camp without the inputs of concerned citizens. A more objective study and presentation has not been given as stated in the forgoing. </span></strong></blockquote><blockquote>SOC<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">ersonally this figure appears to be very believable. How many Singaporean had went to Cruise ships and Genting before ? Are a bulk of these people becoming pathological gamblers ? How do you know the figure is presented by the pro-casino sides and not projected from the anti-casino side ? </blockquote>A belief is only a belief. The party who makes the decision should substantiate the decision with facts from objective and balanced study not just beliefs or assumptions as being done by MM. If not done, the casino decision will remain a poor decision.<br><br><blockquote>RT:<strong><span style="font-style: italic;">If government has the concern of citizens at heart, it should come clean. Do not present the whole issue through the casino operators' perspective or proposals received. Be more objective and neutral by letting non-casino people conduct their own arguments based on facts and studies done which clearly show that casino has a serious impact on population. Let the facts be more clearly presented in perspective and not so constrained by cabinet's own desire or wishes. </span></strong></blockquote><blockquote>SOC:<strong>The Gov is not denying that there may be serious impacts to the casino, and they do propose measures to curb it. Even the anti-casino people acknowledge that a casino do bring in certain advantages to he people as well. Therefore, why not try to harnest the potential good advantages the casino will bring to Singapore while minimising the potential problems linked with it and brought us to more favourable situation. That will be the best scenario to our country isn't it ? </strong></blockquote>The government did not deny that the social impacts were serious, but it has failed to do sufficient homework by making a more objective study and quantifying potential job losses and social problems. That is the whole point I have made in this post. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

The problem is : government people are propagating their views here in the shallow.<br><br>We are already suffering from economic stagnation due to a lack of really good competitive economic strategy.<br><br>Many problems e.g. lack of entrepreneurs, high costs of living and class divisions were created by over-simplistic or over-pragmatic past policies. Government views are being propagated to emphasise on many unworkable past policies in this forum as well.<br><br>Forumers are pressured by pro-establishment views and some become confused. We will need to stay alert and counter these establishment views and examine them even more closely.<br><br>Their views on casino are very one-sided like the meritocracy education and non-welfarism policies which will continue to cause many problems. The view of the government that "without casino, we will be worse off" is too shallow and not correct.<br><br>If government wants to give their views to support casino here by all means. But personally, I believe that the government views about casino are incorrect and too biased. All forumers should stay collective and alert and try to formulate new thinking and something valuable without feeling pressurd by views to please government. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
