We call it "crossing the threshold" Once she crosses that alien threshold, she became an alien to her own family, and it is a threshold of no return. The happy bride knows it, and had to live with it all the rest her life into the new family with her husband, not with her parents! In life, we all had important decisons; both at personal level and family level, and at our national level the threshold we cross affect all Singaporeans. Our GARMEN always chooses the right and wise decisions. It is our hope and prayers that it will be the right ones in the years to come.<br>We need to take risks,not risk our national life for a bleak future.<br>***During the Oxford forum, Dr. V.B. said he is willing to assume the responsibility of failure.
