Why ? Because they can build it anywhere they want if it is just an integrated resort. All countries r begging companies to come over to their countries to build an integrated resort. Why build it in singapore ? They prefer to build it in places like china, macau, hong kong, thailand or malaysia isn't it ? Why waste investment in a place like singapore where the land is more expensive and the appeal to tourists is lesser. Have we not appeal to disney to set up a theme park here ?

Why have a huge casino and let gambling<br>addiction,  prostitution, crime, etc flourish when we already have many legal<br>gambling outlets (says the PM)?<br><br>Companies do not want to develop an integrated resort without a casino. Why ? Because they can build it anywhere they want if it is just an integrated resort. All countries r begging companies to come over to their countries to build an integrated resort. Why build it in singapore ? They prefer to build it in places like china, macau, hong kong, thailand or malaysia isn't it ? Why waste investment in a place like singapore where the land is more expensive and the appeal to tourists is lesser. Have we not appeal to disney to set up a theme park here ? They prefer hong kong in the end.<br><br></blockquote>Obviously casino proponents have the idea of marketing and convincing the public of an integrated resort (which is no different from a smokescreen to shield the gambling operators running their core gambling businesses).  That's so untruthful and reveals their very dishonest business practices with gimmicks to sweeten and hoodwink the public.<br><br>That it is being pushed ahead at racing speed (and they're considering having  2-3 casinos)  to make a quick buck to improve bottomlines giving lip service and brushing aside the social ills and costs makes it even more urgent for the opponents and the people of Singapore to reject the concept and proposals that primarily serves the (pro)gamblers  and not the people of Singapore.<br><br>What the country needs and Singaporeans want is not an integrated casino resort than bans them (or imposes hefty entry charges - being a form of tax) but a truly, family-oriented recreational and entertainment integrated resort....without any mega gambling activities and companies operating it.<br>We still get to create jobs, more tourist numbers, higher government collections and every Singaporean to enjoy it than banned. We get all the good things and not subject to anyone (even tourists) risks that destroy lives that no one (not even the PM) will take responsibility.<br><br>And yes, from CNA debate last night, the money-minded policy-makers are considering having more than one casino, even 2-5 in the years to come.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>
