            <div class='col-md body'>Integrated Casino? Is it just a pipe dream? How would the government propose to integrate? Integrate to which sectors?<br><br>Although there have been severall announcements that Singapore's casino if set up will be an integrated casino, this may be just a make-belief to persuade people to agree to the idea.<br><br>Where is the call centre or master economic re-structuring plan to assure that there will be full spin-offs to all industries to use casino indeed to stimulate the moribund economy. Domestic sector is now dead or dying from high costs.<br><br>Some questions on integration:<br><br>(1) Is integration or hubbing equal to sum of the partsshown in the plan?<br><br>(2) If our casino is only benefitting tourism and entertainments, is that what they call integrated casino or hubbing?<br><br>(3) Where is the master mind of master plan to do all the practical and call-centre fully structured integration or hubbing?<br><br>Without drawing up clearly established whole families entertainment and provide total facilities and call centres to integrate to all-industry business operations to attract global businessmen, Singapore will be just like any other gambling cities.<br><br>We already have certain advantages in industries like oil, petroleum, bio-tech, logistics, air-travel, sea cruises and many more. Where is the integration to motivate locals to get connected to foreign investors to establish up- and down-stream business activities with call-centre linkages?<br><br>Do we have process management to create spin-offs, wheeling and dealing. Real entrepreneurs go around to smell deals to create tie-ups to their principal activities. Do our officers have these smell sensors?<br><br>Tourism, leisures and entertainment businesses will not benefit from spin-offs from casino businesses if they are not linked operationally.<br><br>Businessmen will not come unless EDB/MTI/TDB have all the necessary connections and networks connected to on-going trades, commerce and services of businessmen seeking expansions to this region in tie-ups or local investments.<br><br>How will EDB/MTI/TDB integrate travelers and businessmen through one-stop call centre for exchanges or conferences to synergise various activities.<br><br>So it is doubtful at this stage to see casino being integrated to create real spin-offs in terms of hubbing to all businesses, not even tourism and entertainment. There is no point in having a casino.<br><br>It will only create social problems for future generations because of uncertainty in creating business benefits and jobs.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hello, all forumers,<br><br>As the ministers have said that "the government can do without a casino if casino operators' proposals do not meet certain prerequisites"<br><br>Such statements are ambiqious and do not show accountability and transparency to concerned citizens.<br><br>My questions are:<br><br>ADVANTAGES:<br><br>Are they so overwhelming that Singapore can swop for the social fallouts like increases in crimes, indebtedness, moral and social degradation and lowering of standards for upbringing of children.<br><br>Are the ministers willing to come out with a long-overdue economic master plan like the Urban Redevelopment Master Plan to oversee the entire economic restructuring with casino as catalyst to generate vibrancy and create business and investment spin-offs to all industries.<br><br>There is no sign of any practical and sustenable integration to create business and investment opportunities to benefit all. Without practical integration or leaving integration to be worked out by the bureaucrats, will the casino achieve the primary purpose - integration to business hubs.<br><br>DISADVANTAGES:<br><br>There are distinctly many disadvantages and social problems can become immense in time to come. Is the government expecting the problems to get solved by themselves or along the way like the worksite safety problems which led to highway collapse.<br><br>Good decisions are good only when there is a high degree of probability of follow-through implementation with proper process management taking care of problems, convincing evaluations of costs and benefits. As scholars the ministers should not just make judgmental decisions, they should be accountable and transparent with confident implementation, costs and benefits analysis. Just by saying that "we will be studying all the plans and feedbacks before going ahead with casino is not a good decision or good governance."<br><br>This casino issue allows the leaders another opportunity to show its accountability and transparency in governance. If they say that they are now open, accountable and transparent, show the master plan and evaluation of costs and benefits and get people to support the decision based on facts.<br><br>If the people see the facts crucial to decision in this instance and are unconvinced, say by way of sufficient poll, will the leaders still keep its promise to "do without the casino?<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br><br>I refer to media reports that the government is formally inviting potential investors to submit their concept plans to build an integrated casino resort in Singapore, and has unveiled a list of minimum social safeguards to mitigate the ill-effects of gaming.<br><br>Among the safeguards, Singapore citizens and permanent residents will have to pay membership fees to use the casino facilities at $100 a day or $2,000 a year.<br><br>I spoke to a few friends and their response was<br><br>...might as well pay $2,000 and then I will be encouraged if not in a way forced to go as often as possible - make full use of it - kiasu you know!<br><br>...wah! If my foreign friends come and want to go, I cannot say I cannot afford $100 - lau kui! (no face)<br><br>...most people will surely want to go at least once for the experience and be able to say that I have been to the casino, but since must pay $100, maybe will place bigger bets just to recover the fee. So, actually more people may end up losing more money than if there was no entrance fee!<br><br>...not fair! How can the lower income be like second class citizens? You mean only the rich can be lucky?<br><br>...how can? The very basis of being a citizen is that I have better benefits than a foreigner, so how can a citizen be in a way discriminated. If I am a hapitual gambler, might as well give up my citizenship!<br><br>...if don't have $100 or $2,000 no problem! Just borrow to pay first. If I want to gamble, borrowing $100 or $2,000 will not deter me. Since have to borrow, must place bigger bets to get at least the entrance fee plus the loan interest back!<br><br>...are there any other countries in the world that charge their citizens more to enter the casino? Wah piang! Like another ERP or COE! Who keeps the fees? The casino operators or the Ministry for Casinos?<br><br>...in Malaysia, I understand that bumis cannot go in. Such a policy may be better as its simple to have a complete ban. If as I understand it about 75 per cent of the locals in Malaysia cannot enter the casino, and they still make so much profits, why can't Singapore do the same as after all I understand that about 1 out of 5 at any one time in Singapore is a foreigner.<br><br>...no wonder the casino operators have expressed surprise about the proposed guidelines, because maybe nobody else has done it this way. So, I think they will just factor in the restrictions and charge people more or give worse odds of winning to gamblers. I understand that in some states in the United States, the gaming commission ensures that the casinos' profits are limited and reasonable and reflected in the odds given to gamblers.<br><br>...investors may scale back and invest less than originally planned. This may actually reduce the economic benefits to Singapore of having casinos, which is after all the main reason why Singapore is considering whether to allow casinos.<br><br>...for the conveniece, $100 or $2,000 is OK compared to going to Genting, Batam or the cruise.<br><br>Perhaps the best way to evaluate whether to take a chance on casinos for Singapore, is to hold a public forum and ask what people would likely do, rather than arbitrarily balancing what is morally or economically right or wrong, and leaving it to casino investors to figure out what proposals to make under the safeguard limitations.<br><br>The way the casino issue is unfolding is in a sense a reflection of how the bureaucracy thinks versus the entrepreneurial mindset.<br><br>Instead of setting the social safeguards, the casino investors should be given an open and free hand to come up with proposals that address Singaporeans' social concerns and be at the same time economically viable and beneficial.<br><br>Leong Sze Hian<br></div>

I am a 4D&amp;ToTocrazy, however there's still a limit on betting.  Cos, the pros and cons can easily weigh.  For casino gambling is entirely different!!! The moment you started it, you will get incredible addicted. The bets are whether you win or lose in just split seconds only when the banker opens the cards.  I was a victim before when I went to cruise at SUN VIVA 2.  I lost my entire saving and over lost become indebt with credit cards Co.  That moment I was very down and also thought of committing suicide.<br><br>For betting on 4D or ToTo, Most of us are likely to set a limit.<br><br>When you are at the Casino on the table gambling, most of us are unable selfcontrol.  Gambling in casino will definitely <strong>lose much much much more</strong> compare to betting 4D or ToTo.<br><br>I am telling those who support Casino that these are the facts.
