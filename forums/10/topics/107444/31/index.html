He is now hounded by loan sharks for the mountain of debts he racked up to finance his soccer betting.<br><br>'If my family does that to me, it means they still can't trust me. I would have to commit myself more to these sessions,' he said.<br><br>John was among 13 recovering gambling addicts who spoke about the exclusion order at a recent 'gamblers anonymous' session organised by One Hope Centre, a non-profit organisation.<br><br>The Casino Control Act passed last week allows the National Council on Problem Gambling and casinos to issue orders barring addicts from entering the gambling halls.<br><br>Addicts can apply for exclusion orders from the council or the casinos, while their relatives can send their request to the council. The council is also empowered to bar social assistance recipients, bankrupts and those with poor credit records.<br><br>It was the first time gamblers have shared their views on the ban. Most of the debate so far has been dominated by politicians and community workers.<br><br>There have been concerns that gamblers will turn on family members if they feel they are 'squealing' on them.<br><br>One gambler at the session said he would squabble with his wife if she had him banned.<br><br>A former sales executive admitted he would be annoyed at relatives who sought an order against him. The unemployed 27-year-old is struggling under a mountain of debt totalling more than $100,000. However, he said: 'I'll be frustrated. Why do the authorities treat me differently from others? We are already very miserable. Why impose more misery on us?'<br><br>However, many of those at the meeting last Thursday backed government plans to keep the casinos out of their reach, though they said it will not stop them from gambling.<br><br>Said one: 'It is in the right direction. I will take it as an extra safeguard.'<br><br>President of One Hope, Reverend Edward Job, said his counsellors will explain to gamblers that their loved ones had them barred out of love.<br><br>The ban keeps compulsive gamblers from 'spur-of-the- moment' gambling and enhances their recovery, he said.<br><br>But not every gambling addict may benefit.<br><br>One hardcore punter, who has wagered at spots ranging from illegal gambling dens to offshore casinos, laughed when asked how he would feel if his family had him barred.<br><br>Speaking in Mandarin, he said: 'There's no one to do that. My older and younger sisters are themselves gambling like crazy.'<br><br></div>

One of  Singapore Turf Club's oulet.<br><br>The farking oulet is so small and there are always hundreds and hundreds people gambling there....everytime i walked in or rather I've to <strong>squeeze</strong> in to buy 4D...s h i t!!!..I smell  the perspiration of the crowd looking anxiously at odds or results of horse racing. Littering. spicking on everywhere.  <strong>I wonder what moral that our govt is giving to us or our kids living around that area?</strong> I saw children there waiting for their parents queuing up for horse betting..or sometimes I saw mothers putting their kids or grand children at nearby coffee shop and she went for horse betting.  I even saw family sitting at coffee shop while the parents are gambling at the singapore turf clubs' outlets.  ssssh i t.....is a word to our govt. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br>The farking singapore turf club is sucking loads of hard earned money from desperate singaporeans and making tonnes of money...why can't they have a bigger area for the gamblers or even with air-con.  This one at chai chee avenue block 36....with only three ladies serving at 3 counters.<br><br>According to one of the ladies...she told me most of them are on freelance..meaning that as freelance workers. They will have no employment benefits.<br>You see....even a <strong>highly profitable </strong>leegal gambling den also not willing to take care of singaporeans.<br>One thing I also notice and felt strange...the lady told me she is working as freelance.... But I saw her working most of the time.<br>This shows how well we singaporeans are being taken care by our govt...... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"></div>
