For those who want a casino here, have you done your research thoroughly? Don't just write off "social cost" so easily; PAP knows they could not argue against the apparent high "social cost", thus, they just say it is not about social cost vs economic gains. That's cool and neat but simply put it, they are just sweeping the dirt below the carpet!<br><br>Of course, with a twist, they say it is about OUR MATURITY as a society! Cool. Nobody wants to be seen as "immature" and not agreeing to have a Casino would be seen as "IMMATURE"! Hahaha. That's strange. If you know the odds of losing in a casino, any MATURE human being will not be visiting the casino! Then, the most important question to ask is, why have a casino in the very first place to hoodwink those "IMMATURE" ones? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>I would suggest for those who thinks Casino could bring in all the monies, do some research first. Try to do a search on googles with "NGISC", short form for "National Gambling Impact Studies Commission". This is a study commissioned by the world's most liberal govt on earth, USA.

That would have prevented those who cannot afford it from going in and digging a deep trench out of their own finances. Those turned away would eventually find Singapore Pools' Toto and 4D draws a source of satisfaction for their gambling habit.<br><br>Casinos are being ostracised as a betrayer of moral values.

However do u want gov to propose some restrictions on the people going to casino ? Wat form of restriction should we implement if the answer is a yes ?<br><br><blockquote>Those can't afford to pay for entry fee to gamble will end up with robbery, cheating and thelf for the sake of gambling thrill!!!! </blockquote>If they can't afford to go into the casino, then it just meant they will never experience being in the casino at all and therefore the casino meant little to these people. They can pay just $100 instead of a $1000 to go genting instead.<br><br><blockquote>I can bet with you that many people will get addicted, and in form of gambling in casinos in quite different from people who betting 4D.

U don't expect the gambling facilities to run on nothing or performing charity.<br><br><blockquote>Newspaper surveys??? I don't trust Have you ever stay long period in Macau?

Otherwise the gov will probably never publish or gloat over it<br><br><blockquote>Can u or everyone guarantee your or their children won't get addicted to gambling or becoming drug addicted. So... if your son or daughter being charged for criminals offence you also go to jail hor...... </blockquote>Can u guarantee your son and daugter will not be a gambling addict even if the casino is not open ? U can't guarantee tat your son or daughter will live 5 years later as well. Can u guarantee u never get cancer tomorrow ? Can u guarantee tat a war will never break up between singapore and malaysia for the next generation of singapore ? It is not anything attacking your children but it just shows tat asking for guarantee is pretty dumb.<br><br><blockquote>Maybe you should propose to GOV to legalise taking drugs for rich and mature people as well and it can also generate huge revenue wah..., but for poor people is a deadly offence. Recently, the high profile people's son caught with taking drug....hem...I think the father should be charged too..... for being irresponble father of the son. </blockquote>Drugs is drugs, gambling is gambling. Lets focus on just gambling in this thread. As for the father being charged if their son is a criminal is probably something tat no one wants. Why don't u poll the people and see the response ?<br><br><blockquote>Parents got no right to complain meh???....Government are equally responsible for both its people and their young children. If not, then don't call us up for NS loh.... </blockquote>The gov people or the people who support the casino have families as well. It is after seeing the pros and cons of a casin before they decide to have one.<br><br><blockquote>So our ex-Development Minister Teh Cheng Guan was so mature that he has to corrupt? OR it is Teh Cheng Guan's parents was so irresponsible for not telling him that is wrong to corrupt??? Teh's parents must be foolish!!!! </blockquote>why has he got to do with anything about casino ??? I am pretty sure the corruption level for singapore is one of the lowest in the world. If u say tat corruption is a sign of being immature, then our low level of corruption meant tat we r very mature.<br><br><blockquote>I have been hoping that the government will close down all the 4D and horse betting outlets. </blockquote>Then more people will hate the gov for it. Frankly the majority of the people here do bet 4D<br><br><blockquote>We have no other ways for an avenue of entertainment, or as a money spinner? Why must be a casino???

Why don't u name me a perfect (perfect = cannot not be improved) thing ? Why don't u name me a perfect government ? If u want to complain about things tat they had done wrong. i may even support u.

You are implying that children will get influenced by casinos merely with its presence. I am sure that the current government will disallow rampant advertisement of the casino. Besides, if children were so easily influenced, The Unbeatables (Mediacorp show) would not have been allowed in Singapore - it would have an even worse effect on children than a casino in itself, as the television show was piped into everybody's living rooms.<br><br>If we don't see an increase in the number of gamblers after three series of that show, I don't see why the mere presence of a casino can suddenly create more gamblers.<br><br>Adults giving in to temptation: so you feel that adults should be told what to do?

Would you like it?<br><br>There can never be a perfect environment for growing up, and that statement of yours implies your approval for governmental control over what the people see, hear and feel.
