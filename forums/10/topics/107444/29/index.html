            <div class='col-md body'>Dun look down on our Sg leader lah. So bad, we are not really depending the Casino as the last ditch effort to relieve the Sg economy.<br><br>One must understand that a rich Sg economy doesn't mean a full 100% employment for singaporean. Singapore economy is strong due to her special status as a port in the most important sea trade route in the world, we have successfully becoming the 3rd oil trading centre. More importantly, the Singapore finance hub status has taken off due to the good and sound banking infrastructures and positive Sg gov support. But as mentioned by many in the forum before, banking sectors and biomedical sectors have offer many high pay specialised jobs. But many local talents are not ready, not to say local talent no good enough.<br><br>I would say local talents are lacking behind the "top notched" foreign talents that Gov bring in. Employers are more ready to get the specialised foreign talents-<br>1) their special connections / networks of associate around the world.<br>2) their salary would not be much more expensive than local talents<br>3) they can be retrenched easily anytime if the market outlook changes or demand drops or their performance not on par<br>4) no training is required. employers just hired and fired.<br>5) no need CPF contribution<br>6) Gov supportive as this could be a way to boast our Sg population by giving out PR or through inter-marriage<br>7) Foreign talents could also bring in good money with them as they could be very rich prior coming to Sg to work.<br><br>As you can see a lot of specialised jobs are in the hands of the Foreign Talents. Our local talents must be not so contended. So Sg gov must open up new sectors to accomdate the space needed for our precious local talents to fulfil the dream of becoming rich young and retired early lah. How? Open up the service sector lah, attract more tourist $$ **which is usually easy money**. In addition, these create emplyment opporunity for the large pool of Singaporeans laid off by the moving out MNCs, while they also create opporunities for those who want to venture out and become their own boss. But all action plans need time to implement, dun expect any quick fix for our 4%++ unemployment rate. But trust me, time will heal our wound, ands make us stronger.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i extracted this from the straits times forum.<br><br>The Casino Regulatory Authority of Singapore (CRA) has decided that Singaporeans must pay either $100 per day or $2,000 per year to gamble in the proposed casino.<br><br>The average middle-class Singaporean who plays at the Singapore Pools spends probably $300-$400 a week on gambling. $100 is but pittance for the bigger casino gaming thrill.<br><br>The entry fee of $100 per day multiplied by 365 days a year is $36,500. The huge 95 per cent discount given for an annual pass of $2,000 sends the message that season passes for more frequent patronage of the casino by Singaporeans is encouraged.<br><br>It appears that the CRA is not sincere in trying to discourage Singaporeans from a casino gambling habit or addiction. If anything, the occasional visitor should not be penalised.<br><br>It would make more sense to have increasing rates as the frequency of patronage rises. For example, $50 for the first time, $75 for the second time, $100 for the third time, and so on.<br><br>In addition, there should be no annual fee payable, for that is saying: Just fork out the one-time payment and then throw caution to the winds. One doesn't have to think of paying entry fees subsequently.<br><br>On the contrary, one is spurred on to go to the casino as much as possible in order to get the most out of the fee that was paid.<br><br>Pamela Chong Kwang Ngo<br></div>

Employers are more ready to get the specialised foreign talents-<br>1) their special connections / networks of associate around the world.<br>2) their salary would not be much more expensive than local talents<br>3) they can be retrenched easily anytime if the market outlook changes or demand drops or their performance not on par<br>4) no training is required. employers just hired and fired.<br>5) no need CPF contribution<br>6) Gov supportive as this could be a way to boast our Sg population by giving out PR or through inter-marriage<br>7) Foreign talents could also bring in good money with them as they could be very rich prior coming to Sg to work.<br><br>As you can see a lot of specialised jobs are in the hands of the Foreign Talents. Our local talents must be not so contended. So Sg gov must open up new sectors to accomdate the space needed for our precious local talents to fulfil the dream of becoming rich young and retired early lah. How? Open up the service sector lah, attract more tourist $$ **which is usually easy money**. In addition, these create emplyment opporunity for the large pool of Singaporeans laid off by the moving out MNCs, while they also create opporunities for those who want to venture out and become their own boss. But all action plans need time to implement, dun expect any quick fix for our 4%++ unemployment rate. But trust me, time will heal our wound, ands make us stronger.<br></div></blockquote>you're another product of government brainwashing. well done ol'chap.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear vito_corlene,<br><br>Your argument could be extended, why would we control illegal usage of drugs like opium or heroine or "ice"? Aren't we restricting what they want to do? Similarly, the argument could be that if people could travel to overseas to take these drugs, why should we ban it here?<br><br>Similarly, for underage sex, why should we ban it? If the child and the adults are "willing" partners, why should we restrict people do what they want to?<br><br>In my view, your argument would only be valid if there isn't "BAD externalities"; for every actions one takes, there may be impact on others, be it good or bad. Thus, the litmus test should be whether the "restrictions" have any "positivity" or not. Or rather, the things that are being "restricted" have "bad externalities" or not. "Bad externalities" could mean moulding an unhealthy mindset, social norm or atmosphere.<br><br>You are making a sweeping statement here. There are distinctive differences between what I advocate and what PAP advocates. I base my views on the impact on society while sometimes, PAP bases its views on its self interests. Though there might be similar areas that PAP and I hold similar views, but it doesn't mean we are totally the same.<br><br>And for gambling, I definitely hold very different views from PAP govt; they wanted a casino, I am ANTI-CASINO. They would allow 4D Toto betting outlets to be set up all over Singapore, I am AGAINST such moves. How could you ever conclude we are the same?<br><br>As for this present issue, I am merely pointing out the flawed argument of the article, nothing else. For a set of conditions made (i.e. casino is to be built), what's the next best actions to be taken. I will still fight for NO-TO-CASINO but if you ask me what's the mechanism to minimize the negative social impact on Singapore, I would still provide my views.<br><br>Goh Meng Seng<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by vito_corleone:</div><div class="quote_body">shouldnt people be allowed to do what they want? by restricting and controlling gambling aren't you exhibiting nanny-like behavior aka the present government?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> </div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Formal dress codes yes. No smoking yes. $100 entrance fees no.<br><br>It hurts my feelings when I find myself being discriminated against in my own homeland, and being treated like a kid.<br><br>I appeal to the government to remove the entrance fees. The moment we decide to have a casino is the moment we say to the people, have fun and make your own decisions on where to draw the line between gaming and gambling.<br><br>I personally do not agree that more Singaporeans will fall prey to gambling addiction if we allow free entry to the casinos. Just like the R(A) movies, the novelty will wear off. Non-gamblers will remain as such because it is in their nature to feel the pain of loss. Gamblers will continue to gamble whatever anti-gambling measures are put in place against them, as there are countless alternative avenues to gamble.<br><br>The aim of the IRs and Casinos are to attract tourism. Many Singaporeans have foreign friends, business associates, and relatives who visit Singapore regularly. The IRs and Casinos will encourage them to visit Singapore more often. We should create an atmosphere of fun and games for all visitors and for the Singaporeans who are accompanying them. I dread to see the unhappy face of a Singaporean who has to pay for bringing his guests to the casinos. His chest will sink at the entrance of the casino.<br><br>Singapore will have to live with its decision to have casinos. There is no right or wrong. Every interest group will have its own perspective. The yes-no phase if over. The point is, once decided I feel that we should go all the way and make it a roaring success. Whilst it is necessary to have regulations to minimize collateral damage from the decision, we should not over-regulate, just like over-medication. This is usually counter productive.<br><br>We should all look forward to the next chapter of Singapore's history where the IRs/Casinos are one of the key pillars of our economy. Thank you.<br></div>
