Personally, I don't believe tat 30-40 percent of all casinoes go bankrupt. The only reason why a casino will fail is because of over competition or too small a size, which singapore will not see for the current moment.</div>

See for yourselves what's in it for us if we go ahead with a casino.<br><br>And strategically speaking, we will all become suckers in the end of the day. I will touch on this later.<br><br>Goh Meng Seng<br><br></div></blockquote>IMMATURE people are not supposed to be singaporeans. They are the tourist who come here for entertainment <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> But Dr Ng minister of manpower said on the news last night that "legislation can change the mindsets of people" This shows that we are too immature and need the government's help in changing our thinking that casino is bad for us.</div>

So indirectly u r telling us tat we should give up on tourism ? Then tat make your question even worse. I thought I have mentioned for the upteen times tat we can't give up on tourism. There r a large employment force for tourism in our economy, there r a large income from tis sector and therefore we can't let them crash down. We should find a way to make our tourism better, and one of the way is through a casino<br><br><blockquote>Is SIS telling us he believes floating casino results in moderate social problems in S'pore?

In short, technically we already had a casino. There were problems tat come with such opening of gambling facilities. Social problems do surface. However we had face it and deal with it in such a way tat singapore remains to be a safe and secure place. Tat is why singapore is listed as one of the safest place to live in the world. If another casino is set to be opened, the impact on our society will not be as exagerrated as some of the people believed. Tis is because there really isn't a radical change to the gambling scene in singapore. Malaysia had a casino, and the distance of singapore to it is similar to the citizens of their own state travelling to their casino for gambling. Singapore already have floating casinoes, which was designated to set sail almost everyday. Do u expect to see major changes to our society just because we add another gambling venues when we already have so many ? Do u think singapore will fail to curb the problem of gambling when it was shown tat they had peformed well in the past despite having so many gambling venues ?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>From ObviousMan<br>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Previous Topic Deleted for non adherence to Casino Posting rules<br>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>All suggestions have been recorded and reviewed, but in the interest of maintaining a user-friendly website, we have not included all the detailed feedback here. Instead, we have summarized the key points and arguments. We also ensure that your views and ideas are given due consideration.<br><br>We have consulted widely and gathered views and feedback from a wide spectrum of Singaporeans on the Integrated Resort project through various channels including emails, letters and dialogue sessions. We have received more than 1200 letters, emails and faxes since March 2004. A few independent polls and surveys have also been conducted.<br><br>In September 2004, the Feedback Unit commissioned a telephone cum face-to-face survey with 903 Singaporeans on the Prime Minister's National Day Rally Speech 2004 to find out the public's reactions to PM Lee's maiden rally speech on 22 August 2004, which included sentiments towards the casino issue. Close to half of the respondents agreed that operating a casino would contribute to Singapore's economic and tourism development. Opinion was divided over whether the benefits of setting up a casino outweigh the social costs.<br><br>Seven dialogue sessions were also organized by the Feedback Unit between August to October 2004 to seek views from various groups, such as religious groups, family advocacy groups, grassroots leaders, youths, older adults, businessmen and industry professionals, as well as gamblers and their families.<br><br>Summary of Views<br>Common reasons cited in support of the Integrated Resort with casino included significant economic benefits arising from the growth in tourism, job creation and increase in tax revenues. Participants were aware of the intensifying regional competition for the tourism dollar and felt that an Integrated Resort with a casino would increase our market share. Some of the participants felt that Singapore was "too late" in allowing a casino. In addition, some participants felt that having a casino would divert local gamblers back to Singapore, enabling us to better control problem gambling. Another view expressed was that Singapore was ready for a casino now and it was an opportunity for Singapore to mature.<br><br>Conversely, participants that were not in favour were concerned about the social impact of a casino, (i.e. may lead to an increase in divorce rates, break-up of families, crime, etc.), the erosion of our work ethic and the impact on our international reputation as a trusted financial centre. Other strong objections were based on moral and religious grounds. Another issue raised was that of restricting locals into the casino. Some of the participants felt that locals and tourists should be treated equally, and that patrons should not be assessed on their income level, nationality or other criteria. Other participants were concerned about the lack of resources in the social welfare system to deal with the effects of problem gambling.<br><br>In summary, some of the common arguments posed were as follows:<br><br>For Casino<br>a) Will create significant economic benefits and jobs.<br>b) Will boost the tourism industry / attract more tourists.<br>c) Will provide a wider range of entertainment options.<br>d) Will divert local gamblers back to our own shores.<br>e) Singaporeans are socially responsible and mature enough.<br>f) Singapore society is maturing<br>g) Adults should exercise personal responsibility<br><br>Against Casino<br>a) Will potentially result in an increase in social ills, such as higher incidence of problem gambling, increase in crime, etc. Social safeguards will not work as there will always be loopholes.<br>b) Against Singapore's pro-family policy.<br>c) Has a cannibalising effect on other industries.<br>d) Erodes our moral and religious values.<br>e) Tarnishes Singapore's good reputation and image.<br><br>From: http://app.feedback.gov.sg/asp/mis/mis16.asp</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ACtually, the reasons against Casino are more than what the feedback unit has gathered.<br><br>My point of reasoning is as follow:<br><br>1) By game theory, the casion operators of course want more casinos set up all over the world. If they managed to set up one in Singapore, they will go to other neighbouring countries and start lobby for new casinos to be set up in their countries! The monies are good and every govt will base their argument that in order to stop outflow of gambling monies to Singapore, they will set up their own casinos in their countries! Imagine if Indonesia is to set up one casino right in their famous Bali resort! Which one will have more attraction? Singapore or Bali? Thailand has many exotic places to set up casino too! Malaysia also! Singapore will become the sucker eventually, helping the casino operators to punch through this region. China is considering the Casino option after Macau has one of the American casino operator set up shop there, using the same reasoning.<br><br>2) If one of the main reasons is to stop gambling monies to flow out of Singapore, then it must be the case that we must allow Singaporeans to gamble! IN fact, if the scenerio mentioned above really happen, then even if Singapore first decide to disallow locals to gamble in the casino, eventually such venture will not be economically viable. This is what happened to the various casinos in Korea which are meant for foreign tourists only. IN the end, Singapore govt, having a stake in this casino, will have no choice but to open up the casino to Singaporeans. Especially so when there are billions of dollars of investment involved.<br><br>3) Casino studies by NGISC commissioned by the US govt have indicated the many social ills of casino effecting those community with high percentage of local patronage. Casino is regressive in nature, meaning it affects the poor more than the rich.<br><br>4) Casino is found to be more addictive than other forms of gambling. This is an indisputable fact. This is mainly due to the high frequency of engagement when you gamble in a casino, unlike those convenient gambling like Toto or 4D, or even horse racing.<br><br>5) Accoding to NGISC and other research done, there is no doubt that casino gambling will result in more bankrupts and pathological gamblers. Up to 5% of the adult population would be affected, with a multiplier effect or 3 or 4.<br><br>6) Casino Gambling is a non-productive activity which is time consuming. It will not only effect social costs but also economic cost on the economy. More productive time and efforts could be channeled to create jobs and wealth rather than gambling away.<br><br>7) Singapore will always lose out in terms of tourist attractions. Casino is not going to change that equation. One Disneyland in HK will create more jobs than 1 casino in Singapore. And this Disneyland will definitely attract more tourists than a casino in Singapore. Macau and HK would most probably link up their tourism strategy to provide a Mega tourist attraction that Singapore could never compete. Thus, it is unwise to risk social well being for a loosing game.<br><br>Goh Meng Seng</div>
