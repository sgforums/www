I expect singapore gov to have some power over the casino. Is the door for turf club, 4D, toto, big sweep, clubs close for repeat visits ?</strong> Â“<br><br>The point I want to emphasize is <strong>who is behind the existing legalized gambling organizations.  Can you help to trace it back and let us know who is behind Turf Club, 4D, TOTO, big sweep, clubs</strong>.<br><br>This will explain why there is no objection in the first place, and why they are well Â“controlledÂ”, and why the Â“goodsÂ” that come out of it could be more than the Â“badsÂ” because of the control imposed.  And all the money is flowing within Singapore from one pocket to the other.<br><br><strong>Casino is different</strong>.<br><br>If the government is to have any sort of Â“powerÂ” over the casino, she has to take majority share of the proposed casino, then the casino will be run by the government = Singaporean.  Do we think the Â“<strong>BIG INVESTOR</strong>Â” will come and the casino will take of (in the style envisaged by the highest authority)?<br><br>If the government is to take minority share = no say in running the business, the door to the casino will be wide open for repeat visits by Singaporean eventually for it to be viable.<br><br>Anyway the government had already said that the proposed casino will cater to the tom, dick and harry (including Ah Pa and Ah Ma) who goes to the cruise ships, Indonesia islands, Genting Island to gamble, to collect the tax which otherwise will be lost to other operators / governments.  <strong>To achieve the government aim, the government had already implied that the door to the casino will be wide open eventually for the repeat visit by singaporean</strong>.  So what control are we talking about.<br><br>Can you see the difference between the door being wide open to casino as compared to door being wide open to Turf Club, 4D, TOTO, big sweep, clubs.  In the later, the money goes round within Singapore.  In casino case, it goes out to the Â“<strong>BIG INVESTOR</strong>Â”.<br></div>

Can you help to trace it back and let us know who is behind Turf Club, 4D, TOTO, big sweep, clubs. </blockquote>I thought I said many times it was singapore gov ? It was not ?<br><br><blockquote>This will explain why there is no objection in the first place, and why they are well Â“controlledÂ”, and why the Â“goodsÂ” that come out of it could be more than the Â“badsÂ” because of the control imposed. And all the money is flowing within Singapore from one pocket to the other. </blockquote>actually... wat control had they proposed when singapore gov is in control ? Before 4D is taken by singapore pool, everything remains the same.<br><br><blockquote>If the government is to have any sort of Â“powerÂ” over the casino, she has to take majority share of the proposed casino, then the casino will be run by the government = Singaporean. Do we think the Â“BIG INVESTORÂ” will come and the casino will take of (in the style envisaged by the highest authority)? </blockquote>Ehhh... malaysia gov force investors to give malays a share of their business, yet there r still people investing in malaysia. I don't know wat share will singapore gov take but then again, it will be substantial. If I was an investor, I will let the local gov have a share of it. Why ? Because then the business will be stable and the prospect be high. If u want to invest some telecommunication in china, won't u be happier if the china gov propose to have a huge share of the business ? U can be sure tat the business will have a higher chance of success and lesser red tapes. If I want to open something controversial in a country, having shares by the gov is a good thing. Heck, it beats other companies since they can run away/bankrupt/do illegal acts while singapore gov can't.<br><br>If someone invest with me, the capital I had to cough out is lesser as well. It is still fair if they can earn money and they just need to invest lesser. U either earn lesser while invest lesser or don't invest at all or fail. Which will most side choose ? If I am not wrong, mst companies don't have the fund to build something big like a casino. They had to sell shares or borrow from a bank. Even if they have such funds, they will prefer to keep some liquid cash around to deal with cock up. Tat is why a lot of companies will choose to find another organisation to share the burden of the capital and strength of their organisation. Tis is called joint venture or partnership. Is partnership or joint venture undesirable in business ? I thought people go for these kind of things<br><br>Furthermore, singapore gov control the legislation. If they don't like casino in a big way, they can impose control through laws as well. They can impose laws such as age laws, tax, income, time of operation etc. They already do impose these forms of laws on bars or places serving alcohol isn't it ? These r local laws and no other nations can do anything about it. Tat is why casino operators will like singapore gov to have a share, so they will not be totally screwed up if gov suddenly go kuai lan or something<br><br><blockquote>Anyway the government had already said that the proposed casino will cater to the tom, dick and harry (including Ah Pa and Ah Ma) who goes to the cruise ships, Indonesia islands, Genting Island to gamble, to collect the tax which otherwise will be lost to other operators / governments. To achieve the government aim, the government had already implied that the door to the casino will be wide open eventually for the repeat visit by singaporean. So what control are we talking about. </blockquote>Really ? I am pretty sure the age limit will be set.<br><br><blockquote>Can you see the difference between the door being wide open to casino as compared to door being wide open to Turf Club, 4D, TOTO, big sweep, clubs. In the later, the money goes round within Singapore. In casino case, it goes out to the Â“BIG INVESTORÂ”. </blockquote>From the above explanation I had given, u don't know unless u know how big a share singapore gov will take. BTW, they too can collect tax before collecting their share, so the amount they will take will increase. Even if u don't operate casino, ALL the money just flow to cruise ship or genting. Is tat any better ? If u r scared of fund leaking, fund is leaking like crazy from singapore to other countries now. Openign a casino is a win win situation</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Since none of our voices are heard in the parliament, do you think we should do more than organize online petitions that have no effect on the government? Why do you think the government is being so hot headed about their decision without consulting us Singaporeans? It is because of our heck care attitude that is making the government think that since no opposition, they can just go ahead with the plan? I am greatly shocked when the Prime Minister is quoted as saying that there is a 'minority' who are against this idea. Are we really a minority? Or are we a silenced majority? I appeal to the general public to speak up and stand up for your rights. Would you want your future generation to be tattered with broken families? Girls, would you want your husband to gamble away in casinos in your backyard, coming home late and being neglected? Parents, would ya want your kids to grow up knowing gambling holds on risk? THink, what would ya future generation be with a casino in your backyard. THese are just moral issues. What about economic sense? How much more must the goverment spend to cure the social ills? Your tax money, everything, from COE, road tax, income tax, utilities tax, property all gone into nothingness? I would greatly encourage all Singaporeans, young and old,  who object to the casino idea to stand up and object the plans of the government. It is only you Singaporeans who can do a part, not your MP, not ur NMP. Not any of those in parliament can help you because they will not help you. It is only you, yourself, your family members and friends who can stop this! Our voices are much powerful than MPs in parliament. Aunties, gossip if you can. Uncles object if you want. Teenagers and youth, spread this objection to all your friends , online and everywhere you can. Organize a protests!! Hold anti-casino rallies!! Do your part for the future of Singapore!!</div>

For those who want a casino here, have you done your research thoroughly? Don't just write off "social cost" so easily; PAP knows they could not argue against the apparent high "social cost", thus, they just say it is not about social cost vs economic gains. That's cool and neat but simply put it, they are just sweeping the dirt below the carpet!<br><br>Of course, with a twist, they say it is about OUR MATURITY as a society! Cool. Nobody wants to be seen as "immature" and not agreeing to have a Casino would be seen as "IMMATURE"! Hahaha. That's strange. If you know the odds of losing in a casino, any MATURE human being will not be visiting the casino!

            <div class='col-md body'>No casino? We need more money. Singapore is going to be globalised. Let the money flow to Batam, Genting and Australia if we don't open casino. Even we have no casino, people will still go overseas for casino.<br><br>Of course, there are pros and cons. Some people will have heavy debts, family problems, and more. <strong>Everyone is matured enough to make their own decision, if he or she wanted to bet, and ended up owing heavy debt, he or she have to pay for it, because they choose to go to the casino and lose their control over gambling.</strong> We can't blame the govt. for opening casino, even if there are people who got addicted and got themselves in big trouble, they choose their own way. They should blame themselves for bringing themselves into such situation.<br><br>Another example, drugs, if govt. legalised drugs, and eventually some people ended up as drug addicts and paid a high price, they can't blame the govt., but only themselves to blame. They choose to take drugs, and they will have to face the consequences, they should be matured enough. As for casino, people should be matured enough to know what they are doing, and understand the consequences of overdoing it.</div>

This is an immutable fact of a free economy.  So, we are not doing this to set up class consciousness.  We are doing this, as I said earlier, if at all we do decide to go ahead with this, to broaden our tourism appeal to a wider segment of people.<br><br>As far as tourists are concerned, I have also said that we are trying to attract a wide spectrum of tourists.  We will build more 2- and 3-star hotels, because we recognise that, with the onset of low-cost carriers, it is quite likely, indeed we hope, that more tourists of perhaps a humbler background will also choose to come to Singapore.  But we also have to recognise that there are other types of tourists who have, in a sense, money to burn or money to lose.  And if they are going to lose that money, and lose it our way and in that way create jobs and help strengthen our own economy, then this is something which we should not, as a matter of reflex, ignore.  If we do so, we do so at our loss.  So, all I am saying is that there are strong arguments, both for and against.  There are good reasons to be cautious, but let us go into this with our eyes wide open, being very clear of our objectives, being very clear of the dangers, and also being very clear that there are some practical measures which we have to take.<br><br>This is not a time to indulge in creating or highlighting class consciousness or looking for social dispartity or creating cleavages within our population.  I think if we adopt this in our uniquely Singaporean manner of being pragmatic, realistic and sensible about it, we might be able to fashion a win-win solution, although that is not typical of gambling.<br><br>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong:  Sir, I find it hard to be persuaded that we can insulate Singaporeans if we have a casino for foreigners only.  Since it also involves creating jobs, Singaporeans would have to go to casinos to work in jobs like croupiers, blackjack dealers, showgirls and what-nots.  Therefore, there will be social implications, no matter how hard we try to insulate it.  Hence, I would urge the Minister to kindly consider this very carefully and take into account the various studies all around the world that show that casinos do lead to higher family breakdowns, bankruptcies, gambling addicts and other social ills.<br><br>Dr Vivian Balakrishnan:  I will certainly take the Member's warnings on board.  Thank you.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by stupidissmart:</div><div class="quote_body">Hmm..
