            <div class='col-md body'>Having a casino in Singapore is quite ok as most ppl who went into it n gamble is mature enough to treat it as a form of "relaxing themselves".Like for me,i went to Genting highlands to gamble once in awhile is just for relaxing my mind only,not really want to "make a big money there" or "make a living through gambling".<br>If i were to treat gambling as a "source of income",i would have declared bankcrupt liao lor!From my observation,most ppl are mature enough to control their budgets in the casino,afterall,they do know what is called "hard-earn money"!But for those who are "born-rich",then i am not so sure about them.</div>

Nobody in his right mind would want their children to be gamblers but there are people who would support Casino! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Never mind about that. For those who want a casino here, have you done your research thoroughly? Don't just write off "social cost" so easily; PAP knows they could not argue against the apparent high "social cost", thus, they just say it is not about social cost vs economic gains. That's cool and neat but simply put it, they are just sweeping the dirt below the carpet!<br><br>Of course, with a twist, they say it is about OUR MATURITY as a society! Cool. Nobody wants to be seen as "immature" and not agreeing to have a Casino would be seen as "IMMATURE"! Hahaha. That's strange. If you know the odds of losing in a casino, any MATURE human being will not be visiting the casino! Then, the most important question to ask is, why have a casino in the very first place to hoodwink those "IMMATURE" ones? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>I would suggest for those who thinks Casino could bring in all the monies, do some research first. Try to do a search on googles with "NGISC", short form for "National Gambling Impact Studies Commission". This is a study commissioned by the world's most liberal govt on earth, USA. See for yourselves what's in it for us if we go ahead with a casino.<br><br>And strategically speaking, we will all become suckers in the end of the day.
