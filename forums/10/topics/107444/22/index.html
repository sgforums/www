            <div class='col-md body'>yup, Buzz and Vibrancy in SG??? Sure, the casino is a new light to something more interesting. If anyone thought of creating more buzz and vibrancy, those efforts have been made by many (Not the government), but have the people really turn to those efforts. In case you didn't notice, we asians really need a 'boot in our face' to really keep us active and vibrant, we are all kinda serious, don't ya think??<br>And in the government speech today, tourist found it boring to stay in SG. Talk about it, i find it absolutely boring too!!!! With all the conservative wussies leading the picture all the time, they ain't anything near fun at all. Always control, control and control, talk about the word "chill-out" is like the never-ever land to reach. They ain't got a life, so why stick us to their life!!!<br>I really hope the casino, in bringing out more highlights to tourism, would really bring out more life in our culture. Not another stress out, rule base system that cannot flex!!!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>And if anyone ask why can we not come out with better solutions to the casino, it really is the fact that solutions were there, but they were either banned or not accepted.<br>Tell me about rock concerts, and people are forbidded to head bang, or do body surfing, like the way it is abroad!!!<br>Talk about playing music in public, and a license is so strictly enforced.<br>Talk about coin machine horse racing, and that is also banned.<br>Talk about chewing gum!!<br>Talk about road lightings of advertisement, that is banned and now the roads look so dull.<br>I don't wanna mention, cos there are so many others.

            <div class='col-md body'>well written mannovo, that is exactly how i feel in the first place.<br>to me it will boil down to our govt confusing strategy in attracting tourist. someone mention before that we have too much restiction here that tourist arent finding us attracting anymore.<br>They say, Casino will only be part of the IR and will represent no one than 5% area. which means 95% will be use of non casino. but why casino and just pure entertainment facilities. reason? investor simply non interested and they have better place to invest like Thailand. the very reason singapore allow casino , draws this big investor onboard. these IR concepts will still base on casino, the main crowds drawer. why set the 5% limit then?<br><br>like i mention, those minister whom we know who approve the casino will not stay in politics for long, but the effect of the casino on singapore will be here for life.</div>

Unlike you, I had been a staunch opposer to the IR project. However, after hearing the PM's speech on radio, then on TV yesterday, I decided that their idea seemed quite feasible, adn that they had put much thought to it. And that was confirmed when I read the issue of the speech published on the Straits Times today. It just seemed excellent.<br><br>But now, re-considering it again, I have identified a number of loopholes in the LHL's argument tt the govt has conveniently side-stepped, and which those without an eye for detail would surely miss out:-<br><br>1) <blockquote> the long term impact on social mores is insidious and hard to prevent.</blockquote>These are PM LHL's own words in 1997. Throughout the entire speech, he has not given any time to confront this perception, or any counter-evidence.<br><br>2) <blockquote> we have not been investing in tourist infrastructure projects</blockquote>Ermm... what exactly happened to the Esplanade and a host of other governmental projects? if they are not tourist infrastructure, what are they?<br><br>And aren't there other tourist infrastructure projects which do not need to incldue casinos?<br><br>3)<blockquote> Bloomberg and Guiliani have remade their city by cleaing it up and clamping down on crime.</blockquote>Something tells me that Orchard Road, Geylang and Joo Chiat need cleaning up badly. Why not the Red Light District be replaced by some tourism infrastructure project which is decentralized from the city centre? perhaps a theme park?<br><br>4) <blockquote>They are building a New York Sports and Convention Centre (NYSCC), to draw in more tourists and convention traffic.</blockquote>And in the NYSCC plan, is there a casino anywhere in sight?<br><br>5) <blockquote>The city is redesigning its traffic flow; the mayor has built a very popular artificial beach along the River Seine; and started nightlong street parties.</blockquote>And where are the casinos in Paris?<br><br>6)<blockquote> It tried to legislate to allow up to 40 super casinos, but because of opposition from MPs and the impending elections it had to compromise and agree to build just one super casino somewhere in Britain</blockquote>Well, Britain is a large country, and thus the impact of one casino built in a remote location in the countryside would not affect Englishmen as a whole. On the other hand, Singapore is so small that the impact on local society will be great. And remember, we have no secluded countryside area to build an IR in. Marina Bayfront does not really match that cue.<br><br>7)<blockquote>Hong Kong will open its Disneyland very soon, and is planning a new cultural centre at West Kowloon that is seven times the size of the Esplanade.</blockquote>Oh ok... Why didn't Singapore approve Disneyland's bid in 1997 of building a Disneyland here? Perhaps then we wouldn't need to care about any social impacts of casinos, or government financing, since after all, Disneyland finances itself without the need of casinos!<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> <blockquote>Hong Kong is talking about building a casino on Lantau, to compete with Macao. In Thailand, Prime Minister Thaksin is likely to move ahead with IRs at Khao Lak in Phang Nga Province.</blockquote>SO they do it, we must do it too, right? What happened to innovation and creativity?<br><br>9) <blockquote>Malaysia is developing the Kuala Lumpur City Centre (KLCC) project, a 40 hectare development which includes the current Petronas Twin Towers.  They are also hosting Formula One racing, and Kuala Lumpur is buzzing with tourists from the Middle East.</blockquote>F1 racing tracks do not include casinos. Does KLCC incldue casinos?<br><br>10) <blockquote>Genting gives us some idea what the IR may look like.  Genting started off as a casino with an attached hotel, but now it has many other amenities: good hotels, numerous food outlets, theatres, a huge amusement park, etc.   Many Singaporeans go there for short holidays with the whole family, and not to gamble</blockquote>So an IR will start off like Genting? Doesn't that mean the casino will be the most major part of the entire IR in the first few years? Remember, The beginning is what brings about the most danger.<br><br>And btw, I'm sure many Singaporeans go Genting to gamble too.<br><br>PM did not offer a statistical comparison of people who gamble at Genting and "harmless" tourists. He failed to give any concrete assurance that Genting's situation is not as bad as it sounds.<br><br>11) <blockquote> But somewhere within the premises there is a small jackpot room that generates the revenue that helps to keep the place going.</blockquote>jackpot rooms and Casinos are two majorly different thing man. The machines in a jackpot room pale in comparison to those in Casinos; so do the games offered. And jackpot rooms are kept tightly in one corner, hidden from public view so to speak ,whilst casinos are open to anyone to see. You can't hide a building like you can hide a room, and especially not a glitzy casino!<br><br>12)<blockquote> I wanted to display the designs and models publicly, so that SingaÂ­poreans could see the high quality of the proposals and appreciate the impact of the IRs on our city. Unfortunately the bidders would not agree. They wanted to protect their intellectual property, and not allow their competitors to see their plans</blockquote>Why can't our powerful government demand that the investors show out the projects. C'mon, don't we have IP Laws, can't the investors sue any competitors who violate IP rights? Seriously, this IP Rights argument sux.<br><br>Why is our government, who is so strong at co-ercing people to accept its poltical views, slamming opposition and bankrupting their politicans, as well as stamping out dissidents, including foreign presses like FEER or the IHT,so weak to prevent these firms from concealing their plans?<br><br>13) <blockquote>The only difference is the gaming area itself, but this is only a small part of the whole development Â– less than 3% of the total floor area allowed.</blockquote>And what is the exact size? how many ha?<br><br>14)<blockquote>Altogether MTI estimates that the two IRs will create about 35,000 jobs, counting jobs within the IRs, plus spinoffs throughout the economy.</blockquote>How many jobs will go to Singaporeans?<br><br>15)<blockquote>f we say no, the best proposals for the IR, together with the investments and the jobs, will most likely go somewhere else in the region. </blockquote>Aren't there any other proposals otehr than those for the IR?<br><br>16)<blockquote>The operators also told us that they needed some local business, although they know that this cannot be their main market.</blockquote>A little coy the firms are, aren't they?<br><br>17)<blockquote>Second, we will implement a system of exclusions.  Those in financial distress, or receiving social assistance, will not be allowed entry.</blockquote>how to identify?<br><br>1<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><blockquote>For the IRs, we will similarly channel revenue collected from the entrance fee to the Totalisator Board for charitable purposes. </blockquote>Harm some to benefit others... great...<br><br>19)<blockquote>Their vigorous response to the IRs shows that they are concerned about values, and will work hard to uphold them. </blockquote>So the religious groups are the moral values civil service?<br><br>20)<blockquote>For its part the Government will continue to emphasise moral education in schools and promote wholesome values in our society,</blockquote>Unfortunately, your moral education has failed in many instances, even without the ICR, so will it succeed with the ICR?<br><br>ya, so there.<br><br>the (skeptical) pikamaster</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>What nerves to talk about One Man Vision. The vision was creditable up to a point when HDB flats were sold at S$25,000 - S$60,000 and people were paid higher salaries with more jobs and costs were tolerable, i.e. in the 1980s.<br><br>As admitted by the man himself his vision to build a first world country in a third world region has become inadequate sometime ago. Trouble is the man was too proud to admit fundamental error in his style or narrow-vision leadership.<br><br>That vision has narrowed down and restricted the potential of all the practical talents with all the strait-jacketed one-way garb about meritocracy and elites causing much outflow of its own practical talents.<br><br>The self-proclaimed leadeship ability was drummed into the citizens day in and day out by the state press to reach the Swiss Standard of Living. So many believed in the invinsible power of One Man Vision. What happened in the 1980s-1990s. What did the leaders say to the citizens during the last two recessions. Growth was stunted and people were losing jobs and facing many struggles to make ends meet. Costs went up and businesses are not making monies except for the MNCs and foreign and GLCs.<br><br>At least the Swiss still has kep up with broad-based education and still stayed competitive enjoying a reasonable higher living standard. For us by the 1990s, our standard of living dropped back to third world but our costs gone up to first world.<br><br>The asset bubble burst wiped out the savings of many. Suicides and unemployments were treated with hush hush silence. Bankruptcies were at the all-time high.<br><br>So don't talk ONE MAN VISION. It was past or passe. It is bull. There was only dimmed vision based on facts. That is the reason to push for a casino now as the vision was all blurred. No more vision despite paying the overly honored leaders the world most highest salaries.<br><br>All that the visionary can say is: region is too competitive for us and there is nothing to be done until all sacrifice another round - social pains from casino.<br><br>How visionary can one be. Go and interview the citizens. Don't just watch the state tv or read the papers to see how 90 % of the population of 4 million cope with third world living and first world cost.<br><br>That is our so-called visionary's record. So what nerves and audacity to claim credits for past glories.<br>_________________<br>Manage complexities in objective-steps processes ?
