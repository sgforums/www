            <div class='col-md body'>Having thought long and hard, I think having a casino will be good. People who gamble will gamble. Be it $200 bets on 4D a week, monthly visits to Genting or Star Cruise, weekly mahjong sessions exchanging $200-400 a session (50c, 4-5 tai easily $60 win) or even playing the stock market.<br><br>Ppl want to speculate and get rich fast, simple as that. If so, why not have one here and earn the market share as well... Besides I for one would like another place to hang out, if we have an integrated resort, tho I personally don't gamble.<br><br>What's embarrassing is the PAP's idea of mitigating social ills by placing restrictions on the populace, like membership fees and income caps. It totally reinforces the nanny-state perception many foreign states have of us.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There is a thread about democracy here. One of the precepts of democracy is freedom of choice.<br><br>Cigarettes are sold in Singapore. Ciggies are bad. People smoke rite? However, if YOU don't want to smoke that is ur choice. Smokers choose to smoke and we as a democratic society should defend his right to smoke, as long as his right does not impinge on others' rights not to inhale 2nd-hand smoke. Hence the ruling on smoke-free aircon areas, etc.<br><br>Fast food is everywhere. It's bad, fat, has trans-fat, expensive, etc. However, ppl eat it rite? Sure, fitness junkies deplore it, health freaks think it's poison, but some who lead a balanced life eat it sometimes and some really unhealthy people eat it all the time without exercise. However, it's YOUR choice to eat it, no one can stop u.<br><br>The same thing applies to gambling. U might have ur own ideas about gambling. If YOU don't want to gamble, feel free to avoid it. Hey, it's bad, you throw $$$ away, you destroy families, u become famous overnight with ST articles. However, people who want to gamble, will. And I will defend that person's right to want to gamble. However, gambling for me will be treated as like the above examples of fast food and cigarettes. Coz it simply is the same.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The New Paper, 5 Apr 04<br><br>Chip Thrills: Genting casino didn't ruin Malaysians,<br>so why worry about one here?<br>By Ken Jalleh Jr<br><br>FEELING lucky? Welcome to the Casino, a Disneyland for the gullible, the deluded and the idiotic, a playground for people who believe that a $5 chip, well-placed, would reap a life free of financial worry and everlasting happiness.<br><br>Welcome to a world where, as they say, there's a dumb, buck-toothed William Hung born every day. I know. I, too, was once part of the betting brigade, often referred to, with a snigger, as Suckers.<br><br>My first experience in a casino was at Genting Highlands. Stuck alone in a room on a cloud-covered mountain, I was there to report on a bowling competition for The Straits Times. I remember it clearly because I lost. It was money a $350-a-month sportswriter could ill afford to lose. At 2am, trying hard to sleep, the casino beneath was a throbbing invitation to 'Come, come, put money, take money'. I did not notice, then, the whisper of fine-print: You put money, we take money.<br><br>I have since experienced flutters in casinos from Mauritius to Lake Tahoe to cruise ships. That I am still working for a living, still far from a life free of financial worry and everlasting happiness is testimony to Lady Luck's utter hostility. There are many like me. Small fry with big dreams and hopeless willpower.<br><br>In the next six pages you will find a portrait of the low-rollers and the low-lifes, the minions in the glamorous world of casinos. They are the retirees who, having spent their lives slaving away for a decent wage, suddenly discover the thrill of a wager. Housewives and desperadoes They are the housewives who have graduated from Toto and 4-D, who now salivate at the prospect of a seat at the roulette table, who worship at the root of the money tree, hoping that an apple of opportunity, just one in the bountiful orchard, would fall into their open palms. And there are the desperados who see numbers in their sleep, and dream of overnight riches.<br><br>They are many. And they are a major consideration should the Government proceed with plans to build a casino on Sentosa. Will more of such people flock to the orchard of chance should one be built on Sentosa? That's a sucker's bet. Will they become a burden to society? They are the reason the Government is treading gingerly in its plans for a casino, leaning towards making it exclusive to the high-rollers.<br><br>Compared to the benefits of having a casino - thousands of jobs, spinoffs from tourism and taxation - why are they cause for such concern? No negative social impact The Genting experience shows that there has been little damage to the religious and social fabric in Malaysia. Indeed, Genting Bhd, Asia's largest publicly-traded casino, is salivating at the windfall from a 61 per cent surge of tourists from China, thanks to efforts by the Malaysian Tourism Board. Hong Kong has casinos just a hydrofoil ride away on Macau - and Hongkongers are none the worse for it. Indeed, could their much-envied entrepreneural spirit be because of Macau?<br><br>Singapore gamblers already have floating casinos beckoning like beacons at the edge of our waters, just as they have Batam, a 55-minute boat-ride away. We have illegal gambling dens, Singapore Pools betting outlets in HDB estates - where even R(A) movies aren't allowed - and the Singapore Turf Club. So why this fear of social upheaval? What, as a gambler would say, we worry? Can we create a risk-taking citizenry and still keep it on a leash? Dare we allow the Singaporean to learn for himself the difference between the perils of a punt placed recklessly, and a wager made with eyes wide open? Hesitate, spend too much time scrutinising the odds, and mulling over the consequences, and the Thais may seize the prize with a winning bet on a casino in Pattaya.<br><br>Singapore is known for its caution. We scrutinise the future, study all the scenarios. But, in today's world, can we afford to be slow and steady? No place disproves the existence of clairvoyants or the advantage of careful planning more than a casino. For every roulette player who claims he has a vision - or even a formula to back that vision - and walks away with a fortune, there are 36 people who had the same vision, plonked their same everything, and stumbled away humbled and broke. It's a matter of percentages. And gamblers, high- or low-roller, must be responsible for their own calculations.<br><br>I learned a precious lesson the hard way: Life is like a casino; You win initially, but lose eventually. Living is a gamble; and then you die. Yes, casinos are a sucker's playground. But can it also be a classroom for the risk-averse?<br><br><strong>The retirees</strong><br><br>THESE are men in their 50s and 60s who gamble because they are bored. They use their savings and the money their children give them. They wager small amounts, usually less than $100, and limit their losses to a few hundred dollars each time.<br><br>A 61-year-old who gave his name only as Mr Ong said that, over the past six years, he has been going to a Batam casino two to three times a week, and to a cruise-ship casino once every two to three months. He told The New Paper on Sunday at the Tanah Merah Ferry Terminal: 'I do it to kill time. 'There's not much else for me to do.' Over at Genting Highlands, one retiree lost RM$300 ($132) in less than 10 minutes at the gaming table. He then switched to jackpot. 'I can play the jackpot for the whole night. 'It's only five cents per bet,' he was overheard telling his wife.<br><br><strong>The housewives </strong><br><br>DRESSED in floral blouses, capri pants and platforms, these 'Ah Sohs' gamble while their husbands are at work and their children, at school. Some also do it behind their families' backs. Many like to wear red blouses for good luck.<br><br>Madam A P Sim, 44, who gambles on board a Leisure World cruise ship, said: 'I go on weekdays - maybe three out of five days. 'I take the ferry at noon and come back on the 5pm ferry - just in time to go home and prepare dinner for my family.' She said her husband knows about her gambling, but not her two sons who are in secondary school. They think she just plays mahjong with her friends.<br><br>Most of the housewives we spoke to said their stakes are small - between $2 and $50 per bet - and most do not lose more than $500. But these punters can play for long hours without sleep. Some even end up losing their monthly marketing allowance.<br><br>Madam Ng, in her 50s, said most housewife gamblers like herself pick up the habit while on a holiday abroad. She started gamblingon a trip to Genting Highlands with her son and daughter-in-law two years ago. She said: 'When I reach the place, I prefer to stay indoors and try my luck at the casinos. 'It's okay to lose a few hundred dollars for the thrill I get from gambling. 'I know I'll lose, but I still like to go there.'<br><br><strong>The grannies </strong><br><br>WHILE some gamble to kill time, others are seasoned punters. Many dip into their savings or the money given to them by their children. When SBS Transit bus number 35 arrived at the Tanah Merah Ferry Terminal at 11.45am on a Wednesday, it was carrying mostly elderly female passengers. With their backs slightly hunched and their eyes to the ground, they clutched their handbags tightly under their armpits as they shuffled hurriedly to the boarding gate. They were rushing to catch the noon ferry.<br><br>Madam C W Ong, a 66-year-old grandmother of four, said: 'Today I don't have to look after my grandchildren, so I'm going to Batam to gamble. 'I don't go often, only when I'm free and when I have kakis (Malay for buddies) to go with me.' She added that all her three working children give her money every month, so she always has 'spare cash'. 'At my age, I don't need so much money, so I don't mind using it for small gambling stakes.'<br><br><strong>The jobless </strong><br><br>THEY are out of work, they have time on their hands, they are bored. So they go to casinos. And for those who cannot find work despite many attempts, they hope their fortunes will change at the gaming tables. Some of them have even blown their retrenchment payouts at the casinos.<br><br>Mr Soh, who used to work as a lorry driver, has been jobless for a year. The 56-year-old said: 'I've tried looking for a job in vain for so long. 'I get bored staying at home, so I go to Batam once or twice a week to gamble.' He said he gets the money to gamble from his three children who are in their 20s. 'They may give me money, but I still want to work so I can kill time. 'And if I work, I won't go to the casino.'<br><br>S'pore losers so desperate... They cheat cabbies, leave kids outside<br><br><span style="color: orange;">SOME Singapore gamblers lose so much at the Genting casinos that they cannot even afford cab rides to the train station or airport to catch their rides home. Desperate Singaporeans sometimes resort to trickery to get a free ride.<br><br>Two Malaysian taxi drivers told The New Paper on Sunday that they have encountered such Singaporeans. The gamblers would approach them outside the Genting Highlands resort and ask to be taken to the Kuala Lumpur railway station or the airport. But once the cab nears their destination, they jump out and run off, without paying a cent of their fare. It costs between RM60 ($24.50) and RM180 to go to the railway station or airport. 'Some will jump out of the car when it stops at a traffic junction or when there's a traffic congestion,' said one of the cab drivers, who wanted to be known only as Mr Lam. 'Some of them who don't manage to run away will then beg the cab drivers to let them go without paying.<br><br>'They'll come up with all sorts of excuses to try and gain the drivers' sympathy.' Mr Lam said he has learnt his lesson from more than five bad experiences. 'At least once a month, I'll meet someone who can't afford to pay me,' said the 36-year-old cab driver. He regularly ferries passengers to and from Genting Highlands. 'Now, when I know that my passengers are Singaporeans, I'll ask for payment upfront first,' he said. But he has made exceptions for a handful of them who look really hard-up. Mr Lam said: 'They honestly admit that they have no money. 'They also don't look like habitual gamblers. So I don't mind taking them to KL city. 'Some of them promise to pay me the next time they visited Genting Highlands and a few really did.'<br><br>Another taxi driver, Mr Ricky Tan, 53, said he has seen mothers leave their children at the hotel lobby, while they spend the whole night in the casino. Recalling one occasion, he said: 'The poor children looked cold and hungry. 'If the mother can afford to gamble, shouldn't she have paid for a hotel room for her kids to have a good night's sleep?'<br><br>Apart from uncaring moms, the cabbies have also seen desperate gambling addicts who prostitute themselves to get more money. Mr Tan said: 'Some gamblers will do anything to get cash to recover their losses.' 'I've seen some young women prostituting themselves to tourists after they've lost all their money at the casinos. 'Some resort to borrowing money from loansharks. 'The older folks would pawn their jewellery for more cash.'</span></div>

If your brother drink and drive and kanna hit a tree and become a dumb vegetable, do u blame the world for inventing cars or gov for legalising alcohol ? Grow up lah ! COm'on, there r pros and cons of certain decisions. A casino can bring wealth to the people here though it may cause a few to become addicts. Alcohol can also ruin a few families as well but is certainly is good or the otherwise general public. If u cannot take the hit, go back to your son raping mama and cry in her arms<br><br><blockquote>So r u agreeing tat all top management r going to FTs while Singaporeans becomes waiter (Yr F &amp; B manager), bouncer (Yr Head of Security) rit, does tat create employment 4 singaporeans..fuxkÂ…we r last in the food chainÂ…in our own country..u traitor </blockquote>I am saying F&amp;B managers, and not waiters. Head of security and nto security guards etc. They r gonna only bring in a few , (a few =3  to 10 in case your grammer sucks like wat u shown above) while the rest of the thousands r given to the locals. In a few years, maybe they will replace the top management with locals as well. If u feel tat bad about such arrangements, then u should hate the gov for setting up factories for foreign investors. They too bring in their top management in initially and stabalise the plant first as well. Singaporean, according to u, still remains to be the "last in the food chain".

            <div class='col-md body'>Comes Apr 18, I hope we would be informed:<br><br>a. How much gambling tax we could be collecting?<br>b. How's the collected gambling tax to be spent and allocated by/to the different ministries?<br><br>On many days I seen my mum glue on the teletext at 1900h, sticking her ears up on the radio when the DJs reporting the 4D or Toto results. Other than Friday, she does it on all the other days.<br><br>Fortunately she doesn't go to turf club to bet on those horses.<br><br>Yes, I am dead against the 4Ds, what's the odds for striking a 4D? 0.23%. Perhaps someone can tell me what's the odd of getting $2 from a $1 bet.  Yes, and I thought I am matured and can turn away the lures in my recent Genting trip. I lost RM1500.<br><br>I am not a compulsive gambler, rather I am not a gambler, I betted on Totos only during the CNY, and I had stopped bettings on the SCORE. But why would I still lose RM1500? I am not rich. I brought RM500  to Genting and I drawn RM1000 at Genting with my credit card, and knowingly prior my trip I had told myself I would stop at RM500. All my loses went to Tai-Sai. The odds of winning at  impressive 1:1 had simply overwhelmed me.<br><br>A casino may lure manys, educated or uneducated, rich or poor. An educated person may have done his sum and attracted by the odds. A casino may lure more people like me, someone who despised those who queued at the turf clubs hoping for a big winnings each day.<br><br>Anyway I  am not dead against having a casino.<br><br>As what many say, shouldn't it better for me to contribute my losses to Singapore government?<br><br>I am afraid of economic growth, each time when the economy is picking up, we  see price increase in food, transport, conservancy charges, swimming pool entrance fee, town council bills, utilities, minister pays, movie ticket and whatever....<br><br>To me economic growth is just a set of statistics? What would a common peasant benefits from a x% GDP growth? What would a common peasant benefits from more tourists? I don't own a shop, I don't own a company and I don't have a share in the casino. The x% GDP growth and more tourists would only push our our inflation and CPI indexes.<br><br>Yes our government will be collecting more revenues from gaming tax, in return, the government got monies for more air-conditioned bus interchanges, more monies for the 9th and 10th and 11th wonders, more monies  for their salary adjustment, more monies to lower the personal income tax.<br><br>That's not what I would like them to spend the collected gaming tax. I would rather that the collected gaming tax be used in lowering our current cost  of living instead.<br><br>Yes, perhaps they can tell us that  20% of the collected tax will be used to stabilise our public transport charges, 20% of the collected tax will be used to lessen the burden of the market and food stall holders, 20% of the collected tax will be provided to utilities companies for a lower tarriffs, 40% of the collected tax will be provided to NTUC to offset the 5% GST absorbtion on essential goods......<br><br>What I meant was that on 18 April I would hope that the we would be informed how the collected gaming tax is to be used.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There is no doubt that a never before casino will add vibrancy to life here in Singapore, just as our beloved esplanade did. How much of that added vibrancy translates into actual tourism dollars remains to be seen. The esplanade created much buzz when it first opened. How many tourists come especially to see it? How many extend their stays a day or two to watch a performance? Our tourists have their own casinos and opera theatres back home, there is no reason why they should get excited by ours, there is no compelling reason for the tourism dollars to start rolling in.<br><br>Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying the casino will not make money. It will suck money in like a vacuum cleaner, except the money will come from our fellow Singaporean's pockets. It would be easy money, not very different from 4D, toto or the Turf Club. What is wrong with taking our fellow Singaporean's money? After all, he gives it willingly. In fact every Sunday, you find many people queuing up to give money to the government. The problem is that what he loses in the casino is what he can't buy for himself or his family, in other words he gambles away his disposable income.<br><br>For example, let's say father used to bring daughter to the Zoo and buys her an ice cream each time. Now that his money goes to the casino, he can no longer afford to bring her to the Zoo or buy her the ice cream, so both Zoo and ice cream seller suffer (on top of the family that is). Whatever the casino gains is at the expense of the Zoo and the ice cream seller. In other words, notwithstanding the social impact, other parts of the economy suffer even as our casino thrives. The retail industry will suffer because there is less money for shopping ...<br><br>Gambling is a zero sum game, what one loses another gains, in this case what the people lose, the government gains. Unless the losses come from tourists, the country as a whole gains nothing and the casino becomes a futile waste of time and energy. Why should tourists come all the way here to gamble when they have bigger gambling dens in their own backyards?<br><br>The casino also purports to create jobs for Singaporeans - a noble claim indeed. What quality jobs are we creating? What value add is there? Does it add to our competitiveness? How much productivity will it add? What if as a result of gambling, people give up other past times like swimming or cycling? The swimming pool closes down? The lifeguard goes out of job? The bicycle kiosk owner starts looking for another job? Without real injection of tourism money, as long as the casino derives its money primarily from our fellow countrymen, the benefits it gains will be negated elsewhere (zero sum game).</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Too many postings here, couldn't take in everything, here are some points I wish to reply to:<br><br>[ ... submission of 19 proposals is evidence that there is money to be made from the casino ... ]<br><br>Of course there is money to be made from the casino, except it would mostly come from our fellow Singaporeans.  Tourists have their own casinos back home and have no need to visit ours.  In the end it would be Singaporeans giving money to foreign consortiums + state coffers.<br><br>[ ... People are already gambling in cruises to nowheres, what's with bringing them to Sentosa? ... ]<br><br>Is it really as simple as that?  You just bring people from the ships to Sentosa while the rest of the island remain largely unaffected?  It's more troublesome to clear customs to go on cruises to nowheres so only genuine gamblers do that.  You bring the gambling den to Sentosa and extend the MRT line to it and you have the whole HDB neighbourhood crowding Sentosa.  You're making gamblers out of non-gamblers and that's a sin.<br><br>[ ... One of the precepts of democracy is freedom of choice. Cigarettes are sold in Singapore. Ciggies are bad. People smoke rite? However, if YOU don't want to smoke that is ur choice. Smokers choose to smoke and we as a democratic society should defend his right to smoke, as long as his right does not impinge on others' rights not to inhale 2nd-hand smoke. ... However, people who want to gamble, will. And I will defend that person's right to want to gamble. However, gambling for me will be treated as like the above examples of fast food and cigarettes. Coz it simply is the same.]<br><br>Using the same logic, if YOU don't want to smoke heroin that is ur choice.  Heroin smokers choose to smoke heroin and we as a democratic society should defend his right to smoke heroin ... coz it simply is the same.<br><br>So you see, they are not entirely the same.  You don't get addicted by eating fast food.  You do get addicted to smoking, but you don't puff away your lifesavings or borrow twice that amount for your daily dosage of nicotine.  The first time you gamble, it's your choice.  Second time, perhaps.  But once you become addicted ... you're no longer rational enough to exercise your freedom of choice anymore ... and it's really a sin to take away someone's conscious ability to discern right from wrong (his freedom of choice so to speak) in a democratic country.<br><br>[its not the casinos that ruin people, its people who ruin themselves. nobody is forced to go into a casino, people go in there on their own will and greed.]<br><br>In the same token, it is not heroin that ruin people, its people who ruin themselves. nobody is forced to take heroin, people take heroin out of their own will.  The first time you take heroin, it may be yor own folly.  The second time round, not so anymore.  You've become enslaved to heroin.  Heroin has taken over your body.  You have no free will of your own anymore.  Same goes for casino.  The first time Ah Beng visits the casino, it is his free choice no doubt.  But once he becomes addicted, is it still fair to say "no one forced him to go in"?  Is it moral for us to hook people onto heroin or casinos and then say it is his free choice not to continue smoking heroin or going into the casino?<br><br>It's like someone's digging a big hole in the ground and many people are going to fall into it.  But since I'm not affected I say it's people themselves kayu walk into the big hole.  Isn't it selfish to watch people fall into the hole while you stand by and watch?<br><br>[I do not want my child to be alcohol addict, so I will ban alcohol ? I do not want my child to be smokers, so we ban cigerrettes ?]<br><br>So you're saying even as you do not wish your child to be a drug addict, you'd still legalise marijuana, heroin ...  even if you do not wish to see your child killed by a bullet in school, you'd still legalise firearms in Singapore?<br><br>[GAMBLING DOES NOT RUIN A MAN, A MAN RUINS HIMSELF.]<br><br>While that precept is true, we wouldn't want to become their accomplices in ruining themselves.<br><br>[the more you deprive somebody of something..the stronger his urge to have it. you dont let him gamble here, he'll fly off somewhere else, no difference.]<br><br>You've never tasted marijuana, do you feel a strong urge to have it?  You see, unlike basic urges for food and sex which we are borne with, the urge to smoke or gamble are not something we are predisposed with.  They are acquired and where do we acquire them from?  From family and society at large.  We can't control the family the least we can do is not let society degrade itself.<br><br>[opening a casino at least give singaporean more places to go during the weekend. Otherwise I find there are nothing better to do here]<br><br>No place better to go is poor excuse for setting up an activity that is technically a vice.  Nothing better to do, smoke marijuana too?<br><br>[So in other words you think we should all back off from competition lah ? If we wanna build up bio science, and finland want to do it too, then we gave up and let them do it lah ? If we want to build up on telecommunication while other nationals are doing it too, then we gave up and let them do it ? Then we can just hug a tree and die. I guess u really need to gamble to know more about risk taking.]<br><br>This is akin to saying "My classmate is better at biology, I dun give up, I try harder to beat him.  My classmate is also better than me at telling lies and stealing so I shouldn't give up either but try to outdo him".  You put in an honest day's study, you do better at biology.  Telling lies and stealing no doubt involve more risk taking but are they worth risking for?</div>
