Did a search on Wiki and came up with a write up on his life. The only difference here is we sue political opponents to death instead of shooting them.<br><br>Idi Amin Dada (mid-1920s[1]Â–16 August 2003) was an army officer and president of Uganda. Amin joined the British colonial regiment, the King's African Rifles, in 1946, and advanced to the rank of Major General and Commander of the Ugandan Army. He took power in a military coup in January 1971, deposing Milton Obote. His rule was characterized by human rights abuses, political repression, ethnic persecution, extra judicial killings and the expulsion of Asians from Uganda. The number of people killed as a result of his regime is unknown; estimates range from 80,000 to 500,000.[2]<br><br><strong>Idi Amin granted himself a number of grandiose titles, and for a period in 1977 to 1979 he was titled "His Excellency President for Life, Field Marshal Al Hadji Doctor[3] Idi Amin Dada, VC,[4] DSO, MC, CBE.[5]"[2] He became head of the Organisation of African Unity in 1975[6] and during the 1977-1979 period, Uganda was appointed to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights.[7]</strong><br><br>Dissent within Uganda and Amin's attempt to annex a section of Tanzania in 1978 led to the Uganda-Tanzania War and the fall of his regime in 1979. Amin fled to Saudi Arabia and lived there until his death. Amin and his regime have been the subject of films and documentaries including Rise and Fall of Idi Amin (1980) and The Last King of Scotland (2006).<br><br>Source: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idi_Amin" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idi_Amin</a><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes, I agree that PM's term should be limited to 2 years, so as not to allow any single person to dominate for too long.<br><br>I also think that there should be more, much more, opposition in politics. Now that PAP has been in politics for so long, they have proposed and change our Constitution uncontested many times, and this can't be healthy. For example, the PAP has added the electoral-president thingie into the Constitution but because of the stringent criteria used to screen candidates, you can argue that the rules mainly favour candidates already with heavy links to the PAP, which leads to a weak 'independant' president.<br><br>The Constitution is legally allowed to be changed by the ruling party, but then again, it should only do so after rigourous debates in a parliament that includes significant opposition voices.</div>
