Ms Bhutto had twice been the country's prime minister.<br><br>She had been campaigning ahead of elections due in January.<br><br>The BBC's Barbara Plett says the killing is likely to provoke an agonised response from her followers, especially from her loyal following in Sindh Province.<br><br>Ms Bhutto was key to her party, she was the focus of her party and she was a major political player amongst all those fighting for seats in the forthcoming elections, our correspondent adds.<br><br>The PPP has the largest support of any party in the country.<br><br>Analysts note that Rawalpindi, a garrison city, is seen as one of the country's most secure cities, making the attack even more embarrassing for the military authorities.<br><br>Scene of grief<br><br>The explosion occurred close to an entrance gate of the park in Rawalpindi where Ms Bhutto had been speaking.<br><br>Wasif Ali Khan, a member of the PPP who was at Rawalpindi General Hospital, said she died at 1816 (1316 GMT).<br><br>The blast caused carnage<br><br>Supporters at the hospital began chanting "Dog, Musharraf, dog", referring to President Pervez Musharraf, the Associated Press (AP) reports.<br><br>Some broke the glass door at the main entrance to the emergency unit as others wept.<br><br>A man with a PPP flag tied around his head could be seen beating his chest, the agency adds.<br><br>An interior ministry spokesman, Javed Cheema, was quoted as saying by AFP that she may have been killed by pellets packed into the suicide bomber's vest.<br><br>However, AP quoted a PPP security adviser as saying she was shot in the neck and chest as she got into her vehicle, before the gunman blew himself up.<br><br>Return from exile<br><br>The killing was condemned by the US and Russia, and a statement is expected shortly from the UK.<br><br>"The attack shows that there are still those in Pakistan trying to undermine reconciliation and democratic development in Pakistan," a US state department official said.<br><br>Russia's foreign ministry condemned the attack, offered condolences to Ms Bhutto's family and said it hoped the Pakistani leadership would "manage to take necessary steps to ensure stability in the country".<br><br>Ms Bhutto returned from self-imposed exile in October after years out of Pakistan where she had faced corruption charges.<br><br>Her return was the result of a power-sharing agreement with President Musharraf in which he granted an amnesty that covered the court cases she was facing.<br><br>Since her return relations with Mr Musharraf had broken down.<br><br>On the day of her return she led a motor cavalcade through the city of Karachi.
