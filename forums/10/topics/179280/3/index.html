Better throw away all your crayons and pencils!<br><br>Notice how your reasoning works? You like to take matters out of context and convolute the whole thing.<br><br>Muslims question the freedom of expression laws in europe. Salman posted a thread questioning the freedom of religion in saudi arabia.<br><br>You take things out of context saying: It is wrong for england to have blasphemy laws to protect the church of england, but it is perfectly alright to have saudi govt lock people up for practising their faith?<br><br>Notice that england does NOT lock muslims, athesist or devil worshippers up for practising their faith. Try to corellate the correct points.<br><br>Drug trafficers, murderers may be sentenced to death. They have knowingly broken the laws of a certain country and thus have to pay the price.<br><br>It is NOT against the law to practise your religion, such as islam in countries like USA, Denmark, Holland, England and Singapore. You need not get sentenced to death.<br><br>But being a catholic priest is enough reason for terrorists sentence the priest to death! Being Danish is sufficient reason to die! Being an american is enough for rioters to tear you to pieces!<br><br>When was the last time a priest was killed by a muslim? You dare ask that question? It was in major local newspapers (newpapers, straits times, today). Still pretending to feign innocence? Or are you going to blame the "anti muslim propaganda"?<br><br>Still pretending? So no muslim tried to kill the former pope? Or are you going to demand a definition of "kill"???<br><br>Laws set up by govts are very sensible and much effort and thought have gone into creating and maintaining a sensible and fair legal system in every major country in the world, much unlike your posts which focus more on insults than discussion.<br><br>Instead of using the wrong actions of one to justify another, which is very childish (he hit me first so i hit him back), please try to think your logic and reasoning through first.<br><br>Also, if I have misspelt the name of the muslim court in sg, then that is my mistake. There is no need to hit below the belt and assume I meant the country syria. My posts are understandable to any reasonable human being. You might as well assume when I mention chinese singaporean, you can tell me that singapore is not a china province!<br><br></div>
