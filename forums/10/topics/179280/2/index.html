            <div class='col-md body'>it is already nice enough of me to allow you guys to discuss about the danish issues. Oringinally, no issues regarding the religions should be discussed. But with all the postings that generalise all muslims as extremist, i.e. Islam is a cruel religion, it not only painted this forums in a very bad light, it also made many of the muslim forum members very unhappy.<br>Hence from here on, we have decided to allow such discussion to continue peacefully. But whoever who makes such unwarrented remarks again, we will send their names to the admin to be axed.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>We must encourage the debate on Islam. Is Islam a religion or a political movement in the guise of religion? What is the ultimate goal of Islam? These questions should not be swept under the carpet. They must be discussed in open debates and find answers.<br><br>No problem can be solved unless it is thoroughly understood.<br>Questions must be asked. If Muslims have satisfactory answers to these questions, there is no reason for them to be upset. They should come forth and dissipate all misunderstandings. But if they decide to resort to hooliganism and throw tantrums to avoid answering, it is clear that they do not want you to know the answer to these questions. "Oh, you are hurting my sensitivity" is not a satisfactory answer. It is strawman and a logical fallacy.<br>Only truth will set us free. This is a major problem we are facing today, perhaps the biggest humanity has ever faced and we must know the truth. You can't solve any problem blindly, let alone one as complex and critical as the one we are facing.</div>

Now more than ever, many non muslims and caucasians are going to errorenously assume that all muslims are terrorists (WHICH IS NOT TRUE). Many govts are going to take more stringent steps to control muslims in their countries which might add to the feeling of oppression by the immigrant muslims.<br></blockquote>now YOU are mixing things up further. caucasians? like muslims can't be caucasians or nonmuslims can't be caucasians? you are just thoroughly confused.<br><br>or maybe you think nonmuslims are all caucasians or all caucasians are nonmuslims? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>then you add another issue of migrants. where are you heading to?<br><br><blockquote><br>Perhaps, like the migrant chinese all over the world, the muslims should try to mix with the indigneous citizens of their host country and try to live more in a global village rather than continue to slam the door in the faces of the "infidels" and wonder why doesn't anyone else understand them. </blockquote>yeah once again mixing things up. you just expressed your opinion as if it was some fact, without any proof or backing.<br><br></div>
