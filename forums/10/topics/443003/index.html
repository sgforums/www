              <p>In 2010 CDAC paid $4.3 million out of $10.8 million CPF collected to 71 staff<br> <br> I was glad to read of our self help group Chinese Development Assistance
               Council’s (CDAC) pledge to extend more assistance to  the needy  as we 
              brace ourselves for a looming global financial crisis (Sunday Times 4 
              Dec).<br> <br> I have worked for a short stint  as their job placement officer there 
              during 2007 and was most impressed with their extensive  tuition 
              programmes offered to  our needy kids.<br> <br> Hundreds of volunteer tutors – paid hourly, take care of the thousands 
              of lessons conducted throughout the country benefiting tens of thousands
               of kids yearly.<br> <br> They also have solid programmes to help out those who are jobless and 
              need financial welfare assistance. Their skills upgrading programmes for
               the low-income are  also impressive and most eligible upgraders pay 
              less than 10% of the total course  fees chargeable.<br> <br> In fact, many who could not get any assistance  from our Community 
              Development Councils (CDC) would  apply at CDAC who is seen to be less 
              stringent in their procedures and are more compassionate in their 
              approach.<br> <br> Each month, all working Chinese citizens and permanent residents 
              contribute $0.50 to the fund if they earn $2000 and below.  They 
              contribute $1.00 if they earn $2000 and above. The same CPF deduction 
              rule applies to other races.<br> <br> You can opt out of the contribution by going to the CDAC website and download an opt-out form.<br> <br> Do not discount the small amount that is being contributed monthly as 
              CDAC takes in $10.8 million from such CPF deductible contribution for 
              the year 2010.<br> <br> However,  I always feel that our self help groups – CDAC, Mendaki, 
              Eurasian  and Sinda, can do more to reach out to the different 
              communities besides carrying out current programmes for  the needy.<br> <br> They did all the good stuff which  CDCs have being doing all along – job
               matching,  skills upgrading, social welfare among others and one 
              wonders if our self help groups have out-live their original mission.<br> <br> Formed in 1992 by Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry 
              (SCCCI) and the Singapore Federation of Chinese Clan Associations 
              (SFCCA)., its mission is “to nurture and develop the potential of the 
              Chinese community in contributing to the success of a multiracial 
              Singapore”.<br> <br> Moreover, with the recent spate of racial discrimination incidents, our 
              self help groups can do more to actively reach out to the different 
              communities instead of  duplicating what CDCS have being doing 
              successfully all along.<br> <br> It had also splashed out quite alot of money on useless programmes e.g. the social outreach attempt using a community bus.<br> <br> I remembered following the big outreach bus weekly  to remote parts of 
              Singapore hoping that someone out there would stop by our bus and look 
              through our programmes while we were parked at  some forsaken place due 
              to the car park problem.<br> <br> We had less than five enquiries in a month from the public and every 
              week, three bus rides would be made in an attempt to promote   our 
              services to the public.<br> <br> The monthly price tag for the driver and maintenance of the bus: $8000 a
               month. The project was thankfully scrapped after a year – wasting 
              almost $100, 000 in the process.<br> <br> I could go on but that would mean I am bad mouthing my previous employer.<br> <br> High Staff Cost<br> <br> Though I am no accounting expert, I was  alarmed at the high staff cost 
              entailed in running a 71-strong flagship with 311 part-time volunteers 
              probably paid on a hourly basis.<br> <br> $4.3 million was paid out as staffing cost for the year 2010 and  this 
              worked out to each full time staff  costing an astronomical  $55, 000 
              per year! The financial figures could be found here. .<br> <br> <a rel="lytebox[62139468]" href="http://www.transitioning.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/cdac11.bmp"><img src="http://www.transitioning.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/cdac11.bmp" border="0" alt="" height="570"></a><br> <br> The council  may have over paid it’s staff – its shocking to pay $4.3 
              million in staffing cost out of the  $10.8 million received from the CPF
               contribution in year 2010.<br> <br> The total income for the council  for 2010 was $20 million which 
              included our CPF check-in contribution, grants and subsidies from 
              government agencies, investment return and fees it collected from some 
              of its’ programmes.<br> <br> Staff cost alone  worked out to   almost 22% of the total  operating expenses of $19 million  for 2010.<br> <br> A year before in  2009, it also  paid out another  astronomical $3.6 
              million in staff cost alone  for 59 full time staff and 260 volunteers –
               even though it was 19% lesser  than the 2010 figure, the  staff 
              strength was also lesser by the same correponding figure.<br> <br> I am all for adequately paying staff who works for an organisation but 
              when 40% (S4.3m) was paid out of what  was been  taken in as charitable 
              donation  ($10.8m) from a cluless contributing public – something is 
              wrong somewhere even though I am no accounting expert here.<br> <br> There was also no proper break down on how much the full time staff and 
              volunteers’ cost were and  even the Executive Director (ED) pay package 
              was not disclosed.<br> <br> Huge $55 million In Reserve Holding<br> <br> Another financial item that stood out was the huge amount of reserve it holds – $55 million as of 31 Dec 2010.<br> <br> Most of it – $48 million -  was held in a fund management investment 
              scheme and one hopes that it is not all held in speculative risky 
              instruments.<br> <br> $16.6m was held in quoted equities securities, $13m in quoted debt 
              securities and another $7m in unquoted debt securities – all were used 
              for trading purposes.<br> <br> Out of the $48 million investment fund, $10 million is in cash form – probably for easy transfer if there is a need.<br> <br> For a charity organization meant to help the public using CPF monthly 
              deductible contribution, I thought that the reserve  held was too 
              excessive.<br> <br> $10 million in reserve holding will be sufficient for the council as it 
              is almost guaranteed an annual income of $10 million each year from the 
              CPF check-in contribution besides whatever top-up the government will 
              provide to the council.<br> <br> Holding too much reserve means that the council has being ineffective  
              in using whatever money  it has received all along and the council’s 
              committee can perhaps think out of the box to  better use the extra fund
                for  community outreach purposes.<br> <br> While working in CDAC, I attended meetings and there were always pleas 
              for the deparments to use up   all it’s money allocated as if not their 
              reserves will grow too large.<br> <br> Besides the $10 million CPF  funds  it received annually on average,  
              the government also pumped in $4.1 million in 2010 through various 
              grants and subsidies.<br> <br> Should CDAC now re-channel any surplus funds that it will  receive in 
              future  to benefit  other charitable organisations which  are badly in 
              need of funds?<br> <br> I also remembered how when a  job placement officer  helped our jobless 
              client  found a job, each placement would bring in an extra  $1000  
              funding  from the Work Development Agency (WDA).<br> <br> Each job placement officer has a target of 10 placements a month and we have two placement officers working then.<br> <br> It looks like the government funds are meant for those organisations which carry the same agenda as theirs.<br> <br> Political Agenda?<br> <br> The Chariman of the council’s committee is Mr Lim Swee Say – a PAP MP and also the current NTUC labour chief.<br> <br> There are also a few other MPs  sitting on the board e.g. Baey Yam Keng,
               Grace Fu Hai Yien, Sam Tan Ching Siong (ex-ED of CDAC and now senior 
              Perm Sec with MCYS),  Ong Ye Kung (NTUC) among others.<br> <br> The directors in office are as follows:<br> <br> (For the term 25 June 2010 to AGM in 2012) <br> <br> <br> Mr Lim Swee Say  (Chairman)<br> Mr Baey Yam Keng<br> Mr Philip Eng Heng Nee<br> Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien<br> Mr Gan Kim Yong<br> Mr James Kuah Geok Lin<br> Mr Lau Tai San<br> Ms Lim Sau Hoong<br> Mr Ng Siew Quan<br> Mr Ong Ye Kung<br> Mr Adrian Peh Nam Chuan<br> Mr Sam Tan Chin Siong<br> Mr Tan Eng Lai<br> Mr Tang Kian Meng<br> Mr Tay Khiam Back<br> Mr Teo Chiang Long<br> Mr Alex Yam Ziming<br> <br> Source: CDAC<br> <br> One wonders how politically-neutral and objective the council can be if 
              it has a minister  chairing the board with other like-minded MPs from 
              the ruling party deciding on the activities  for the council.<br> <br> I believe that the self help groups can function better with a board that is politically neutral.<br> <br> Our community development councils already have almost all politicians 
              sitting on the mayor seat and its’ agenda is mostly  political – even 
              though most of its’ funds come from our tax payer money.<br> <br> Moreover, self help groups, deriving most of its’  funds from the 
              public’s CPF contribution must strive to be apolitical so that the needy
               can be assisted without any political gain from the mostly-PAP board.<br> <br> Conclusion<br> <br> Some may have speculated that I have a hidden agenda when I wrote this article.<br> <br> I must confessed that I did not enjoyed my short work stint with the 
              council as it is a very closed-up protective environment which  always 
              favoured those that belonged to the inner circle.<br> <br> The usual workplace bullying took place there and the superior would 
              close an eye when a fresh face took in some verbal battering. I was also
               shouted at by a  influential senior staff in front of others and no one
               lifted an eyelid.<br> <br> Another junior staff was loaded with too much work while the rest took 
              it easy. Most of the senior staff  would pretend to work late to prove 
              to the managers that they are hard working  when in fact they were 
              loafing off during the day.<br> <br> Though the council has enjoyed  a family-themed work environment within 
              the smaller inner circle, it has suffered from being too inward looking 
              and almost tried too hard to reach out to the community with its’ 
              over-stuffed coffers.<br> <br> It is perhaps timely  for the council to break away from  focusing on 
              its past glory of using tuition programmes to reach out to the needy and
               try to think of new ways to prepare for a looming global financial 
              crisis ahead.<br> <br> The council also  needs to get rid of all the politicians on its board 
              so that it’s mission can be strictly community-focused   and apolitical.<br> <br> If not, many Singaporeans will always remember the self help groups as 
              another political tool – used by the ruling party at the people 
              expenses.</p>

              <p>umm...for charity organisation that has annual contribution of 10 millions, they should not chart similarly as that of government on reserve accruing...as suggested....a reserve of 10 millions is reasonably good....it is also not good for them to involve themselves in investment as there is standard income contribution to let them enjoy the assistance to others and for themselves. Instead of month cpf contribution for its employees, the government should contribute for the month cpf contribution so that the organ can optimise the contributions more wisely to more needies. Spending on transportation etc is negligible if it ready required, it's helpful towards the economy if the contribution is well spend....</p>
              <p>can the board pls look into it and do something more satisfying that benefit the employees, the public and especially to the needies  :D</p>
              <p>For an affluent city like singapore, it's saddening to learnt that there are still so many needies to look into. So, it is in the long term interest to tailor a good education that has to achieve the impact beyond materialism... on the social fabric of a nurturing mind and body...this is the responsibility of the government to ready identify another 100 years ot future bliss and peace of its state and the prosperously well beings of the people....the futuristic model of singapore really must be carefully and caringly look into :D</p>
              <p>the volunteers also deserves a big thanks for the selfless contributions.</p>
