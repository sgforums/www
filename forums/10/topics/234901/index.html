Look at the state our our government now, it is made to look like the people are the government and paid to discover the facts behind Shin Corp or NKF wrong doings ?<br><br>We have employed a minister for information in addition to all the PR officers in every ministry to gather and disseminate information and facts relating to governance, so who is required to present the statistics.<br><br>What is the job of our Minister for Information, Mr. Michael Backman once wrote an article to ask this question. whether ministry of information is set up to provide facts and information why must people be told to back up what people say?<br><br>I thought the minister could make the information available so that any doubts or lack of accountability and transparency as expressed or discovered through feedbacks will be dealt with objectively e.g. total nos. of jobs created versus citizens retrenched or unemployed.<br><br>If professors in NUS interpreted the data of MOM wrongly, why can't MOM correct the data and make them more accurate and reliable or representative of problems at issue.<br><br>Instead we saw MOM slamming the professors for not giving facts or statistics to back up what they said.<br><br>Not surprisingly the Minister in charge of Information replied to Michael Backman instead accusing him of interfering with the internal politics of Singapore.<br><br>What is the root cause of all such problems with facts, statistics and who is playing with words and legalistic power to avoid answering to real problems and issues?<br><br>Is our government right in witholding facts and information and insisting that citizens or Michael Backman or the NUS professors should be the ones to present statistics on Shin Corp deal or NKF or HDB's claim of subsidy?<br><br>Has none of our ministers and scholars in public service the duties to disseminate information as accurately and objectively as possible to answer to people's queries or is the minister of Information merely in charge of controlling free flow of information and not willing to publish the facts.</div>
