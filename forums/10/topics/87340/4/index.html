This lack of communication is the fault of both parties, why blame only the Singaporeans.<br><br>Thats like saying that all Indians are smelly or all Chinese smell like sotong or all Singaporeans are racist pigs,many are but most are not.For example,I myself have been discriminated against during my life due to my heritage,being half-Chinese with rest being Indian-Portueguese.Many ppl say that Singapore is multicultural,I would say yes,largely so,but there are isolated incidents.Who discriminates against me-Chinese,my own ppl,my own race.I have also faced discrimination in Sydney as well,but not from the native people.Guess what-it is also Chinese.Of course,I don't go around saying that all Chinese are racist simply because of the actions of a few misguided idiots.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Eh, u might wanna rephrase ur point?  Singapore is multiracial, and u "would say yes largely so"? Multiracial does NOT equal racial harmony or tolerance... singapore is either multiracial or NOT multiracial... and from what i see... we are multiracial... what u mean by there are isolated incidents? isolated incidents of not being multiracial? multiracial refers to the racial composition, NOT the views held by the people<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> i note u mention "...MANY singaporeans are guilty of..." in ur 5th paragraph.  if u dun say all or most chinese are racist because of a few misguided idiots,  why criticise "many" singaporeans because of the actions of a few misguided idiots?<br><br>Similarly,we cannot judge all Chinese just because of the actions of their government.I feel that the comments you make should be more balanced and slightly more objective.Consider what you type and preview it before deciding whether ot not to post it.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Yes, ALL of us should do that.  "Us" meaning u and me as well...<br><br></div></blockquote></div>
