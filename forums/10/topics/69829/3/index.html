Streaming is the "macro" segregation; within RI there is a "micro-segregation" as well. One that is put abt by the school admin of course: the best-teacher-to-best-class syndrome and the grouping of teh so-called "elite" students in one class. And they stuff the class with all teh gd teachers. n of course, there is the normal label of "problem" class, undeniably since the "problem" class is poor in results. n then RI has this big fat ego-buster called CLE (Character and Leadership Education). i have no idea how they can promote CLE on one hand, which teache that a leader should be humble, and on the other hand, continue with such an elitist segregation system that fosters arrogance.<br><br>call me an idealist, but im definitely not idealistic abt our education system!<br><br>the pikamaster</div>

It was only when I was in sec3 that I realised my folly and started to hate my secondary school.
