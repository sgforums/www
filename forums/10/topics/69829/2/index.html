Wearing big pants does not make you fat, being fat makes you wear big pants.<br><br>In the same vien, fustation of other's feebleness causing them to be snobbish is illogical, it is their arrogrance and snobbishness that makes them view others as feebleness.<br><br>And of course, if they have the apitidue to be snobbish, then it means they are not really mature at all, for the true intellectual will be smart enough to be humble and always remain open to all kinds of views.<br><br>I'm sorry, but this snobbishness is not a result of their hightened intellect, it is a result of their childish and deluded vision of their apparent intellect, and their malfunctioning logic that causes them to assume this gives them the right to be superior.<br><br>I'm afraid sometimes the mugging in top schools really damages the brain and leaves people socially and emotinally inept. Many of the elites can ramble off physics formulae (which have no bearing to their lives whatsoever) and have utterly no idea on their implications, many of them can't even change a light bulb.<br><br>And it's fustrating that for all their high qualifications, they are totally inept in questioning the system at all, maybe it's not exactly surprising but it's usually the underdogs that see sense.<br><br>Feeble? I'm afriad it is the snobs, with no grounding in reality whatsoever and walk around with a delusional air of self-importance who are the ones that are really feeble.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>From the few schools that were particularly spotlighted for believing in their Elitist Status, it seems very noticeable - and gratifying - that 'MISSIONARY Schools' have not been included into the Elite List being spotlighted.<br><br>This is somewhat a relief and shows that these schools have improved, since the 1980s, when it was previously a widely held belief that some 'Missionary Schools' - and the parents of the students - were 'inculcating' the WRONG values.<br><br>Perhaps it is time that the Government review the intense competition amongst the various schools, in their exam oriented approach with the objective of being the Top School, with the Top Student scoring the Top Aggregate Scores, and producing the Top Scholars in the Top Numbers.<br><br>It impart to the young mind, a false sense of value towards Achievements.<br><br>The final result is exactly as reported in the opening post, which we are all having a hard time to believe that it is coming from those who have just puberty.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>WHY YOU ARE WRONG<br><br>For your convenience, I have highlighted the brain malfunction(s) that most closely resemble(s) the one(s) you recently made on the topic of (fill in topic): TRYING TO JUSTIFY ELITIST MINDSET<br><br>1. Amazingly bad Analogy<br><br>Example: Chickens and ducks do not go together, therefore, a hokkien and hakka can never be together.<br><br>2. Faulty cause and effect<br><br>Example: On the basis of my observations, being in a good school makes you smart<br><br>3. I am the world<br><br>Example: I do not like neighbourhood schools, therefore they have little worth.<br><br>4. Ignoring everything science knows about the brain<br><br>Example: IQ is the thing that matters and makes us superior.<br><br>5. The few are the same as the whole<br><br>Example: Some normal tech students are smokers, some of them are non-smokers, therefore normal tech students are hypocrites<br><br>6. Generalizing from self<br><br>Example: I am a liar, therefore I do not believe anything that you say.<br><br>7. Argument by bizarre definition<br><br>Example: We are not snobbish or elitist, it's just that we do not believe in mixing with people of lower classes.<br><br>8. Total logical disconnect<br><br>Example: I am a good person because I study alot.<br><br>9. Judging things without comparison to alternatives<br><br>Example: I think neighourhood school students are the worst in the world, I don't believe in mixing with them.<br><br>10. Anything you donÂ’t understand is easy to do<br><br>Example: I know there isn't a textbook for it, but how hard can being streetsmart or aware of reality be?<br><br>11. Ignorance of statistics<br><br>Example: We are the best in the world, we have no need for them except slaves.<br><br>12. Ignoring the downside risk<br><br>Example: Sure, all this studying may dehumanize me and turn me into something that can only be defined as human in the physical sense, completely lacking in humility and epathy but I want full marks for this test at any cost!<br><br>13. Substituting famous quotes for common sense<br><br>Example: Remember, Â“Genius is 1 percent inspiration and 99 percent perspiration." So don't think too much about how all this stuff is revelant to us! Just mug mug mug!<br><br>14. Irrevelant comparisons<br><br>Example: All these paper qualifications may not make us real people but at least we are not Saddam Hussien.<br><br>15. Circular reasoning<br><br>Example: I am correct because I am smarter and I am smarter because I am correct.<br><br>16. Incompleteness as proof of defect<br><br>Example: Normal people from normal schools may be better human beings then us but there are no paper qualifications to show for it so it must not be possible.<br><br>17. Ignoring the advice of experts without a good reason<br><br>Example: I know what all the experts are saying on how being in a top school, gathering tons of paper qualifications and mindless studying does not make us well adjusted people but I have my own theory on that.<br><br>18. Following the advice of known idiots<br><br>Example: Some dude in the gar'men said there would be genetic dilution if we crossbred with lesser castes, and I'm gonna listen to him!<br><br>19. Reaching bizarre conclusions without any information<br><br>Example: These people have no paper qualifications. They must be simpleton ah bengs who hang out at far east with no personality worthy of being defined as an individual.<br><br>20. Faulty pattern recognition<br><br>Example: I know that a snobbish attitude, trampling down the "inferior" usually ends badly for the oppressors but I'm hoping that we can try it here.<br><br>21. Failure to recognize whatÂ’s important<br><br>Example: What? Why do you care that I am maladjusted, social inept and have the personality of a snobbish self-annointed ruler of the lesser people? I have paper qualifications and come from a good school you know!<br><br>22. Unclear on the concept of sunk costs<br><br>Example: I know that we have given up a lot of what it means to be a good person in our quest for elitism, but we can't stop now or it'll all be wasted.<br><br>23. Overapplication of OccamÂ’s Razor (Which says the simplest explanation is usually right)<br><br>Example: The simplest explanation for people with no paper qualifications is that they are individuals with no worth.<br><br>24. Ignoring all anecdotal evidence<br><br>Example: I know my girlfriend is not good in studies but they are fantastic human beings who are every bit as human and intelligent as you and me but they have no paper qualifications to prove it and hence I'm going to break up soon..<br><br>25. Inability to understand that some things have multiple causes<br><br>Example: Singapore's problems are all caused by people who are poor in studies.<br><br>26. Judging the whole by one of its characteristics<br><br>Example: My mother has no paper qualitfications, therefore I would be better off without them.<br><br>27. Blinding flashes of the obvious<br><br>Example: If we have more IQ, we are smarter.<br><br>28. Blaming the tool<br><br>Example: I have paper qualifications, I was rejected at the job interview because I had no pratical skills. Therfore this paper qualification must be defective.<br><br>29. Hallucinations of reality<br><br>Example: We from good schools are superior.<br><br>30. Taking things to their illogical conclusion<br><br>Example: If you treat these lesser people equally, the next thing you know they'll be taking over our lives!<br><br>31. Failure to understand why logic donÂ’t have exceptions<br><br>Example: It should be okay to study like mad as long as I get the paper qualifications at any cost and is not seriously dehumanized in the process... right?<br><br>32. Proof by lack of evidence<br><br>Example: I have never seen you in a JC uniform, therefore you must be a worthless person.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>a rather cute observation made by one of my drinking buddies when he went back for reservist recently...<br><br>all the orcifers who went to good schools and top j.c's were salaried men... and not all were equally successful. those who had million dollar paychecks obviously didn't get called back  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>most of the the ah bengs were "entrepreneurs"... again, not all were equally successful, but many were not making less money than the officers who got called back... again, those who were making a helluva lot didn't get called back...<br><br>some may argue that the two groups make money in different ways... white collar vs blue collar... mind work vs manual labour... here's another interesting point... SO? as long as its a line that rakes in the dough, does it matter???<br><br>one's secondary school, or even one's degree is a bad measure of that individual's worth...<br><br>at best, a good degree gives u a slight leg-up for the first 2-3 years... after that, if u don't perform, u stagnate all the same... individual mediocrity and higher education are not contradictory.<br><br>what's a degree from cornell anyway? all it proves is that u're probably good at studying.<br><br>ultimately, those young elitist punks need a reality check cos they obviously have an over-inflated opinion of their worth.<br><br>its hard to generalise on whether going to r.i will make one a ridiculously successful individuals, but all i can say to arrogant snobs is "GOOD LUCK!" may u not get too disappointed.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>At the end of the day, it's terribly sad to see that they can't even see that they are only big fish in a little pond.  As ST has observed, their "elite" status is based upon their ability to do exactly and only as they're told - that's more mindless than intelligent.<br><br>In line with that mindlessness, it's not particularly surprising that they lack the insight and self-possession to see how they are well behind the 8-ball compared to less educated but more successful businesspeople.  Instead, they prefer to hide behind a brand name.<br><br>At the end of the day, highfaluting brand names don't cut it in the real world.  In my line of work, credentials and jargon are a hinderance more than anything else - speaking in plain English has been my best tool for convincing my clients that I actually do have an understanding of their business.  I was once with a firm that did a pitch for the Sydney Olympics recruitment contract.  After a two-hour presentation showing all the techniques that my colleagues proposed to use in the process, the chairman cut them off and asked, "Look, I just want to know one thin - can you give me a number that tells me if I should hire this person or not?".  With that, they lost the tender.</div>

Have seen in NS how some from these "top schools" would not mix with those from schools not as "good" as theirs/family background not as good/English not as powderful as theirs. I was not given such shrift, because although I came from one of the "better" neighbourhood schools and poly (like ST I could have gone JC but didn't), my command of English could make some if these elitist s-h-i-t-e weep and had a more "middle-class" background.<br><br>Of course, not all are like that, but enough of them are for me to notice.<br><br>Still, I preferred to mix with the drivers and other Hokkien-pengs when I was there.

It is also a fact that the "brillant" spore student is made that way by pressure-cooking, benchmarking, coaxing, brain-washing the poor soul instead of INSPIRING them to INTERNALIZE their learnings whereby this internally-generated WISDOM helps him to APPLY it in the REAL world (you know, the one that is more than Singapore) and OPEN his/her mind.<br><br>That, is the difference.</div>
