Like a recent article in Streats commented, few people down here actually have any aspirations. anyway, let's get back to the real issue...<br><br>what wearing the white uniform means to me? well, i suppose it meant being part of a proud tradition and belonging to a good school, upholding the Rafflesian Principle of Honour, etc. though now, of course, i would dare to soil it and chuck it aside, since to me there really is no meaning anymore, not after ive gotten first hand life in RI.<br><br>i would like so much to say sth gd abt teh school, and im ashamed to have to admit that there are really quite a lot of "snobbish idiots" in RI, especially among the prefects. n i hope i'm not in your books as a "snobbish idiot", becos that im definitely not.<br><br>anyway, in RI, it's not just students building the castles, the teachers do it very often as well. In fact, that seems to be the HM's favourite pasttime at school assemblies. He enjoys spinning a whole yarn on the wonderfulness and pride of abeing a Rafflesian and his pet topic is Rafflesian Spirit. to his credit, he dun practise what he preach. in fact, he (n DHM) is the first to walk out of the competition venue when we see that RI is losing in cricket to ACS. funny, isn't it? any way, he made some snide comments on Christianity last year. SO much for promoting multiracial and multireligious harmony!<br><br>Crikes, i cud write a whole essay on that!<br><br>the dissappointed pikaamster<br><br>My Motto: Dare to Disturb the Universe!</div>

I'm not against anyone having an English name, and my post was not aimed at people having an English name. I'll be happy to admit I do use an English name as well. And yes, I am Chinese, but with an English educated background and a whole lot more comfortable using English (spoken and written) than Chinese anyday. However that does not mean that I eschew the Chinese language and culture and am too ready to denounce it. Despite my background I'm proud of who I am.<br><br>My comment is aimed at a lot of pretentious Singaporean Chinese I have seen and heard, who are quick to denounce anything "non-Western" or anyone speaking Chinese as "cheena".<br><br>Theres a difference between using English and having an English name for convenience, and eschewing one's language and culture as something to be ashamed of and sticking a derogatory label on it.</div>

But then again what can we do?<br><br><blockquote><strong>While the education system can produce excellent engineers and scientists, can the same be said of raising potential leaders who are sensitive to societyÂ’s needs? </strong></blockquote>This is a prime example of what Singapore believes education is, pieces of paper with As and more As, but no characterisation or honour. Economically there is no time for people here to work on "people" skills. This goes hand in hand with your country having to conduct ad campaigns to "encourage Singaporeans to Smile", this got me and my friends laughing in arrogance, REAL Arrogance, not your education politics kind of arrogance.<br><br><blockquote><strong>They lend weight to an observation by some foreigners that the new generation of Singaporeans is arrogant and self-centred. </strong></blockquote>Aye, look at what locals do at fast food outlets with their trays.<br></div><div class="quote_body">According to her, some Singaporeans, with their superiority in English, tend to look down on Chinese nationals. <blockquote><br>What superiority in English? Most Singaporeans cannot speak properly, in terms of sentence structure and the way they speak. E.g. Cha: So what kind of books do you read?<br>Local from SAJC: Like tat lorrrr....<br>Cha: oooooooookaay<br><br>[quote]<strong>a lot of people from so called "under achieving" schools have a fixed mind set that those from "over achieving" schools would definately be snobs. as such, would not even bother to get to know person.</strong></blockquote></div></blockquote><strong>When I completed my O level prelims, i was a 25 pointer. I went to a pre-university, which is not as glamourous as a JC. Whatever few friends I did have, 1 english educated Chinese middle class guy, 1 2nd generation Eurasian guy, looked down on me because they went into JCs, Meridian and SAJC respectively. These 2 'friends' did not return my calls, and they ignored me and did not accept me as readily as they usually did. After the real olevles came out, i was  a 10 pointer, they scored 12 and 15 respectively. Suddenly they started accepting me again. Something is seriously wrong with your society.<br><br>[quote]<strong>it also goes to show how shallow the mindset of Raffles students can be. marrying someone just because he/she is smart,handsome/beautiful,earns loads of money or social status is so superficial of them. students from top schools who have this mindset obviously do not deserve the title of being in/graduating from the so-called "elite" schools. they are nothing more than just superficial empty vessels which can be easily taught by another school. in fact, they dont even need to go to school. </strong>Why should we stop at bashing Raffles JC? Every SINGLE school in Singapore is at fault for "educating" the average Singaporean in this depraved way, the MOE is also at fault for organising the system so. ALl this shit stems from the annual school rankings, you have top 10, top 50, top 100 etc etc. The mindset of students being pompous, arises from such rankings. Last year Raffles may have been the best, followed by ACJC, then by Hua Chong, Chinese high etc etc, as you go down the list, you will see an air of superiority one school has for another, like a giant food chain cycle. With one supreme School at the top, e.g. Raffles... by the time you reach the 178th or 192th placing (however long it is), you may have "Chee Chiong Fun Junior College" students feeling superior to "Serangoon JC" because Chee Chiong Fun JC is 110th place and Serangoon is 111th place. (These are just examples).<br><br>However much I bash your system, i cannot offer a definitve solution to it. Perhaps more CME? But your culture has not much interest in it anyway, its a studying culture, a competitive one, one which only sticks to your own kind, not wanting to mix with others, expecially foreigners. But I believe, however flawed the culture is, it needs TIME, for a start, the system has to be less stressful, so that people will have time to develop empathy. E.g. IF you are in a hurry for work, you may be uncivil to people, and not really care because you are in a hurry. Likewise for school work, likewise for school ranking and uncivility in general. Its all connected. For people to rectify their faults, time is needed, you will never have time if things continue to be so hectic. But then again, you will never let things run smoothly or slowly, because otherwise your competitiveness will fall, thus you must continue this cycle, afterall, its the people who suffer, not the policy makers.</strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yeah well, ACS (I) and ACS(barker) is radically different from each other...If you guys lok closely, the ACS spirit has somewhat been "split " ever since we physically split.ACS(I) is more success-at-whatever-the-cost oriented while Barker was more student-oriented.When your bottom-line is only results and yearly promotion up the holy superscale pay grades for the educators, some of this will inevitably spillover into the mindsets of the students.Barker to my impression is still very much a school which wants and strives hard to instil a sense of responsiblity and humility. You may call me blindly loyal to this school, but a tleast its some form of loyalty, which the majority of society has perhaps even forgotten how it's spelled.</div>
