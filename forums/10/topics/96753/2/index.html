            <div class='col-md body'>As I used to be a practising lawyer once and a victim of crime myself, AND one who still has a morbid interest in what goes on in our courts, I have come to the conclusion that the reason our crime rates are considerably lower than other countries is due to a few contributing factors.<br><br>1. We have stringent laws (not unlike other ASEAN), and;<br>2. (more importantly) A police force that has the ability and support to enforce those laws -<br>3. We're a tiny tiny country. It's much easier to govern a tiny city state, than, say even a country the size of Malaysia (which is still relatively small when compared to other nations)<br><br>Singapore has always taken a tough stance against crime. We're a tiny nation, as far as possible, our policies have always been aimed at making things work. We'll adopt best practices from all over the world, and we make no apologies for doing so.<br><br>Contrary to popular belief - All our criminal laws are aimed at trying to uncover the truth of what happened.<br><br>Sylvia Lim came up with some interesting proposals:-<br><br><blockquote>Setting a maximum time limit beyond which an arrested person must be given access to counsel in the course of police investigations; </blockquote><span style="color: blue;">There really is no need for this. It is extremely rare for the accused to be denied counsel for that long a time. Even if the accused is denied access to counsel for a considerable time, the counsel is always given sufficient time to prepare a defence. The CPC is also clear on the rules governing the acquiring of evidence and of what the police can or cannot release to the defense lawyers.<br><br>I think one has to remember that if a guilty accused is given access to counsel there is always a chance for him to destroy evidence/warn accomplices etc. Inversely, if one is truly innocent, the delay in getting access to counsel does not in any way jeopardise his case.<br><br>This is an example of how our laws allow us to get to the truth of matters.</span><br><br><blockquote>Oral confessions to police should not be admissible; </blockquote><span style="color: blue;">Admissibility does not mean it cannot be disputed and rejected.<br><br>Here's a typical situation - Uniformed officers arrive at a shopping centre to arrest a shoplifter, called Bob. When the boys in blue ask why he did that, Bob says that he just thought he wouldn't get caught. They bring him back to the lock up. As he waits for the Investigating officer to attend to him, the gears in his head start turning and he crafts a plan to deny everything.<br><br>When the IO finally sees him for his side of the story, Bob goes on about how he was mistaken, that he did not mean to take the stuff out of the shop, he was the victim of gung ho shop security etc.<br><br>All other evidence all seem to support his contention that he is innocent, he has no prior record, the security officers were indeed the gung ho sort etc<br><br>At this point, Bob's simple answer to the arresting officers can be used to show the guilt.<br><br></span><br><blockquote>Â· Further facilitating remand inmates to assist their lawyers in preparing their defences e.g. making phone calls to his lawyer, family members and witnesses; </blockquote><span style="color: blue;">I don't think counsel has any problems in this area. Actually, this is grounds for appeal if indeed it has occured and hampered the defence.  </span><br><br><blockquote> If the presumptions against the accused in laws such as the Misuse of Drugs Act are retained, the standard of proof required from the accused be lowered e.g. to one of casting a reasonable doubt. </blockquote><span style="color: blue;">Semantics. The moment a reasonble doubt is cast, the scale is already tipped in favour of the accused (i.e. on a balance of probability, the accused is to be believed)  </span><br><br>What about the DP?<br><br>Well, I think the results speak for itself.</div>
