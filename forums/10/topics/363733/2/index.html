              <p><em>"If LKY make the false claim ,where are the actions taken against LKY,after Chee heard legal advices?" - </em> we should all be interested to know why is the Attorney General's Chamber and the Public Prosecutor not taking action or responding to Dr Chee's statement that LKY had made a false statement under oath that the IBA had sent a letter in praise of the Singapore Judiciary ?</p>
              <p>Why is the noisy pussy not pursuing with the AG's Chambers or the PP Office on this issue instead of demanding CSJ for evidence ?</p>

              <p>What are you disputing - the fact that such a letter from IBA exist as stated by LKY, or the fact that CSJ had claimed that the IBA had responded to CSJ that LKY lied ?</p>
              <p>Perhaps the whole event was simply distorted by  CSJ, or is it being distorted by the noise that only a pussy can make with too much idle time waiting to be plugged?</p>

              <p>Then, on July 8, the IBA issued a <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.int-bar.org/images/downloads/07_2008_July_Report_Singapore-Prosperity_versus_individual_rights.pdf">report on “Human Rights, Democracy and the Rule of Law in Singapore – July 2008”. </a>- which expressed concerns about the “limitations on the freedoms of expression, assembly, and the press, and of the independence of the judiciary in Singapore”</p>

              <p><em><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">Dr Chee sent a letter to the Supreme Court on Tuesday saying that MM Lee had given evidence 'that may not be accurate' when cross-examined by him during a hearing in late May to assess damages in a defamation case.<br><br>That evidence related to <span style="color: #ff0000;">MM Lee's claim that the IBA had written to the Law Society of Singapore praising the judiciary</span>.<br><br>'The IBA has denied that they had sent such a letter and has also confirmed that the Law Society has not received any such letter,' said Dr Chee.<br><br>Responding, Mr Singh said <span style="color: #ff0000;">the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">only inaccuracy</span> in Mr Lee's testimony was his statement that the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">IBA had conveyed this view in a letter to the Law Society</span></span>, when it was actually <span style="color: #ff0000;">a public speech by the IBA president</span>.<br><br>'If anything, Mr Lee's testimony did not do enough justice to the fact that an international organisation like the IBA was prepared to and did publicly endorse the excellence of our judiciary,' said Mr Singh.</span><br></em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>From the tussle between the IBA and the Foreign Ministry - did CSJ claimed that the IBA had written any letter to the SDP which had the IBA denying writing any letter that LKY claimed was made ?</p>
              <p>Even the Singapore Law Society was reported to have stated that they received no such letter from IBA which LKY claimed - how did LKY know what letters were received by the Singapore Law Society ?</p>
              <p>How did the noisy pussy come to his own conclusion ?</p>
              <p>If you are truly interested in pursuing the truth of what had actually transpired in LKY's statement in the High Court - should it not be in your interest to back up the noise that only a pussy like you are interested in continuing to make ?</p>
