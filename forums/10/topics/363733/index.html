              <p>Dear Dr Chee,</p>
              <p>U are a learned PhD holder and should know how to write a GP</p>
              <p>which should be fully supported by facts.</p>
              <p>http://www.yoursdp.org/index.php/news/singapore/2465-govt-no-beatings-and-torture-under-isa</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In this article published by WP,u said,among other things--</p>
              <p>1.In the Marixt Conspirators Op,who were the <span style="color: #ff0000;">100 pers</span>ons u are talking about?</p>
              <p>Pl tell us the names of the 100.</p>
              <p>2.Who have dead inside the cells?What did u imply?</p>
              <p>Did they die from torture?Share with us here.</p>
              <p>3.U are mislreading the western readers implying that there</p>
              <p>No trial nor No evidencs were put in  trial.</p>
              <p>U are wrong.There were trials and lawyers defends the accused</p>
              <p>in the closed door trials under ISA.</p>
              <p>Pl read the list of ISA detainees and their lawyers.</p>
              <p>For example,one of the lawyers,Mr <em>Subhas Anandan</em></p>
              <p>is still alive and Chairman of Criminal lawyers Association.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Mr <em>Subhas Anandan</em></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">was also a ISA detainee for 9 months for connection to gangsters.</span></p>
              <p>But he still serves the communities and raise his family</p>
              <p>in Singapore.</p>
              <p>He recently penned a Book 'The Best I could'.U can check with him.</p>
              <p>This is non--sense that lawyers of ISA detainees were targeted,like</p>
              <p>Francis Seow.Some still live very happily,no need runs for their life,</p>
              <p>if they do not betray their country!!</p>

              <blockquote>To be clear, the suspects are held under the Internal Security Act

                      government through a Marxist network. The fact that not a shred of

              <p>lionnoisy,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I thought I already explained to you in another topic, about why Francis Seow was targetted instead of the other eight lawyers.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It's because Francis Seow was politically active and LKY feels that Francis Seow is a threat to his autocratic power, therefore he needed to get rid of Francis Seow. Why you ask Francis Seow is a great threat to his autocratic rule? Francis Seow is an insider, someone who has worked as an Attorney General, he knows lots of inside workings of LKY's government, that's why LKY deemed he was the greatest threat to his absolute power and decided to go against him.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Are any of the other eight lawyers politically active?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You seem to have a psychological issue with learning, you are not able to dispute the facts given to you, but still you decide to persist in your erroneous thinking. It's like someone explaining to you earth's eliptical path around the sun and without basis you decide to dispute it and say the sun revolves around the earth.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Seriously, there are not many morons of your calibre these days. What do you actually work as? What is your highest education level?</p>

              <p>The noisy pussy never fail in his stupendous exercise at displaying his stupidity.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Before making a disgraceful attempt at helping the PAP to grind another Opposition Politician into the ground, the noisy pussy should at least make itself equal to the task.</p>
              <p>This task has become a dedication for those who are at least recognised to be more talented than the noisy pussy.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Did CSJ claim that there were 100 opposition members rounded up during the controversial <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.singapore-window.org/sw01/010521m1.htm">‘1987 Marxist Conspiracy’ </a>?</p>
              <p>Or did CSJ state that those "suspects are held under the Internal Security Act (ISA), <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>the same act</strong></span> that had" been used by the PAP to rehabilitate..more then.."<span style="color: #ff0000;">100 opp</span>osition members, journalists, human rights advocates and trade union leaders" ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The noisy pussy is adding oil to a burning controvery that was seen - then and now - to be more as the 'LKY Conspiracy' then it being a 'Marxist Conspiracy'.</p>
              <p>For 52 years, the only Communist in Singapore is LKY and the PAP - as evidenced in the Stalinist methods employed, and the dogmatic insistance in the supremacy of the Single Dominant Political Party over all politics in Singapore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This entire sad affair came about after Francis Seow was elected to <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.lawsociety.org.sg/about/organisation_structure/presidentHonMember.aspx">head the Singapore Law Society </a>in 1986, and he went on to make the Law Society more pro-active in reviewing the legislative processes as part of the social responsibility of the Law Society to protect the interests of Singaporeans - as was reflected in its Charter.</p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://books.google.com.sg/books?id=77oVpLOEiSQC&amp;pg=PA91&amp;lpg=PA91&amp;dq=1987+politics+created+singapore+academy+of+law&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=VjAuOyGPRL&amp;sig=8O5jYk7PT8BnqwdnQMX7jyOM3w0&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=vdYxSpPWFcWNkAXQ6KyKCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10">“when the Law Society attempted to comment on amendments to the Newspaper and Printing Presses Act that were introduced in 1986, the government warned expressly against professional organizations participating in politics. It then set up a rival Academny of Law..” </a></p>
              <p>This led to LKY confronting the Law Society head on, eventually resulting in LKY push to form the Singapore Academy of Law as a rival to the Singapore Law Society.</p>
              <p>The confrontation found its way into the High Court between LKY and the Singapore Law Society - which was represented by JBJ assisted by Teo Soh Lung and Mirza Namazie, in which both 'newbies' were taken to tasks by LKY - in his usual wicked ways of exposing personal details and examination results.</p>
              <p>The confrontation showed the surprising mettle of <a rel="nofollow" href="http://theonlinecitizen.com/2009/05/toc-exclusive-teo-soh-lung-%E2%80%93-in-her-own-words-part-one/">Miss Teo Soh Lung </a>- who was amongst the Catholic Church social activists accused of being involved in the Marxist Conspiracy.</p>
              <p>If ever there was a Marxist Conspiracy - it was a devilish plot that was seen quite differently by Singaporeans who witnessed that period - as can be reviewed in a <a rel="nofollow" href="http://singapore.groups.vox.com/library/post/6a00d4142545853c7f0110182755e1860f.html">Singaporean reflection of the ‘Conspiracy’ </a></p>
              <p>Even local commentators that included those who were then youngsters and later to become PAP ministers had their views on record about this contemptuous plot of deriding innocent Singaporeans in a <a rel="nofollow" href="http://theonlinecitizen.com/2009/05/the-marxist-conspiracy-not-forgetting-the-evil-things-that-have-already-been-done/">Marxist Conspiracy </a>that was created by LKY.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If stupidity must be seen, we should expose it from all possible angles.</p>

              <p>My frens here shall rememebr Chee called a Reader as a Professor.</p>
              <p>Now the PhD Chee wants to cheat us again by calling a Lectuer</p>
              <p>as a Professor!!But SG old fren Gopalan Nair this time is very</p>
              <p>honors.Nair calls the same guy Michael Barr a Lectuer only.</p>
              <p>2.U may ask me why I am so particular of the title.</p>
              <p>My answer is i am very stict to any one who may has strong influence</p>
              <p>on the future of SG,be it a PAP or opposition party.</p>
              <p>I cant stand any one who cheat us on small issue and</p>
              <p>who may ,one day ,can decide our future.If he is so prone to cheat</p>
              <p>or careless,i am afraid he just sell SG out one day,if he is in power!!</p>
              <p>3.I dunt think Chee Soon Juan just overlooks the title.</p>
              <p>He wants to impress his readers that these two authors of a book</p>
              <p>on SG are PREFESSORS.This will make their book more credible.</p>
              <p>CHEE just do a disservicr for them!!SG people,though on bended knees</p>
              <p>as decribed by opposition party,are not stupid!!</p>
              <p>Or he may wants to enhance his own status by telling u that who</p>
              <p>blacken the name of SG like he does,are PROFESSORS!!</p>
              <p>4.I have done my home works ,This Michael Barr</p>
              <p>is just a Lectuer in The
                  Flinders University of South Australia,NOT a Professor</p>
              <p>in Flinders Uni.</p>
              <p>I am not sure if this mr Barr holds a position of Professor in othe Uni.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>first,i am sorry sometimes give reply late.</p>
              <p>2nd,in response to your question.</p>
              <p><em>''Were the following words created by CSJ, or were these
                  words printed by the publishers of the book written by the

              <p>well,if the first paragraph is not written by Chee,then how can Chee starting his review in this way--</p>
              <blockquote><em>'This issue is examined not just through the lens of Singapore’s
                  political system. Messrs. Barr and Skrbis delve at length into the

              <p>There is  connection between the first paragraph</p>
              <p><em><strong>''The “Singapore Story”</strong>—the title of the first''</em></p>
              <p>and the second para.</p>
              <p><em>''This issue is examined not just through the lens of Singapore’s political system''.</em></p>
              <p>so CHEE did write the first paragraph.</p>
