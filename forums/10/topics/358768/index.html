              <p><span class="postbody">Jakarta (ANTARA) - <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: red;">A
              group of protesters calling themselves a team for the care of the David
              Hartanto Widjaja case, will stage a rally in front of the Singapore
              Embassy here on Tuesday.</span> <br> </span> <br> Jakarta Metropolitan Police Traffic Management Center (TMC) said the protest rally would be staged from 11 a.m to 1 p.m.
              <br> <br> As reported earlier that David, an Indonesian student at the Nanyang
              Technology University (NTU) in Singapore, was found dead after
              allegedly committing suicide by jumping from a balcony of a campus
              building.
              <br> <br>According to media report, the university claimed that David was in
              a meeting at the office of his mentor, Prof Chan Kap Luk, when he ran
              amuck and stabbed the professor in the back, then left the office while
              stabbing himself repeatedly before jumping off the balcony.
              <br> <br> But <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: red;">David`s
              parents insisted their son was murdered, saying he would never commit
              suicide and claiming they had evidence to prove it.</span> <br> </span> <br> The family and an independent verification team filed the case with the
              coroner`s court last week and gathered their own witnesses to support
              their case at the coroner`s inquest in Singapore from May 20-26, 2009.
              <br> <br>It was reported that about 16 witnesses have been lined up to
              testify at the inquiry into the death of the 21-year-old Indonesian
              undergraduate student.
              <br> <br>Besides the protest rally outside Singapore Embassy, other groups
              of protesters will also stage rallies in front of Parliament building
              on Gatot Subroto street in South Jakarta, in front of Presidential
              Palace, and the Home Affairs Ministry office on Merdeka Utara street in
              Central Jakarta.
              <br> <br>The protest rallies on Tuesday may cause heavy traffic jams along
              the main roads in the capital city and motorists are therefore called
              on to take alternative roads. </span></p>

              The news make it such that NTU seemed to be lying and covering the true nature of David's death.
              
              I'm all for the protesters.
              
              I don't use my sig here in respect to David and his family. May they find justice and peace.

              <p>PHOTOGRAPHS - 120 in all - were used to paint a likely scenario of
              events that transpired between Nanyang Technological University (NTU)
              student David Hartanto Widjaja and Associate Professor Chan Kap Luk on
              March 2.</p>
              <p>On that day, Mr Widjaja was found dead after falling four storeys
              from a link bridge on campus. Minutes before, he was seen running from
              the office of Prof Chan, his final-year project supervisor, after
              allegedly being in a knife struggle with him.</p>
              <p>On the fifth day of the coroner's inquiry into Mr Widjaja's
              death, forensic scientist Lim Chin Chin told the court that her
              findings were based on the photographs, two visits to the campus in
              April, and information given by the police.</p>
              <p>Ms Lim, from the Forensic Chemistry and Physics Laboratory of
              the Health Sciences Authority, took the witness stand yesterday, along
              with Dr Christopher Syn, a senior forensic scientist who conducted a
              DNA examination of blood taken at the scene.</p>
              <p>She said almost all the bloodstains left behind in Prof
              Chan's office - including some found on the wall above a computer
              monitor - belonged to Mr Widjaja. Prof Chan had been seated near the
              computer when the alleged attack began.</p>
              <p>These stains indicate the swing of an arm downwards from
              somewhere above the monitor where blood was either cast off from a
              wound or from a bloodstained object, she said.</p>
              <p>Dr Syn told the court on Monday that only Mr Widjaja's blood
              was found on the knife handle. He added that the blade, which broke off
              during the struggle, had a mixture of Mr Widjaja and Prof Chan's blood.</p>
              <p>Ms Lim said Prof Chan's blood was detected only on the floor
              near a computer table. Blood from a partial palm print on some
              documents near the office door was also found to be Mr Widjaja's.</p>
              <p>Outside the room, blood trailed in two different directions.
              One was caused by Prof Chan while the other, more severe, was from Mr
              Widjaja. The soles of Mr Widjaja's feet were soaked in blood although
              he did not leave any footprints along the trail.</p>
              <p>Ms Lim said he was likely to have 'inked his feet in blood'
              that dripped from a deep cut on his right wrist, before sitting on the
              ledge of the glass roof. The hearing continues on June 17.</p>
