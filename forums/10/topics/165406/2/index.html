His father is a sea captain. Rabe pursues a career in business, serving as an apprentice with a merchant in Hamburg then working in Africa.<br><br>1908 - Rabe travels to China.<br><br>1910 - He is employed in the Beijing office of the Siemens China Corporation.<br><br>1927-29 - Japanese troops are sent to China to obstruct attempts by the Guomindang to unify the country. In June 1928 officers in the Guandong Army, the Japanese Army unit stationed in Manchuria, begin an unauthorised campaign to secure Japanese interests and precipitate a war with China. Both the Japanese high command and the Chinese refuse to mobilise.<br><br>1931 - In September, conspirators in the Guandong Army stage the 'Manchurian Incident', blowing up a section of railway track in the south of Manchuria then blaming Chinese saboteurs. With the Japanese Government powerless to intervene, the Guandong Army mobilises, taking nearby Mukden (now Shenyang) then, in January 1932, attacking Shanghai, south of their territory in Shandong Province.<br><br>A truce is reached in March 1932. The Japanese then establish the puppet state of Manchukuo, centred on Manchuria and headed by the last Chinese emperor, Puyi.<br><br>Meanwhile, in November 1931 Siemens transfers Rabe to their office in Nanjing. Now the company's senior representative in China, he sells telephones, turbines and electrical equipment to the Guomindang government.<br><br>1932 - The Japanese military effectively takes control of the Japanese Government in May when the prime minister is assassinated. Manchukuo is formally recognised by the military-controlled regime.<br><br>1933 - In Germany the Nazi Party seizes power on 30 January when their leader Adolf Hitler is appointed chancellor. The Nazis quickly take control of the entire state apparatus. Rabe will join the party, becoming head of the local party branch in Nanjing.<br><br>1936 - In November, Japan and Germany sign the 'Anti-Comintern Pact', an agreement to fight the spread of communism. Italy joins a year later.<br><br>1937 - The Second Sino-Japanese War breaks out on 7 July following a skirmish between Chinese and Japanese troops outside Beijing. Chinese forces evacuate Beijing on 28 July.<br><br>The Japanese overrun Tianjin (100 km southeast of Beijing) on 30 July then attack Shanghai on 13 August. After a three-month siege, Shanghai falls and the Guomindang forces withdraw to the northwest towards their capital Nanjing (also known as Nanking). The Japanese pursue.<br><br>The foreign community and much of the Nanjing's Chinese population, including the government, are evacuated from the city during November. Rabe is ordered by Siemens to leave. He sends his family away but refuses to go himself.<br><br>Instead, he stays behind with several dozen other foreign nationals (mostly German and American missionaries, scholars, doctors and businessmen) to establish a temporary 'Safety Zone' to provide Chinese refugees with food, clothing and shelter during the confusion that is anticipated when the Japanese enter the Nanjing. Rabe is made head of the 15-member international committee that is founded on 22 November to administer the zone.<br><br>Twenty-five hostels are established in an area measuring around seven square kilometres in the western district of the city, with centres located in all of the foreign embassies and at the University of Nanjing. Rabe also opens his own property, which will shelter about 650 refugees.<br><br>On 1 December the international committee is authorised by the mayor of Nanjing to take over the administration of the city once he and his staff are evacuated.<br><br>The Japanese ground assault on Nanjing begins on 10 December after the Chinese troops assigned to defend the city refuse to withdraw.

            <div class='col-md body'>Rabe and other members of the international committee meet the Japanese as they enter the city and attempt to explain the situation within the safety zone, asking that its boundaries be respected. However, their appeal will have limited effect.<br><br>"If I had not seen it with my own eyes, I would not have believed it," Rabe writes in his diary on that day. "They (Japanese soldiers) smash open windows and doors and take whatever they like. ... I watched with my own eyes as they looted the cafÃ© of our German baker Herr Kiessling. ... Of the perhaps one thousand disarmed soldiers that we had quartered at the Ministry of Justice, between 400 and 500 were driven from it with their hands tied. We assume they were shot since we later heard several salvos of machine-gun fire. These events have left us frozen with horror."<br><br>The Rape of Nanjing (in Chinese, 'Nanjing Datusha' or 'Great Nanjing Massacre') results in the indiscriminate murder of between 200,000-350,000 Chinese civilians and surrendered soldiers. It is the worst single massacre of unarmed troops and civilians in the history of the 20th Century.<br><br>Japanese troops loot and burn the city and surrounding towns, destroying more than a third of the buildings. Chinese captives are tortured, burnt alive, buried alive, decapitated, bayoneted and shot en masse.<br><br>Between 20,000 and 80,000 Chinese women and girls of all ages are raped. Thousands are murdered after their ordeal. Thousands more are forced into sexual slavery. It is one of the worst ever recorded single cases of mass rape.<br><br>About 250,000 Chinese find refuge in the safety zone, which quickly becomes a permanent rather than temporary facility. Among the refugees are Chinese soldiers who were unable to leave the city during the general retreat. The Japanese demand that they be handed over and forcibly enter the safety zone on several occasions to apprehend suspects.<br><br>Rabe and his fellow zone administrators attempt to stop the atrocities occurring in the city while working to ensure that the refugees within the safety zone are fed and nursed. They also petition international governments to intervene and document the events for the world media.<br><br>Rabe uses his Nazi credentials to prevent the atrocities wherever possible. He writes repeatedly to Hitler asking that something be done to stop the killing. Along with other members of the international committee he records the actions of the Japanese troops and passes on reports to the Japanese embassy, which is also lobbied to intervene. Rabe also records his experiences in his diary.<br><br>"Groups of three to ten marauding soldiers would begin by travelling through the city and robbing whatever there was to steal," he writes at one point. "They would continue by raping the women and girls and killing everything and everyone that offered any resistance, attempted to run away from them, or simply happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. During their misdeeds, no difference was made between adults and children. There were girls under the age of eight and women over the age of 70 who were raped and then, in the most brutal way possible, knocked down and beat up. We found corpses of women on beer glasses and others who had been lanced by bamboo shoots. I saw the victims with my own eyes - I talked to some of them right before their deaths and had their bodies brought to the morgue at Kulo Hospital so that I could be personally convinced that all of these reports had touched on the truth.<br><br>"You would have thought it impossible, but the raping of women even occurred right in the middle of the women's camp in our zone, which held between 5,000 and 10,000 women. We few foreigners couldn't be at all places all the time in order to protect against these atrocities. One was powerless against these monsters who were armed to the teeth and who shot down anyone who tried to defend themselves. They only had respect for us foreigners - but nearly every one of us was close to being killed dozens of times. We asked ourselves mutually, 'How much longer can we maintain this 'bluff'?'"<br><br>On 19 December Rabe writes, "Six Japanese climbed over my garden wall and attempted to open the gates from the inside. When I arrive and shine my flashlight in the face of one of the bandits, he reaches for his pistol, but his hand drops quickly enough when I yell at him and hold my swastika armband under his nose. Then, on my orders, all six scramble back over the wall. My gates will never be opened to riffraff like that. Â… The 300 to 400 refugees here in my garden - I no longer know how many there really are - Have used straw mats, old doors, and sheets of tin to build huts for a little protection from the snow and cold."<br><br>On 24 December he writes, "I have had to look at so many corpses over the last few weeks that I can keep my nerves in check even when viewing these horrible cases. It really doesn't leave you in a 'Christmas' mood; but I wanted to see these atrocities with my own eyes, so that I can speak as an eyewitness later. A man cannot be silent about this kind of cruelty!"<br><br>And on 30 January, "My car is stopped on Hankow Road by a group of about 50 Chinese, who asked me to rescue a woman whom a Japanese soldier had led away to rape. Â… I find the house completely looted, the floor covered with all sorts of debris. In one of the open rooms is a coffin on a bier, and in the room adjoining, lying on a floor covered with straw and junk, I see the soldier, who is about to rape the woman. I manage to pull the soldier out of the room and into the entryway. When he sees all the Chinese and my car, he pulls away and disappears somewhere in the ruins of nearby buildings. The crowd stands at the door, murmuring, but quickly disperses when I tell them to, so as not to attract more Japanese soldiers."<br><br>The 1,200-page diary is forgotten after the Second World War, but will later resurface to furnish proof that the atrocities at Nanjing did in fact occur.<br><br>It is estimated that more than 250,000 are saved by the actions of Rabe and the other zone administrators, who are subjected to constant threats and intimidation, including violence, from the Japanese.</div>

It is generally remembered for the invading forces' barbaric treatment of Chinese women. Many thousands of them were killed after gang rape, and tens of thousands of others brutally injured and traumatized. Meanwhile, approximately a quarter of a million defenseless Chinese men were rounded up as prisoners-of-war and murdered en masse, used for bayonet practice, or burned and buried alive.<br><br>The background<br><br>The Second World War began in Asia. Japan's military dictators had long viewed China as the main outlet for their imperial and expansionist ambitions (for an overview, see Saburo Ienaga, The Pacific War 1931-1945). Japanese forces invaded and occupied Manchuria in northeast China in 1931, setting up the puppet state of Manchukuo. After the manufactured "Marco Polo Bridge Incident" of July 1937, the Japanese launched a fullscale invasion of China, capturing Shanghai on 12 November and the imperial capital, Nanjing, on 13 December. Numerous atrocities were committed en route to Nanjing, but they could not compare with the epic carnage and destruction the Japanese unleashed on the defenseless city after Chinese forces abandoned it to the enemy.<br><br>The gendercide against Chinese women<br><br>Murdered Chinese women and children are strewn<br>across the steps of a Nanjing building.<br>Women were killed in indiscriminate acts of terror and execution, but the large majority died after extended and excruciating gang-rape. "Surviving Japanese veterans claim that the army had officially outlawed the rape of enemy women," writes Iris Chang. But "the military policy forbidding rape only encouraged soldiers to kill their victims afterwards." She cites one soldier's recollection that "It would be all right if we only raped them. I shouldn't say all right. But we always stabbed and killed them. Because dead bodies don't talk ... Perhaps when we were raping her, we looked at her as a woman, but when we killed her, we just thought of her as something like a pig." (Chang, The Rape of Nanking, pp. 49-50). Kenzo Okamoto, another Japanese soldier, recalled: "From the time of the landing at Hangzhou Bay, we were hungry for women! Officers issued a rough rule: If you mess with a woman, kill her afterwards, but don't use bayonets or rifle fire. The purpose of this rule was probably to disguise who did the killing. The military code with its punishment of execution was empty words. No one was ever punished. Some officers were even worse than the soldiers." (Yin and Young, The Rape of Nanking, p. 18<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>One eyewitness, Li Ke-hen, reported: "There are so many bodies on the street, victims of group rape and murder. They were all stripped naked, their breasts cut off, leaving a terrible dark brown hole; some of them were bayoneted in the abdomen, with their intestines spilling out alongside them; some had a roll of paper or a piece of wood stuffed in their vaginas" (quoted in Yin and Young, The Rape of Nanking, p. 195). John Rabe, a German (and Nazi) businessman who set up a "Nanking Safety Zone" in the city's international settlement and thereby saved thousands of Chinese lives, described in his diary the weeks of terror endured by the women of Nanjing. Though young and conventionally attractive women were most at risk, no woman was safe from vicious rape and exploitation (often filmed as souvenirs) and probable murder thereafter. "Groups of 3 to 10 marauding soldiers would begin by traveling through the city and robbing whatever there was to steal. They would continue by raping the women and girls and killing anything and anyone that offered any resistance, attempted to run away from them or simply happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. There were girls under the age of 8 and women over the age of 70 who were raped and then, in the most brutal way possible, knocked down and beat up." (Chang, The Rape of Nanking, p. 119.) In addition to those killed after the violation, historian David Bergamini notes that "Many immature girls were turned loose in such a manhandled condition that they died a day or two later. ... Many young women were simply tied to beds as permanent fixtures accessible to any and all comers. When they became too weepy or too diseased to arouse desire, they were disposed of. In alleys and parks lay the corpses of women who had been dishonored even after death by mutilation and stuffing." (Yin and Young, The Rape of Nanking, p. 195.)<br><br>Not all of the victims of rape were female. "Chinese men were often sodomized or forced to perform a variety of repulsive sexual acts in front of laughing Japanese soldiers," writes Chang. "At least one Chinese man was murdered because he refused to commit necrophilia with the corpse of a woman in the snow. The Japanese also delighted in trying to coerce men who had taken lifetime vows of celibacy to engage in sexual intercourse. ... The Japanese drew sadistic pleasure in forcing Chinese men to commit incest -- fathers to rape their own daughters, brothers their sisters, sons their mothers ... those who refused were killed on the spot." (Chang, The Rape of Nanking, p. 95.)<br><br>The gendercide against Chinese men<br><br>Young Chinese men, their hands bound, are<br>led away for mass execution.<br>On 5 December, even before Nanjing's fall, Prince Yasuhiko Asaka -- uncle of Emperor Hirohito -- issued a secret order to "Kill all captives." When Nanjing was taken, "All military-age men among the refugees were taken prisoner," whether or not they had actually been soldiers (Yin and Young, The Rape of Nanking, p. 76. Note that the Chinese Nationalist government's press-ganging of young men was possibly the most brutal and gendercidal in history -- see the case-study of Military Conscription).<br><br>At wharves along the Yangtze River, tens of thousands of these prisoners -- up to 150,000 in all -- were massacred in cold blood. A typical order, issued to the 66th Regiment 1st Battalion on 13 December, read as follows:<br><br>Battalion battle report, at 2:00 [p.m.] received orders from the Regiment commander: to comply with orders from Brigade commanding headquarters, all prisoners of war are to be executed. Method of executed: divide the prisoners into groups of a dozen. Shoot to kill separately. ... It is decided that the prisoners are to be divided evenly among each company ... and to be brought out from their imprisonment in groups of 50 to be executed. ... The vicinity of the imprisonment must be heavily guarded. Our intentions are absolutely not to be detected by the prisoners. Every company is to complete preparation before 5:00 p.m. Executions are to start by 5:00 and action is to be finished by 7:30. (Quoted in Yin and Young, The Rape of Nanking, pp. 110, 115.)<br>According to Iris Chang, "The Japanese would take any men they found as prisoners, neglect to give them water or food for days, but promise them food and work. After days of such treatment, the Japanese would bind the wrists of their victims securely with wire or rope and herd them out to some isolated area. The men, too tired or dehydrated to rebel, went out eagerly, thinking they would be fed. By the time they saw the machine guns, or the bloodied swords and bayonets wielded by waiting soldiers, or the massive graves, heaped and reeking with the bodies of the men who had preceded them, it was already too late to escape." (Chang, The Rape of Nanking, p. 83.) The Japanese held grotesque killing contests, including "a competition to determine who could kill the fastest. As one soldier stood sentinel with a machine gun, ready to mow down anyone who tried to bolt, the eight other soldiers split up into pairs to form four separate teams. In each team, one soldier beheaded prisoners with a sword while the other picked up heads and tossed them aside in a pile. The prisoners stood frozen in silence and terror as their countrymen dropped, one by one." (Chang, The Rape of Nanking, p. 85)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Atrocious tortures were also inflicted on the captive men. "The Japanese not only disemboweled, decapitated, and dismembered victims but performed more excruciating varieties of torture. Throughout the city they nailed prisoners to wooden boards and ran over them with tanks, crucified them to trees and electrical posts, carved long strips of flesh from them, and used them for bayonet practice. At least one hundred men reportedly had their eyes gouged out and their noses and ears hacked off before being set on fire. Another group of two hundred Chinese soldiers and civilians were stripped naked, tied to columns and doors of a school, and then stabbed by zhuizi -- special needles with handles on them -- in hundreds of points along their bodies, including their mouths, throats, and eyes. ... The Japanese subjected large crowds of victims to mass incineration. In Hsiakwan [along the Yangtze] a Japanese soldier bound Chinese captives together, ten at a time, and pushed them into a pit, where they were sprayed with gasoline and ignited." (Chang, The Rape of Nanking, pp. 87-88.)<br><br>How many died?<br><br>After the war, the International Military Tribunal of the Far cited "indicat[ions] that the total number of civilians and prisoners-of-war murdered in Nanking and its immediate vicinity during the first six weeks of the Japanese occupation was over 200,000. That these estimates are not exaggerated is borne out by the fact that burial societies and other organizations counted more than 155,000 bodies which they buried ... these figures do not take into account those persons whose bodies were destroyed by burning or by throwing them into the Yangtze River or otherwise disposed of by [the] Japanese." As well, "According to Japanese Lieutenant colonel Toshio Ohta's statement, between December 14 and December 18 the Japanese commanding headquarters of Nanjing Port disposed of 100,000 bodies while other troops disposed of 50,000." (Yin and Young, The Rape of Nanking, pp. 78, 90.) With the sole exception of the Nazi gendercide against Soviet POWs, this was the most concentrated massacre of prisoners-of-war in recorded history. The rapes and rape-murders of women were also of staggering proportions. "Certainly it was one of the greatest mass rapes in world history," writes Iris Chang. She notes that "it is impossible to determine the exact number of women raped in Nanking. Estimates range from as low as twenty thousand to as high as eighty thousand." (Chang, The Rape of Nanking, p. 89)<br><br>Who was responsible?<br><br>Senior members of the Japanese high command bearing direct responsibility for the mass atrocities in China included the Emperor Hirohito, who made all major military decisions, including the one to invade China in 1937; Hirohito's uncle, Prince Asaka, who issued the order to "Kill all captives" and was thus the main architect of the gendercide against Nanjing's men; General Yanagawa Heisuke; and Lieut. General Nakajima Kesago, commander of the 16th division, who "supervised the beheading of two prisoners-of-war to test his new sword, thus setting an example for his troops in mass-scale killing in Nanking" (Yin and Young, The Rape of Nanking, p. 284).<br><br>The aftermath<br><br>The massacres and mass rapes in Nanjing continued for a full six weeks, extending into January 1938. Eventually the genocidal rampage was replaced by a brutal occupation conducted under a puppet authority, the "Nanking Self-Government Committee." Life began to return to the city, and its population eventually re-stabilized at around 700,000, two-thirds of the prewar population. In August 1945, after atomic-bomb attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the Japanese surrendered to the United States and other allies. The Second World War was over.<br><br>In 1946-47, war-crimes trials were held in Nanjing. "Only a handful of Japanese war criminals were tried in Nanking," notes Chang, "but they gave the local Chinese citizens a chance to air their grievances and participate in mass catharsis." (Chang, The Rape of Nanking, p. 170.) Tani Hisao, a commander of the 6th Division which had committed many atrocities in Nanjing and elsewhere, was sentenced to death in March 1947 and executed the following month. The International Military Tribunal for the Far East tried nearly 30 key Japanese commanders, including Matsui Iwane, commander of the Central China Expeditionary Force. Iwane, however -- according to Chang -- "may have served as the scapegoat for the Rape of Nanking. A sickly and frail man suffering from tuberculosis, Matsui was not even in Nanking when the city fell" (Chang, The Rape of Nanking, p. 174). He was nonetheless executed along with six other "class A" war criminals in this Japanese equivalent of the Nuremberg trials. General Yanagawa Heisuke and Lieut. General Nakajima Kesago, two of the main Japanese field commanders in charge of the occupation of Nanjing, died of natural causes in 1945, and thus could not be prosecuted. Controversially, the Japanese imperial family, including Emperor Hirohito and Prince Asaka, received immunity.<br><br>A conscious attempt has been made by "revisionists" in Japan to deny or downplay the involvement of the Japanese military in massive atrocities during World War II. In September 1986, the Japanese education minister, Fujio Masayuki, referred to the Rape of Nanking as "just a part of war." In 1988, a 30-second scene depicting the Rape of Nanking was removed from Bernardo Bertolucci's The Last Emperor by the film's Japanese distributor. In 1991, censors at the Ministry of Education "ordered textbook authorities to eliminate all reference to the numbers of Chinese killed during the Rape of Nanking because authorities believed there was insufficient evidence to verify those numbers" (Chang, The Rape of Nanking, p. 20<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">. And General Nagano Shigeto, a Second World War veteran appointed justice minister in Spring 1994, told a Japanese newspaper that "the Nanking Massacre and the rest was a fabrication."<br><br>Until the recent resurgence of interest in the Nanjing Massacre, the atrocities and their survivors had been largely forgotten. "After the war some of the survivors had clung to the hope that their government would vindicate them by pushing for Japanese reparations and an official apology. This hope, however, was swiftly shattered when the People's Republic of China (PRC), eager to forge an alliance with the Japanese to gain international legitimacy, announced at various times that it had forgiven the Japanese." Despite the fact that "the PRC has never signed a treaty with the Japanese relinquishing its right to seek national reparations for wartime crimes," no such reparations have been sought -- or offered. Overseas Chinese have, however, mounted increasing activist efforts. "The 1990s saw a proliferation of novels, historical books, and newspaper articles about the Rape of Nanking ... The San Francisco school district plans to include the history of the Rape of Nanking in its curriculum, and prints have even been drawn up among Chinese real estate developers to build a Chinese holocaust museum." (Chang, The Rape of Nanking, pp. 223-24.) Chang concludes her book, itself an important contribution to the revival of interest in these ghastly events, with a call for justice, however delayed:<br><br>Japan carries not only the legal burden but the moral obligation to acknowledge the evil it perpetrated at Nanjing. At a minimum, the Japanese government needs to issue an official apology to the victims, pay reparations to the people whose lives were destroyed in the rampage, and, most important, educate future generations of Japanese citizens about the true facts of the massacre. These long-overdue steps are crucial for Japan if it expects to deserve respect from the international community -- and to achieve closure on a dark chapter that stained its history.

            <div class='col-md body'>"Smug calculations" lack sincerity, analysis<br><br>At the upcoming 11th ASEAN Summit in Kuala Lumpur, the annual trilateral meeting of Chinese, Japanese and South Korean leaders gets aborted for the first time. Both China and South Korea believe that the three-party conference will be meaningless given the Japanese Prime Minister's continuous shrine visits. However, Tokyo responded not by reflecting on its improper behavior but by accusing China of playing "diplomatic card" and "shunning Japan out", in an attempt to cover up the fact that Japan lacks fundamental sincerity towards the promotion of East Asia cooperation.<br><br>Under the proposal of Japanese former Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi, leaders from China, Japan and the ROK specially held an informal breakfast meeting when attending the ASEAN 10+3 summit in 1999. The same thing happened the next year. In 2001, proposed by then Korean President Kim Dae-Jung, the breakfast was upgraded into an annual formal conference, and six of them have been held by now. The two-hour close-door talks have become a gathering ground for dialogue, communication and discussion for cooperation among the three parties.<br><br>However, a looking back on Japanese acts in East Asia cooperation in recent years reveals easily that this country, from the bottom of its heart, has never treated this gathering very seriously.<br><br>Against the backdrop of continuously deepening economic globalization and regional cooperation, East Asia has attained fresh vigor after experiencing "miracle", "crisis" and system innovation. Meanwhile, Japan, who has long been given a "lift" under a multilateral free trade system, has been enveloped in economic bubbles over the past decade. Japan is craving a "return to Asia", and the kernel of its regional strategy is to "Japanize" regional policies, legal system, industrial division and financial and monetary fields. It mainly targets some ASEAN countries, at the same time avoiding Free Trade Agreement (FTA) but bending on Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA).<br><br>Signing FTAs with Asian countries, Japan believes, will help it neither in protecting disadvantageous sectors such as agriculture, nor in grasping dominance in investment, service, financial and monetary affairs and intellectual property rights. While EPA will not only enable it to protect weak sectors, highlight strategic advantages and grab the upper hand in negotiations, but will promote its policies and laws in East Asia and therefore dominate the process of system integration in this region.<br><br>To this end, Japan firstly signed an EPA with Singapore, and is now trying to promote it with ASEAN countries. At the same time, Japan never responded to the Chinese appeal to start FTA talks. Japan's smug calculations are clear: to skirt around China and build up a so-called "new order in East Asia" led by itself.<br><br>Japan's unwillingness to talk directly with China on FTA is out of the following considerations: first, the huge market released by China's WTO accession is enough for Japanese companies, and zero-tariff between the two parties are not needed now; second, once a FTA is signed, Japan will be forced to open its agriculture and labor markets; third, Japan believes a big part of the current non-governmental business network in East Asia is in the hand of Chinese, which is not favorable to efforts to "Japanize" this region; fourth, Japan is afraid that the Chinese influence may stand in its way towards a political power.<br><br>So far, China's regional cooperation strategy is characterized by equality, mutual benefit and common development. It has been regarded as a "strategic threat" by Japan since it runs counter to the Japanese appealing for economic, financial and monetary circles in this region.<br><br>Cooperation must be based on sincerity. If Koizumi really hopes to further discuss cooperation with China and the ROK at multilateral occasions such as the ASEAN summits, he should be better behaved and stop his shrine visits, for they will only keep the relations with the other two countries at the lowest ebb. "Smug calculations" lacking sincerity are no more than a one-sided daydream that will never come true.</div>

Zoellick throws into the dustbin of history the notion of containment, Cold War parallels or 19th-century balance-of-power concepts as the foundation for Washington's management of China's rise.<br><br>The Zoellick interview offers a new framework for the US's approach to China: that of shared stakeholder in the international system calling on China to accept the responsibilities as well as the benefits of the global system.<br><br>This is fresh US thinking and language about China. It has the potential to create a new platform for US-China relations. It should be music to Australia's ears, and it raises another possibility forgotten in Australia: that America's approach towards China is far more sophisticated than Australia's.<br><br>Zoellick's message is that "the US welcomes a confident, peaceful and prosperous China". He offers China an invitation "to work with us to shape the future international system".<br><br>For China's leaders, this is an invitation and a challenge. For the US political system, it presents China as an opportunity, not a threat. Zoellick's aim is to change the mind-set of the US-China debate; he is explicit about seeking a transformation.<br><br>While Zoellick would never concede this, his China vision stands as an alternative to the portrait of military rivalry depicted by Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, notably in his June 4 Singapore speech.<br><br>Rumsfeld and Zoellick, typical of the Bush administration, offer competing stories about China. But this term the State Department, under Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, is more formidable and Zoellick, officially described as Rice's "principal deputy, adviser and alter ego" has the running on China.<br><br>Zoellick's concept was first advanced in a September21 speech before the national committee on US-China relations and was expanded upon in his December6 interview with this paper. It is already the subject of intense debate within China's system and among its leaders.<br><br>Zoellick's framework dominates the US-China dialogue, inaugurated in Beijing last July and which had its second session in Washington last week involving Zoellick and China's executive vice-foreign minister, Dai Bingguo.<br><br>"What I tried to do in the [September] speech was set out why the Cold War logic of containment no longer applies," Zoellick says. "In fact, it's in direct contradiction with our efforts to integrate China. But I also take this a step further. I say that 19th-century balance of power logic also doesn't conform with the current process of integration.<br><br>"However, I point out to the Chinese that it is natural that as a rising power they will prompt questions about their intentions and if they are not successful in dealing with that, then it will lead to hedging strategies.<br><br>"So I'm not setting out a view that is all benign. I'm trying to engage the Chinese very seriously: on the one hand paying them the respect they're due for what they've accomplished but, second, urging them to recognise the larger responsibilities they now have in the international system."<br><br>Zoellick says the US must "encourage China to become a responsible stakeholder". This means working "with us to sustain the international system". It is a framework to encompass the entire US-China debate.<br><br>"Our discussions [with China] focus on how this concept can be applied across a whole range of policy issues: economic, energy, security, nuclear non-proliferation, terrorism and regional security. The challenge of the dialogue is not only to engage people at a conceptual level but start to connect it to operational implications," Zoellick says.<br><br>Highlighting this symbolism, Zoellick plans to take his Chinese counterpart Dai to former US president Franklin Roosevelt's Hyde Park home in New York.<br><br>"FDR was associated with developing a concert of powers after World War II," Zoellick says, pointing to the UN and Bretton Woods as examples. "What I am suggesting to the Chinese is that rather than keeping China contained or at arm's length or in balance, we are trying to urge China to play a role in this system of systems that has evolved."<br><br>For Zoellick, the threat to the US comes not from China but from Islamist terrorists. It comes from failing states, not a rising Asia.<br><br>"China does not want a conflict with the US," he says. "In my view the real security threat today is one of Islamic radical terrorism, part linked to weapons of mass destruction."<br><br>To highlight the real threat, Zoellick invokes the published letter intercepted by US intelligence from al-Qa'ida leader Ayman al-Zawahiri to his terrorist commander in Iraq, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, and says: "It is a striking document that gives you insights into how these people view the world.<br><br>"Their goal is to set up a new caliphate, throw out all the infidels - that's us - throw out all the apostates, that's most of the Muslims in Southeast Asia. Now, this view doesn't accept the international system that exists. But that's not China's view."<br><br>He rejects the claim that China today is the Soviet Union of the 1940s. "I believe they are unlike the Soviet Union," he says. "China is not trying to challenge the fundamental system. The Soviet Union never accepted international partners in capitalism. The Soviet Union had a notion of imperial expansion. China has not taken that strategy."<br><br>Zoellick points to prominent Chinese such as chairman of the China Reform Forum, Zheng Bijan, who argues (Foreign Affairs, September-October) that China's strategy depends on peace. "Contrary to China challenging the international system, China is using the international system as part of its development path," Zoellick says.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>"The 20th century was a tough century for China: wars, civil conflicts, poverty, the threat of dismemberment. But if you look at the Chinese over the past 25 years they have made a lot of progress. And there've made progress as part of an international system that our two countries [the US and Australia] have helped to create and sustain."<br><br>The Chinese have been thrown into a spin by Zoellick's "responsible stakeholder" concept. The Wall Street Journal of December 7 reported their difficulty in getting an adequate translation. What, exactly, did stakeholder mean? A mini-industry was created in China over its meaning and political implications.<br><br>Zoellick believes China cannot succeed just focused on internal development; it needs to confront the challenge implicit in its rise to power. "What I am first encouraging the Chinese to do is to join with us on the concept of using their influence in a constructive way to sustain and advance the international system," he says. "From a domestic [US] point of view I also had a purpose which is to try to counter some of the thinking that just sees China as a threat. I want to advance the thinking in the US that for seven administrations looked upon our goal as simply integrating China in the global system."<br><br>For Zoellick, that policy has succeeded; look at commodity markets, the UN Security Council and capital markets. It is now time for a new US policy. So what does it involve?<br><br>It means putting pressure on China. It means asking China to accept responsibility equivalent to its ambition. It means forcing China to think about its future and how it wants to be seen. It means recasting China's traditional view of international relations. It means broadening the scope of shared US-China interests. And it means a searching intellectual test for China's leaders. That's all.<br><br>In the interview and in his September speech Zoellick gives many practical examples of his thinking. Each has been or will be put to the Chinese. Here is part of the list.<br><br>Zoellick has raised the idea of "a true peace with regional security and development" on the Korean Peninsula. The North Korean problem transcends nuclear weapons: it is about economic and political reform, and China's diplomacy is pivotal to any lasting solution for a non-nuclear peninsula.<br><br>Next item: the threat of terrorism and a weapons on mass destruction capacity. "What will happen to the economic development of China if there is a serious terrorist incident some place with nuclear weapons?" Zoellick asks rhetorically. His message is that China and the US should do more in the global fight against terrorism. On the issue of state proliferation he says: "I will be suggesting to the Chinese they have a strong interest in stopping Iran getting nuclear weapons."<br><br>Take trade. As the former US special trade representative, Zoellick wants China to assume a greater role in global trade talks. "Australia has played an influential role historically in the world trade discussions," he says. "I've made the point to the Chinese that given their interest in the world trading system they're going to need to play a more active role."<br><br>Yes, he concedes it is asking a lot from such a new World Trade Organisation member. But, given China's size, it is essential.<br><br>Take human rights and foreign policy. Zoellick says that if China's energy policy "leads it to develop relations with governments like those in Sudan and Burma", then it risks being "the closest partner of international pariahs". China cannot ignore the costs, so Zoellick proposes a form of linkage. "I'm trying to suggest to them that they can develop energy resources in Sudan but help us deal with the genocide in Darfur," he says.<br><br>Take the most sensitive issue: China's mercantalism, manifested in an artificially low exchange rate, a compulsion to accumulate balance-of-trade surpluses, a preference for exports over imports. Chinese mercantalism, the flip side of American extravagance, is the joint source of the unsustainable imbalance in the world economy.<br><br>Zoellick issues a polite warning. He's not trying to be "hostile and faulting" but China, given its size, if it slips into these policies, then "the international economic system will be much less able to cope".<br><br>The further risk is a US domestic backlash against cheap China imports. Zoellick cautions China against "creating political stresses in this country and others that will eventually hurt their own strategy".<br><br>China will need to find an exit path and that involves, sooner or later, a new exchange rate system. Paul Keating has called on China's authorities to move to a float, Reserve Bank of Australia governor Ian Macfarlane says a higher exchange rate is necessary and Zoellick says, in effect, that he wants China and the US to negotiate this outcome.<br><br>His aim is to "get my Chinese counterparts to recognise that it is in their interests and our mutual interests to address these problems" not as a "zero-sum negotiation" but as a mutual benefit.<br><br>Next item: the freedom and democracy debate, so beloved by President George W. Bush. "I've tried publicly and privately to explain to the Chinese why our advancement of freedom, rule of law and democracy should not be seen as a threat to China but rather as part of China's own development," Zoellick says. "My main point is that the values we believe in are not only our essence as a country but, equally important, we think they lead to stronger societies. The lesson of September 11 is that dysfunctional societies and failing states are the location, if not the source, of security problems. So rather than see a pluralist political system as a weakness, we believe it's a strength."<br><br>Zoellick, who lived in Hong Kong 25 years ago, says a generational transformation in China has occurred. He rejects any notion that democracy is limited by culture or civilisation.<br><br>On regional relations Zoellick warns that "concerns will grow if China seeks to manoeuvre towards a predominance of power". He plays down but does not dismiss that closer US ties with Japan and India are motivated by the need to balance China. He wants to explain to the Chinese "why tension between China and Japan isn't in our interest". He seeks greater co-operation between the US, China and Japan.<br><br>Those people who interpret the new US-India concord as "just a power-balancing ploy against China, failed to recognise that India is not going to allow itself to be a chesspiece that's moved around the board".<br><br>Zoellick dismisses any analysis of Asia in 19th-century balance-of-power terms.<br><br>Asked to confirm his framework is a Bush administration policy, Zoellick laughs. "Well, yes, I do work in the administration," he says. "I wouldn't just put out a speech that didn't have the general support and backing of the rest of the administration. Secretary Rumsfeld was in China recently and he referred to stakeholders. I'm sure the Chinese took close note of that."<br><br>The starting point to understand US-China relations lies in the realisation that they encompass many stories and many policies. There is no single US policy towards China. But Zoellick, who oversees the US-China dialogue, offers a compelling new story founded in optimism about the most vital relationship of the coming century.</div>

"Some of its recent moves have caused concern to both the neighboring countries and around the globe."<br><br>The most important thing, as Qin acknowledged, on the Japanese side, should be making substantive efforts by taking actions to overcome the political hurdles impeding the growth of friendly and cooperative relations between Japan and its Asian neighbors, including its relationship with China and the Republic of Korea (ROK).<br><br>Qin denied the possibility of discussing defence issues at the upcoming ASEAN (the Association of Southeast Asian Nations) plus China, Japan and the ROK Summit and the East Asian Summit by saying that the main focus of the summits would be on the economic and social issues of the region.<br><br>He added that there was no arrangement for a meeting to bring together the foreign ministers of China, Japan and the ROK in the near future for reasons known to all.</div>
