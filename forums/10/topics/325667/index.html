              <p>The rich are defintely taxed higher here than in singapore. Btw this thread is not about me claiming the rich should not be taxed, I am saying they should not be taxed like intheir own countries because we can accomodate them in singapore. We need them to contribute to the economy. Like eg. i know for a fact the some of the rich want to escape the high taxation in their own countries but Singapore can give them residence if they agree to invest or start a business.. I think such a scheme is avaialble already, just that the details i am not so sure of.</p>

              <p><br>Actually Singapore doesn't need the rich to invest in it. Singapore at present has lots of reserves, so much reserves that the government has no viable investment options in Singapore, in desperation they ended up ploughing into overseas investments, as a result overpaying for most of it. What Singapore lacks is citizens with expertise to form viable businesses for the export market. Probably a result of the political system, as dictatorship stifles creativity needed for inventions and research. Therefore under the current political system, Singapore will never achieve a level of economic growth like the Swiss.</p>
              <p>Only some of the superscale salaries to ministers should be reduced, some of the low grades civil servants are already paid pittance.</p>

              <p>A two-tier structure to the GST? </p>

              <p>The government considers it too troublesome (not profitable), therefore better to tax everything and let god sort them out.</p>
              <p>In Australia &amp; UK where they have GST (VAT), they have exemptions for necessities like basic foodstuff, medication and textbooks.</p>
              <p>If they earn less, they will cook up lots of excuses about how cumbersome it is to implement. I don't see the problem with implementation because alot of countries are doing it, it's just that they will rake in less revenue.</p>

              <p>I have seen very well paid employees of a certain company  - since they are so well paid, they are concern about making their money grow from Millions to Billions. So they have no time to look at work or other issues cause they are busy investing their own money on company time and resources. The work and responsibilities are "delegated" out to brown nosing subordinates who want a leg up and will do anything to help their boss.</p>
              <p>So when a employee is paid so much that is not within market range, and if the employee is high in power and there is no possible counter checks, there is a high chance the above is happening. If this is happening in pirvate sector, don't you think the same human nature exists in public sector.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Quite true. Why don't they increase your tax instead rather than the "innocent" rich.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">the civil service salaries
              could be reduced.</span></p>
              <p>Yeah and risk corruption and a reduction in work effectiveness and productivity? Do you know that most people working in the public sector earns lesser than those from the private sectors?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Taxing foreigners on their salaries to feed the

              <p><span style="color: #000000;">So lets say that the range of income which is considered as middle range from SG$2000 - SG$7000</span></p>
              <p>Those earning 7k would pay the same tax as those earning 2k?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">I believe our revenue can only b earned from foreigners and at

              <p><span style="color: #000000;">And if one day all the foreigner would to go off to another country which have better benefits, who or what will we rely on then? Self-reliance man. The fact that they migrate shows that they are not loyal to their home country, and may not be loyal to ours as well.</span></p>

              <p>Last years, singapore produced thousand of millionaires both in asset and cash in bank, but the poor lower class had also increased to 20% and still going up, there is a widening disparity of rich and poor, this is normal under a capital minded society. What the govt can help is to plough more from the rich to help the poor to buck up on their structural unemployment status, upgrade existing skill for better pay and continous longlife education, govt must keep giving money to help this group so as to close the gap. A widening of income gap between the rich and poor is not healthy to our national security, harmony and peaceful society. And of course the election votes can be bad for the ruling party if poor is on the rise.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However, having said it, the poor must be willing to learn and upgrade themselve, the govt can give them the rod and teach them how to fish, but they must have the determination to fish for themselves, otherwise, whatever is given, it no use</p>
