            <div class='col-md body'>It's a bit long, but I guarantee it's an enjoyable read!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>A long time ago, there was a powerful Kingdom in the ancient world.<br><br>The Kingdom was ruled by a wise royal family. They realize that in order to administer the Kingdom effectively, they must have control over the judges, the soldiers and the messengers.<br><br>Their most influential messenger was a grand old lady called <strong>Gwen Forsynth</strong>.<br><br>As the chief messenger, her duty to the Kingdom was to convey accurate information to the peasants and workers. She was also the official spokesperson of the royal family.<br><br>Despite her cool and impartial appearance, Madam Forsynth was a very tortured soul.<br><br>On one hand she lived among the peasants and workers, and talked often with them, so she identified with them.<br><br>On the other hand she had frequent audiences with the royal family, and understood the importance of their decisions, so she respected them greatly.<br><br>The problem is - whenever the royal family and the workers disagree, they both tend to blame Mdm Forsynth.<br><br>The royal family reminds Gwen to exercise restraint over her words, because miscommunications can be devastating to the Kingdom. The workers accuse Gwen of withholding too many words, because <span style="font-style: italic;">that</span> is a form of miscommunication.<br><br>Caught in the middle and shot by both sides, Gwen was plagued with inner conflict. It was a pent-up frustration that was waiting for a chance to explode.<br><br>Then one day, that opportunity came.<br><br>A friend of the royal family made a glaring mistake.<br><br>He was the head officer of <strong>T&amp;T Welfare Services</strong>, which obtains funds from the workers and redirects them to needy people. He had become greedy over the years and was diverting much of this money into his own pocket.<br><br>Gwen was suspicious of T&amp;T because of the officer's extravagant ways and his arrogance. She hinted to the workers as diplomatically as she always did,  that T&amp;T had controversial practices.<br><br>This "hint" immediately drew the ire of T&amp;T, which read the insinuation as a direct accusation. T&amp;T wanted blood. The head officer challenged Gwen to a public duel to defend his honour.<br><br>Gwen tried to settle this disagreement privately, but the T&amp;T head was unmoved. He was an expert marksman who had shot dead some of his opponents before. He looked down on Gwen, a mere old lady.<br><br>He was sure that he would win.<br><br>On the fateful day of the duel, Gwen and the head officer were each handed a flintlock pistol. They paced outwards, back to back.<br><br>3...2...1... FIRE!!!<br><br>POP! POP!<br><br>The head officer was shocked. His shot went completely wide. Gwen's shot however, stuck him right at his chest.<br><br>To add insult to injury, the head officer's formal dress was damaged by the blast, causing all of his ill-gotten gold coins to drop all over the ground.<br><br>T&amp;T was finished. But Gwen was not done yet.<br><br>Shrieking like a crazy woman, she repacked the black powder, reloaded her flintlock and shot the officer again and again, with child-like pleasure in her eyes.<br><br>POP! POP! POP! POP! POP! POP!<br><br>It was relentless. She knew that the royal family would not protest because he was a "mere friend". She used this opportunity to release all of her inner frustrations.<br><br>POP! POP! POP! POP! POP! POP!<br><br>This went on for days and days. Although the head officer's body was already shot through like swiss cheese, Gwen refused to stop.<br><br>The royal family could only smile weakly and pretended not to notice.</div>
