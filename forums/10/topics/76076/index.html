            <div class='col-md body'>After hearing the news that the MRT and Bus operator may need to implement marshall to deter terrorist attack and possibly increase tranport fare. I understand that there would probably be a need to implement transport marshall, but do we want to pay for it?<br><br>So how?  Here's an idea, why don't we follow the example of changi airport, where they get NS man to patrol the airport premises.  Cheap and good, already paid for by tax payer's money.  Can we not also get NS man to patrol the MRT and Bus stations? What do you guys think?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>in the first place does security guard patrol at MRT and bus terminal gona make a difference? if they are unarm, they cant even protect themselves. if they are arm, probaly only cisco. how can they ensure safety? check all passenger? if not also no point. not easy to detect potential threat at these train and bus station esp we have high volume of passenger traffic.<br><br>to me this idea is stupid. just way for MRT and bus operator to raise their fare. if each passenger need to pay 5 cents more. imagine min 1 million MRT passenger. if means $50000/day .<br>$1.5 million/mth. $18 million/year.  this is minimum. actual could be more.<br><br>i agree we need plane marshall. MRT station guard? forget it! and stop finding excuses to give more business to Cisco police.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think relaxx1corner has a pretty good idea. The great thing also, is that we won't be need that many NSmen to go on the trains, because obviously they should be plain-clothed and undercover. The idea of having onboard marshalls basically serves as a deterrent to any potential terrorist activity. Unfortunately, we may not even have enough NSmen to send there because of our population decline.<br><br>And as for reyes's estimates on MRT commuters, I've heard that the actual amount is somewhere around 4-5 million rides a day. And if you multiply that number by 5 cents, you will get....a lot of money.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  . As for the increment, if you're wondering how much of that amount will actually be going directly to those marshalls, I don't think you'll be able to find out, because obviously SMRT will not publish a financial record on that.<br><br>Sigh...I still remember those days when bus fares were 35 cents. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>

It is almost similar to the suicide bombers who blow up BUSES in Isreal....just what kind of deterrant will work with such people?<br><br>There are so many ways that the MRT trains and the rail structure can be sabotaged. Just one bomb on one of the pillars which support the rail tracks will do enough economic damage for SG. It is just like Nicoll Highway in a sense.....except that there are no alternative railway tracks for the trains to divert to.<br><br>I think the public needs to do their part too - announcements asking people to report suspicious articles are needed, but whether they are effective is another thing, many singaporeans really prefer to mind their own business.....they dun like to kay poh....<br><br>if there are really marshalls, then the people will think that looking out for suspicious articles is not their job, and that the safety on trains are the responsibility of the marshalls, which is definately not the case. People do tend to get complacent over time too.<br><br>To me, having marshalls are just a waste of money....sigh....and any real sloution to combating this terrorist problem will be expensive and probably not worth the cost - but again, how can the benefits of effective security be measured in terms of dollars and cents? It is simply difficult to gauge the benefits, if any at all.</div>
