If we meet face to face, I ask you for your IC, see whether you run or not. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Talking about the word "migration", it simply means the movement from one place to another place, it takes many different forms, from conquest, to cultural infiltration, to settlement, ...and refugee movement. A tick on an immigration form does not define the word in details. Modern understanding of the word migration means you move with the intention to settle. This differentiate the move from going on long holidays, overseas employment, ....  you are not seasonal birds which would settle for good. Thousands of HKgers went to Canada, USA, Australia, and even HK to get a PR, a green card, in case things go bad in HK after 97, they have a back up, just likeyour parents. Most of them would not say they have migrated. Have your parents migrated? Those who actually migrated sold everything in HK, brought their family and settle in a foreign land.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">It makes no sense to argue with you on definition. I don't put words into your mouth, you wrote a lot in this forum, apparently you forgot what you wrote. </span><br><br>I agree, the government is wrong not to take care of old folks, but thank God, my parents, who also participated in the building of Singapore, do not have to depend on the government for old age. I, together with my brother and sister will not allow any winter in my parents old age, though they have experienced winters in China, Korea, and Japan during holidays trip there. They don't like it there, and I will never allow them to have to travel with me to settle in a cold country, just to be with their grand children. Don't want to migrate for me is more than just patriotism. Yes, we still need to care for those old folks who are less fortunate, join opposition parties, participate in help organisations.....migrating to any other country can only talk, it does not help.<br><br>I said it in another post, I am not in biomed industry and I know nothing about that, so I cannot and won't expend on it. But from airport hub, ports....to high tech industries, since when were there no competitions, from any countries in the world, not just Australia. So? chicken out?<br><br>I have been retrenched before, during the difficult period of time, my wife supported me till I got another job again. Being positive enable us to live our life happily together, but of course, being prepared with savings, with extra skills, and even my friends in Singapore who help make it easy to have positive attitude. In anyway, will it help by being negative, does it make any diff if I sing a different tune? Be positive, there is no win or lose in this arguement, if you know how to be positive, it will benefit you a lot in the future, that is what I've learned.<br><br>Yes, I have bought a car for a song, because the owner was migrating, needws to dispose of it quickly. I am looking for more. Oh ya if the bubble burst, hmm....that is a very negative statement, I will be first to scavenge off those singaporeans who have to sell their properties cheap. Whats wrong with that? you will be lucky if you get some money back, if religious terrorists, or communists from PRC occupies Singapore, you would have nothing left.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"> another negative statement. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">   </div></blockquote>I don't think I forget what I say about the definition of migration. I never ever mix up citizenship and migration . As for putting words in my mouth, you did not read properly and jumped straight into conclusions.<br><br>If I stay in Singapore, I will be struggling to support my own parents based on the type of shitty wages I will get and be increasingly unhappy.  You have 2 other siblings. I have 1 and I am the only child of theirs working while she studies in Australia as a dependent. My father could have retired but international student fees are too expensive . I had to sponsor them to come over plus jump the queue - so my finances are already tied with the Australian govt bond so that my own sister got a way out as a dependent child of theirs,  if she does not want to return to Singapore or cannot get a good job there . At least when they decide to come over, I just buy health insurance in Australia for their private health cover which is far cheaper than paying for some subsidised bed in a Singaporean hospital. Free healthcare is just my backup.<br><br>It is about basic survival and a better lifestyle where I know I will be happy. <strong>If I have to go overseas to have a comfortable survival , I will. </strong> I am not even talking about earning a million bucks - my version of comfortable is to have a paid off property before 35 years old and a job I actually like doing.  Of course a million will be a bonus. If you can't get it in your head and want to continue hammering others, go ahead.<br><br>You make it sound so easy to migrate . Not many people can migrate. And not many can build from square one at all - new homeland, new friends ,new laws etc. Got friends who want to go out of Singapore - they can't. They are stuck.  One of my friends my age and she cannot even afford to buy a HDB flat or even a car despite the fact that she has to work OT and six day weeks .

            <div class='col-md body'>The brain drains of talented citizens are by the hundreds of thousands.<br><br>The ministers are too self-centred to admit this was largely caused not by individual attitudes as mentioned by them like quitters or whiners but by their uncaring policies over the years which have resulted in our losses of economic competitiveness beside driving up costs of living forcing citizens to go for migration.<br><br>So it is untrue that citizens are ungrateful or fleet-footed. It is just that the government has failed to bring about the necessary conditions to facilitate growths and vibrancy and citizens' making of honest living.<br><br>The current recovery from last deep recessions is just a hype partly due to world recovery and partly a knee-jerked reaction to IR. Look at the real domestic economy other than a few monopolies and GLCs which dictate their own fees and prices, most businesses are in very bad shape struggling to pay rising rentals and all the double-charged lands and assets set by government to drive up its surpluses.</div>

Before that there were not much growth there, little appreciation of properties prices, definitely not the level of appreciation in Singapore. So far, the people I know actually made their money here then move to australia. I don't think Singaporeans are migrating to be rich in Australia. Unless you are of special professions which their government require, it is not easy to get a job there.<br><br>My parents came from Malaysia, but my family grew up in Singapore, with all the education and so on..... compared to my relatives in Malaysia, I am glad my father brought us to Singapore. He being Chinese helicopter, did not have it well under the english speaking colonial government, but we are glad we came here. Patriotism to me is what the country required of you, how patriotic are you are judged by your fellow countrymen, not what you and I claim.<br><br>Malaysia had never wanted the speak no malay/english chinaman; to the malaysians, especially the malays, the country is for the bumi. In Singapore, the reverse is true, just that the distribution of wealth is not so even, the need to care for the less fortunate become more urgent, the concerns about aging population become acute, and the need for check and balance in our political system thus become imminent. You are patriotic when dealing with outsiders, not for internal problem.<br><br>The Chinese says "jia jia you ben nan nian de jing", every family has its own problem. There is no DS solution for all families, migration is definitely not a solution for me. Besides hardwork, family support, you also need luck (to me it is the grace of God).

The Chinese have given up that right in many SEA countries. Singaporeans are in general apathy to politics, not so much for fear of the ruling party but for the fear of changes. It is also true here to exercise our political right beyond the vote once every 4 years requires much more effort and self disciplines than in many other countries. As such, more so, much more so, do we need citizens to be politically active to make changes. Migrating will not help.</div>

The Chinese have given up that right in many SEA countries. Singaporeans are in general apathy to politics, not so much for fear of the ruling party but for the fear of changes. It is also true here to exercise our political right beyond the vote once every 4 years requires much more effort and self disciplines than in many other countries. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">As such, more so, much more so, do we need citizens to be politically active to make changes. Migrating will not help. </span></div></blockquote>Politically active? You are joking. The current government does not encourage it. Singapore is the epitomy of Father Knows Best State.<br><br>Look at how the opposition politicians are dealt with.<br><br>Each time someone speaks up about something.

Now students are made to speak english and chinese. While it is still not desirable that students speak Singaporean with a mix of english, chinese, with lah, hor, meh...at least there is no more segration in the society, no more jia gang tang nor the chinese helicopters, Many Chinese families can't tahan and migrated, blaming the government.<br><br>You can find out why all these normal express gifted streams are for, extend it further why some go poly some JC if not all JC can go university? I don't necessarily agree with the education system here, which directly affect my children, but this is where I find home education more important now than ever before. but this is a different subject.<br><br>The word "Scholor"  has two definitions, "a learned person or a specialist in a particular brand of learning" and "a student given scholorship aid". Australians take one definition and Singaporeans take one definition, what's wrong?<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by fymk:</div><div class="quote_body">Why do u think people brand ITE as It's The End?

If they can do well they can stay on to take O level and so on. Even after ITE they can also do O level. This is an alternative, a choice. Of course nobody want to be electrician or plumber cause they are not paid as highly as those in Australia. But damn, isn't it lucky we still have the malaysian plumbers and electricians to give us affordable service. Or else we all have to go ITE to learn about electricity and plumbing. will that be the end for us?<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by fymk:</div><div class="quote_body">Why do you think that in Singapore ( and even with overseas Singaporeans) , I have seen parents will point to the cashier and tell their kids if they don't study , they will end up like them?</div></blockquote>point to the cashier or point to the road sweepers? parents have always been telling their children to study so that they can become doctors, accountants, lawyers.... How can this be changed? the day cashiers make $10,000 a month! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>I am not saying that I agree with parents teaching their children this way, just that wealth or the ability to create wealth has been a key factor in social segregation. In fact, equal wealth does not necessarily bring about social cohesion, but the lack of wealth definitely aggrevate the difference. I don't know if the rich aborigines are regarded equally in the Australian society,  the poor, no money aborigines are definitely one low class of its own.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by fymk:</div><div class="quote_body">Why do u even think Wee Shu Min, an overpampered little princess with daddy's connection , can even hammer on a poor guy griping about his future in Singapore?<br><br></div></blockquote>why? her daddy's connection? wish her luck if all she counts on is her daddy's connection. Over pampered? hammering the poor guy like hammering her maid at home? there is nothing you can do if her father didn't teach her.<br><br>My concern was the naivety and arrogance of many young punks speaking like her, subjects and opinions can be different. She is pro government, many here are anti government. An illustration of youthfulness or superiority?<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by fymk:</div><div class="quote_body">Policies affect society .</div></blockquote>Everything affects society. If policies change society, it is when the people in the society allow it to be changed. People do not live together as a society because the policies tell them so, people become a cohesive group because they have common interests. What are the common interests of Singaporeans?<br></div>
