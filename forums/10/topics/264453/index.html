If any FT see investment back in their home country yielding greater returns than leaving it in Singapore, it is their perogative, at least they made the right decision to invest in Singapore to start with. You should wish your investment in your new place give you greater returns than in Singapore, or else the FTs are better than you in investment.

Stay in Australia, I own an apartment owing 30% of the value to the bank so it is backed against itself. Sorry, don't get you about me wishing my new place giving me greater returns. I already got greater returns in Australia.<br><br>If I didn't return to Singapore to work , I would have owned a 100% without mortgage. But I returned out of blind loyalty...so I kenna big time ....70% of my apartment is mine and 30% is owed to the bank. I still have to make up for alot of lost time.</div>

If we meet face to face, I ask you for your IC, see whether you run or not. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Talking about the word "migration", it simply means the movement from one place to another place, it takes many different forms, from conquest, to cultural infiltration, to settlement, ...and refugee movement. A tick on an immigration form does not define the word in details. Modern understanding of the word migration means you move with the intention to settle. This differentiate the move from going on long holidays, overseas employment, ....  you are not seasonal birds which would settle for good. Thousands of HKgers went to Canada, USA, Australia, and even HK to get a PR, a green card, in case things go bad in HK after 97, they have a back up, just likeyour parents. Most of them would not say they have migrated. Have your parents migrated? Those who actually migrated sold everything in HK, brought their family and settle in a foreign land.<br><br>It makes no sense to argue with you on definition. I don't put words into your mouth, you wrote a lot in this forum, apparently you forgot what you wrote.<br><br>I agree, the government is wrong not to take care of old folks, but thank God, my parents, who also participated in the building of Singapore, do not have to depend on the government for old age. I, together with my brother and sister will not allow any winter in my parents old age, though they have experienced winters in China, Korea, and Japan during holidays trip there. They don't like it there, and I will never allow them to have to travel with me to settle in a cold country, just to be with their grand children. Don't want to migrate for me is more than just patriotism. Yes, we still need to care for those old folks who are less fortunate, join opposition parties, participate in help organisations.....migrating to any other country can only talk, it does not help.<br><br>I said it in another post, I am not in biomed industry and I know nothing about that, so I cannot and won't expend on it. But from airport hub, ports....to high tech industries, since when were there no competitions, from any countries in the world, not just Australia. So? chicken out?<br><br>I have been retrenched before, during the difficult period of time, my wife supported me till I got another job again. Being positive enable us to live our life happily together, but of course, being prepared with savings, with extra skills, and even my friends in Singapore who help make it easy to have positive attitude. In anyway, will it help by being negative, does it make any diff if I sing a different tune? Be positive, there is no win or lose in this arguement, if you know how to be positive, it will benefit you a lot in the future, that is what I've learned.<br><br>Yes, I have bought a car for a song, because the owner was migrating, needws to dispose of it quickly. I am looking for more. Oh ya if the bubble burst, hmm....that is a very negative statement, I will be first to scavenge off those singaporeans who have to sell their properties cheap. Whats wrong with that? you will be lucky if you get some money back, if religious terrorists, or communists from PRC occupies Singapore, you would have nothing left.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"> another negative statement. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
