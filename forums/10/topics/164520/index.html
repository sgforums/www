            <div class='col-md body'>'Us vs them' view of students disturbing GEP a boon for talented pupils<br><br>Tuesday Â• November 22, 2005<br><br>Letter from Kelly Koh Ben-Lin<br>Letter from Chaitali Tarafdar<br><br>In her zealous defence of Gifted Education Programme (GEP) students, Michelle Qiu ("A second look at the gift", Nov 21) displays a sense of, at best, brash arrogance and, at worst, condescension and a superiority complex.<br><br>While I do not want to believe she represents the typical GEP student, it would be worrying if many "GEPers" (as they call themselves) had such an "us-them" mentality.<br><br>Aside from proclaiming "mainstreamers" (what a patronising term!) to be immature, she is thrilled the programme allowed her to interact exclusively with "people like us".<br><br>For a "gifted" student, she is quick to make sweeping generalisations that "everyone" in the mainstream follows trends, almost insinuating that "ungifted" people have no minds of their own.<br><br>It is fine if Michelle and her group of like-minded friends continue to live in their ivory towers, associating only with members of this chosen fraternity, keeping out of the lives of the "mainstream". Unfortunately, many may end up with scholarships and eventually hold public office, where their policies will affect the "mainstream" and the "masses".<br><br>I shudder to think what kind of empathy there can be when, from the onset, these young people display such an elitist "us" versus "them" mentality.<br><br>This is probably an alarmist scenario, but picture this: A group of key decision makers decide that the general population is rather immature and cannot possibly have minds of their own.<br><br>As such, everyone with an IQ below 150 should be systematically eradicated. Such a mentality would please Adolf Hitler.<br><br>My daughter will join the GEP in January. The GEP branch sent us materials highlighting the curriculum. The briefing was also elaborate, giving a clear idea that students would have to work hard.<br><br>I asked my daughter if she was still willing to go for it Â— she enthusiastically and repeatedly nodded.<br><br>Five other parents I know whose children are joining the course likewise did not pressure their children. Another parent of a child who is in his third year of GEP says he enjoys it.<br><br>Strangely, though the programme is criticised as a heavy burden for small shoulders, there are many siblings in the programme. If parents felt it was a nightmare, it is unlikely they would allow another child to enroll.<br><br>As Singaporeans, it is easy to overlook the plight of talented young people in other countries who, lacking the chance to nurture their talents, are forced to leave their homelands. Here, talented children are identified and nurtured.<br><br>So let us try to see the merits of the programme, rather than only the demerits.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A country that is well run will be one that nurtures the right conditions for business to thrive even for the small-timer. Such a country that is pro-business will produce a lot of entrepreneurs who in turn produce a lot of jobs.<br><br>We do need some professors, academicians and elites from the universities but let us not kid ourselves this group of education products will not lead to job creation.<br><br>At the most this group of academicians may help to supply manpower need for our public administration and the teaching professions and research.<br><br>Our leaders in the initial years have underestimated the importance providing the population with broad-based practical education as posted to the Feedback Unit three years ago as this type of education will equip students with readiness to apply knowledge and become entrepreneurs one day.<br><br>So our leaders under the banner of meritocracy keep sending people to the universities or elitist schools only to produce many academicians and elites who are mostly waiting for high paying jobs instead of producing jobs.<br><br>Today, our leaders have succeeded in producing many academicians or educated unemployed. This is the price we are now paying for past oversell of education for education sake.<br><br>Singapore could have become a much more competitive country if we had equipped the population from the start with practical knowledge application instead of all the paper chase.<br><br>So today we are running short of entrepreneurs but we do have a lot of good degree who we are running out of ideas how to be better entrepreneurs and create jobs.</div>
