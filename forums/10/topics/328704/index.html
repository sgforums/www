            <div class='col-md body'><p><span>SINGAPORE : Parliament saw a lively debate on Wednesday as Members of Parliament (MPs) spoke on the issue of by-election laws in Singapore. <br><br>Eight MPs spoke on the motion to fine-tune the electoral system - tabled after the death of MP Dr Ong Chit Chung in July. He had been part of the five-member Jurong Group Representation Constituency (GRC). <br><br>Filing the motion were Nominated MPs Thio Li-ann and Dr Loo Choon Yong. <br><br>Among the changes mooted under the Parliamentary Elections Act is that a by-election should be called for if a seat is vacated by a GRC member from a minority community, half or more elected GRC members, or a member of a single member constituency. <br><br>Both MPs also argued that by-elections should be called within three months from the date of vacancy, unless the Parliamentary term is due to expire within six months from the date of vacancy. <br><br>Under the current law, the timing of any by-election is up to the prime minister. <br><br>MPs who argued for the motion noted that the changes will strengthen the practice of elective democracy in Singapore. They also pointed to residents being short-changed if they do not have a dedicated representative in Parliament. <br><br>Professor Thio said: "Given the onerous burden of MPs and the importance of their constitutional role, do we really want them to take on more work and add to their many serious responsibilities? Five MPs may be able to carry out the work of six, but there will be a strain rather than peak performance. <br><br>"I do not doubt their dedication, but we are all mortal and finite beings, and fatigue will set in at some stage. I am sure we all agree that Singapore citizens deserve the best of their representatives, with a full house and all hands on deck." <br><br>But this sentiment was swiftly shot down by MP for Jurong GRC Madam Halimah Yacob who said that since Dr Ong's passing, the remaining four MPs have attended more than 15 activities at Bukit Batok and handled five Meet-the-People Sessions. <br><br>She noted that the true test of parliamentary elections is the ability of elected members to serve the people. <br><br>She said: "To me, the response of the grassroots leaders and the residents whom I had met is a great assurance. They gave us a strong mandate at the last GE (general election) and they knew that we would honour and respect that mandate even after the demise of one MP. <br><br>"They are confident that their interest and welfare will be taken care of. None have raised the issue of a by-election." <br><br>This was refuted by Nominated MP Siew Kum Hong, who said a street poll of about 300 Jurong residents showed that 56.8 per cent wanted a by-election. <br><br>Mr Siew said: "Sir, we are here today debating the nature of democracy in Singapore. Democracy is about the people, about how they have the power, and the people have spoken. They have spoken, their voice rings loud and clear, and they want a by-election." <br><br>Hri Kumar Nair, MP for Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC, also disagreed with the need for a by-election should a seat held by a minority MP be vacated. <br><br>He said: "In other words, who calls (for) the by-election? Is it the PM or the MP? With this motion, the power to call a by-election is placed in the hands of one MP, whether in the GRC or SMC (single member constituency). ... our laws (do not) extend such privileges to any single member, whether minority or otherwise." <br><br>One MP said that by doing so, it is like handing the veto power to a minority candidate which is not the intention of Parliament. - CNA/ms <br></span></p></div>

              <p>I see flaws in his arugment. First, did he know the reasons why the GRC was being mooted? It was mooted to "protect" the minority representatives in the parliament. Otherwise it defeats the purpose of having a certain group of minority in the GRC. Therefore when a minority MP vacates, by-election is necessary</p>
              <p>The elected PM represents the head of the elected government. He is being enpowered to execute the constitutions and the policies laid down. Therefore the power to call for a by-election is neither the PM nor the MP but the people and the constitution</p>

              <p>Mdm Halimah had forgotten who "voted" them in. It was not the grassroots leaders but the voters of Jurong GRC. What I can interpret from her statement is "there are more MPs than required". Perhap the PM can look into cutting cost by removing the unnecessary.</p>
              <p>Mdm Halimah had also forgotten that they were "voted" in by means of walkover. Therefore the word mandate does not apply. Furthermore the NMP survey had shown that the voters of Jurong GRC wants a by-election</p>

              <p>One point of contention is, the composition of the MPs in the GRC with the death of Dr. Ong has changed the entire structure. It's like voting in Team A, but it's now Team B that is running the show. I have no doubt that P4P will win back the GRC, but it's whether the current P4P leadership has the fortitude to put the GRC back into contest.</p>

              <p>I guess this is probably where technology can be the "force multiplier" for the work load required by the MPs, i.e. to use the web to reduce the amount of time required for MPS or whatever. Maybe even to have some pervasive technology that allows MPs to "meet-the-people" while on-the-move.</p>
              <p>Regarding the by-election, what if the new member in the GRC is from opposition? Hmm....</p>

              <p>Some may dislike MM Lee and the GRCs, but this canny man is a patriot true and true. He left a legacy to protect and ensure that we the citizens will be protected, no matter which political party wins. His legacy is GRC. Today, the ruling party is trusted. but who knows the future?</p>
              <p>In  a parliament of only a few men, eg, as some opposition had proposed, - it will only be these few that decide on issues pertaining our country. It is easy for these men to fall into the trap of being 'yes' men.</p>
              <p>But if they were more members, it would be a difficult task to enjoy absolute power without persuading everyone to agree. More responsible heads are better than one to oversee our growing economic portfolios.</p>
              <p>I have no issue on the present motion, for i do not belong to the constituency of Bt Batok or Jurong. I feel it is a issue that only these constituents can decide if they had been served.</p>
              <p>But I am NOT comfortable with MP Halim's report that her grassroots leaders are saying that their constituents, the people they meet, are not keen to hold a by-election.</p>
              <p>However, a poll conducted by NMP Siew sheds a different light.</p>
              <p>Are her grassroot leaders doing their jobs, or misrepresenting the grassroots??! This is a critical issue she must address to stay relevant, being the elected representative of her people, or she may be misleading our PM with wrong information into making wrong decisions, and affecting his party's vote in future. </p>
              <p>As he had said it, it is not only the person we voting for, it's the party's mandate. If the party's mandate is not relevant to the people, the chances are, people will vote against the mandate, no matter how good the MP will be. </p>
              <p>Guess MP Halim will have to account for her trust in her grassroot leaders.</p>

              more assistants to aid him in his work. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>One point of contention is, the composition of the MPs in the
              GRC with the death of Dr. Ong has changed the entire structure.
              It's like voting in Team A, but it's now Team B that is running the
              show. I have no doubt that P4P will win back the GRC, but it's
              whether the current P4P leadership has the fortitude to put
              the GRC back into contest.</p>

              <p>Noticed that most of the NMP supported a by-election...and those "elected" ones oppose.</p>
              <p>PM said they dun wan a "forced" by elections when mp decide to switch sides or resign...like what's happening/happened in other countries which destablized govt. However, this can be good or bad depends on the circumstances.</p>
              <p>At the time being, I think they can compromise in this way, for GRCs by-election should be called if mp is unable perform his duty with natural courses, like death, sickness, etc. But if mp resigns or switch sides, then no.</p>

For the support given to them by the ruling party, compared to the opposition like Sylvia, Low, and Chiam,<span>  </span>the young MPs are born with golden spoon.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">They joined the ruling party because they agree with the PAP way, and if they disagree, their only choice is to join opposition if they want to stay in politic.

              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Citizens of Singapore of also not without brains, they are just not good at scoring in examinations.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Those who buy gem are never shown costume jewelry, to them all costume jewelry are the same, cheap. But more people wear costume jewelry than real gem, agree? So do the international business man understand the plight of small time hawkers? When you run Singapore like a corporation, do you know the problem of the small citizens? do you retrench the poor workers to maintain your ROI to your shareholders?<span> </span> With very little shares, the dividends given to the citizen as shareholders can provide a good meal for Chinese New Year, but the jobs keep them alive for the rest of the year.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Singaporean MP can’t be said to all that civic conscious to stand for election, they are paid the market price!</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The progress of Singapore since independent is not the efforts of a few people, and many of those who contributed to the progress are not in the parliament today. Many of those who are in the parliament are there to be groomed and trained for the future. For the support given to them by the ruling party, compared to the opposition like Sylvia, Low, and Chiam,<span> </span> the young MPs are born with golden spoon.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">They joined the ruling party because they agree with the PAP way, and if they disagree, their only choice is to join opposition if they want to stay in politic. What has it got to do with your efficiency?</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The opposition and NMPs may not be in the PAP discussions, but it doesn’t mean they don’t discuss.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">To the PAP it is the party first, Singapore second, Singaporean last.<span> </span> FT is good for Singapore, but to a certain extend, it is at the expense of Singaporean.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">To the opposition, it is Singaporean first, Singapore second, party last (except for Chee SJ, when he ousted his former party chairman).</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>

              <p>I respect your right to express yourself and your views, regardless if it is right or wrong, for only others will intelligently and rationally perceive.</p>
              <p>I would just take issue on your beliefs that MPs are 'born with a silver spoon',  'beholden to the party' and the 'party comes first'.</p>
              <p>Even our ex PM Goh lived in a govt flat. Most of our MPs came from humble beginnings, for the simple fact that back in the 50s and 60s, Malaysians and Sporeans lived in attap huts or shophouses.</p>
              <p>Most of our MPs are above 45, putting them right back as child of the 60s. Thus your conclusion that our MPs were 'born with silver spoons' is not credible. They know what is poverty first hand, much worse than we this generation ever got to know.</p>
              <p>'beholden to the party' and 'party comes first' are unfortunately unsustantiable. Do you have any proof that they, being citizens as well with relatives here, will stupidly support laws that would affect our long term prospects?</p>
              <p>Singapore needs professional politicians. Not angst filled student activists that some of the opposition political figures had shown themselves to be. Professionals who can come out with solutions, win votes, win over the ruling party MPs. Not become part of our problem. The longer they remain deluded, the longer will we citizens will suffer from third world class opposition political figures ( MP Chiam, MP Low, NCMP Sylvia excluded)</p>

              <p>what I said was this "<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">For the support given to them by the ruling party, compared to the opposition like Sylvia, Low, and Chiam,<span> </span> the young MPs are born with golden spoon."</span></p>
              <p>The young MPs today certainly did not have to deal with party politics, having to recruit new members like Sylvia, Low and Chiam, who are heading their parties. They don't have to be worried about the information given to them about Singapore for the ruling parties have access to many information that the opposition do not have, and I don't think they don't have to worry about the fund for the party. Compared to the opposition, they are fed with silver spoon.</p>
              <p>Being born in a poor family and having to raise a family of your own is totally different. I don't need to argue with you on this. I know that having the comfort of a room and three meals provided by my parents even if I have no job, is already very different from what my parents had to go through. If you say that the 30s to 40s generation feel they have the same experience as their parents, then they really don't know what is hardship and what is being poor.</p>
              <p>We all have relatives here, what make you think that we don't support any law that affect our "long term prospects"? The question is whether a one party dominant government will continue to be good for Singapore in the long term, or check and balance are necessarily provided by some more oppositions in the parliament?</p>
              <p>the NKF saga and the Mas Selamat great escape has proven to us there is still a possible need for something to keep the government on their toe. While the ministers are paid million, they dont take responsibility like those paid million in the private sectors, they stay on. It is hard to believe how the ruling party is keeping their people on the alert.</p>

              <p>I read yesterday's newpaper and that got me wondering about the political system here in Singapore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The parliament voted overwhelmingly to reject the motion to amend the by-election constitution.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Newpaper reported that the majority of the residents in Jurong GRC wanted a by-election.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Does this mean that our MPs are NOT REPRESENTING their constituents in parliament? Perhaps they think they know better.</p>
