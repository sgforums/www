              <h1 class="articleTitle" style="margin: 0px;">Democracy in Singapore<br><span class="aTime">June 26, 2008; Page A14</span></h1>
              <p class="times">Lee Kuan Yew's Singapore can rightly be proud of many
              achievements, but full democracy is not one of them. The city-state he
              founded in 1965 and led as Prime Minister until 1990 is economically
              prosperous and its citizens enjoy a range of freedoms.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Political
              dissent is not among them.</span></p>
              <p><img class="imglftbdy" src="http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/HC-GH018_Kuan_Y_20051108133649.gif" border="0" alt="[Lee Kuan Yew]" width="136" height="231" align="left"></p>
              <p class="times">Which makes a recent David vs. Goliath exchange
              between one of the country's few opposition politicians and Mr. Lee
              worth noting. The dialogue took place in a courtroom and is therefore
              privileged – which means <span style="text-decoration: underline;">we can report on it without risking a lawsuit,
              which Mr. Lee often files against critics. </span>Audio files are available on
              the <a class="times" href="http://www.yoursdp.org/">Singapore Democratic Party's Web site</a>, and a partial transcript is available at <a class="times" href="http://www.singaporerebel.blogspot.com/">Singapore Rebel</a>, an independent blog.</p>
              <p class="times">The setting was a hearing to assess damages against
              Chee Soon Juan, head of the Singapore Democratic Party, and his sister
              and colleague, Chee Siok Chin. In 2006, the Chees lost a defamation
              suit brought by Mr. Lee and his son, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong,
              over an article they published in their party newsletter that was
              interpreted by the court to imply corruption on the part of the
              government. In last month's hearing, the elder Mr. Lee, who holds the
              title of Minister Mentor, was cross-examined by Mr. Chee, who was
              representing himself.</p>
              <p class="times">Mr. Chee is no orator, and on one level the dissident
              was no match for the eloquent Mr. Lee. But when the subject turned to
              the moral underpinnings of democracy – freedoms of speech, assembly and
              association – <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the debate went game, set and match to Mr. Chee.</span></p>
              <p class="times">Mr. Chee set out his philosophy while questioning Mr.
              Lee: "What I'm interested in is justice, the rule of law, because
              ultimately it is not about you, Mr. Lee. It is not about me. It's about
              the people of Singapore, it is about this country and everything we
              stand for. You and I will pass on, but I can tell you, the practice of
              the rule of law, the entire concept of justice, democracy – that is
              going to last for all eternity."</p>
              <p class="times">Mr. Lee didn't respond directly to those assertions,
              choosing instead to cite the International Bar Association's decision
              to "honor" Singapore by holding its annual conference there last year
              and noted a letter from the association's president saying "how
              impressed they were by the standards they found to obtain in the
              judiciary."</p>
              <p class="times">Elsewhere in the hearing, Mr. Lee defended his string
              of defamation suits against opposition politicians and the press: "They
              know me by now," Mr. Lee said, referring to the people of Singapore,
              "that if anybody impugns the integrity of the government, of which I
              was the prime minister, I must sue."</p>
              <p class="times">He went on: "There are various parts of this
              government which do not comply with Western practices, including the
              law of libel. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">But it is a system that has worked.</span>" <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Mr. Lee has never
              lost a libel suit.</span> He and his son are <span style="text-decoration: underline;">currently suing the <a class="times" href="http://www.feer.com/">Far Eastern Economic Review</a>, a sister publication of this newspaper, and its editor, Hugo Restall.</span></p>
              <p class="times">Our reading is that the Minister Mentor sounded more
              than a tad defensive – no less so than in his characterization of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Mr.
              Chee, who has been bankrupted as a result of lawsuits by Mr. Lee</span> and
              other politicians. He called Mr. Chee, a "liar, a cheat and altogether
              an unscrupulous man." Not to mention "a near-psychopath." Mr. Chee, for
              his part, referred to Mr. Lee as a "pitiable figure."</p>
              <p class="times">It's hard to know what Singaporeans make of all this.
              Mr. Lee is widely revered as the father of their country, and Mr. Chee
              is often scorned for his aggressive tactics. But at least, thanks to
              the Internet, they are able to read the exchange and make up their own
              minds.</p>
              <p class="times">So, too, in the case of Gopalan Nair, which is making
              its way through the courts now. Mr. Nair is a former Workers' Party
              candidate. He is now a U.S. citizen and online advocate for media
              freedom in Singapore. He traveled to the city-state to attend Mr.
              Chee's hearing last month and recorded his thoughts on his blog, where
              he expressed his contempt for the court proceedings and challenged Mr.
              Lee to sue him.</p>
              <p class="times">On May 31, he was arrested and interrogated. On June
              2, he was charged with insulting Judge Belinda Ang, who presided over
              the Chee hearing, by email. He was released on June 5, six days after
              his initial arrest, and charged on June 12 with insulting another judge
              in a separate, 2006 email. Last week, the court changed the first
              charge and specified that the offending remarks about Judge Ang were
              made on a blog, not by email.</p>
              <p class="times">Mr. Nair's case is scheduled to go to court in
              mid-July. Meanwhile, Mr. Chee was just released from jail, where he
              served 11 days for "scandalizing" the court during his questioning of
              Mr. Lee. His sister served 10 days. The court has yet to set the amount
              of monetary damages in the defamation case. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">When it does, we'll know
              the price of political dissent these days in Lee Kuan Yew's Singapore.</span></p>

              <p>If old man Lee really wanted to show how independent our judicial system is, he should let another democratic country's judicial system decide. If someone makes accusation against you, how credible is it if you refute the claim yourself? Putting the case through a judicial process which is ultimately determined by you bears no credence to faith of independence in the judicial system.</p>

              <p class="Sollicitors">Patricia D.S. Jackson and Peter R. Balasubramaniam, for defendants/responding parties The Globe and Mail, Thomson Canada Limited, William Thorsell, Margaret Wente and Marcus Gee.</p>
              <p class="Sollicitors">Sean Dewart, for defendant Nair.</p>
              <p class="Para">[1] SWINTON J.:—The plaintiff, Lee Kuan Yew, has brought a motion to strike paras. 6(p), 6(q) and 7 of the Statement of Defence of <em>The Globe and Mail, </em>Thomson Canada Limited, William Thorsell, Margaret Wente and Marcus Gee (the “Thomson defendants”) in this libel action.</p>
              <p class="Para">[2] The action was brought as a result of an article which appeared in <em>The Globe and Mail </em>on March 29, 1999, reporting an interview with the defendant Devan Nair, who was the President of the Republic of Singapore from October 1981 to March 1985. The plaintiff Lee Kuan Yew was the Prime Minister of the Republic of Singapore from August 1965 to November 1990, and he is now the Senior Minister for the Republic of Singapore. According to the article, Mr. Nair, now a resident of Canada, decided to break his silence and to speak out on the continuing suppression of legitimate dissent in Singapore, drawing on his personal experience.</p>
              <p class="Para">[3] In the course of the interview, Mr. Nair made certain statements which are alleged to be defamatory. Paragraphs 8 and 9 of the Statement of Claim are important to the determination of this motion:</p>
              <p class="Citation1">8. On or about the 29th day of March, 1999 the Defendants falsely and maliciously published the following words on page A12 of The Globe in an article entitled Singapore Sage, which are defamatory of the Plaintiff personally and in the way of his profession as a politician:</p>
              <p class="Citation2" style="text-align: center;"><em>Singapore</em><em> Sage</em></p>
              <p class="Citation2">(1) Then, in 1985 came a shocking break. Mr. Lee told Singapore’s parliament that Mr. Nair had resigned because he was an alcoholic, a charge Mr. Nair now calls a baseless slur.</p>
              <p class="Citation2">(2) But before he could speak out, Mr. Nair found himself at the centre of a rumourâ€‘mongering campaign that labelled him a drinker and a womanizer. He says he was neither, and he suspects that Mr. Lee had government doctors slip him hallucinatory drugs to make him appear befuddled. “Lee Kuan Yew decided: This man is going to be a threat, so I’d better begin a total demolishment of his character. He’s very good at that.”</p>
              <p class="Citation1">9. The Plaintiff pleads that the words in their natural and ordinary meaning meant and were understood to mean the following:</p>
              <p class="Citation2">(1) The plaintiff, as the Prime Minister of Singapore, invented false allegations that Mr. Nair was an alcoholic for the purpose of destroying Mr. Nair’s good character;</p>
              <p class="Citation2"> (2) The Plaintiff, as the Prime Minister of Singapore, invented false allegations concerning alcohol for the purpose of destroying Mr. Nair’s good character;</p>
              <p class="Citation2">(3) The Plaintiff, as the Prime Minister of Singapore, invented false allegations that Mr. Nair was a womanizer for the purpose of destroying Mr. Nair’s good character;</p>
              <p class="Citation2">(4) The Plaintiff, as the Prime Minister of Singapore, maliciously directed government doctors to slip Mr. Nair hallucinatory drugs in order to make him appear to be befuddled as part of a scheme to destroy his good character.</p>
              <p class="Para">[4] Mr. Nair has yet to file a Statement of Defence. However, in their Statement of Defence, the Thomson defendants have pleaded the defences of justification, fair comment and qualified privilege.</p>

              <p>All these damages awarded were meted out by Singapore judges in
              Singapore courts, which was already tainted with accusations of
              judicial bias.</p>
              <p>If our leaders want to show the world how impartial our courts
              are, they should take these issues to another impartial
              world court.</p>
              <p>Strange logic this be, if you accuse someone (Mr. A) that he is
              a liar, Mr. A brings a legal suit against you to which he is also
              the judge.</p>
              <p>How impartial can such a system be?</p>
              <p>The plantiff is both the judge, jury and executioner. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>If the case were to be put on trial here, I would suggest Wall

              Limited, William Thorsell, Margaret Wente and Marcus Gee (the
              “Thomson defendants”) in this libel action.</p>
              <p>[2] The action was brought as a result of an article
              which appeared in <em>The Globe and Mail</em> on March 29, 1999,
              reporting an interview with the defendant Devan Nair, who was the
              President of the Republic of Singapore from October 1981 to March
              1985. The plaintiff Lee Kuan Yew was the Prime Minister of the
              Republic of Singapore from August 1965 to November 1990, and he is
              now the Senior Minister for the Republic of Singapore. According to
              the article, Mr. Nair, now a resident of Canada, decided to
              break his silence and to speak out on the continuing suppression of
              legitimate dissent in Singapore, drawing on his personal
              experience.</p>
              <p>[3] In the course of the interview, Mr. Nair made
              certain statements which are alleged to be defamatory. Paragraphs 8
              and 9 of the Statement of Claim are important to the determination
              of this motion:</p>
              <p>8. On or about the 29th day of March, 1999 the
              Defendants falsely and maliciously published the following words on
              page A12 of The Globe in an article entitled Singapore Sage, which
              are defamatory of the Plaintiff personally and in the way of his
              profession as a politician:</p>
              <p style="text-align: center;"><em>Singapore</em> <em>Sage</em></p>
              <p>(1) Then, in 1985 came a shocking break. Mr. Lee
              told Singapore’s parliament that Mr. Nair had resigned because
              he was an alcoholic, a charge Mr. Nair now calls a baseless
              slur.</p>
              <p>(2) But before he could speak out, Mr. Nair found
              himself at the centre of a rumourâ€‘mongering campaign that labelled
              him a drinker and a womanizer. He says he was neither, and he
              suspects that Mr. Lee had government doctors slip him

              <p>9. The Plaintiff pleads that the words in their natural
              and ordinary meaning meant and were understood to mean the
              following:</p>
              <p>(1) The plaintiff, as the Prime Minister of Singapore,

              part of a scheme to destroy his good character.</p>
              <p>[4] Mr. Nair has yet to file a Statement of
              Defence. However, in their Statement of Defence, the Thomson
