              <p>Singapore's
              attorney-general's office is taking legal action against the Wall
              Street Journal Asia and two editors over articles allegedly casting
              doubt on the judiciary's integrity, it said.</p>
              <p>A statement on the
              website of the Attorney-General's Chambers said the articles "impugn on
              the impartiality, integrity and independence of the Singapore
              judiciary."</p>
              <p>The High Court has granted permission for the contempt proceedings to be initiated, a court spokesperson told AFP.</p>
              <p>Facing
              contempt charges are the newspaper's publisher Dow Jones Publishing
              Company (Asia), Inc, international editor Daniel Hertzberg and managing
              editor Christine Glancey, according to the statement.</p>
              <p>The
              articles, which were published in June and July, involve two editorials
              and a letter by Singapore pro-democracy activist Chee Soon Juan.</p>
              <p>"The
              items allege that the Singapore judiciary is not independent. It is
              further insinuated that the Singapore judiciary is biased and lacks
              integrity," the statement said.</p>
              <p>"These allegations and insinuations in these items are unwarranted."</p>
              <p>Singaporean
              leaders have won hundreds of thousands of dollars in damages in
              defamation cases against critics and foreign publications, which they
              say are necessary to protect their reputation from unfounded attacks.</p>
              <p>In
              a recent case, founding father Lee Kuan Yew and his son, Prime Minister
              Lee Hsien Loong, sued the editor of the Hong Kong-based Far Eastern
              Economic Review (FEER) and its owners, alleging defamation in an
              article centred on an interview with Chee.</p>
              <p>The government has
              also banned distribution of the magazine, which is the Wall Street
              Journal Asia's sister publication, saying it had failed to comply with
              media regulations.</p>
              <p>Paris-based media watchdog Reporters Without
              Borders (RSF) has persistently ranked Singapore in the bottom of its
              annual index of press freedom.</p>
              <p>But the attorney-general said
              the case against the Wall Street Journal Asia was not about freedom of
              expression but about the rule of law.</p>
              <p>"An unwarranted attack
              against the integrity, impartiality and independence of the Singapore
              judiciary is an assault on the rule of law in Singapore," it said.</p>

              <p>All these damages awarded were meted out by Singapore judges in Singapore courts, which was already tainted with accusations of judicial bias.</p>
              <p>If our leaders want to show the world how impartial our courts are, they should take these issues to another impartial world court.</p>
              <p>Strange logic this be, if you accuse someone (Mr. A) that he is a liar, Mr. A brings a legal suit against you to which he is also the judge.</p>
              <p>How impartial can such a system be?</p>
              <p>The plantiff is both the judge, jury and executioner. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>If the case were to be put on trial here, I would suggest Wall Street Journal negotiate for an out of court settlement and a letter of apology. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>itz like someone who wen to jail and wrote a book, it became a huge success.</p>
              <p>The people they are going to sue, will turn this around and make themselves popular by going to CNN, Fox news and BBC shouting " protect freel Journalism ethics and rights" . They will then start to publish their own articles regarding the defamation case week by week, most people interested in some kick arse politic will buy them andd their sales will go up. and they will draw paralleles to their own country and such.</p>

              <p>This could be one of articles at work : <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB121443744095705301.html">Democracy in Singapore</a></p>

              <p>Excerpt: </p>
              <p class="times">Lee Kuan Yew's Singapore can rightly be proud of many
              achievements, but full democracy is not one of them. The city-state he
              founded in 1965 and led as Prime Minister until 1990 is economically
              prosperous and its citizens enjoy a range of freedoms. Political
              dissent is not among them.</p>
              <p><img class="imglftbdy" src="http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/HC-GH018_Kuan_Y_20051108133649.gif" border="0" alt="[Lee Kuan Yew]" width="136" height="231" align="left"> Which makes a recent David vs. Goliath exchange
              between one of the country's few opposition politicians and Mr. Lee
              worth noting. The dialogue took place in a courtroom and is therefore
              privileged – which means we can report on it without risking a lawsuit,
              which Mr. Lee often files against critics.</p>
