              <p>PROJECT engineer Alex Tan did not mince his words as he blamed the ruling People's Action Party for the apathy of Singapore's youth.</p>
              <p>He pointed his finger especially at the PAP's dominance and the lack of press freedom. The 22-year-old also said the PAP may feel it is helping the people but the people feel disadvantaged by its policies, from foreign talent to national service.</p>
              <p>His stark statements surprised, not for their content but for where they were made. Mr Tan was speaking last night at a dialogue organised by the Young PAP, and which was attended by 150 youths and two PAP MPs.</p>
              <p>They were first-term Mr Sam Tan, who is six months into his job as Parliamentary Secretary in two ministries - Trade and Industry, and Information, Communications and the Arts - and Mr Christopher de Souza, vice-chairman of the Youth Wing.</p>
              <p>Mr Alex Tan was the most hard-hitting from among a dozen young people who spoke during the two-hour dialogue titled, 2010: How Can Our Youths Serve Singapore?</p>
              <p>The issues raised by the others include ways to get more youths to be volunteers, how the political system discourages alternative voices and puts opposition parties at a disadvantage, and that schools discourage political discussion.</p>

              <p>PAP MP Christopher De Souza said during a two-hour dialogue – “2010: How Can Our Youths Serve Singapore” organized by the Young PAP that there is more robust debate from the PAP MPs than the opposition MPs in parliament.</p>
              <p>He was responding to a question by Project Engineer Alex Tan who blamed the PAP’s dominance for the apathy of Singapore’s youth.</p>
              <p>Mr de Souza extended an invitation to Mr Alex Tan to attend Parliament to see how PAP MPs speak their mind.</p>
              <p><em>“If you’d heard Denise Phua speak on, say special-needs kids, you will think she is an opposition MP,”</em> he said.</p>
              <p>Mr Tan also said the PAP may feel it is helping the people but the people feel disadvantaged by its policies, from foreign talent to national service.</p>
              <p>A fellow participant shot back at him:</p>
              <p><em>“‘If you’re so disenchanted, why not leave Singapore?”</em></p>
              <p>The dialogue is part of the YPAP’s series on social and political issues to better engage a younger, more outspoken generation, with the aim of renewing the party’s ranks and support.</p>
              <p>The event was attended by 150 youths and 2 PAP MPs, Mr Sam Tan and Mr Christopher De Souza.</p>
              <p>In reply to Mr Alexa Tan, Mr Sam Tan said the fault does not lie with the system, but that “it all boils down to individuals making their own choices.”</p>
              <p><em>“If people feel they want to exercise their will and choice and want to serve, there are many ways they can do so. (The issue) is not the system, it is us,”</em> he added.</p>
              <p>Mr Sam Tan also reminded young Singaporeans not to run down Singapore when abroad or with foreigners:</p>
              <p><em>“People will have less respect for us and our dignity will be dented,”</em> he said.</p>
              <p>He quoted the example of opposition MP Mr Chiam See Tong during a trip together to Kuala Lumpur who was asked by him “if he would speak in a different language from the PAP MPs”.</p>
              <p>Mr Chiam’s reply was:</p>
              <p><em>“When I’m outside Singapore, I speak as a Singaporean because Singapore is my country.”</em></p>
              <p>Mr Tan agreed with Mr Chiam:</p>
              <p><em>“‘Singapore is also my country. Let us speak in one united voice.”</em></p>
              <p>Mr Chiam is one of the only two elected opposition MPs in parliament. The other is Hougang MP Low Thia Kiang.</p>
              <p>While both men are considered veteran MPs, they seldom dare to challenge the ruling party or take them to task in parliament.</p>
              <p>Some PAP backbenchers like Indergit Singh and former NMPs like Siew Kum Hong and Eunice Olsen are even more vocal than them raising important, sensitive and difficult questions in parliament which embarrassed the ruling party.</p>
              <p>When asked point-blank by PM Lee during a parliamentary last year if he felt DPM Wong Kan Seng should resign over the escape of Mas Selamat Kasteri, Mr Low Thia Kiang was stunned into silence.</p>
              <p>Like many others, Mr Sam Tan appears to be confused over the separate roles of the party and state.</p>
              <p>Singapore is not the equivalent of the PAP and criticisms towards the party should not be misconstrued as an attack on Singapore.</p>
              <p>While Singaporeans should stay united as one nation, there should be ample room for differing political opinions to be expressed in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Due to the dominance of the PAP and its control of the mass media, only its voice is heard and permitted in the public domain which is unhealthy for the nation in the long run</p>
