              <p>Hi all bros &amp; sis,</p>
              <p>Today just went down to subordinate court hoping to settle noise pollution caused by my neighbour for playing mahjong at wee hours.</p>
              <p>Already made countless of police report asking them to stop playing mahjong but they're not scare of police still cont' playing after police officer left. Therefore went to complain to HDB, MP (PAP) and CMC but no avail. My neighbour still continue the act! After went to meet the magistrate, he said this kind of neighbour dispute, court cannot charge them. Now i'm thinking this is loophole that this kind of people will make use. These people knows that they cannot be chase out by the HDB nor arrested by the police and can continue their mahjong even they did not play for pleasure but purposely try to disturb us.</p>
              <p>I seeking all bros here is there anything i can do? Or any bros here like me have face this situation before?</p>
              <p>I will really like to question the MPs or Ministers, does that means that we who have been a good neighbour &amp; citizen have to suffer/tolerant this kind of disturbance?</p>

              <p>About noise from neighbours, i reported to police and police told me I can go bring them to court by registering at the magistrate court.  </p>
              <p>Magistrate court said cannot charge?   What reason did they give on this statement?   Why was there court case and charges on the Everitt Road case?</p>

              <p>The reason for it to be called a loophole - is that it goes round and around in a loop, and then there is the hole that allows the problem to disappear into.</p>
              <p>What did you expect the magistrate at the subordinate court to do for you ?</p>
              <p>Act like a policeman ?</p>
              <p>The correct thing for you to do is to gather all your evidence from witness statements, your medical and psychological conditions during the affect periods, and get a very aggressive lawyer to pursue a private action against the offensive tenant.</p>
              <p>At the end of the day, it is the money needed to get justice for yourself in Singapore.</p>
