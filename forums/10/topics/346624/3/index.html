              <p>I don't think it is a strange pattern of civil unrest, but rather the changing pattern of response from society.</p>
              <p>We note there is a general increase in complaints, and expressions of dissatisfaction. This incident is just another form of that expression. It is what that is within the capacity of the perpetrator. The younger set would have been more vocal than violent. Still there is a general increase in expressing dissatisfaction.</p>
              <p>This is good. As such expression brings about changes, mostly for the better, although not necessarily so. Sometimes more stern measures are implemented.</p>
              <p>Whatever, it depends on how the dissatisfaction is expressed. The wisdom of the ages still hold true. Speak your truth quietly and clearly.</p>

              1. Hatred begets hatred
              2. Desperate equate extreme action

              <p>The mad arsonist Mr Ong and others like him had passed up a perfectly good opportunity to show evidence of presumed 'high handedness' of his MP.</p>
              <p>If only he had voice out amongst his grassroot leaders and as well others in his constituency, and have iron -clad evidences, than i am sure the ruling party will have to answer and take responsibility for their selected parliament representative offered to the voters to vote for.</p>
              <p>But as it happens, violence instead was used. No human being will ever condone violence, no matter how righteous it may be, least of all a rash decision alone by one man.</p>
              <p>Once harm has occured, who cares or thinks about other issues, except a horrid and repulsive violent act had been committed?</p>
              <p>Therefore, think twice, before resorting to violence. It never solves anything.</p>
