              <p>I had hope to avoid threads such as these, for i have no wish to dwell in politics.</p>
              <p>But I have to accept that actions conducted by the rag and bone man Mr.Ng, whom is our fellow elderly citizen must not be condone. What he had done is not just intimidated another citizen, he had even threatened physical harm to her, made worse by evidence of mental instability.</p>
              <p>Are we to wait till someone gets hurt then act, or should we act before it happens?</p>
              <p>In anycase, his record of mental instability will mitigate his offence. At most he will be sent for further and deeper rehabilitation so that he can rejoin society. He is not some hot headed but fully capable of mental stability young punk.</p>
              <p>Whether the person injured or to be injured is an MP, the PM, President, or anyone of us, no one deserved to be physically harmed. There is absolutely NO reason to resort to violence. We are not animals or live like animals. It is not about politics.</p>
              <p>Politics is about rational debate and building of societies. The brains are used. Physical intimidation is not politics. It is terrorism - the destruction of a human or humans to forcibly swing opinions to his way of thinking.</p>
              <p>Some may hate opposition politicians such as Dr CSJ or ruling party politicians such as the great MM Lee, but had these people ever threw even a whisper of physical punch at anyone in the political arena? The day we fight it out physically like the Taiwanese in politics is the day that we renounced our own humanity and inviting terrrorism and dictatorships. </p>
              <p>Just my 2 cts worth. Peace. May the parents, wife and children of our fellow citizen and MP, Mr. Seng - who is only serving a greater public role as our elected official, forgive the <strong>assailant</strong>. The <strong>assailant</strong> is one of us too, only with destablised mentality which all of us must be careful and concern with support for their rehabilitation and not condemnation. Espacially when he is only acting alone and not in a position to influence anyone else or sought to form a group of similar people like him to harm others. </p>

              <p>1. What make the old man want to say those words? That old man could be so desperate that he cant support his family that will result him in saying these in the fit of fustration. (assuming his comcare application is rejected or someone must have provoke him with some scarstics remarks when he see the MP?)</p>
              <p>2. This $50k bail can be interpreted that the rich are bullying the poor. It the poor old man have $50k, he will not have ask MP for comcare funds &amp; all these will not have happen.</p>
              <p>3. Report state that he used to be from IMH. Ex-patient means he is discharged from there. If he is not mentally sound then why is he discharged in the first place?</p>
              <p>4. Why have all these happen? Did someone instigate him or "psycho" him knwing he used to be from IMH.</p>
              <p>5. MPs are the bridge between people &amp; goverment. They might not have 100% correct info on the cases they attend. Did those volunteers give the correct info to MP before MP made decision?</p>

              <p><br>Yes, making Mr. Rag-and-bone man a Martyr is educating the masses. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
              <p>Is the government hoping to win over the masses by delivering terror or should the government be wise enough to see this as an opportunity to exercise and extend GRACE &amp; UNDERSTANDING to the masses?</p>
              <p>Maybe the Air-Condition in the Parliament is set to freeze or too cold?</p>
              <p>Delivering terror to the masses would be an unwise decision as the masses could easily United as One United People and select the Opposition Party as the next ruling government in the next election.</p>
              <p>But that would means Singapore would be fallen into a pair of even more Wrong Hands.</p>
              <p>This would be a good opportunity to test the current government on their wisdom and tolerance for Singapore in the future.</p>

              <p><br>Both rich and poor feel the pain. The rich wanna get richer and the poor just wanna survive. It's not that there's no money, just that the rich and successful ones amongst us had hoarded up money. Some of them do give to charities, and assume they had done their part.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But giving to charity although noble, can only feed the needy for a day, and not for life. Creating jobs will and it is where the money should go to.</p>
              <p><br>The poor have no money. No money will lead to desperation and the ones whose mind are weak are easy target for nervous breakdown. As long as this situation continues, weak minded ones will lose their rationality and do rash acts.</p>
              <p><br>This is where our Health Ministry must step in. While waiting for govt efforts to take effect, a national pyschatric programme is necessary. The purpose is not so much as to brainwash, but to assure the general public on genuine measures to remain calm.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Pyschologists may perhaps work together with the advertising brightest thru the media to form a committee to look into the matter. These are unprecedented times.</p>
              <p><br>Medicines will help. That violence was resorted and happened performed by IMH ex-patients only proves the medical rehabilition medicines and programmes had not worked and are not effective.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Would genetic manipulation help? Is mental destability caused by a lack or too much of a protein in the genes? This would be a task for our Health Minister to look into.</p>
              <p><br>Prevention is better than cure. But we do not have that many jails to house depressed fellow citizens, nor does it speak well of a society that put such people behind bars.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A more effective rehabilitation programme would help better. Afterall, it's all only in the mind.</p>

              <p>I had hope to avoid threads such as these, for i have no wish to dwell in politics.</p>
              <p>But I have to accept that actions conducted by the rag and bone man Mr.Ng, whom is our fellow elderly citizen must not be condone. What he had done is not just intimidated another citizen, he had even threatened physical harm to her, made worse by evidence of mental instability.</p>
              <p>Are we to wait till someone gets hurt then act, or should we act before it happens?</p>
              <p>In anycase, his record of mental instability will mitigate his offence. At most he will be sent for further and deeper rehabilitation so that he can rejoin society. He is not some hot headed but fully capable of mental stability young punk.</p>
              <p>Whether the person injured or to be injured is an MP, the PM, President, or anyone of us, no one deserved to be physically harmed. There is absolutely NO reason to resort to violence. We are not animals or live like animals. It is not about politics.</p>
              <p>Politics is about rational debate and building of societies. The brains are used. Physical intimidation is not politics. It is terrorism - the destruction of a human or humans to forcibly swing opinions to his way of thinking.</p>
              <p>Some may hate opposition politicians such as Dr CSJ or ruling party politicians such as the great MM Lee, but had these people ever threw even a whisper of physical punch at anyone in the political arena? The day we fight it out physically like the Taiwanese in politics is the day that we renounced our own humanity and inviting terrrorism and dictatorships. </p>
              <p>Just my 2 cts worth. Peace. May the parents, wife and children of our fellow citizen and MP, Mr. Seng - who is only serving a greater public role as our elected official, forgive the <strong>assailant</strong>. The <strong>assailant</strong> is one of us too, only with destablised mentality which all of us must be careful and concern with support for their rehabilitation and not condemnation. Espacially when he is only acting alone and not in a position to influence anyone else or sought to form a group of similar people like him to harm others. </p>

              <p>Sorry Maam, I aint no seer, least of all a political one. All i know is that many are affected by the financial crisis. A sense of doom pervades. Thus it is critical to have friends and to keep in contact, so that you know you are not alone or the only one facing this storm.</p>
              <p>Many others too are facing it, and while some had cower in fear, there are many others who are braving it. Stick to the latter ones, and we will tide it over.</p>
              <p>Stick with the former ones, and civil unrest will surely come.</p>

              <p><br>I understand your point, your concern as well as your sympathy for the seemingly 'poverty oppressed'. But there is no necessity for violence. Why confrontation when there are opportunities for deliberation?<br>Take the arsonist Mr.Ong, our fellow citizen for example.</p>
              <p><br>Perhaps in his irrational view, the MP had done nothing for him. Was it true? I seriously doubt it as no one goes hungry in Spore. CDS, charitable organisations, religious sanctumns and even common laymen samaritans helps.</p>
              <p><br>But there is only so much one can help. Thus, Mr. Ong too, must help himself. Perhaps he is too old for jobs, but i had seen even limping old men gathering tin cans. That is not something a society can be proud of, but there are limitations a society can do without taxing our young to the hilt.</p>
              <p><br>It is something Mr. Ong must decide for himself to make himself relevant to job offers for the opportunity to earn a better living. More often than not, the fault partially lies with us,- are we too fussy, argumentative, dont take orders, behave atrociously, etc, and made employers pissed off with us?</p>
              <p><br>No. Violence MUST NOT be an answer. Allow one to go scot free and you will have a terrorist nation on your hands.</p>
              <p><br>We all sympathise underdogs. But when the underdogs start biting and harming others, sympathies must end and solutions found to solve the impasse.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Even gangsters such as loansharks are willing to sit down for talks with a neutral 3rd party. What more we ordinary cilivised people to seek peaceful options instead of murder and mayhem where unintended innocent victims get hurt as well?</p>

              <p>I agree with you violence should not be condoned. But err.... maybe you don't know but there are Singaporeans who go hungry you know. There are people who are "poverty oppressed" too. Even the tame mainstream media reports that there are such people. Maybe that's why some of them become loan sharks, haha.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Maybe young, upwardly mobile civil servants out of score points with gahmen and the "great MM Lee" may not know that there are poor people in Singapore.</p>
