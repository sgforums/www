              wondering…</p>

              a civil case…I wonder?</p>

              people..I wonder?</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">What happened to doctor patient confidentiality?..I wonder?</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Is this going to be the precedent? Is the police going to
              arrest anyone who even mentioned “I can’t be sure….I get angry when I see her, so
              how can I not hit her?”..I wonder?</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Someone mentioned MP are voluntarily speaking up for the
              people..ain’t this their job?..I wonder?</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Voluntary..does that not mean unpaid?...I wonder?</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">The poor and civil unrest? The poor are trying to fill their
              stomach and have no time for civil unrest..the only course open to them seems
              to be the mrt track. Civil unrest is for intellectuals who for whatever
              reasons, rousing the people feelings and leading them in the unrests…isn’t it?</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Of course, if the people are being taken care of and happy,
              who would want to join any unrests? In this case, why is the poor man not being
              taken care of instead he is being arrested, jailed and brought to court?..I wonder?</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Is there really any justice for the poor?...I wonder?</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Oh dear…will I be arrested for contempt of court for even
              mentioning this..I wonder?</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">What is the recession proof job in Singapore?...I wonder?</p>

I'm shocked that the MP actually took offence at this remarks.  We need to have a heart.  Know that when one takes a honourable job as an MP - it is to serve the public, and one would do so with humilty.  It would mean that one would have to deal with the occasion, unpleasantness that comes with it with a pinch of salt.  If people are acting out in defiance, its time to look at how our policies have been ineffective in dealing with them.  Have they been given a listening outlet, a sympathetic ear.  A man in poverty still needs people around him to treat him with dignity.  </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">My appeal is - please have a heart for the poor man.  You have not lived like him nor suffered like him - its impossible to feel on the ground because you're way up.  If you have decided to serve the community, please please do so with serious commitment which would mean enduring the flaks that come with it.  Remember that the public is aware that you are remunerated with taxpayers money.  Please do find it in your heart not to be offended but to render help in the biggest possible way. </span></p>

              <p><br>Heart??? our MPs got heart meh??? if so, long long we would had live in low cost and perhaps no Gst liao. I foreseen there will be more old peoples coming to in to comment and critise these MPs who are mostly a generation newer than them.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I totally agreed with you that out of a fit of anger, desparate and depress, one may cry out loud on his/her dissatisfaction, same goes to you and me, just a matter of how much we can control our emotion. And many old peoples just cannot express themselves well leading to threatening and vulgarities words which is actually not what was intended.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As an educated person, one must be able to interpret such issue before making decision. Moreover as a strong public figure, an MP must be able to comprehend compassion and ethic to lead his/her town. Rather than punishing him, which also deter others from commenting like him, the MP learned nothing. The MP should do some soul searching as to why this happen, why and what drive a man of dignity in his/her town to his negative action..there must be a cause to it. It should be treated as a case study for the MPs and not a law by laws settlement to settle the issue.</p>
