              <p>There is this commercial which shows two monkeys saying</p>
              <p>æœ‰èŠ±ç”Ÿå�ƒå¥½è¿‡æ²¡èŠ±ç”Ÿå�ƒ reminds me that living in singapore, we have no alternatives when it comes to government issues.</p>
              <p>because sg does not have natural resources so it cannot afford to lose foriegn investors to implement minimum wage law like other countries such as US.</p>
              <p>sg depended heavily on foreign investments to solve unemployment problems which means that wage will be suppress to a minimum, I see it as a form of exploitation due to the forever rising cost of living and medical bills. It is time for the government to review its policy which worked 40 years ago, but it does not necessary mean that it will work forever.</p>
              <p>Sure enough, its foreign investor policy created jobs and helped singapore to achieve industrial growth and economic and social stability. But, also at the same time cause much internal resentment within its own country, which the government turned a blind eye on them.</p>
              <p>I cannot see the benefits of growing GDP. How does it improve the lives of us heartlanders? </p>
              <p>the ever increasing electricity bills and GST will only create more and more social resentment and the wage gap issue will not be solved.</p>
              <p>The policy of NTUC, to create full employment rather than do collective bargaining wage increment makes ones think whther the policy benefited singaporeans or is it time for them to rethink about their policy measures or they are too afriad to tweak their policies which they think it bring results for them, but not w/o any flaws?</p>
              <p>Aging population and declining birthrate. The governments answer to this problem is to implement short term solution which is to depend on foreign talent.</p>
              <p>I personally thinks that the government should start to invest more in technology and stop hiring foreign workers because some of them might have problems integrating into our society.</p>
              <p>Government want us to help them settle down here. Its ironic for ouir own govt requesting us to do that when it means that they will take away our bread and butter.</p>
              <p>Long term solution is to invest heavily in technology rather than depending on foreign workers.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Singapore, without natural resources, is very much depend on human resources, with a fast pace of growing economy competitiveness, we can slack behind others and allow them to overcome us, if that is the case, we are history.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Invest in technology also needs manpowers, aging population is one of the main factor that we are engaging young foreign talents and strength to helps us build our economy. We should be glad that people find here conducive to work and thereby leave their homeland to help us create business and technology here. We are also lucky that these foreigners homeland are not doing well, thereby given us the opportunity to drain both their brain and strength for the benefit of you and me. Talking about problems with foreign peoples, i think Singaporeans are also equally creating problems here, these are norm of a society, as there can never be a so call utopia society, as long as we can keep it at a minimum, we should be the least crime rate in Asean.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Throughout the years of industrialisation, MNCs in one way or the other bring wealth and knowledge to us, and in a short period of time, the state created and privatised it own MNCs, the like of DBS, ST technologist, Keppel, City developers...etc etc, all these cannot be form without the know how and know why that we learned from MNCs, we actually should thanks the Japanses, europe and even the americans who invested here for the benefits of the world, the likes of SONY, TATA, PHilips, Hitachi, etc etc had trained our peoples not only in the knowledge of working and technology but how the vision of how an MNCs works. As Such, we adopted a very open door policies and make ourselves ranked as best workers in the world under BERI survey.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The NTUC had managed to train about 100,000 peoples in this recession resulting in less unemployment and less retrenchment, it is the worst recession that hit us hard then 1998, but we still have lesser retrenchment than 1998, 30,000 nos. It provided a channels of reaching and helping the lower income and unemployed by match jobs to jobs for them, train and provide hourly paid too. Where else can u find these in Europe?? The recent strike and protest by french and british workers on employer employing former cheap Eastern European workers had totally cut their local workers off..this led to clashes and riot which is detrimental to the country and society as a whole.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Birthrate is a unique social issue by itself, we are not the one having a low birthrates, since it is beyong one control, but we have to be ready to look forward into the future, if there is no grow from within, we hve to order from outside, that is the fact of it, and luckily, peoples are coming, be it stepping stones or whatsoever, at least a few will stay and make this a place they call home.</p>

              <p>There is this commercial which shows two monkeys saying</p>
              <p>æœ‰èŠ±ç”Ÿå�ƒå¥½è¿‡æ²¡èŠ±ç”Ÿå�ƒ reminds me that living in singapore, we have no
              alternatives when it comes to government issues.</p>
              <p>because sg does not have natural resources so it cannot afford
              to lose foriegn investors to implement minimum wage law like
              other countries such as US.</p>
              <p>sg depended heavily on foreign investments to solve unemployment
              problems which means that wage will be suppress to a minimum, I see
              it as a form of exploitation due to the forever rising
              cost of living and medical bills. It is time for the government to
              review its policy which worked 40 years ago, but it does not
              necessary mean that it will work forever.</p>
              <p>Sure enough, its foreign investor policy created jobs
              and helped singapore to achieve industrial growth and
              economic and social stability. But, also at the same time cause
              much internal resentment within its own country, which the
              government turned a blind eye on them.</p>
              <p>I cannot see the benefits of growing GDP. How does it
              improve the lives of us heartlanders? </p>
              <p>the ever increasing electricity bills and GST will
              only create more and more social resentment and the wage gap issue
              will not be solved.</p>
              <p>The policy of NTUC, to create full employment rather than do
              collective bargaining wage increment makes ones
              think whther the policy benefited singaporeans or is
              it time for them to rethink about their policy measures or they are
              too afriad to tweak their policies which they think it bring
              results for them, but not w/o any flaws?</p>
              <p>Aging population and declining birthrate. The governments answer
              to this problem is to implement short term solution which is to
              depend on foreign talent.</p>
              <p>I personally thinks that the government should start to invest
              more in technology and stop hiring foreign workers because some of
              them might have problems integrating into our society.</p>
              <p>Government want us to help them settle down here. Its ironic for
              ouir own govt requesting us to do that when it means that they will
              take away our bread and butter.</p>
              <p>Long term solution is to invest heavily in technology rather
              than depending on foreign workers.</p>

              <p>There's some truth in that, but consider that the average wage in Singapore is much higher than say in Malaysia. I feel that unless you are active in the blue collar industry, foreign talent is not really as big of an issue. Most professional jobs are still actively held by Singaporeans. As for the GDP issue, if Singapore is forever in the red, im sure you would feel it then</p>

              <p><br>True breed Singaporeans are hardworking peoples, especially the earlier generation, from poor farmer to technicians and so on to skill master of his/her own trade, they make money, see the earlier numerous opportunities and take advantage of it to create their own business, it can in group of buddies or individual, others when overseas by the parents companies to upgrade and return as managers or senior engineers. These pioneer workers are the best of the best, they save, work hard, learn and trained, just to get survive, just to bring home a better life for their childrens and wifeys. But today, these peoples are either death or old aged, leaving behind wealth, stocks, insurance whereby today kids and youngs live on it. There the youngs of today, just like me are not so aggressive and motivated as their earlier generation, because father or grandfather had left a fortune that can last a few generations. No doubts our workforce is still nos 1, but we are slowly losing ground to the hardworking koreans.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Education and knowledge bring about independency to we, the gals, in a society of equal gender footing, we gals can take on a man job anytime, infact I am doing it. But the side effect of education and knowledge gives both men and women a different perspective on family. If men can go work and wonder around, we women also can do it. Yet, with the lost of identities in term of religions and cultures, we feel no responsibility to bear childrens for the sake of bearing childrens. We cannot blame the govt for allowing us to be educated and knowledgeable, not unlike those third world countries where women are second class and not able to attend school. What we can say is that we had moved up another level, a level whereby there is no belonging and very individualistic.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Singapore is one of the best for investment is not just because of the peoples, there are many factors, the corporate tax, the facilites, and most important the infrastructure and the peaceful environment. The quick accessiblilty to all things likes transport, sea ports, road, equipment, financial dealings, etc etc is very conducive for business peoples to come here even tho, it is a bit more expensive, but after we dun like to wear Rolex </p>

              <p>Well, the govt can still make the dream come true.</p>
              <p>Singapore enjoys cordial relations with so many many countries. Here's a plan for the government: Pick the 100 most important such nations and create 250 jobs at each foreign embassy/mission/consulate. Pay each between 50 K and 100 K a year. (All numbers random lah, feel free to change them).</p>
              <p>In one fell swoop, you get to create 25K jobs, send that many people overseas, pay them decent wages (some of which may come back home)...all at an annual outgo of less than $3 billion, which is chickenfeed for the govt.</p>
              <p>These thousands of overseas Singaporeans can act as ambassadors, promoting inbound and outbound tourism, education and healthcare and also scout for fresh business opportunities.</p>
