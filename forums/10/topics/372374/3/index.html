              <p>good last question. So do we behave as a corporation ALL the time, or do we behave like a corporation most of the time?</p>
              <p>Not sure about you, but in my view, it seems like its ALL the time. In which case, your question comes in, shouldn't there be a limit to how pragmatic we are as a society?</p>
              <p>If you look at our KPIs set by our govt, its mostly related to economic progression. We seem to think that by achieving economic progression, everything can fall perfectly into place. By bringing in the $$$, automatically, the citizens will be happy.</p>
              <p>But is this necessarily the case? Can a govt focus only on economic progression, and then ignore all other aspects of the society?</p>
              <p>Not that I am saying we are completely wrong. Perhaps this formula was effective for the past 40 years. Is this formula going to be effective going forward? What has happened to SM Goh's (when he was PM) call for a kinder gentler society?</p>
              <p>I see robotics all around me. We are becoming less and less like a human society...</p>

              <p> I don't think you'd get any disagreements from me regarding what you've said.</p>
              <p>Most here i think would agree the formula that the government is using to decide policies is extremely outdated and we need more opposition in parliament in order to stop them from pursuing a self destructive path. </p>
              <p>But what exactly would be the better formula? And who would be the best to implement it? This requires a far bigger magnifying glass and much harder strutiny than that we used for the PAP.</p>
              <p>LKY is correct that if we elected the wrong opposition up then Singapore is finished. Big emphasis on the "wrong".</p>
              <p>I just don't buy that the solution is as simple as electing CSJ into power, or that we pursue a vague "more humane policy" we would solve our problems.</p>

              <p> I don't think you'd get any disagreements from me
              regarding what you've said.</p>
              <p>Most here i think would agree the formula that the government is
              using to decide policies is extremely outdated and we need more
              opposition in parliament in order to stop them from pursuing a self
              destructive path. </p>
              <p>But what exactly would be the better formula? And who would be
              the best to implement it? This requires a far bigger magnifying
              glass and much harder strutiny than that we used for the PAP.</p>
              <p>LKY is correct that if we elected the wrong opposition up then
              Singapore is finished. Big emphasis on the "wrong".</p>
              <p>I just don't buy that the solution is as simple as electing CSJ
              into power, or that we pursue a vague "more humane policy" we would
              solve our problems.</p>

              <p>Agreed to your point on opposition. We would not want the wrong opposition to be elected into the parliament.</p>
              <p>But who determines "wrong" opposition? Us, or the PAP and LKY?</p>
              <p>For eg, what right does the presidential election committee have in putting so many boundaries and terms so that Nathan gets re-elected WITHOUT contest? Do they have the right to decide for us who is right or wrong? Is Singapore so pathetic (in terms of talent), that our presidential election only has ONE candidate each round? And are we Singaporeans so pathetic individuals that we cannot even discern between a good and bad candidate, that we need to be spoonfed time and again?</p>
              <p>Good or "wrong" opposition going into the parliament the next round sometimes may not be so relevant at this stage, opposition serves to warn the PAP one thing. Listen to the people, and STOP behaving like arrogant elites in another realm, before you lose more votes.</p>
              <p>Do you want another GST increase AFTER the next election, which from historical patterns, seem to indicate its a trend?</p>
