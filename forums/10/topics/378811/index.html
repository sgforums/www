The government has to lead, watch the changing environment, implement the policies needed, mobilise Singaporeans and mount a national response to get us through. It’s the party’s business to provide this leadership for Singapore."<br><br>He added that the country is much better off with one dominant party, as long as the PAP provides clean and good government, and the lives of Singaporeans improve.<br><br>Mr Lee said: "If the party doesn’t work, if something goes wrong with the party, you can be sure new parties will come, new contests will come. People will spring up to take on the government in no time at all.<br><br>"But it is not our job to build up the opposition or split the party into two, because it is hard enough to find one team to look after the country. How can we find two?"<br><br>Mr Lee said that as a small country, Singapore depends critically on an outstanding team of leaders to make up for the many limitations.<br><br>Hence, the country cannot afford to compromise the quality of the nation’s leadership.<br><br>Mr Lee said that at every general election, the party brings in 20 or more new MPs and ministers.<br><br>The progress of leadership renewal in the PAP determines whether Singapore will continue enjoying stability and good government in the long term, he said.<br>— CNA/ir</div>

              <p>It simply shows the lack of challenge and political immaturity of the new breed of PAP "politicians" - accustomed to being sheltered by the bullying tactics of LKY to manage a population whose political apathy simply suit them fine.</p>
              <p>Placed on the World Stage, the new breed of PAP "politicians" cannot compare with those who are truly tested in "real politiks" to reach their rightful positions supported by their communities.</p>
              <p>It is obvious that PM LHL will propagate this false position, as he and his Old PAPA cannot tolerate any alternative views that challenge their political positions.</p>
              <p>As PM LHL had so eloquently said in the 2006 elections, if there are more MPs from the Alternative Parties entering Parliament, they will bog him down, and he will have to spend more time to "fix" every single one of them.</p>

              <p>Yes, certainly, it will bog LHL and his minions down lar - why?</p>

              <p>"pretending to be martyrs" - what possible drama can be extracted from any simple understanding of the word "martyr" ?</p>
              <p>How prepared are you to make your sacrifices, or suffer as much in order to further your belief in a cause, or in a principle ?</p>
              <p>If you are not to make even an iota of personal sacrifice, or to suffer on a point of principle - are you qualified to pass judgment on others ?</p>

              <p>With your well publicised skewed prejudices, do you need to mention any name for the "Singapore Martyr" whom you despised with such deep psychopathic passion ?</p>
              <p>It is obvious that democracy will fail with "fence sitters" like you, who will wait for others to create the setting, while you avoid playing any part in the unfolding Drama - even as you eagerly watch from the front pit of the stage - to form your own skewed conclusions as a cynical drama addict based on your pathetic standards.</p>
              <p>It is easy to generalise, and make passing comments without statistics.</p>
              <p>Comparing to the time when CST was leading the SDP, and to the SDP at this time - the fact is that the SDP is seeing an infusion of fresh, younger and better educated party activists - despite the harsh and desperate PAP treatment applied against CSJ and the SDP.</p>
              <p>Even at the Public Forums organised by the SDP has seen a growing number of attendees, with the SDP cardres and Youth Wing playing a high profile role.</p>
              <p>Are you being realistic or objective with your cynical views ?</p>
              <p>Could CSJ stand a chance when after his first election outing in 1992, the heavy hand of the PAP machinery came into play to persecute him with petty charges from his workplace at the NUS, and from his Faculty Head who is a PAP stalwart ?</p>
              <p>You must be a joke to expect CSJ to get any votes when after his first political outing, CSJ was nailed by a desperate and insecure LKY to prevent CSJ from succeeding in politics that will put stress on LHL as PM to have to fix CSJ all the time.</p>
              <p>Your senseless remark on "martyrs without a cause" - simply reflect an ingrate in you, who has no substance to apprecate the sacrifices made by others with the ignorance clearly being part of your character.</p>
              <p>Can your pathetic existence measure to the likes of those martyrs who sacrificed their lives to challenge LKY and the PAP, to change political environment that had allowed the PAP to takeover the political controls from the hands of Singaporeans ?</p>
              <p>Those martyrs will include J.B.Jeyaretnam, Francis Seow, Tan Liang Hong, those social activists falsely accused as Marxist Conspirators in the Catholic Church, Tan Wah Piow, Chia Thye Poh, Lim Chin Siong - can you hold a candle near them ?</p>

              <p>From the arrogant ignorance seen in these statements, it is obvious you have not learnt to chew and digest the more important lessons in life.</p>
              <p>Is it not pathetic that you will dare say that "the opposition idiots will blame everything except themselves" - when it is your own delusion with your own failures that have prevented yourself from seeing your own role in the entire drama ?</p>
              <p>In the politics of Singapore, are you not claiming your own role for your own political future, or are you surrendering your politcal rights to the PAP, who have dominated politics in Singapore for 52 years since 1957 ?</p>
              <p>Are you disclaiming your resposibility to yourself and your future generations - to play your part in the unfolding political drama in Singapore ?</p>
              <p>One can only wonder if you are truly keeping a fine balance sitting on a narrow fence, or if your butt is truly so small to keep a tight balance act ?</p>
              <p>Despite your claims of being a fence sitter, your small butt is surely leaning on the side of the PAP, as you are contented with the two ineffective MP from the Alternative Parties - even when both are subjected to the monolithic weight of the PAP, that prevent these two MPs from even conducting their political duties as Elected MPs in their own respective constituencies let alone in Parliament.</p>
              <p>Can you chew and digest the fact that you have as much a political responsibility for your own political future, even when you expect others to do the job for you ? </p>
