              <p><strong>The Australian, 9 Jul 2009, aap</strong><br> <br> <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>SP AusNet boss's pay leaps 60pc as profit plunges<br> </strong></span> <br> <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>SINGAPORE-BACKED SP AusNet has
              defended a 60 per cent jump in annual remuneration for its managing
              director despite a fall in the company's security price and profit over
              2008-09.</strong></span><br> <br> Stapled security holders gathered yesterday for the company's annual
              general meeting in Melbourne to vote on its remuneration report and
              other resolutions and to hear a yearly update from its key executives.<br> <br> SP AusNet remuneration committee chairman George Lefroy told the
              meeting he was aware of investor concerns about the plan to increase
              managing director Nino Ficcau's annual pay.<br> <br> "I would like to acknowledge security holder and community concern and
              interest in executive remuneration particularly in these challenging
              times," Dr Lefroy said.<br> <br> <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>There was an outcry in May when SP
              AusNet, which is backed by Singapore Power and runs Victoria's
              high-voltage electricity transmission network, said it would award Mr
              Ficca a $412,461 cash bonus, despite the utility posting a 6.7 per cent
              dip in its net profit for this financial year.</strong></span><span style="font-size: medium;"><br> </span> <br> Dr Lefroy told shareholders yesterday M<span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>r Ficca had been rewarded for <span style="text-decoration: underline;">"operational excellence"</span> and the role he played in developing business strategy and "guiding and driving specified business outcomes".<br> </strong></span> <br> Mr Ficca's total reportable remuneration for 2008-09 had risen by 60
              per cent to $2.4 million, from $1.5m last financial year, he said. "The
              key reason for this increase is the long-term incentive plan," Dr
              Lefroy said.<br> <br> He stressed that the reportable remuneration was not the same as
              take-home pay because it included accounting valuations for current and
              historical equity grants that may or may not materialise.<br> <br> The managing director's remuneration package included fixed
              remuneration of $802,000 an on-target short-term incentive of $401,000
              in cash, and a maximum long-term incentive payment of about $750,000,
              which he must convert on-market into securities.<br> <br> Dr Lefroy he said a review in May last year showed a correction was
              needed in directors' fees and the salaries of the managing director and
              other executives, for it to remain competitive.<br> <br> The remuneration jump for Mr Ficca comes despite the company's stapled
              securities price falling to 88.6c at the end of its March year, from
              $1.20 a year previously. SP AusNet shares fell 0.5c yesterday to 77c.
              Despite the protests, security holders later voted in favour of the
              company's remuneration report.<br> <br> Mr Ficca told the meeting his company report card for the year had included a number of positive achievements.<br> <br> The net profit result, the connection of 26,400 new customers, the
              refurbishment and upgrade of key transmission stations and a high level
              of customer satisfaction were among the year's highlights, he said.<br> <br> SP AusNet's power infrastructure was affected by the fatal Victorian
              bushfires earlier this year. Some Kinglake residents affected by the
              fires have launched a class action against SP AusNet, alleging faulty
              power lines started some of the blazes. The firm is defending the claim.<br> <br> ============================</p>
