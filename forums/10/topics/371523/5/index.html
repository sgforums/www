              <p>maybe MM lee would like to stick to the view of world renowned
              economist such as marc faber, roubini lor. they predict we are not
              out of the most servere recession since the great depression. 
              actually the govt should have lotsa information before they make
              such a comments. EDB might feedback that alot of company are
              planning on cutting back on investment, NTUC been inform in advance
              of possibility retrenchment. and survey conducted that SME, MNC
              would cut staff if not stop hiring.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If US dont come out of recession, singapore has no chance of
              recovery. the current optimism in stock market and economy are
              because of the result of govt stimulus package across the world.
              but the jobless rate is still increasing. what happen if stimulus
              stops, and jobless rate still show no sign of recovery.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>however no one know whether the reovery is a V shape or W
              shape.</p>

              <p>its an i shape...</p>
              <p>for US to come out of recession..they need to spend..but they are broke..so they have to borrow from others to spend.the others have no money to lend because US isnt spending..so if US doesnt get the funds to spend..US doesnt get out of the recession..so they got no money to buy..with no money to buy..sellers cant sell their goods..goods not sold leads back to no money to lend US to spend and again and again it continues..</p>

              <p><br>The matter relating to retrenchment is something the PM can hardly do a thing cause the Spore is dependent on the US market to export her stuff. Export such as electronic and PC stuff but if u look at Malaysia or Indonesia, they are not that badly affected considering the fact that they also export to US but they export mostly commodities such as oil or palm oil which is a daily necessity in everyday life of the common people.

              <p><br>In Malaysia, we got a property in Malacca left over by my ah gong, outside there is tulip plants, celery, sugar cane, potato plants and a few coconut trees beside those durian and rambutan trees. No money also can survive.</p>

              <p>In Singapore, unless you are living in landed property, all condo and HDB is like a jail, a more flexible jail. If you dun work or do a business, you are dead, or the most you can do is eat cement and bricks in this concrete jungle of Singapore.</p>

              <p>As i said early, it near the end of the year, season greetings will bring in some order to energise the economy, but after that, everyone will be feel the hole in the pocket and start to spend less, order reduced and retrenchment will take place, that is why PM said retrenchment is going to be higher as job credit scheme will end by end of this year, and peoples will not be getting any bonus but rather cut wages as this year performance is so far, poor.</p>

              <p><br>If I remeber correctly, this country is the first to go into recession when the financial crisis took place n ever since the job credit scheme kena implemented to minimize the impact of the recession. Unless economy in US pick up quickly, the exports is still hanging around at the port. The recovery being talked is still questionable considering plenty of people in US still looking for work, therefore they spent less.</p>

              <p>As an export oriented country, we are bound to be the first to be hit by foreigners consumer index falling,  but with no doubt we will be the first to gain when the tide come around.</p>

              <p>Our dependent on US and the west is no more at a 100% stake as it use to be after this finanical crisis, we will be stupid if we do not improve and take precaution on our dependency, we  have shifted towards China and India to widen our export and business targets. Such diversities will give us less risk in future. As a country without natural resource, we are indeed very fragile, we are able to survive this recession is because of our strong saving culture and more importantly, our cool heads to ride this wave smartly.</p>

              <p><br>Most Singaporean Do not understand ...........The notion that Singapore depended upon export oriented are just the remnant of FDI from the 80s. and 90s. Back than it works for Singapore.  liberal trade polices is simply an extension of that same strategy.</p>
              <p>To continue expecting this strategy to work for island state is to bury yourself in the hatch. Since the start of 2000 most MNC has gone several round of restructuring it is only a matter of time it exit out from Singapore.</p>
              <p>What Singapore govt fail to understand that at the end of the day, Singapore needs its own industry. It need to buffer its own SME, but instead it  invest too much on Civil Govt and crowd out talent from the private sectors.</p>
              <p>Private sectors are to fence for themseleved.  </p>
