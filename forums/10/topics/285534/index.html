Are we the ordinary citizens better off today as compared with the 1970s and are now truly living in the first world?<br><br>PROSE OF LITTLE RED DOT (2nd edition)<br><br>In the east was a little red dot,<br><br>Too small and scarce of resource,<br><br>Said supreme leader to be governed,<br><br>By democracy said to be promiscuous,<br><br>So he governed the dot with iron-fist autocracy,<br><br>In disguise of western democracy,<br><br>To shouts of merdeka, got himself elected,<br><br>To serve fellow citizens with justice and equity,<br><br>Alas as in history he did not write,<br><br>Men once given golden opportunity,<br><br>Became haughty and **@#ey,<br><br>Obsessed with own self glory,<br><br>Intoxicated with power hungered more,<br><br>Tweaked all laws to serve his own agendas,<br><br>Control the legislature, and judiciary,<br><br>In supreme parliament made all laws,<br><br>That prevented citizens from questioning,<br><br>Wrongful acts and policies of ministers,<br><br>Passed laws that paid themselves highest salaries,<br><br>Not by agreed appointment contracts,<br><br>But by afterthought to pay themselves,<br><br>The amounts said to be earned by lucky CEOs,<br><br>Who earned millions from sweats of investments,<br><br>Such salaried they paid themselves,<br><br>Surpassed the president's of United States,<br><br>Claimed to keep talents and prevent corruptions,<br><br>But not enough so they paid themselves,<br><br>Bonuses, life-long fees, and director fees,<br><br>Double pay added for retiring while working,<br><br>They tax, double tax and claim all costs,<br><br>Made bogey of medical care and facilities<br><br>On ground of sloppy road of welfare,<br><br>So taxes collected left as reserves in billions,<br><br>To be spent like on golden taps,<br><br>Seven wonders, more salaries or annuities,<br><br>While peoples live in struggles,<br><br>With higher fees, medical, housing and utilities,<br><br>Diverse schemes divised to claim more fees,<br><br>Size of reserves seem ever growing,<br><br>Need for spending seem unending,<br><br>Immense profits made from assets and lands,<br><br>Already paid and owned by citizens'

to buy votes with election goodies,<br><br>Fearing unhappiness of citizens,<br><br>Lleaders tweaked the election process,<br><br>Reasoned to ensure racial harmony,<br><br>So citizens cannot cast votes to elect individuals,<br><br>Who must group in block of 3, 4, 5 or 6,<br><br>To compete group of individuals called GRC,<br><br>Leaders thus monopolise election process,<br><br>Sued any politicians of threats to ruling party,<br><br>Till no one left to represent electorate,<br><br>To pacify simple peasants and potential rebel,<br><br>Goodies were given before election day,<br><br>Some as lift and

millions,<br><br>Newspapers were too afraid of truths,<br><br>Fears of defamation suits or losing licence,<br><br>Reported good news not crusading journalism.<br><br>Economy stagnated from lack of

to the third,<br><br>Propaganda spread vile about democracy,<br><br>To dissuade citizens from taking to street,<br><br>Citizens getting poorer each day,<br><br>So had no savings to pay for higher costs,<br><br>So there is a need to rethink on CPF policies,<br><br>To cope with ever rising medical care,<br><br>Senior citizens' CPF retirement got frozen,<br><br>At 55 they could not draw own

            <div class='col-md body'>MM Lee was speaking tonight at the International Conference on Arbitration with repeated emphasis on Singapore government's upholding principle of rule of law.<br><br>He said Singapore has an independent judiciary and an efficient police and citizens are free to read anything they like and blog as they like.<br><br>Surely if judiciary was independent as claimed the ministers would not be pitching together with intimidations of all kinds and sue Tang Liang Hong for defamation over a minor innuendo remarks against ministers like having made a police report for certain wrong or speaking critical of government in the Cheng San election.<br><br>How far are such speeches true? Does he allow reporters of Straits Times to write articles featuring analytical opinions without being taken to task for engaging in crusading journalism.<br><br>How many critical letters written to the Straits Times on failed government policies were published?<br><br>Does he allow the judiciary to hear the politically motivated defamation suits independently which may not favor his ruling party or which may result in reprimanding of his party for one reason for another?<br><br>Can he reveal how was Michael Khoo transferred so soon after he delivered the contrary verdict to the opposition politician against the expectation of his government?</div>

How does he defined unemployed?
