            <div class='col-md body'>In MM Lee's replies to questions raised at the recent international panel of lawyers held in Singapore it is clear that he could easily deny he or his government is curbing freedoms of speech or criticisms of government with half truths and fallacies without objective measurements apple-to-apple comparison or basis.<br><br>This kind of answering to criticisms can be endless and inconclusive and no one could ever get to the truth. It will be contentions ad nausem where no one will be the wiser at the end.<br><br>If this case the international reports he was trying to reply to ranked Singapore's freedom of press or accountability as 146th - among the worse fascist regimes.<br><br>Yet he simply replied to such reports by coming up with other reports ranking of Singapore as among the best or the top like regarding the rather limited aspects of rule of law relating to banking etc but refused to acknowledge other independent international reports which ranked Singapore's press freedoms at 146th which bear no relationship to banking law.<br><br>He is using fallacy as well by comparing his ministers' salaries to some benchmarking done of private sector CEOs. Many of the CEOs who were earning millions being benchmarked to are actually non-comparable entrepreneurs and investors who derived higher salaries from their own business success but no MM Lee still insisted on such fallacious comparison for his own purpose probably relying on his political power to overrule all within and without right or wrong.<br><br>This has been his comparisons of Singapore's performance in all areas as well by comparing selectively to those who support his argumentations.<br><br>He could not counter objectively the 146th ranking of Singapore in term of press freedom and all he could add it to say that Singaporeans can read anything or almost anything namely quite a number of magazines without mentioning magazines banned or curtailed by his actions.<br><br>In this way he will endlessly contend and contend by fallacious argumentations of his own withoutapple-to-apple comparisons or basis.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Malaysia being more driven... you xiao is it..?. how to when they are still being shackled with a big ticking TIME bomb called NEP around their ankles, condemning ordinary Malaysians into perpetual slaves. In fact, FDI into the country has been falling and their projected economic growth this year will be rather dismal..... only thing lubricating and propping them is the 720,000 barrels of oil the country produces per day... Singapore's reserves is still a good US60 billion more than them.... please la, dun use Msia as a comparison... you make me laugh (Not trying to be arrogant or rude to any Msian here).. A good analogy is this... Msia is like a person who has a rich dad who left him plenty of properties and assets and Spore, a driven, hardworking and your normal everyday working joe... but Joe has more savings than the Kai Chai&gt;</div>
