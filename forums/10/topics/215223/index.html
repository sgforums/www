            <div class='col-md body'>Well written.<br><br>I knew a taxi driver like that too. We've became such good friends that I regularly request him for the ride to the airport. He too, was a well educated taxi driver.<br><br>At near fifty, he has a wealth of experience but couldn't find work. He was in the electronics/semiconductor industry that was oh-so-hot until our government took a change in policy and switch to IT and now biotech. Left with no choice, he took to driving a cab. But good for him, he is now downunder enjoying retirement life. He's a "quitter". Instead of slogging it out and working for MacDonald's in Singapore, he gave up his citizenship; sold his HDB (didn't get much because it didn't have many more years left on the 99 year lease), took his CPF and now lives in a 20,000 sq ft bungalow and runs a small enterprise.<br><br>During our regular conversation, we had came to agree that Singapore is a great place to work and earn money (for now) but a terrible place to retire. Like him, when I earn my keeps, I will sell away everything and move out of Singapore with my family.<br><br>However, I disagree that we are loosing our edge in employment. Our govt policies has been and will always be pro-business and it makes absolute sense to employ staff in Singapore (be it Singaporeans or FTs). We have a failed MOM that does not protects its citizens but seems to always agree with companies instead.<br><br>Employees in Singapore are not well protected against retrenchment or being fired. It's all good for business.<br><br>Even if we loose our edge as employees (we are no longer as bilingual as we claim to be, nor as smart) but we are very employable for the simple reason that there's no hassle in firing anyone.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I too have tested the Straits Times' Forum editor a few times by writing letters with compliment and letters which are politically sensitive. Usually the letters which are complimenting the government or leaders in some ways will be published and the letters which contain bigger problems and policy errors or suggestions to revise the Constitution of Singapor will be rejected.<br><br>I have once written one piece concerning the leadership and corporate governance which was at first accepted but later within the same day rejected by a more powerful editor.<br><br>When I emailed the editor to ask why she has rejected my article which the editorial assistant earlier informed me it will be published she claimed that it was published. But searched as I did, I could not find the publication of that article.<br><br>If government must control the news media, and if it results in this kind of happenings, there is something seriously wrong which will at the end lead to bigger problems.<br><br>That is why there has to be a re-think of all major policies including liberalizing expressions of views and dissent as done by world CSOs.<br><br>If therer is no change, government will be creating its own instability and not the press freedoms which actually may help to improve stability and law and order and hiding of problems like the NKF.<br><br><a href="http://forums.delphiforums.com/n/main.asp?webtag=sammyboymod&amp;nav=messages&amp;msg=120392.1&amp;prettyurl=%2Fsammyboymod%2Fmessages%3Fmsg%3D120392%2E1" rel="nofollow">http://forums.delphiforums.com/n/main.asp?webtag=sammyboymod&amp;nav=messages&amp;msg=120392.1&amp;prettyurl=%2Fsammyboymod%2Fmessages%3Fmsg%3D120392%2E1</a></div>
