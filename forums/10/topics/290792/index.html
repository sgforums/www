            <div class='col-md body'><strong>GILA GANTRY<br>Reckless motorists pop up at new ERP gantry along CTE near Jalan Bahagia<br>By Tan Mae Lynn<br><br>November 10, 2007       </strong><br><br>IMAGINE trying to buy or borrow a CashCard from another motorist right on the jam-packed Central Expressway.<br><br>A taxi driver did just that after a new evening electronic road pricing (ERP) gantry started operation this week, apparently catching him by surprise.<br><br>He stopped by the emergency shoulder just before the gantry, got out of his cab and then begged other waiting motorists to let him use their CashCards.<br><br>He apparently succeeded in persuading one motorcyclist to part with his CashCard, on the condition that the latter would use it to cross the gantry first.<br><br>After the biker went past the gantry, the cabby ran to him, took the CashCard, rushed back to his cab, and then drove off.<br><br>CAUSED TRAFFIC JAM<br><br>The cabby's antics, and those of other motorists who stopped illegally on the emergency shoulder, reduced traffic along the CTE to a crawl.<br><br>All this because a night ERP gantry, on the northbound CTE after the Jalan Bahagia exit, was activated on Monday.<br><br>Many of these motorists were spotted waiting along the CTE shoulder from 8pm onwards, without realising that this new ERP gantry operates from 5.30pm until 10.30pm.<br><br>With this new gantry, northbound motorists on the CTE, like those headed to Ang Mo Kio or Yishun, may have to pay ERP twice.<br><br>There is already an existing gantry along the northbound CTE near the Braddell Road exit which operates until 8pm.<br><br>A check by The New Paper team from about 7.30pm to 9pm on Tuesday found cars and motorcycles changing lanes amid heavy traffic to get on to the expressway shoulder.<br><br>Some had forgotten to put their CashCards into the in-vehicle unit.<br><br>Others wanted to avoid paying either the 50 cents or $1 fee at the new ERP gantry before the PIE exit.<br><br>They stopped at the shoulder and waited and, as a result, caused a congestion.<br><br>At least 20 cars were seen stopping by the road shoulder over the 1 1/2-hour period.<br><br>Some vehicles cut across lanes to get to the road shoulder.<br><br>But after waiting five to 10 minutes, some vehicles drove off when they realised the 'In Operation' light on the gantry would not go off soon.<br><br>There were also other inconsiderate motorists who came to a complete halt before the gantry, causing a chain of motorists behind them to brake suddenly as well.<br><br>Many tooted their horns.<br><br>As if that was not bad enough, some cars and motorcyclists even tried to reverse against the flow of heavy traffic to escape through Jalan Bahagia.<br><br>While only a few cars were seen attempting this stunt - mostly without much success - many motorcyclists made a U-turn on the shoulder and rode back to the Jalan Bahagia exit.<br><br>Motorists who spoke to The New Paper were peeved by the antics of these reckless motorists.<br><br>Mr Christopher Pereira, 33, said: 'They're idiots. In the first place, if you're going that way, you should know that (the gantry) is there... It was widely publicised.<br><br>'And if you travel along the CTE regularly, you should know a new gantry has been put up.'<br><br>He added: 'Even if you happened to use that road that day, it doesn't make sense to wait just to avoid paying the 50 cents or $1.'<br><br>Agreeing, freelance photographer Mr Sam Yeo, 45, said: 'It's dangerous to be on the shoulder because there are careless motorists who might overtake on the left and they might hit them, especially at night when visibility is not so good.'<br><br>He added: 'They're willing to pay so much for a car but want to stint on parking and ERP.'<br><br>SUDDEN HALT<br><br>Earlier this week, Mr Kelvin Wong, 31, also came across a car that came to a sudden halt before the new gantry.<br><br>The physiotherapist said: 'Along the shoulder, there were five or six cars and many more motorbikes when I drove by a few days ago.'<br><br>-- Pictures: CHOO CHWEE HUA<br>Another motorist who gave his name as Vincent attempted to explain the behaviour of these inconsiderate road users.<br><br>He said: 'While I don't understand why they would risk being fined and put themselves in danger just for that $1, I guess from their perspective, it can add up to a lot if they cross the gantry many times over a week...<br><br>'Especially for those who don't earn a lot of money, they will be hardest hit and would try to avoid paying if they can.'<br><br>A check with the Land Transport Authority (LTA) revealed that an average of 125 motorists are booked each month for stopping along the road shoulder.<br><br>Those caught face a fine of $130 and four demerit points.<br><br>LTA did not provide the number of motorists caught since the ERP rate changes took effect this week.<br><br>A spokesperson for LTA, Ms Suhana Kharudin, urged motorists not to stop on the road shoulder to avoid ERP.<br><br>She said: 'The road shoulder is used for the recovery of broken-down vehicles along expressways.'<br><br>She added: 'LTA enforcement officers have been patrolling the expressways and LTA traffic marshals have also been deployed to look out for motorists stopping in front of the ERP gantries.'<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Land is scarce. Restriction in building more roads. Offices already have staggered working hours to help ease congestion. Not much alternative routes for diversion to reach any destination. Erect some more ERP gantries here and there. Eventually no more alternative route for diversion. Use any route must still pay. ERP increase is only a short term solution. Build more flyover, in the end also road users will pay. No more idea to squeeze more money out of road users.<br>Possible solution- Make some companiesÂ’ office hours to follow NY time. Make Singapore a 24-hour non-sleeping cityÂ…..butÂ…donÂ’t remove any gantry.<br>This is also possible to increase car ownership. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
