(This is not the loser part, okay?)<br><br>And when we do not fall between the lower income brackets (earning $1,500 and below a month) we actually end up being the ones who get the least and give back the most.<br><br>So I did not expect anything - and the expectation came true. But you know, lah, old people, we can also be quite blur, one.<br><br>We have barely heard the complete sentence and are all excited.<br><br>Which was my state when I heard that for the over-55s, there's to be - in my qualifying group - $800 GST credits.<br><br>Oops, then the penny dropped. That's $800 over four years, which amounts to $200 per.<br><br>I perked up again at the mention of a Senior Citizen Bonus. Usual conditions applying, I am good for somewhere midway of $400 to $1,000.<br><br>Alamak, not so fast, again paid out in four yearly instalments.<br><br>Where got people give out hongbao like that, in instalments?<br><br>Okay, so I am going to be property-tax-free for two years, a big deal for an HDB four-roomer. Plus there will be rebates on service and conservancy charges and Utilities Save (U-Save) for five years.<br><br>(Another thing, how do you explain S&amp;CC and U-Save to the man in the kopitiam? Uncle, can put aircon on longer, bill won't be so high?)<br><br>Overall, the solo silver surfer in the middle income group is sandwiched between the cracks, living life in the longkang lane, as it were.<br><br>Do I feel as if we are being penalised? For being non-productive (if you do not count the two, three good jokes I produce annually).<br><br>My brother, a father of three, said: 'You guys enjoy all the benefits of the country, but you have not produced children, who are future contributors to the nation, that's why.'<br><br>Put like that, it makes some sense.<br><br>You know, I said to him, with what I am about to receive, I can buy only a one-way ticket to the Cannes Film Festival this year. Which is not an altogether bad thing.<br><br>Hmm, this calls for a drink. At least my Tiger will be cheaper...<br><br></div>
