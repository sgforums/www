To knock off work at lunchtime and report for another job at teatime?<br><br>Yesterday, I described how I shadowed daily-rated worker Kamaruzaman Rahman mosquito-busting at the drains in Mountbatten.<br><br>That's his first job. It might start early - at 6.30am - and be physically exhausting, especially for a 54-year-old like him.<br><br>But to supplement his income (he earns $47 per day for this job), he has a second job polishing floors at a factory in Chai Chee.<br><br>There, he makes about $22 per day.<br><br>So at 1pm, when others head for their lunch break, Kamar rushes (by bicycle) from Mountbatten to his Eunos flat, changes out of his sweaty clothes and gobbles down lunch.<br><br>By 3pm, the second half of his day begins.<br><br>I was exhausted. It had felt like the end of a long day after combing Mountbatten's drains for six hours in the hot sun.<br><br>But now, I had to get ready, not just physically but also mentally, for the start of another 'working day'.<br><br>So, this is what having two jobs feels like. You need stamina.<br><br>Polishing floors looked easier, though. But when I tried it, the polishing machine ran off like a runaway train.<br><br>It took quite a bit of strength and skill to control it.<br><br>Mr Seah yawns as he follows Kamar on his bus ride home after working for 14 hours.<br>That was why I was surprised when Kamar told me he has a 71-year-old worker who does it, working the midnight shift from 11pm to 7am!<br><br>On Sundays, Kamar's only day off from his mozzie-busting job, Kamar works both shifts at the factory. That's from 7am to 11pm straight!<br><br>What keeps you going, I asked Kamar.<br><br>'I like to keep things clean,' he said.<br><br>We polished the sprawling factory floor, square foot by little square foot.<br><br>Dinner was prata kosong, Kamar's usual, at a nearby kopitiam.<br><br>The work reminded me of the days when I worked part-time in a launderette, a stock take agency and a kitchen.<br><br>MUNDANE WORK<br><br>The hours were long, the work exhausting. It could also be numbingly mundane. This was, perhaps, the biggest challenge.<br><br>After dinner, the hours rolled by slowly. Outside, people were probably already home from work.<br><br>We finally called it a day just before 11pm.<br><br>Outside, the street was deserted. The evening breeze felt good against our sweaty bodies.<br><br>It had been a long day. At a hawker centre, we had a bottle of beer each.<br><br>Kamar usually does this once every five days. It helps control his temper, he said.<br><br>Once a month, he treats himself to a Guinness stout, with a raw egg thrown in to give him strength.<br><br>His other luxury, or necessity in his opinion, is cigarettes. He smokes two packs a day.<br><br>Kamar said he sleeps three to four hours every night. I was shocked.<br><br>To me, these two days had been tough. But I have weekends (and annual leave) to look forward to. Although weekends are usually packed with grassroots activities, they do offer some respite.<br><br>A daily-rated worker like Kamar hardly takes days off. Any day off is a day's wages lost. Every day is the same.<br><br>But Kamar said he can't see himself not working.<br><br>He already has plans: When he's too old for the factory, he hopes to clean the Eunos MRT station.<br><br>It'll be close to this house. He won't have to travel.<br><br>'Old already, never mind. I can work slowly,' he said.<br><br>If you would like to contribute to the Amalgamated Union of Public Daily Rated Workers (AUPDRW)'s bursary and welfare fund, please e-mail aupdrw@ntuc.org.sg<br><br></div>
