              <p>i knew this HK couple fairly close, and they had lived in bishan in the lat 90s to early 2000s. sold their hdb flat and made a bundle, then move to australia to settle permanently.</p>
              <p>husband studied theology to become a pastor and wife is a high flying professional. reason of leaving? son is turing 14.</p>
              <p>lets face it. their decision is neither immoral nor illegal. it is just a chess of game to play based on different set of countries that give them different set of opportunities. so they played and when the time is up, they clear off one stage and move onto another. simple.</p>
              <p>and i can tell u, the HKers NEVER cut ties from the HK. coz they know HK is an entrance back to China, recognising that China is a economy superpower both now and in the future, they want their children to have access back to China too.</p>
