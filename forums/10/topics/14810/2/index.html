Show proof, we assisst. No proof=no assist. Its the same for all other countries not just the Arab ones. Regarding the religion issue, thats what religious schools are for..and I'm not talking about madrasahs..its this 'tuition' sort of thing. It can be at a neighbours house or the mosque. Plus, every Friday theres a 'sermon'. And there are regular mosque activities. If you want to know more, go visit a mosque or go to an Islamic bookshop.<br><br>Regarding the intrepetration issue, thats what I was arguing about. These extremists interprete the Qu'ran biasedly and convinced people they are rite. Thats why they must be exterminated. but veri hardlah..lots of polictics going on..The Islamic leaders got little support cuz some of their people think terrorists are heroes or something. Thats my opinion..dunno whether thats true.<br><br>&gt;&gt;while you and dozens of islamic nations with populations in the hundred of millions who claimed to be the true and good muslims just sit back and just talk and talk and more talk......?<br><br>wah..hundred of millions. I dun think that much cuz their life expectancy realli veri short but still cannotlah.. most of them find it hard to survive let alone fight. Their economy really very bad. Maybe they talk alot..cuz they want to settle things through diplomacy ? Cuz war doesnt settle who is right or wrong, just who is left.</div>

If they do that, they will lower themselves to the standard of the terrorists. What they should do is to serve out justice and justice is served with proof.<br><br>&gt;&gt;To those who find the United States  distasteful and unfair.
