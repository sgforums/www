            <div class='col-md body'>In view of the latest development in the World Trade Centre in New York, is Singapore taking any pre-emptive measures to ensure that such disaster will not happen to the financial district in Shenton Way. What a terrorist need to bring down the Singapore financial district is just hijacking a Boeing 747 and fly stright into it to demolish it! Singapore has taken more than a decade to build it but it just takes a couple of hours for an outlaw to demolish it!Is Singapore taking any chances?</div>

I remember reading abt an Israeli minister visiting Singapore, creating an upstir among the local Muslims. This is a minor incident, compared to a full-blown jihad. Therefore, I also have doubts that they will support us in such an incident.

            <div class='col-md body'>NEARLY 13 years ago, then Singapore Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew triggered a debate about Malay loyalty with televised comments he made before a university audience (December 1986). Lee stated that the government had taken two opinion polls prior to and following the visit of Israeli President Chiam Herzog (November 1986) to the republic.<br><br>The poll found that the number of Malay respondents who were not against the visit fell sharply from one poll to the next, while the proportion of non-Malays who did not oppose the visit rose marginally.<br><br>Lee interpreted this to mean that "in certain circumstances, the Malay Singaporeans react with the emphasis on Malay/Muslim rather than Singaporean.<br><br>An article in the Far Eastern Economic Review Asia 1998 Yearbook (pg 222f) says, "To Lee this came down to a question of loyalty : "Are we sure that in a moment of crisis, when the heat is on, we are all together heart to heart? I hope so. But we ought to have a fallback position and quickly fill up all the missing hearts if some go missing."<br><br>The same article says, "In February 1987, Lee's son commented further on the status of the Malays in an open forum on why Malays do not hold sensitive positions in the armed forces. Explaining that there are no Malay fighter pilots, for example, because their religion might conflict with their duty to Singapore, he provoked a backlash of criticism from the Muslim community in addition to Singapore's Muslim neighbours."<br><br>The article goes on to say, "these statements represented some of the most frank public commentaries ever made by Singapore's political leaders on the role of the Malays, which continues to stir emotions among the Malay community."<br><br>As recently as September 18, Mr Lee, speaking at a Singapore 21 forum said, the reality is that while Singapore has made progress in integrating the different races, certain emotional bonds are instinctive and cannot be removed overnight. (Straits Times September 19, 1999)<br><br>Asked by a polytechnic student if Singapore could overcome this and become a nation, Mr Lee said: "Yes, I think so, over a long period of time and selectively. We must not make an error.<br><br>"If, for instance, you put in a Malay officer who's very religious and who has family ties in Malaysia in charge of a machine gun unit, that's a very tricky business.<br><br>"We've got to know his background. I'm saying these things because they are real, and if I didn't think that, and I think even if today the Prime Minister doesn't think carefully about this, we could have a tragedy."<br><br>"So, these are problems which, as poly students, you're colour-blind to, but when you face life in reality, it's a different proposition."<br><br>Reports in the Singapore media this year refuting Indonesian Presidents Habibie's remarks in February that Singapore was racist because Malays could not become military officers only stated that there are Malay officers in the armed forces.<br><br>The reports made no reference to the documented remarks (above) of the two Lees regarding Malay loyalty.<br><br>The reports also did not state:<br><br>1. if Malays hold sensitive positions in the armed forces;<br>2. if any Malay officers in the Singapore air force are fighter pilots; and<br>3. if the Lees have changed their expressed position regarding loyalty of the Malays.<br>While meritocracy is still maintained in the island and the Singapore armed forces appoints and promotes Malays, there is no evidence that Malay Singaporeans hold sensitive positions in the Singapore armed forces.  <a href="http://www.singapore-window.org/sw99/90915loy.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.singapore-window.org/sw99/90915loy.htm</a><br><br>------------------<br>'Tis better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all. -- Alfred Lord Tennyson</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think the problem herein lies in the fact that some pple fail to differentiate the Islamic extremists and normal Muslims. We do not condone the violent acts that they have done and do not justify it in any way. People tend to forget that there are quite a number of Muslims in the WTC since Islam is the fastest growing religion in the US. We grieve for the live losts whether Muslim or not as we place the same value on each live no matter what their social status is. I also pity the terrorists who had lost their lives because they will not go to heaven as they are led to believe but will rott in hell. Muslims may not be afraid of dying but they are afraid of going to hell.<br><br>I also like to point out that the attack is not an act of jihad. The word has been misused by the public and the terrorists in their bid to recruit more pple. There are many aspects to Jihad and one of them is war in Allah's cause. Since Islam specifically condemn this terrorist act..this is not a jihad as it is not in Allah's cause.

We grieve for the live losts whether Muslim or not as we place the same value on each live no matter what their social status is.

They had blamed the Middle East for the Oklahoma bombing yet it was their own citizen that did it.

Why do you think the US is pressing for Osama to be handed over?<br><br>The point that the US is trying to drive is, "fuck with us and you DIE."  The events of September 11, clearly showed someone fucked the US big time.  The US policy now is not directed at ONLY muslim terrorism, but ANY form of terrorism that threaten's Global Peace and security.<br><br>Regarding the Malay/Muslim issue, I feel the local Muslim community, those who are citizens of Singapore, should attempt to distinguish and stand out apart from the global muslim community.  They should attempt to lead the world's muslim community rather than listening and reacting to the gibberish uttered by untrustable external sources.
