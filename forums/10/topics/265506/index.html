            <div class='col-md body'>I'm still not comfortable with hijacking another person's thread, so I'm reply here.<br><blockquote>What are the countries you are using for comparison (those that are less stable)? Israel? Iraq? Iran? Afghanistan? North Korea? Is the demographics (population composition) the same? If our MM, SM and PM are so capable, they should go over Indonesia and help transform them into first world economies with third world civil liberties</blockquote>I am comparing in general to the entire world. Yes the demographics are different but are there 2 states in the world with identical demographics? I mean at this point in time, you are not disputing that Singapore is a stable country right? Base on conscience, if you grew up in Singapore, did you perceive yourself to be in a safe place?<br><br><blockquote>When you make such comparison, you are also stating that the poor and untalented of Singapore are not able to migrate too. Isn't it the same as the other countries. Most mainland Chinese are able to migrate because of cash? Are you sure? Do you have any statistics to prove it? I have some mainland Chinese friends, the majority of them are working class FTs who has a basic degree from China. I know of hawkers who are PRs in Singapore too. If everybody in Singapore has the ability to migrate, then I will give the ruling party credit, else it's just the same as the any other third world country. </blockquote>Yes, it's the same with regards to the fact that poor and untalented people are often unable to migrate to better places unless claiming refugee status. But Singapore has a higher percentage of people that are eligible for migration. But I got this tru deduction rather than factual statistic, which of course mean I could be wrong, but I could also be right, and perhaps you want to correct me tru means of either deduction or statistics. (The deduction was: take for eg. the point system form of migration, the hosting country requires new migrants to reach a certain point to gain PR status. And every certain amount of cash you bring in will earn you some point and the higher your education or other professional qualification will also earn you more points. Singapore has higher percentage of people who received tertiary education (recognised internationally ones) and we are also richer (based on GDP per capita) which therefores allows more of us to have higher points and thus better means of migration.)<br><br><blockquote>Hypothetically, if I take over the government tomorrow and declare my pay to be $1 billion a year. In your words, being paid with a high salary is not corrupt because it's legal. Hell! I run the government and the judiciary, anything I say goes, if it's not legal, I can make it legal through parliament. The principles of legality depends on who is in government. When Thaksin was PM of Thailand, everything he did was legal, when he was ousted, he is corrupted. Care to explain the concept of legality in such a case?</blockquote>Yes, you are right. Legally speaking, if you are the sole dictator of the country and you overthrew all form of constitution, which basically means you make and judge your own laws, everything you do would be legal, though not necessarily moral. Corruption is against the law, greed is against moral. Hence the election process to allow people to change a govt that really pisses everybody off. The fact that PAP had not been defeated may not necessarily means that there's no way to defeat them via election means, it just mean they haven't pissed enough people off.<br><br>Interestingly, how do you know for sure that Thaksin is corrupted? Did he tell you? Did any Judge make a ruling? Innocent until proven guilt is the rule of law and until he is convicted, it is not correct to say he is corrupt. And if I'm not wrong, his charges were tax evasion, which is a crime nevertheless, but is not the same as corruption.<br><br><blockquote>Some robbers are a result of circumstances, no work, no money to survive. But what about robbers that are paid millions? What do you call that? Greed? Greed is not a result of circumstances. </blockquote>Robbers that are paid millions? Hmmm.... if they are paid, then they didn't rob, if they didn't rob, they are not robbers.... Greed is not a result of circumstance, but how much is too much? What is the amount the people can take before being called greed? If desire for material items such as money is called greed (tan), is desire for non-tangible things such as fame not greed too? If over desire for all tangible and non-tangible items are greed, then is insatisfiable desire for freedom a form of greed as well?<br><br><blockquote>Minimum amount? When you are displease with your family members in your house, can you voice your displeasure, if you are a big family can you gather all your family members to voice your displeasure at your parents? Singapore is your home, can you voice your displeasure in a group?</blockquote>I believe that you are doing so already.<br><br><blockquote>Irresponsible journalism? That is for you to prove</blockquote> do not assume that your point of view is always right, everybody has their own views on issue. What might be right to you might not be right for others. A cliche would be "One Man's Meat is Another Man's Poison". This would prove that your views are limited to only your own, only your view is correct, others are wrong.[/quote]<br><br>Some example of irresponsible journalism.  The case of Lani Guinier where she was demonised, misquoted and mis-interpretated by most media to such extent where her nomination by Clinton to be the Assistant Attorney General was withdrawn without a public hearing. Her popularity was so damaged by irresponsible journalism that she could never explained herself clearly. She had to try to clear her own name by publishing a book "The Tyranny of the Majority", but by then it was too late and she never took public office.<br><br>During the Katrina incident, various media reports describe New Orleans to be an "all hell-loose" city. Rapes, plunder and such incidents were reported to be happening all the time and everywhere; public servants such as the police and military were heavily criticised for their inability.

So you telling us that it's alright to be greedy in monetary terms. I think greed for non-tangible forms is more tolerated, because money is a scarce resource, you use it to make daily needs (e.g. food, housing, transport, etc), obviously you cannot have unlimited money unlike fame.

"They have M16s and are locked and loaded. These troops know how to shoot and kill and I expect they will," Louisiana Governor Kathleen Blanco said. Congressman Bill Jefferson (D-LA) told ABC News: "There was shooting going on. There was sniping going on.

What I'm trying to explain here is that corruption and greed are two different things, the former being a legal concept while the latter is a moral concept.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><blockquote>That is true, Singapore is number one in terms of our pay to our top public administrators (including but not exclusively, our ministers). Although that doesn't automatically mean that the reason of controlling corruption becomes an excuse. The pretext of pay increase was that "the original pay was not high enough for a person of that talent and social level", not simply "the pay was not high". And so the consideration was to benchmark their pay against other people of the same talent and social level. Now you may say that that is the wrong reason to consider or that the reason is flawed in some way, but it cannot be simply dismissed as an excuse to increase their income for if it's only money they are after, there are various means to do so without having to come up front about it. </blockquote></strong><br><br>And what makes you think the other ways have not been accounted for?<br><br>The difference here is if we should really be encouraging excess in the name of pragmatism in our leaders while at the same time the people are encouraged to take more cuts and hits.<br><br>Is this really in line with the spirit of proper leadership? Or prehaps the recent NKF saga has been forgotten by you? Durai actually did very few illegal things, but the main outcry was over the morality of his actions.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><blockquote>No, that's not what I'm saying. What I'm trying to explain here is that corruption and greed are two different things, the former being a legal concept while the latter is a moral concept. What I'm saying is therefore is that you can say that they are greedy because that is subjective, but you can't say they are corrupt because that has to be objective in accordance to the law. I'm not saying what they did was right, I'm just emphasising that it's not against the law, period! (If you would like, I'm using something like Gongsun Long Zi's white horse theory's approach) </blockquote></strong><br><br>Did anybody say it's against the law to begin with? That's you own wanting to force arguments that never existed into the debate.<br><br>What people are pointing out is that the concept of corruption extends beyond what is legally defined. And what's more, they are pointing out that it is disasterous to run any nation (that has respect for its people) based only on what is legaly acceptable without following the <span style="font-style: italic;">spirit</span> of the law. Laws are worthless without their spirit, and this is a very pratical issue and not just mere idealism.<br><br>And FYI morality is not subjective, but an absolute thing. What we humans think about absolute right or wrong does not change the nature of it.<br><br>The bottom line is this: Regardless of the law, is the pay hike justified or not? If not, don't have to split hairs over what is legal or not.</div>
