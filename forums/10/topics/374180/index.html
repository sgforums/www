              refer to the replies by the Housing and Development Board (HDB) to the
              various letters in the Straits Times forum page over the past few
              weeks. (See below)</p>
              <p>I also refer to media reports (“<a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporebusinessnews/view/449326/1/.html">SGX mainboard-listed BBR secures S$104.2m HDB contract</a>”,
              ChannelNewsAsia, Aug 17) Channelnewsasiaarticlehdbcontract_com.mht that
              Singapore Exchange’s mainboard-listed BBR Holdings has secured a
              S$104.2-million contract from the Housing &amp; Development Board (HDB)
              to build seven blocks of flats in Yishun Neighbourhood 4.</p>
              <p>The work comprises 864 homes, a Child Care Centre, a roof garden,
              communal amenities and site works, as well as contingency works.</p>
              <p>Since there will be 864 HDB flats, the average cost per flat,
              inclusive of communal amenities, site works and contingency works, is
              about $120,602 ($104.2 million divided by 864 flats).</p>
              <p>With the latest HDB new 4-room flats at Punggol (Punggol Residences
              BTO) selling at an average price of $293,000 (price range of $264,000
              to $322,000 divided by 2), does it mean that the HDB stands to make a
              profit of about $172,398 per flat, or a profit margin of about 143 per
              cent?</p>
              <p>According to the report “Application for Additional Housing Grant doubled since HDB  enhanced scheme (CNA, Sep 1), it said:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><em>“Since the additional housing grant scheme was
              introduced in 2006, the government has disbursed $251 million to more
              than 16,000 households”.</em></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>So, does it mean that the estimated profits from just one BTO
              project (about $149 million) as discussed above, may be enough to cover
              about 59 per cent of the total disbursement from 2006 to now, for the
              additional housing grant scheme?</p>

              <p>I guess in Singapore it's different, because the government is a profit motivated entity just like all the big corporations.</p>
              <p>In <strong>other</strong> governments, the surpluses are used to finance public works and social services to increase marginal social benefits. In Singapore, the $300 billion reserves are used to set up Temasek and GIC, so that he can get his family and friends to be CEO and lose $100 billion in investment value. The income derived from the citizens isn't returned to the citizens but used to benefit family and friends.</p>

              <p>I am abit skeptical of the figures provided by HDB and BBR.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Why?</p>
              <p>A 1000 square feet <strong>private</strong> apartment (<strong>land, construction cost and profit</strong>) in Malaysia KL <strong>sells at</strong> RM$198,000 (SG$ 80,784). HDB per flat <strong>construction cost</strong> is SG$121,000, <strong>a discrepancy of SG$40,000</strong> (ie if you don't include the land price and profit for the developer in the KL project).</p>
              <p>We are not even using Malaysian labourers, shouldn't HDB cost be even cheaper than SG$80,000. I am sure Banglas and PRCs cost a fraction of the Malaysian labourers. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>Are you sure HDB didn't include the cost of afew multi-storey car park (also monsoon drains, overhead bridges) to the contract to inflate the cost? (So as to show you they are not making that much from you)</p>
              <p>The terms "<strong>inclusive of communal amenities, site works and contingency works</strong>" looks abit suspicious. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thank ARPANET for bringing internet to the world, else I can be easily deceived into believing anything. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Does the government have 100% duties on sand, cement, iron and tiles?</p>

              <p>After more then 30 over years of questioning, the PAP Government has never given a straight answer as to the cost of building an HDB block of flat.</p>
              <p>Chiam See Tong had clashed with Mah Bow Tan on this issue, but had never taken up the challenge from Mah Bow Tan - to build an HDB estate, as Mah had refused to allow Chiam the same set of conditions that HDB was given.</p>
              <p>Mah had insisted that the land cost should be based on market price which would have torpedoed Chiam's costings, as the land cost to HDB is based on some formula that will be reflected in the accounts of the various government agencies and HDB, so that every agency will show profit from the transaction on the land used. </p>
              <p>Afterall, market price becomes meaningless when the land has been repossessed from Singaporean lease holders with compensation calculated on a fraction of prevailing market rate.</p>
              <p>Finally, from a statutory requirement for a Main Board Listed Company to declare income that can affect the profit performance of the company - Singaporeans will get some insight into the cost of building the HDB unit.</p>

In Singapore, the $300 billion reserves are used to set up Temasek and GIC, so that he can get his family and friends to be CEO and lose $100 billion in investment value.

              <h1>Cost of building HDB flats – finally an answer?</h1>
              <div>
              <p>Wednesday, 2 September 2009, 12:36 pm</p>

              <p><strong>Leong Sze Hian</strong></p>
              <p><img style="float: left; margin: 13px; border: black 3px solid;" src="http://i140.photobucket.com/albums/r19/theonlinecitizen/Pictures%20Posted%20on%20TOC/Housing/tp.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="220">I refer to the replies by the Housing and Development Board (HDB) to the various letters in the Straits Times forum page over the past few weeks. (See below)</p>
              <p>I also refer to media reports (“<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporebusinessnews/view/449326/1/.html">SGX mainboard-listed BBR secures S$104.2m HDB contract</a>”, ChannelNewsAsia, Aug 17) Channelnewsasiaarticlehdbcontract_com.mht that Singapore Exchange’s mainboard-listed BBR Holdings has secured a S$104.2-million contract from the Housing &amp; Development Board (HDB) to build seven blocks of flats in Yishun Neighbourhood 4.</p>
              <p>The work comprises 864 homes, a Child Care Centre, a roof garden, communal amenities and site works, as well as contingency works.</p>
              <p>Since there will be 864 HDB flats, the average cost per flat, inclusive of communal amenities, site works and contingency works, is about $120,602 ($104.2 million divided by 864 flats).</p>
              <p>With the latest HDB new 4-room flats at Punggol (Punggol Residences BTO) selling at an average price of $293,000 (price range of $264,000 to $322,000 divided by 2), does it mean that the HDB stands to make a profit of about $172,398 per flat, or a profit margin of about 143 per cent?</p>
              <p>According to the report “Application for Additional Housing Grant doubled since HDB  enhanced scheme (CNA, Sep 1), it said:</p>
              <p>So, does it mean that the estimated profits from just one BTO project (about $149 million) as discussed above, may be enough to cover about 59 per cent of the total disbursement from 2006 to now, for the additional housing grant scheme?</p>

              <p>We are over paying for a lease. Some mature estates are priced so ridicuslously with 70-80 years lease left.  As the article mentioned, when we buy a HDB we sign a <strong>Tenancy/Lease Agreement </strong>not a <strong>Sales and Purchase Agreement</strong> for private properties. Yet we are expected to pay so much for the leases because most of the land supply are owned by the govt, which were forcibly bought at a cheap price in the 1970s <strong>in the name of providing affordable public housing.</strong></p>

              <p>Perhaps someone could question HDB, how they derive the sum $56700 for their MUP program.</p>
              <p>And how the HDB valuations have been carried out? And who carried out the HDB valuations? And how endorsed the amount? Does the valuations factored in the age of the flat, estate?</p>
              <p>I have looked for a 3rm flat in 2007, it was quoted as $170000. As I do not have a stable job, and I believe in a year time I should have sufficient savings and cpf to pay a lump sum for that flat. Unfortunately the same flat had risen to $250000.</p>
              <p>Why work hard and saves on every pennies? I had lose out to those who simply buy and sell their apartments.</p>

              <p>For those who are still young, I would advise to marry early and buy a new HDB flat (at your capability). And if you need enrol into universities, still buy a new HDB flat first as soon, ask your rich daddy or mummy to finance your housing loan first. In 4 years time, you will probably have some capital to start your own business.</p>

              <p><br>Marry early?? U must be joking, why get ourselve tied up so early, got so much years to play and have fun, beside today guys also dun earn as much as us, and most are those lame and weak types, cannot stand the hardship of life, i am certainly not going to loose my youth spending time with these guys. Why buy HDB, aim higher in life, get a free hold land or condo, it is much more worthy.</p>

              <p>All that we have endured and are experiencing now is cos we are stuck with a one-party system, a muzzled press n media.</p>

              <p>There are many detractors who discourage or even frown upon such a stance.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>To some peoples, what is so wrong about HDB being expensive, it is more affordable than HK, giving the land space we have here..and more over, you can gain from it after selling it and upgrade to a bigger house. In account term, this is an asset on an going concern, meaning you exchange your cash for an asset that is expanding, and you can also rent out yr asset to earn more money while the asset is expanding, there is simply no liability in purchasing a HDB, the only thing is the 99 years leasing, which in most cases, HDB would have enblocked it before 50 years.  </p></div>
