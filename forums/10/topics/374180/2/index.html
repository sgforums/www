To cut to the chase, the answer is: ‘mostly made.'</p>

              <h3>Leaders are Always Made</h3>
              <p>Leadership can be learned by anyone with the basics. But an awful lot of leadership cannot be taught.</p>
              <p>That's because leadership is an apprentice trade. Leaders learn about 80 percent of their craft on the job.</p>

              <p>To some peoples, what is so wrong about HDB being expensive, it
                      is more affordable than HK, giving the land space we have here..and
                      more over, you can gain from it after selling it and upgrade to a
                      bigger house. In account term, this is an asset on an going

                      expanding, and you can also rent out yr asset to earn more money
                      while the asset is expanding, there is simply no liability in
                      purchasing a HDB, the only thing is the 99 years leasing,

              <p>any facts or statistics to back your statements that public housing is more expensive in HongKong?  Do you work in HDB and know the future enbloc policy or is it written anywhere in the tenancy and lease agreement from HDB?</p>

              <p>Hong Kong has a similar CPF system, it's called MPF (Mandatory Provident Fund), the only difference is that it's not like the CPF which gives you a fixed 3% interest rate.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Members are given financial advice so they can better manage their retirement fund, it's not a cheap source of funds for the government like Singapore. The HK government also provides a guarantee to the funds invested in MPF.</p>

              <p>Were the infrastrature and money for land acquisition not funded by the citizen's money, especially CPF which they were forced to save at 40-50% of their salary to build these infrastrature?</p>
              <p>Is it right forcibly acquire these land when the owners refused to sell them? And if they are acquired at such cheap prices and infrastrature funded with the citizens CPF/funds, is it right to charge Singaporeans at such high prices?</p>

              <p>Yes, how much did the Government spend on land compensation when they robbed property owners at below market rates, when previously they will use market rates to calculate Property Tax ? </p>
              <p>What does a lion know about property when its home is a simple hole anywhere that it can find to fit itself into ?</p>
              <p>Can there be any value with your hole ?</p>

              <p>Can you offer a better case to justify the high prices of HDB units that are built as part of Nation Building plan ?</p>
              <p>If you have no expertise in Urban Planning as part of nation building, it is best that you stay out of the controversies in justifying the high HDB Public Housing with the capital costs of supporting infrastructures.</p>
