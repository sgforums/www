            <div class='col-md body'>Please note that Malays are a race and Islam is a religion. Theres no such thing as a Malays' Mosque. It might be built by malays but its for use for all races. I guess the reaction that the Muslims (followers of Islam) get is quite understandable seeing how people do not think rationally when they are too emotional. However, like most other races, the Malays opinions on this matter differs from each individual. Some people (including other races) even believe that US brought this upon themselves as they were too 'nosey' and imposed their powers on other country. But Malay or not, I think everybody would grieve for those lost lives.

            <div class='col-md body'>Just to let you know I dun support the Taliban or any form of extremists. They have some really barbaric laws and they dun treat women rite.<br><br>I agree its hard to differentiate as theres not much media on them. You cant really see things from their perspective. Politics and religion is really a bad combo. My opinion is that the Islamic leaders and scholars dun get much support from the people as the people dun see them doing anything much..while they think that the terrorists are risking their lives for them. In that sense theres really very little things going on that actually concerns religion but more of politics.<br><br>I still think the Palestinians dancing around was a biased perspective. If a camera was in a backstreet boys concert, you cant just deduce that all teenage girls like the backstreet boys can you? What about those in their homes?

They are afterall just children.<br><br>I can assure that no Muslims think that the civilians deserve their death but there are people that think that US should share part of the blame becuz of the attack.

So just dun think that Muslims hate US becuz we're Muslims and they're not. There must be some reasons.<br><br>Anyway, read this article found by fireice.

            <div class='col-md body'>Can anyone enlighten me on the local Muslims' seemingly dislike for the US and their support for the Islam fundamentalists? Is it due to American intervention in the Middle East Islamic states? If it is not so, why is it that the people of other religions in Singapore tend to side with the US, even if they r not Christians? I find the messages on IRC Galaxynet #USA totally repulsive, as they tend to portray the US negatively. In my opinion, I feel that even if local Muslims don't sympathise with the Americans, they should not discriminate and condemm the Americans. If u MUSLIMS out there really show such an intense hatred for the Americans, it may be better for you to abandon capitalism in Singapore and become an Afghanistan Citizen. After all, its Mullah has envisioned it to become the perfect Islamic State.<br><br>Goodwill and peace to all mankind.<br><br>------------------<br>'Tis better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all. -- Alfred Lord Tennyson</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Simple. There a few ways to eradicate ur enemy. One, u cut off the head.  Removing the leadership of the army.  Two, removing the arms, crippling the enemy's ability to fight.  Three, attack his dick, *bullshit, reducing his chances of reproducing.*  Four, Cutting off his legs, effectively, destroying all forms of logistics support and training for his troops.<br><br>Hence, this option is number 4.  Destroying the bases in afghanistan, housin training camps.  Anything that stands in the way, well too bad.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Shotgun (edited 23 September 2001).]</div>
