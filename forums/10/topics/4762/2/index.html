            <div class='col-md body'>As I have mentioned before, in the midst of all of tripwire's vehemance and angst, any peace-loving Muslim would agree with him in condemning the acts of these terrorists.<br><br>The terrorists' mission is simple and vicious. They not only abuse religion to fulfill their own ends, they also pull all Muslims into the trap. What trap? You might ask.<br><br>Well, in using religion, the terrorists have wittingly caused a divide to open between the Muslims and the non-Muslims. Who are their victims? Why, Muslims and non-Mulims alike. You see, any society which is not well-integrated, whose racial mix lives in deep distrust with each other, will experience this dreadful schism. Non-Muslims will begin to persecute and blame the Muslims for the acts of a minority, and the Muslims will have no choice but to defend themselves. I am not envisioning a war, though, God forbid! My point is, the trap that these terrorists lay is not only a physical one, but also a psychological one.<br><br>People who refuse to see that it is the Muslims who have failed Islam, rather than Islam failing Muslims have no choice but to promote a campaign of intolerance that is faintly akin to the Christian militant views of the Ku Klux Klan. Why were the Asians, Blacks, Hispanics and Jews murdered by the "white supremecists"? Simple reason, Jesus was a "white" man (how fallacious this belief is!).<br><br>It is important to understand that all religions preach tolerance and goodness. The Quran continually exhorts its followers to pursue peace until the end of days, how can this be taken as a religion of violence and terror? It is Osama's personal vendatta against "western civilisation" that has got Muslims all over the world so deeply troubled, and non-Muslims so hostile against the Muslims. In a way, the trap had been sprung. I only hope that the strong cohesion of the Singaporean way of life will be able to withstand these onslaughts.<br><br>As a Muslim, I categorically condemn the attacks that were laid out by that villian Osama. It is amusing to see people being indignant about this. I mean, they would think that hey, since I'm a Muslim, I should stick together with the terrorists and be one with them in heart, spirit and cause. Well, using this type of crooked logic, it would make perfect sense to also say that since I'm a Chinese, I'm also a fervent Communist. But that's not so. In this world, there are Chinese who believe in Communism, and Chinese who don't. I don't take the whole of China as a whole reflection of the race.<br><br>In the same vein, it is interesting to note that almost all of the Muslims who use the word 'jihad' are people who live in third-world countries, or in a nation stricken by war, poverty, corruption and a repressive government. Like the Chinese students who rose up in rebellion against the Communist regime in Tianamen Square, Muslim leaders have consistently used religion to unite the people in their cause. In effect, it is a rebellion very much like any rebellion, except that Muslim leaders abuse the name of Islam.<br><br>I would have to agree wholeheartedly with tripwire on that.<br><br>In Singapore, it is important to maintain a culture that transcends all faiths, all races. Hehe, doesn't mean that if I'm a Muslim, I'm a 'bumiputra' lover and a 'dog-hater'. My good sense recognises the mistakes of a system that is not based on meritocracy, and exults everytime Singapore excels in something, some branch of science or some niche in business. In Singapore, there is no need for a Muslim way, or a Christian way, or a Hindu way. The Singaporean way is enough, because it is the way of tolerance and patience. That is why I'm confident that no Muslim in Singapore would ever be "tricked" into the schemes of mad mullahs and crazy Osamas...<br><br>It only takes a little bit of brainpower to realise that as a human, I recognise the evil behind Osama's deeds. Take away my faith, and I will still see Osama as evil. I don't have to be a Muslim or a Hindu or a Christian to understand what evil means.<br><br>------------------<br>For a rollicking good time, come visit my homepage at: <a href="http://clik.to/pebble" rel="nofollow">http://clik.to/pebble</a><br><br>[This message has been edited by salivateforme (edited 24 September 2001).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I wish that life were so simple; if Islam were a religion that promoted ant-western feelings, it is very easy to eradicate the problem...wipe all Muslims out of the world...<br><br>hehe, unfortunately, you got the wrong end of the root. Whether the Palestinians are Muslim or not, they would still have cause to hate Israel and the United States.<br><br>It's the same thing for Lebanese Christians who join the Lebanese Liberation Army. It doesn't matter if they are Christian or not. They'll still wage their war to free Lebanon from Israel's occupation.<br><br>Terrorism is a result of the environment, not religion. It is unfortunate that some leaders, especially in the Middle-East, turn such political fights into religious fights. I do agree with you that this is an abuse of power; a purely human fault that transcends all faiths and creeds. Take Adolf Hitler and Slobodan Milosevic for example. They needed something to unite the people to their cause, so they used religion to stir up the feelings of the population. Hitler, Milosevic, Chairman Mao (who used Communism, of course) and Osama share the same bed. They are masters of propoganda, and their trap is a vicious one that affects everybody.  Create a divide between "US" and the "OTHER", and whip up the sentiments of "US" against the "OTHER"...and when "OTHER" retaliates, "US" will have fresh reasons to stay united and fight my bloody war.<br><br>As Singaporeans, let us not fall into this trap. Don't alienate our fellow citizens because then, our national pledge will be a farce. "Pledge ourselves as one united people, regardless of race, language or religion..."<br><br>I recited the pledge many times in school, and then during my NS days where I shared the same shit with Chinese, Indian and Malay soldiers. I mean to stick by it...<br><br>Again, I reiterate my Muslim position that Osama should be brought to justice. What he did was reprehensible beyond measure, and goes against every grain of Islam.<br><br>Stereotypes never work, and indeed sow the seeds for future conflict. I share your anger, your pain and indignance for the innocent lives lost in New York. Make no mistake about that. And I share America's pressing desire to wipe out the terrorist's elements in the world.<br><br>------------------<br>For a rollicking good time, come visit my homepage at: <a href="http://clik.to/pebble" rel="nofollow">http://clik.to/pebble</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Okay, i'm gonna sound very stupid if this does not happen.  But some guy who claims to have a vision, says that China will be the target of terrorism.  Next.<br><br>He said that the Great wall will be one of the first targets, as well as having other targets in Beijing.<br><br>I don't know of any current active militia groups in China, but there ARE some muslim militants severely oppressed there, that is a fact which I know.<br><br>I'd rather feel stupid than have this realise.  But I have a feeling that he might be correct.<br><br>Also, muslim radicals in Indonesia and Malaysia has also been stirred up.  They may be plotting some other attempts @ destabilising the region. I remind you guys once again, Singapore is caught between these 2, and i suspect we might become a target.  Singapore is not alone, Thailand too may become a target, as there are already known militant groups there.<br><br>The shit is about to hit the fan, people.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmmn..not sure if the Muslims in the Xinjiang province have connections to the terrorist's network. I certainly hope not. The Great Wall of China is a treasure, and it would be terrible if it is targeted by bombing...but i don't think that the terrorist's style...their goal is to target as many civilian losses as possible.<br><br>Anyway, it is truly frightening if Malaysian and Indoneisan radicals spilled over into Singapore. The double-trap I mentioned earlier is going to be sprung. Innocent Muslims in Singapore may become the targets of hate-crimes, and then some of them will be pushed into defending themselves. Which means they will have no choice but to join the radicals. Not because they share the radicals' ideology, but because the community is alienated from the rest of society.<br><br>This is just speculation, of course. I sincerely hope that this will not happen. Whatever it is, I think it's important Singaporeans pull together and defend our way of life, not as Malay, Chinese or Indian, but as peace-lovers.<br><br>------------------<br>For a rollicking good time, come visit my homepage at: <a href="http://clik.to/pebble" rel="nofollow">http://clik.to/pebble</a></div>

In SINGAPORE, we're actually VERY FORTUNATE to be in such CLOSE CONTACT with our DIFFERENT RACES and RELIGION followers.... Somehow the DEVELOPMENT of the TOLERANCE is NOT easy... But WE DID IT...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>The MORE IMPORTANT thing I guess for now would be to continue to keep up with the GOOD WORK and APPRECIATE the RICH CULTUREs of the others... I MEAN... People CHOOSE what they wanna do and believe in... We should learn to RESPECT them and NOT DISCRIMINATE AGAINST them.... Only then would we be able to EARN the EQUAL RESPECT in return and UPHOLD the BALANCE.... We're SENSIBLE people in Singapore and certainly won't MISTAKE a MUSLIM for a TERRORIST... Or even a MUSLIM for another OSAMA....<br><br>ONCE AGAIN, GREAT WORK SINGAPOREANS!<br><br>------------------<br>In LIGHT I shall FEAR NOT. FOR what I AM is CUT so DEEP inside of ME.<br>I LIVE my FLESH and SOUL ONLY to BLEED for the OTHERS.<br>FEAR ME NOT. FOR I AM YOUR 'MASTER'. GIVE YOU STRENGTH. FOR YOU ARE MY 'ENEMY'.<br>DEVIL PHRASE I<br><br>I have no 'friends' nor 'family'.<br>I hold no past and see not future...<br>These are just samples of illusions....<br>I don't exist, but I shall live ETERNITY.....  DEVIL PHRASE II<br><br>Though NOT the RIGHT thing to do,<br>This might be the ONLY NATURAL thing to be...<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Just like heat</span> is produced when work done...<br><span style="font-style: italic;">EVIL</span> is the GENERATION of SYSTEM FLAWS... <strong>DEVIL PHRASE III</strong><br><br>In DREAMS you CAN NEVER DIE.....<br>For YOUR LIFE is about the EXISTENCE of....<br>Your Happiness.... Your Sadness... Your Pain.... Your Pleasure....<br>Like a painted sky, when it rains... All CEASE to BE...    DEVIL PHRASE IV<br><br>When Law &amp; Rules are there,<br>they are NOT about JUSTICE.<br>While reality &amp; dreams are there,<br>they are NOT about SURVIVAL..<br><br>And Life &amp; Death NOT about LIVING...<br>Good &amp; Evil NOT about definitions....<br><br>IF truly there is EVIL, it is NOT just one of its kind......<br><br>DEVIL'S SEVENTH PHRASE<br><br>ÃŸe COOL, NOT sÂ¢rrÂ¥....</div>
