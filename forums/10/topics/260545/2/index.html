Why? Because it is NOT something that is regarded by many as Clear &amp; Present Danger.<br><br>The problem with people is that they largely only react to something as tangible as a Tsunami, or a massive Earthquake or Hurricane. And the deadly thing about Global Warming, is that it is very slow and gradual - much like putting a live frog in a pot and turning up the heat every so slightly till it gets boiled alive without knowing it.<br><br>Global Warming is no joke. It can permanently alter our weather systems, sea level rises and geogrphy changes permanently. It will royally screw up the nature of things on Earth and catastrophes will wreak havoc on lives and World Economies.<br><br>But herein lies the big question; What can we do? Yes indeed, what the hell can we do?<br><br>Do you people seriously think, that China with the largest population on Earth will be concerned about Global Warming? I think not...<br><br>Already the weather in Singapore has become abnormal; rain and storms almost everyday from March into June/July?<br><br>I wonder where will Shenton Way be if the sea level rose 20 feet?<br><br></div></blockquote>Human beings by nature are reactive, not proactive.</div>
