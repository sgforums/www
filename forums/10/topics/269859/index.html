Just make sure that your father would not employ a philippino or indonesian maid in the house, or your brother would not marry a malaysian lady, then the foreigners would be right inside your house, what are you going to do?<br><br>Looking at your situation, if you feel sick of foreigners, it is your mindset problem. If you were to work in an MNC, and you find that you are the lowest pay, the lowest rank, the rest all expats from US or Uk, then you can start complaining.<br><br></div>
