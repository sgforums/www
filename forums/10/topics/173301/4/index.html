He re-instigated the Medisave and medishield CPF policies and lobbied for a greater percentile to be channelled from the ordinary acc. He has placed, on priority, more health schemes and payment terms to be tied to medisave accs, ensuring affordable costs for generic treatments and easing the burden on the older generation.<br><br>Contrary to your beliefs, polyclinic costs are still rated at very affordable prices for the general public. A general checkup for generic illnesses like fever or cough amounts to under $15/-. Again, if you have special requests for specific medication, then prices will rise accordingly. A standard blood test performed at a private institution will cost at least $10/- more than a polyclinic.<br><br>Again it depends on what you are testing your blood for.

Consultation came to 6 bucks (or was it 8?) and the medication a further 6~8 bucks. All in all, well below 20 bucks and i actually requested for a senior doc (the junior ones are quite inexperienced) and stronger medication (i.e. antibiotics against the doc's recommendation of cough mixture)<br><br>If you have different rates and have compared them against TTS, perhaps you could share them?
