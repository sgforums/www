Because Falungong preaches Truth, Benevolence and forbeareance, it had attracted at least a 100mil practitioners who wanted to lead the wholesome life it teaches. With so many practitioners, the communists are scared despite the fact that Master Li Hongzhi stated that any falungong members who dabble in politics are not his disciples. And of course, Communism do not tolerate spiritual belief.<br><br>In our universal, when there is good there bound to be bad. If there is Justice, there will still be evil. A world complete goodness would mean heaven and one of absolute evil will be hell. Hence this is not possible in human society.In other words, if you are good, evil people will still try to make trouble for you. A check of history text would tell you all gross injustices the communist government in China had commited. History will tell you that the Nazis under Hitler killed much less people than the communist. I am definitely not speaking up for Hitler but if you are disgusted with what he did, you would be more so if you know what is happening in China. Concentration camps are opened to steal human organs from live humans for black market profits.etc...........<br><br></div>

In reference to the tai chi group exercise things , those are elderly and middle age people participating in it without a cahoot about who belongs to what religion. That falungong group who I said was following my parents' tai chi group - the leader of that falungong group actually decided to challenge the person leading the tai chi one day showing off his "practice" . They had to disband tai chi for that morning because this group just won't let off . <strong> It does sound contradictory to the so called teachings of Truth forebearance etc of the falungong society , doesn't it? </strong><br><br>So Mr no more, anything to say about your fellow members' behaviours towards law abiding citizens.</div>

It may be a bit long and I hope most will bear with the length.<br><br>Most of the threads had demonstrated the powers of propaganda. A lot of people are willing to believe what they hear without questioning.  I donÂ’t expect many people to believe what I say because I am up against a powerful propaganda machine. For those who wish to know, here is the actual truth.<br><br>Master Li Hongzhi is not living in luxury. He actually lives in a humble house in USA. I can use rational reasons to explain why he could not be living in luxury. The teaching of Falungong is totally free of charge. Hence no money can be made. If Falungong is a cult, with its 100mil members, everybody giving their master a dollar would make him rich. But obviously he did not do it. Master Li Hongzhi is living by on revenues earned for the royalties on his books. By the way, all books can be downloaded for free on the Internet. Any profit-motivated people would never do such a thing. What Master Li Hongzhi is earning is a legitimate way of income. Zhuan Falun was a popular best seller. Why cant an author live by earnings from their royalties?<br><br>Perhaps, I may need to elaborate on the concept of what is a religion to answer fymkÂ’s doubts. Religions are more of rituals with heavy emphasis on what you can do and what not. Falungong does not have any of these. Its principles just state what a good person on the road of cultivation must do. If a person wants to leave, he can do so. No records are kept and strictly no money is to be accumulated. There is also no praying or worshipping at all. Emphasis is placed on how to be good and to abandon human attachments.<br><br>Maybe fymk is confused ( no offense meant) between Buddhism and the school of Buddhist laws( in chinese called Fo Fa). Buddhism refers to the religion founded in India by Lord Buddha. Lord Buddha himself had stated that there are 84000 methods to attain enlightenment in the Buddhist way. Lord BuddhaÂ’s way, which is one of the way is present day Buddhism. Falungong is also one of the 84000 methods. They are classified under the same family because of similar attributes but they are absolutely different methods.<br><br>This is also why you see falungong members distributing leaflets. One of the most significant attributes of the Buddhist law school is the idea of compassion. If you cultivate on way of Buddha and abandoning selfish human attachments, you will naturally and sincerely feel compassion for other living souls. Falungong member wish to inform people on the evils of now to discourage people from sinning. This is a very high level Buddhist law concept which I feel very hard to explain. You really need to cultivate compassion to understand this.<br><br>Master Li Hongzhi had strictly required his disciples to never think of him as a god. He wants his disciples to see him as a human.<br>(to be continued)<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by NUS_Superst@r:</div><div class="quote_body">"Falun Gong: homophobic mind control cult"<br>San Francisco Sentinal - Letter to the Editor/January 27, 2006<br>By Samuel Luo<br><br>My name is Samuel Luo and my parents are both Falun Gong practitioners who have been hurt and exploited by this cult. Among the many harms done to them, I have been seriously concerned that they have refused needed medical treatment. In 2002, my step-father initially refused help when he had a stroke and he has suffered painful gout attacks unnecessarily for five years. He did so because he was being brainwashed into believing that Li Hongzhi, the founder and leader of this cult has the power to cure illnesses and taking medicine is counter productive.<br><br>The Falun Gong is also extremely homophobic. Li teaches that homosexuality is not the standard of being human, the priority of Gods will be to eliminate homosexuals and that gays are demonic in nature. These teachings are honored by all Falun Gong practitioners. Recently when I confronted my mother with these teachings she said that the elimination of gays is already happening. When I wanted her to give specific examples she said that all the natural disasters that happened recently are directed at corrupt people, gays included.<br><br>In my efforts to warn the public about the harmful and cultish nature of Falun Gong, my free speech was suppressed. Last year when the International Cultic Studies Association organized a program on the Falun Gong in which I was one of the presenters, the Falun Gong threatened the organization with a lawsuit and successfully suppressed our freedom of speech.<br><br>The Falun Gong is preying on the residents of this city I just want people to know that the Falun Gong is not what they claim to be.<br></div></blockquote>Maybe I need to continue because Fymk raised many important issues. Here are so some of them.<br><br>In the article on Samuel Lo, what is it suggesting is that Master Li Hongzhi is preventing his disciples from taking medicine. This is not true because in Zhuan Falun, Master Li Hongzhi had stated that anybody who is not a true cultivator should go to hospital if he is sick. He had never say that humans should not take medicine. This is actually communist propaganda. It is be easily verified because it is stated clearly in Zhuan Falun.<br><br>To sidetrack a little, do anybody know why Falungong easily had 100mil members in so short a time? The answer is it is famed for curing many people of unknown or incurable diseases after many ill people practiced it. It was acknowledged internationally. But before anybodyÂ’s imagination runs wild, I can tell you all this is not what you think. There were many documented cases of people recovering from cancer without medicine and of course people who died because they did not take their medicine. Why is this so? I ask everybody a question. It is possible for every human to be 100% free from diseases? If so will human society exist? Getting sick is part and parcel of human life. If you want to abstain from it you must be above that of humanity. This concept is very complicated and is best to refer to Zhuan Falun if you want to know.<br><br>Do you know what is the minimum moral requirement to be considered Master Li HongzhiÂ’s disciple? It is to never retaliate even if your enemy hit or abuse you. WhatÂ’s more you can bear a grudge against your enemy (and many others). I will not speculate whether Samuel LoÂ’s stepfather had reached the level of morals stipulated by Master Li Hongzhi. If he did not, he is all but a normal human and not a falungong true practitioner. If he is not, a normal human who does not take his medicine will of course die.<br><br>The main point is that Falungong had never disallowed the usage of medicine.<br><br>I started this thread with no intention to attack homosexuality. Absolutely no. But I need to explain why falungong is against homosexuality like many of other orthodox beliefs like Christianity. Imagine this, if the whole world turns homosexual, how can the human world continue to have a regeneration of human offspring? WonÂ’t humans be extinct in this way? Christian theology talk about God creating Adam together with Eve, not Aadm and another Adam. To go against the original creation is sin. Again, I am not attacking homosexuals but to paint the spiritual basis of homosexuality condemnation.<br></div>

It is strictly cultivation or "Xiu Lian" in chinese. This mean that Falungong demands very high moral and spiritual developments. The core of Falungong is on mental improvement. The exercises are secondary.<br><br>Mr(or Miss?) Bear, the answer lies not with me but with you. Are you willing to die for truth and justice?<br><br>My Master preaches Truth, Benevolence and Forbeareance. Once you cultivate to a certain level, you understand the beauty of these attributes. Once you become enlighented to these values, you will discover that you are willing to sacrifice yourself for such good values. This is not blind following without thinking.<br><br>Bear just imagine this. Why are there people like Ghandi who pit themselves against authority. He did so because of his strong belief in independence. What about Falungong member. Again this is because of their strong belief in even higher attribute of goodness.<br><br>I know it will be very hard for you to imagine this goodness I am talking about. Such things come from the soul and you need strict cultivations to attain it. But to be honest, it is very hard to attain such a level. I am not preaching to you but if you want to know about this goodness you can read Zhuan Falun. Perhaps you will then understand how childish these propagandas are. Maybe you will not even ask this questions at all.</div>

Li also regards mixed-race or 'cross-bred' people as rootless and deviant, a sign of morally bankrupt times. Mixed-race people are a plot by the evil extraterrestrials who populate his cosmology, which spills over with accounts of lost civilisations, higher realms and mysteries that science cannot grasp.</strong>  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>'By mixing the races of humans, the aliens make humans cast off gods,' he is quoted as saying in a lecture in Switzerland.<br><br>In an interview with Time Magazine Asia, 10 May, 1999, he was <strong>quite specific about the role of aliens</strong> in the present troubled times.<br><br>TIME: Why does chaos reign now?<br><br>Li: Of course there is not just one reason. The biggest cause of society's change today is that people no longer believe in orthodox religion. They go to church, but they no longer believe in god. They feel free to do anything. The second reason is that since the beginning of this century, aliens have begun to invade the human mind and its ideology and culture.<br><br>TIME: Where do they come from?<br><br>Li: The aliens come from other planets. The names that I use for these planets are different. Some are from dimensions that human beings have not yet discovered. The key is how they have corrupted mankind. Everyone knows that from the beginning until now, there has never been a development of culture like today. Although it has been several thousand years, it has never been like now.<br><br>The aliens have introduced modern machinery like computers and aeroplanes. They started by teaching mankind about modern science, so people believe more and more science, and spiritually, they are controlled. Everyone thinks that scientists invent on their own when in fact their inspiration is manipulated by the aliens. In terms of culture and spirit, they already control man. Mankind cannot live without science.<br><br>The ultimate purpose is to replace humans. If cloning human beings succeeds, the aliens can officially replace humans. Why does a corpse lie dead, even though it is the same as a living body? The difference is the soul, which is the life of the body. If people reproduce a human person, the gods in heaven will not give its body a human soul. The aliens will take that opportunity to replace the human soul and by doing so they will enter earth and become earthlings. When such people grow up, they will help replace humans with aliens. They will produce more and more clones. There will no longer be humans reproduced by humans. They will act like humans, but they will introduce legislation to stop human reproduction.<br></div>
