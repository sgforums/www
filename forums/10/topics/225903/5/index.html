Why Falungong must make such a big ruckus to the point of causing the funding of Chinese New Year for San Francisco's Chinese community to be cancelled?<br><br><strong> Falungong is already political in the sense </strong> that it is trying to buy the world's pity about alleged human right crime against it . Well we all know China has human rights issues with main stream religions such as Christianity and Catholicism but there is prayers for those who are persecuted in China NOT POLITICAL DEMONSTRATIONS to go SLAM into people's faces.<br><br><strong> Yet Falungong with all its infinite wisdom claim to be apolitical when it repeatedly highlights all alleged crimes committed against its practitioners  as a POLITICAL REASON TO DETHRONE a political party i.e. " Overthrow the Communist party"  - that was what I saw on a falungong's banner.  Falungong also threatened to sue a person like Samuel Luo tries to speak up against their practice. It just doesn't make any sense to me  if falungong claims to be apolitical. </strong><br><br>As for the alleged human organs - I don't think it can be proven as true neither can it be proven as false. One thing I know logically is that Communist China doesn't even allow the western media to film anything inside the prisons , let alone take a tape out of China. How must I be expected to believe that the videos they show on the lawn are true especially when u need a big arse camera filming it  and with security over human rights sensitivity such as China's - it is just not possible to smuggle in a video camera and smuggle out that same camera.  The gullible may believe it but I certainly won't.<br><br>I am sorry but Africa deserves more pity than Falungong in terms of human rights violations and genocidal ideations of some of the african dictators.</div>

[/b][/quote]<br><br>Nothing to be sorry about it. It was nice talking with you. I am repeating the same thing  over and over again- I am not here to convert preach or force my ideas down to other. I respect the freedom of beliefs. What I am trying to do is to highlight the present crisis in China and perhaps clear up some understanding about Falungong. Nothing else.<br><br>With regards to how these evidences can get out of China, it is because there are falungong sympathesiers and people still with a conscience working in concentration camps and military hospitals. There are still people who are willing to risk their life for justice. They somehow managed to get these evidences out.No matter how you try to cover up, things still get out to the public.<br><br>The following is totally unrelated but is what I feel judging from the replys from the threads. I know a lot of people now believe  the whole world is filled with bad people but the truth is there are still good people around. Perhaps there is no need to always think on the bad side.<br><br>With regards to the samuel Lo incident etc. I am not sure and hence I abstain from commenting. Again sorry for the problem faced by your parents. Perhaps my fellow members have being over-zealous in trying to promote Falungong. No harm is intended despite the rudeness. It is just a case of trying to share what they feel is good to other people. However, this is not an excuse for their act. Hence i seek your understanding on this issue.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>falungong is not just a religious cult or some form of self-improvement exercises...it has political ambitions as well. That's why the Chinese government is cracking down on it.<br><br>How the Chinese govern their nation is no concern of mine. But members of Falungong have defied the laws of Singapore and that's a fact. If you disagree with a law in a democratic society, you change it by petitioning the government or at the polls. Disobeying the laws of a country with a popularly elected legislature is not a democratic right.</div>

In Zhuan Falun, It had being stated clearly that we are not a religion. It just happen that everybody think that we are. Falungong disciples clearly know that we are never a religion and that is good enough already. It had not being my intention to insist upon others to believe this viewpoint. However cultivation or Xui lian is very similar to religion at least on a low level of understanding. hence the label stick.</div>
