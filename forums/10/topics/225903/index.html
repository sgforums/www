            <div class='col-md body'>"Falun Gong: homophobic mind control cult"<br>San Francisco Sentinal - Letter to the Editor/January 27, 2006<br>By Samuel Luo<br><br>My name is Samuel Luo and my parents are both Falun Gong practitioners who have been hurt and exploited by this cult. Among the many harms done to them, I have been seriously concerned that they have refused needed medical treatment. In 2002, my step-father initially refused help when he had a stroke and he has suffered painful gout attacks unnecessarily for five years. He did so because he was being brainwashed into believing that Li Hongzhi, the founder and leader of this cult has the power to cure illnesses and taking medicine is counter productive.<br><br>The Falun Gong is also extremely homophobic. Li teaches that homosexuality is not the standard of being human, the priority of Gods will be to eliminate homosexuals and that gays are demonic in nature. These teachings are honored by all Falun Gong practitioners. Recently when I confronted my mother with these teachings she said that the elimination of gays is already happening. When I wanted her to give specific examples she said that all the natural disasters that happened recently are directed at corrupt people, gays included.<br><br>In my efforts to warn the public about the harmful and cultish nature of Falun Gong, my free speech was suppressed. Last year when the International Cultic Studies Association organized a program on the Falun Gong in which I was one of the presenters, the Falun Gong threatened the organization with a lawsuit and successfully suppressed our freedom of speech.<br><br>The Falun Gong is preying on the residents of this city I just want people to know that the Falun Gong is not what they claim to be.<br></div>

They play tai chi at the park and the falungong members keep disturbing their tai chi group because they are on "their turf" by purposely going near them when there is a lot of space and making alot of noise when the tai chi music comes on . When the tai chi group move because of that , those falungong idiots followed them again and did the same thing plus yelling at the whole group.  Bloody irritants. Better to get them arrested for being a public nuisance.<br><br>Tell that to me . In Australia, they set up tables to posters. That's fine. <strong> What is not fine is that when I refused to take a falungong pamphlet handed out to me ,the girl was making so much noise in public in front of dozens of people about "chinese not wanting to support chinese in need" </strong> . If falungong does not give me personal freedom to have a choice over what I want to take and instead choose to coerce me in a trivial matter , they don't deserve any pity from me and I will support the PRC government in curbing such nuisance down to the limit in China.<br><br>Falungong doesn't need propaganda to make themselves look bad. They already made themselves look bad by their members'  actions.<br><br>Take Jehovah witnesses as an example , they may be banned in Singapore . They come and bother u thru door knocking but they never ever try to shove something down your throat like Falungong does.</div>

What is the picture of the buddha doing on it then? <strong> Sorry TS,  you LIED big time and that makes me hesitate to believe you at all. </strong><br><br>Go figure and the website is not even in China. There is so much Chinese Govt Vs Falun websites and vice versa but it is hard to google on what is the objectionable properties of falungong.<br><br>If we google other religions - there is alot of free criticisms openly on them by individuals . For the case of Falungong, hard to dig it up except their so called advertisement of CCP taking out the organs - HOW DO WE KNOW THAT IS NOT STAGED? All those nice pictures on the lawn - well excuse me , it is not easy to get those up and personal shots of individuals being tortured in China. CCP we all know would probably have torture of individuals but by far not too much  got out as proof . Yet falungong got videos of it even!<br><br>I hesitate to jump on the human rights party wagon for falungong. If they suppress Mr Luo from talking in a public forum about what had happened to his parents, I say they deserve to have CCP suppressing them as well.  Free speech goes both ways - so don't expect any pity from me.<br><br>I will tell anyone I know that it is a bothersome cult which doesn't deserve any pity since it restricts other people's personal freedom to speak out against them.</div>

Being one of its members, I wish to clarify to many people who are hoodwinked by the Chinese Communist propaganda machine. Here are some basic areas of misunderstanding.<br><br>1.	Falungong had never being a religion. It has no religious ritual or any systems to be considered a religion. If is not a religion, how can it be considered a cult? <span style="color: red;">Moreover, Falungong requires a high level of personal cultivation, which in other words, requires its practitioners to be morally upright.</span><br>2.	The communist party had really taken human organs from living Falungong members. This is a fact recognized by international human right organizations. Many Western countries calling for investigations into the matter.<br>3.	<span style="color: red;">Master Li Hongzhi is not some cult leader. How can a person who preaches good for no monetary rewards be a cult leader?</span><br>4.	<span style="color: red;">Falungong absolutely abhors the taking of lives, including suicide. A real Falungong practitioner will never resort to burning himself.</span><br><br>There is simply too many misunderstandings floating around. I would gladly clarify any doubts if anybody have any. </strong><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></strong>[/b]</blockquote></div>
