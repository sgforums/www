Li also regards mixed-race or 'cross-bred' people as rootless and deviant, a sign of morally bankrupt times. Mixed-race people are a plot by the evil extraterrestrials who populate his cosmology, which spills over with accounts of lost civilisations, higher realms and mysteries that science cannot grasp.</strong>  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>'By mixing the races of humans, the aliens make humans cast off gods,' he is quoted as saying in a lecture in Switzerland.<br><br>In an interview with Time Magazine Asia, 10 May, 1999, he was <strong>quite specific about the role of aliens</strong> in the present troubled times.<br><br>TIME: Why does chaos reign now?<br><br>Li: Of course there is not just one reason. The biggest cause of society's change today is that people no longer believe in orthodox religion. They go to church, but they no longer believe in god. They feel free to do anything. The second reason is that since the beginning of this century, aliens have begun to invade the human mind and its ideology and culture.<br><br>TIME: Where do they come from?<br><br>Li: The aliens come from other planets. The names that I use for these planets are different. Some are from dimensions that human beings have not yet discovered. The key is how they have corrupted mankind. Everyone knows that from the beginning until now, there has never been a development of culture like today. Although it has been several thousand years, it has never been like now.<br><br>The aliens have introduced modern machinery like computers and aeroplanes. They started by teaching mankind about modern science, so people believe more and more science, and spiritually, they are controlled. Everyone thinks that scientists invent on their own when in fact their inspiration is manipulated by the aliens. In terms of culture and spirit, they already control man. Mankind cannot live without science.<br><br>The ultimate purpose is to replace humans. If cloning human beings succeeds, the aliens can officially replace humans. Why does a corpse lie dead, even though it is the same as a living body? The difference is the soul, which is the life of the body. If people reproduce a human person, the gods in heaven will not give its body a human soul. The aliens will take that opportunity to replace the human soul and by doing so they will enter earth and become earthlings. When such people grow up, they will help replace humans with aliens. They will produce more and more clones. There will no longer be humans reproduced by humans. They will act like humans, but they will introduce legislation to stop human reproduction.<br>[/b]</blockquote>Before I reply to this thread, I feel I own everybody an explanation. I am here not to preach or even convert anybody to Falungong. It had never being my original intention. Such spiritual matters to a very large extent are decided by fate. And true to what the Bear had said, everybody have a right to believe in what they want. Why should I try to convert anybody if in their heart they have no desires to do so? Thus, my intention is to tell the true side of the story and remove some of the harm done by propagandas upon innocent and normally kind hearted people. Thats all. There is no other agenda.<br><br>Elindra had quoted a very interesting article about Master Li Hongzhi. Although I feel that my reply will not satisfy most people, this is the best I can  give. I can ensure you that I am not taking the easy way out by giving this answer.<br><br>This is very similar to the case of sameul Lo's stepfather. People concentrate on the few death case while ignoring the fact that many people had their illness cured miraculously. This interview is a very small part of Falungong essence. In order to understand this, you need to have a foundation of knowledge on the other areas of Falungong. Talks of aliens whatsoever will sound out of the comos for any people who have no foundation in basic Falungong knowledge. Won't university maths seem out of the world when you are ignorant of primary school maths? The same theory applies. I have to conclude by saying this. What Master Li is saying is not what you are thinking.<br>Again I am not preaching, but the answer is in Zhuan Falun.<br><br>By the way Master Li Hongzhi had never being intolerant of homosexuals and mixed blood. These people are also accepted as Falungong practitioners.</div>

Lord BuddhaÂ’s way, which is one of the way is present day Buddhism. Falungong is also one of the 84000 methods.

Lord BuddhaÂ’s way, which is one of the way is present day Buddhism. Falungong is also one of the 84000 methods.

It is not buddhism doctrine.<br><br>However Falungong will lead to liberation and enlightenment. One similar attribute is Shan which is benevolence or compassion. Once you have this, it becomes the core of enlightenment Moreover it is not logical for buddhism to say falungong will not achieve enlightened. Perhaps this is interpreted by some monks because Lord Buddha had never denied Falungong. How can the words of monks be used to justify such high realms of knowledge when it can only be done so by Lord Buddha himself?<br><br></div></blockquote>Nomore<br><br>People can't just take a method out from a mainstream religion and claim it as another thing.

Religions are more of rituals with heavy emphasis on what you can do and what not. Falungong does not have any of these. Its principles just state what a good person on the road of cultivation must do. If a person wants to leave, he can do so. No records are kept and strictly no money is to be accumulated.

If you try to see Falungong within the lens of buddhism, you will get confused. It is just like trying to see christianity through the lens of buddhism. No result will come out. Eternalnow is right. Buddhism and falungong are different and they should continue to remain so. Falungong is a way of cultivation. It has no rituals. My Master had also stated in his books that we are not a religion.<br><br>There is also a misunderstanding that we worship other gods. That is not true. We respect other Gods like Jesus and Lord Buddha because of their compassion, kindness and goodness. They are great Gods there is no doubts about it. This is different from worshipping them.<br><br>Perhaps we should not be overly focused on the form but be interested in the essences. No government can say which religion is a cult. Christianity will not become a cult even if Taliban and Osama say so. Christianity is an upright religion because of its preaching of love and compassion. How could Falungong  be a cult when it teach so too?<br><br>But fymk is very right on one issue. Many cults are around stealing other ideologies to attempt legitimacy. Many should beware.</div>
