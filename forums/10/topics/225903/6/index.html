Falungong is still allowed to operate because it does not encourage its members to demonstrate illegally and break the law in Singapore (at least officially). If the police has evidence that this is not the act of some errant members on their own initiative but at the instigation of the organization, falungong will be banned.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>From the book Zhuan Falun: (as you can see Master Li is a totally ignorant fool, and he likes to pretend he knows a lot of things)<br><br><blockquote><br>But something just doesnÂ’t add up. There are a lot of places around the world where traces of ancient cultures have been left, and theyÂ’re really a lot older than our civilization. These ancient remains are excellent in terms of their craftsmanship, and if you look at the artistry theyÂ’re superb. ItÂ’s almost like modern folks are imitating the arts of ancient people, and they have great aesthetic value. But theyÂ’re from more than 100,000 years ago, hundreds of thousands of years ago, millions of years ago, or even more than 100 million years ago. Then think about it, isnÂ’t this making a joke of "history" as we know it? But this really isnÂ’t just another amusing idea, since mankind is perfecting itself and rediscovering itself on an ongoing basis, and thatÂ’s just how a society develops, so chances are what it knows at the beginning isnÂ’t totally correct.<br></blockquote>can't  Master Li get a high school history book and read before you talk about ancient civilization?<br><br>oldest civilization is Sumerian, 5000~6000 years ago<br><br><blockquote><br>The Third Eye weÂ’re talking about is actually located slightly above the spot thatÂ’s between your eyebrows, and itÂ’s connected to the pineal gland. ThatÂ’s the main passageway, at least.<br><br>When we talk about "opening the Third Eye" itÂ’s about bypassing your optic nerves and opening a passageway between your eyebrows, which makes it possible for your pineal gland to see outside directly. And this is what opening the Third Eye means.<br></blockquote>go buy a human anatomy book before you talk about pineal gland.<br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pineal<br><br>The pineal gland (also called the pineal body or epiphysis) is a small endocrine gland in the brain. It is located near the center of the brain, between the two hemispheres. So it's not situated between your eyebrows and it has nothing to do with detection of light.<br><br><blockquote><br>A lot of beings have seen something: speaking in terms of the present time, itÂ’s been quite a long time since a big explosion happened in this dimension of the universe. Astronomers arenÂ’t able to see it today because what we can see with the most powerful telescopes are things that happened 150,000 light-years ago. If we want to see the changes now happening in the celestial bodies, we have to wait until 150,000 light-years have passed. ThatÂ’s quite a long way back.<br></blockquote>Now 10 years old kids also know "light year" is a unit of distance not time! But Master Li doesn't know!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_bang<br><br>In physical cosmology, the Big Bang is the scientific theory that the universe emerged from a tremendously dense and hot state about 13.7 billion years ago.<br><br>I suggest Master Li go buy a Physics text book and read before you talk.<br></div>

Falungong had never being a religion. It has no religious ritual or any systems to be considered a religion. If is not a religion, how can it be considered a cult? Moreover, Falungong requires a high level of personal cultivation, which in other words, requires its practitioners to be morally upright.<br>2.	The communist party had really taken human organs from living Falungong members. This is a fact recognized by international human right organizations. Many Western countries calling for investigations into the matter.<br>3.	Master Li Hongzhi is not some cult leader. How can a person who preaches good for no monetary rewards be a cult leader?<br>4.	Falungong absolutely abhors the taking of lives, including suicide. A real Falungong practitioner will never resort to burning himself.<br><br>There is simply too many misunderstandings floating around. I would gladly clarify any doubts if anybody have any. </strong><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></strong>[/b]</blockquote>Hmm.

The two parties argued as to whether or not Lee was involved in the case. The judge decided that Lee and other officials were not involved, and will not be required to testify in the trial scheduled for January 22.<br><br>On October 23, 2005, a few Falun Gong practitioners distributed fliers about quitting the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) on busy streets. Nine months later, during Chinese official Li Lanqing's visit to Singapore, six Falun Gong practitioners were suddenly charged with "assembly without permit." Falun Gong practitioners involved and several legal professionals in Singapore feel that this is a ridiculous charge. The manipulator behind the scene is most probably Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew.<br><br>To clarify the truth, clear their names and overturn the charge, defendant Dr. Wang Yuyi requested that the Court summon Lee Kuan Yew to testify at the early stage of the trial. However, her request was turned down by the Subordinate Court. Wang thinks the Subordinate Court didn't even give consideration to her request. Her right as defendant was neglected. She then appealed to the High Court. The following is an interview with Dr. Wang.<br><br>Reporter: Hello, Dr. Wang! Your request to summon Lee Kuan Yew and others has triggered a lot of concern and feedback in the past few months. Did you expect it when you made the request?<br><br>Wang: It is common for parties in the lawsuit to summon witnesses during trial. It is usually a simple process. The reason why my summon triggered special concern is probably because of the special identity of the people I summon. I noticed it during the trial on July 28. It was late afternoon and it was pretty dark in the courtroom. It wasn't the time everyone was most focused. However, when I said I would like to summon Lee Kuan Yew, it caused a stir in the court. Many turned around to look at me in surprise.<br><br>Some told me afterwards that it was great to summon Lee. Some thought I had challenged and humiliated them on purpose, as if treating him as an ordinary person is humiliation. It doesn't make sense. If someone thinks we should do such and such because of Lee's special status, it is equivalent of granting him special privilege. But it would take away my right as an ordinary defendant. It is unfair to us.<br><br>Reporter: Why do you want to summon these people as witnesses?<br><br>Wang: It is from of the point of view of a defendant. I know my fellow Falun Gong practitioners and I are innocent. Falun Gong practitioners wouldn't do anything illegal. I am determined to expose the conspiracy behind the scene and overturn the charge. But I need witnesses and evidence. The prosecutor didn't provide any witness for me to question. I have to think about summoning witnesses. We will be able to see how the order was passed down level by level through the dialog of these witnesses.<br><br>Reporter: Are you sure it is appropriate? Have you consulted any lawyer?<br><br>Wang: I haven't. I didn't have to show up at the court on July 28 because of my international trip. I learned that the court made a change during my trip. So, I hurried to show up at the court as soon as I came back. I didn't have time to consult a lawyer or even discuss about it much with other Falun Gong practitioners involved.<br><br>Eleven of us stood in a row and took turns talking to the judge during the trial. I heard Ms. Ng Chye Huay request the policemen to be witnesses. I am inspired. I thought, "Right. A few policemen were at the scene on Oct. 23. They can be my witnesses." My second thought was they were simply carrying out an order. They won't be able to explain much. "I should summon their bosses too." But their bosses were not decision makers either. "I should summon their bosses' boss." When I traced it up, I naturally thought about the true decision maker, Lee Kuan Yew. When it was my turn to talk, I announced their names to the judge. I know it is doable legally.<br><br>Reporter: On your list, you did not include SingaporeÂ’s former and current Prime Ministers Lee Hsien Loong and Goh Chok Tong.<br><br>Wang: No. In recent years that Falun Gong was not fairly treated, and they bear responsibility since they are high level government officials. On the other hand, I did not see any report about their comment on Falun Gong in public. I donÂ’t know their attitude towards Falun Gong and the relationship to this case. Those witnesses mentioned above were all involved in the case.<br><br>Reporter: Then, why did the judge at Subordinate Court refuse your summons request? What is her reason?<br><br>Wang: She said that those witnesses were not present on the spot and thus, don't relate to this case.<br><br>Reporter: How do you explain this from the law?<br><br>Wang: From the law, if one person is present on the spot, he relates to the criminal case, but if he is not present, it doesnÂ’t mean he has nothing to do with the case. In other words, one person may have many relations to a case, and presence on the spot is only one of the relations.<br><br>Reporter: Why did the judge not know this? Why did she use this reason to refuse your summons request if she knows?<br><br>Wang: I think that she could not find any better reason. She asked me that day, "Was Lee Kuan Yew present on the spot on the day of the case?" I said, "No." I asked her, "If a witness relates to the case, must he present on the spot?" She answered, "Not necessarily." This indicates she knows clearly.<br><br>But in the meeting record she provided, the conversion was omitted. I put it forward in my appeal. The omission was intentional since the judge frequently used "Witness to be summoned was not present on the spot and does not relate to the case" as a reason in her ruling.<br><br>Reporter: In addition, do you have any other thoughts for the judgeÂ’s refusal?<br><br>Wang: The right to summon witness in a criminal case is a serious matter. The judge has the responsibility to safeguard my rights, and at least carefully consider my summons. She did not do that. I was disappointed. But her refusal reinforced my reasons for summoning Lee.<br><br>Reporter: It seems that you do not agree with SingaporeÂ’s handling of Falun Gong. Did you communicate with them to exchange ideas?<br><br>Wang: In recent years, we contacted with police a lot and the highest level we reached was deputy director of the bureau to monitor Falun Gong. Many police, investigators and even some officers know the facts well. Many of them were transferred and it was said that they did not like to participate in the plan from the Ministry of Internal Affairs. But there are still many police and officials who carry out orders from high levels on this matter.<br><br>We could not reach higher level officials. For years, Falun Gong practitioners requested many times and wrote countless letters, but did not get any response. One reason that I summon Lee Kuan Yew is to have a chance to ask him face to face why he treats Falun Gong practitioners unfairly and what his real thoughts are.<br><br>Reporter: Thank you for the interview.<br><br>Wang: Thank you.<br></div>
