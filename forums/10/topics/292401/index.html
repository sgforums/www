            <div class='col-md body'>Ministers are people given the rare opportunities to serve the country and lead the people to overcome whatever their problems and improve their livelihood.<br><br>A minister should feel greatly honored to be elected to represent and fight for the citizens even with low or just sufficient pay to keep a certain lifestyle.<br><br>A good pay therefore should be optional consideration. It will be a big plus if a good pay is formally predetermined before he is elected as there will be so suspicion cast on his character as someone who is after monies or self-rewards.<br><br>Such a carefully anointed minister will be accepted by people as some one with real leadership and character to lead his people with full authority and morality.<br><br>Given such a position of honor many people would be too happy to serve the people even less than million-dollar or substantially below million salaries or even below their precedent pay in an existing job.<br><br>Why? Because service to the people is an honor. It is a privilege to serve the country even at the risk of sacrificing one's own life.<br><br>Why is it that we do not have too many people willing to enter politics to serve the country? The answer is not necessarily lack of material rewards of not enough pays. It may be something else? One reason could be like the old Chinese proverb puts it : "A mountain cannot home two tigers", meaning a talented person cannot serve under head-strong leader.<br><br>If our leaders are to recognize such fundamental truth then it will be possible again to attract capable persons who are willing to serve his people even at lesser rewards as compared with his other options.<br><br>It is unfortunate that we have too headstrong leader who may be the reason for talents to feel reserved about serving the country.<br><br>Let our new leaders recognize this as one of our setback and make changes to attract talents who are willing to serve with change in conditions in the work environment allowing people with good and original and creative ideas to rise up and be tested instead of dictating all policies based on self-centredness and position of power.<br><br>It is time for our new leaders to reflect on how they cannot attract people with calibre as it is not pay alone which is the determining factor.<br><br>The serving ministers should carefully decide whether they have accepted the above-stated premise for entering politics or they have entered the service because of million-dollar pays.<br><br>A man cannot serve two masters - monies and service to his people.<br><br>If there is a doubt about the above-stated self-evaluation such ministers should give up their jobs to someone else who could serve the nation with honor and passion without being colored by greed or self-rewards.</div>
