            <div class='col-md body'>quote:<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>1) Driving on the left lane at 90km/h is not lane hogging yet many drivers will get angry and call that lane hogging. According to paper, TP cannot book these "idiots".<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>This is what I call selfish bastard that deserve to be killed by the truck when they travel to NS highway. 90km/h is by the book, play by rule you can still travel at 109km/h. Knn kia see dont drive in 1st lane lah. What is the problem with giving way. What if there is an emegency?<br><br><span style="color: red;"><br>Ok, then let's drive off the road to give way then. BTW, left lane is not the same as first lane. Please get your left and right, first and third lane right.<br><br>And sg has no NS highway, so the SPF, LTA and TP cannot do anything about it.<br></span><br><br>quote:<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>3) TP closes an eye to this as they are not blocking other road users. When moving off, they will signal their intention. At night, their lights will be on and the road brightly lit. There is no overwhelming need to book these "idiots" either.<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>They are not blocking? How many times have you read of people being killed on the road side with changing tyres are using the mobile phone? These are the damn idiot who need to he shot in the head for being so STUPID.<br><br>Why dont you stand in the middle of 2 lanes and see how long you can survive without being hit. You are not block what.. right?<br><br><span style="color: red;"><br>Stopping on the road shoulder is NOT standing between two lanes. If you stay away from the traffic and the LEFT LANE, you should stay alive.<br><br>If you insist on standing between two lanes, you ARE breaking the law, by jaywalking, and you ARE blocking.<br></span><br><br>quote:<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>4) Because when you signal early, some motorists will drive to prevent you from entering their lane. Many ppl have this thing against letting others enter their lane in front of them. Sadly, this kind of antisocial behavior cannot be presecuted. This results in many motorists choosing not to signal. I usually only allow the signal light to flash once then i change lanes. This gives me the benefit of acting before the motorist can cut me off, yet i can be said to have signalled.<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>That is why I say bad habit bred bad drivers. And this is a typical monkey see monkey do. Why dont you just use your head the think of the reverse? If you dont signlal dont expect people to give way. And personally I will horn at any idiot who change lane dont signal, to me it is rude and it is dangerous. Period!!<br><br><span style="color: red;"><br>You have been insisting on travelling at 109 km/h and refusing to allow anyone to filter into your lane, signalling or not doesn't make any differnece anymore right?<br></span><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>1) Why are there so many idiots who like to speed on the left and centre lane and act like they own the road? Why can't they use the high speed lane and overtaking lane to speed? Isn't it an offence? ?Beginner drivers and heavy vehicle drivers have to use the left lane and now you're depriving them of its use safely?<br><br>BECAUSE THE F.CUKING RIGHT LANE IS FILLED WITH IDIOTS LIKE YOU WHO REFUSE TO GIVE WAY TO FASTER CAR. EVEN THE <span style="color: red;">MAT YO YO IN MALAYSIA </span>WHO IS DRIVING A KANCIL KNOWS THAT NS HIGHWAY IS 110KM/H, BUT THERE WILL BE CARS THAT WILL TRAVEL AT 300KM/H. BOTTOM LINE IS GIVE WAY!!!<br><br><span style="color: red;"><br>As usual, responding without reading. I already mentioned so many times, left (kiri, zhuo) lane is for slower drivers. Are ppl supposed to give way to you by filtering right (kanan, you) just for you? Then why designate the LEFT lane for slower drivers and RIGHT lane for overtaking?<br><br>So what do you want the TP and LTA to do about those who drive at 300 km/h on the NS highway?<br><br>BTW, it is a seditionary remark to say that all Malays are "Mat yo yo".<br></span><br><br>2) How come emergency services drivers are able to do their jobs well, without complaining and yet people in unrelated industries are so bored and go complain about them on internet forums?<br><br>BECAUSE THEY ARE THE ONES THAT IS DRIVING, NOT LYING BEHIND DYING IN PAIN. I HOPE THAT ONE DAY YOU WILL GET THE CHANCE TO TRAVEL ON ONE YOURSELF AND SEE IF TIME IS PRECIOUS OR NOT!!<br><br><span style="color: red;"><br>If they keep taking their own sweet time their KPI will suffer. Trust me, when they are being threatened with getting fired, their time is prescious too.<br></span><br><br>3) Why are there idiots that want to drive (and speed) on the road shoulder and get angry because others stop on the road shoulder? Isn't that what the road shoulder is used for? For stopping your vehicle? If it is not for stoping your vehicle, then shouldn't there be a shoulder on the road shoulder? Then if there is a car breakdown or other driver related emergency, where is the driver supposed to stop his/her vehicle?<br><br>YOU KNOW WHAT IS THE MEANING OF EMERGENCY? TALKING COCK ON THE MOBILE PHONE IS EMERGENCY??<br><br>IF YOU CHANGE YOUR TYRES YOU BETTER CHANGE IT UNDER BRIGHT LIGHTS AND HAVE YOUR HAZARD LIGHT ON AND USE YOUR BREAKDOWN TRIANGLE SIGN.<br><br><span style="color: red;"><br>Why can't I talk cock on the mobile on the road shoulder? Maybe its my biggest client clarifying a term in a contract? That is talking cock to you, but not to me. Losing a few million dollars or getting sued IS an emergency.<br><br>Why can't I change tyres on the road shoulder? Is there a law against it? Am I hogging the shoulder? If i'm not allowed to change tyres on the shoulder, then WHERE SHOULD I CHANGE MY TYRES?<br></span><br><br>4) Why must some stupid road bullies not give way when others signal to use their lane? They claim that our road limit is 109 km/h and anyone going below that is lane hogging. They will horn and zoom forward just to cut other drivers off. ShouldnÂ’t these idiots to be taken out of the road and get ban for life?<br><br>YOU UNDERSTAND THE MEANING OF GIVING WAY OR NOT? DO YOU KNOW THAT 1ST LANE IS FOR OVERTAKING ONLY. IT IS NOT FOR PEOPLE WHO WANT TO TRAVEL AT 90KM/H, IF YOU ARE DRIVING AT 250KM.H AND THERE IS A CAR COMING TOWARDS YOU, YOU STILL HAVE TO GIVE WAY ISNT IT?<br><br><span style="color: red;"><br>DIDI SAY RIGHT LANE? I SAID THEIR LANE. Read carefully. Their lane may NOT be the right lane.<br><br>And since the right lane is for overtaking, that means its ok not to give way? Heavy vehicles are not allowed to filter right at Dunrean exit on the PIE just because they cannot drive at 250 km/h???<br></span><br><br>Talking about 3rd to 1st world, every damn thing has changed, but the road bullies in Singapore is becoming from bad to worst.<br><br>PIE still uses the speed limit of 90 km/h, not 109 km/h. I dunno where you got your road limit of 109 km/h from.<br><br>THERE GOES YOU SHOW WHY EVERYTIME WHEN WE APPROACH SPEED CAMERA THERE WILL BE IDIOT LIKE YOU WHO SUDDENLY JAM THEIR BRAKE TO GO BELOW THE SPEED LIMIT. i CHALLENGE YOU TO TRY GOING AT 99 KM.H ON AT 80KM/H SPEED CAMERA AND SEE IF IT FLASHES? IF IT DOES i WILL PAY FOR YOUR FINE. IF IT DOESNT, PROMISE ME YOU DONT DRIVE ON 1ST ANYMORE.<br><br><span style="color: red;"><br>You're the one advocating speeding at 109 and 150 km/h. WHY DON'T YOU TRY TO DRIVE PAST SPEED CAMERAS AT 109 OR 150 KM/H AND NOT BREAK? I CHALLENGE YOU TO TRY IT AND SEE IF IT DOESN'T FLASH!!!<br><br>I believe that all drivers should drive at whatever speed their skill level warrants.<br></span></div>
