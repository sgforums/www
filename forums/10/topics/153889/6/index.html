            <div class='col-md body'><span style="font-style: italic;">SINGAPORE : If you think you are seeing things blinking at some signalised junctions in Toa Payoh, don't worry your eyes aren't playing tricks on you.<br><br>New intelligent road studs and pedestrian signs have been put up to enhancing pedestrian safety, especially for the elderly.<br><br>They are part of a three-month trial by the Land Transport Authority, which, if successful, will be implemented islandwide.<br><br>Last year, 23 elderly pedestrians were killed in road accidents, so the Land Transport Authority is not taking any chances.<br><br>It has installed intelligent road studs at two junctions in Toa Payoh.<br><br>Once a pedestrian presses the button and the green man comes on, the road studs are activated to warn drivers of pedestrians ahead.<br><br>Other signs also alert motorists to give way to pedestrians.<br><br>Passers-by welcomed the move.<br><br>"It's safer for the elderly when they walk slowly," said one pedestrian.<br><br>Toa Payoh has a high proportion of elderly residents, so the LTA worked with the Singapore Action Group of Elders (SAGE), Central CDC and the Traffic Police to make the roads more friendly for them.<br><br>Said Ho Seng Tim, head (road safety and engineering) at LTA, "We spent three months examining how other countries deal with this situation, visiting the US and Japan, and we found that this was effective, so we decided to try it out."<br><br>Also under consideration is giving elderly pedestrians more time to cross the road.<br><br>The trial will be on till January, before the Land Transport Authority decides whether to implement the changes islandwide. - CNA /ct </span><br><br><strong>KNN....what LTA know is buying more new toys and wasting our tax payer monies.. Common sense will tell you that this bloody sh.it is just a waste of time and it wont work.<br><br>WHY? Because pedestrian dont always use traffic light junction when crossing the road. The most dangerous people are the jaywalker.<br><br>Instead of trying to protect pedestrian with new toys and device, I think they should spend more time teaching pedestrian and motorist about good road manner and how to cross the road.<br><br>KNN... 9 out of 10 people who cross the road at traffic light and zebra crossing never border to even take a glance to check if the bloody cars are slowing down etc.</strong><br><br></div>

If they tailgate, just switch to the left lane.<br><br>If not, it's probably low speed traffic.

Road rules, and nothing but road rules. Sure they've updated the ERP timings and Bus lane timings as well, but that's not what the highway code is really about, is it?<br><br>Now, the one that i studied in australia, that's properly updated. inclusion of road rules, evasive actions, what to do when tailgated etc etc, and the road manners which love_supreme so supremely advocates. sure, we'd pick these up as we go along, but wouldn't it be kindda nice if we gave the new drivers a better start? but i digress, because i suspect this is entirely irrelevant to the suggestions which love_supreme was making.<br><br>case in point, it shows how nonchalent the authorities' attitude towards the driver's education is; with a somewhat apparent flawed logic (or at least the prevalent opinion amongst fellow drivers, your'e free to disagree) of 'make our test harder = better drivers'. I think it's the beauracratic attitude which love supreme can't stand, which i think is perfectly understandable. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>*edit, incomplete sentence.</div>
