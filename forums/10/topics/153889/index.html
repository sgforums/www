Many ppl have this thing against letting others enter their lane in front of them. Sadly, this kind of antisocial behavior cannot be presecuted. This results in many motorists choosing not to signal. I usually only allow the signal light to flash once then i change lanes.

Youre like the only person I've heard, getting incensed at people for stopping on the road shoulder and claim that they are blocking you. Emergency vehicle drivers are trained (i think) in defensive driving and are fully capable of discharging their duties. They haven't complained yet, why should you?<br><br>A final note, please do not try to change your tyres by stopping your car between two lanes.

READ properly... I have been talking about the left lane all the time. You complain that ppl are driving too slowly on the left lane, then you reply that I'm hogging the right lane, and now you say others force you to speed on the left lane? I think you should join politics! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Acording to you, we should all drive at 109 km/h, then why bother to slow down at speed traps? Why do YOU bother to slow down at speed traps? After all, you feel justified in driving at 109 km/h on the PIE.<br><br>You complain about sg drivers and then cite NS highway as an example? Are you mentally deficient?<br><br>When ppl have to filter left or right for whatever reasons they deem fit, do YOU give way when they signal or do you horn and zoom ahaed, cutting the other driver off claiming that they were road hogging? And you're talking about courtesy on the road?<br><br>Does dropping a contact lens while driving count as an emergency? I believe it does as it undermines your vision and depth perception and thus a driver has full right to stop on the road shoulder to rectify the matter. WHY THE FCUK WERE YOU SPEEDING AT 109 KM/H ON THE ROAD SHOULDER AND CLAIMING THAT THEY WERE HOGGING THE ROAD AND BLOCKING YOU?<br><br>Maybe if you spend less time swearing and more time reading, you might actually give coherent arguments...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>1) Why are there still so many idiots who like to hog the expressway? IsnÂ’t this an offence? How many people have you booked in a year for such offence. Honestly I have never heard of anybody who get book for that before? Can be right? If I can see them everyday, why cant you?<br><br><span style="color: red;"><br>You started off claiming that ppl hog the EXPRESSWAY. The right lane is for overtaking and ppl who want to travel at 109 or 250 km/h. You failed to mention that left lane is for ppl who travel at 90 km/h.<br><br>So are those travelling on the left lane hogging the road because they are travelling at 90???<br></span><br><br>2) How come Singapore drivers doesnÂ’t know how to give way to ambulance when there is a traffic jam? WHY?? KNN when ambulance siren on liao everybody panic and donÂ’t know what to do? Btw, have you idiot include this in the highway code? Or isit that if it is an emergency during peak hours, you will say TOO BAD!!!<br><br><span style="color: red;"><br>I have full faith in the competency of our emergency. If they are incompetent or unable to discharge their duties, their next KPI will suffer, that's how the world works, too bad.<br><br>Furthermore, they have different driving skills from us. They know how to rush to the nearest hospital without meeting accidents themselves.<br></span><br><br>3) Why is there idiots still like to park their cars along expressway and not turn on their hazard light? ShouldnÂ’t these idiots to be taken out of the road and get ban for life?<br><br><span style="color: red;"><br>I replied you about ppl who stop on the HIGHWAY SHOULDER, you responded by talking about standing between two lanes? Are really that stupid? And since I can't use the mobile and drive at the same time, why can't I use my mobile on the road shoulder? What if its a call from a family member who just entered hospital? Do I wait until i reach home before calling back?<br><br>Then you mentioned that ppl driving on the road shoulder are moving too slowly, etc... YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO DRIVE ON THE ROAD SHOULDER!!! I DUN CARE 90 OR 109 OR 250, YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO DRIVE ON THE PROPER LANE! HOW CAN SOMEONE BE HOGGING THE SHOULDER?<br></span><br><br>4) Why most drivers still not use their signal light? Honestly you TP dude, have you ever book drivers for not signalling? If you havenÂ’t, I think it is about time to do so, cause that create most accidents and incontinence for road user.<br><br><span style="color: red;"><br>You talk about signalling and you also talk about not giving way. Then you claim that everyone should signal and that you'll never give way.<br><br>Then you go on and talk about NS highway. WHAT THE FCUK DO YOU WANT THE SPF TO DO ABOUT THE NS HIGHWAY? YOU WANT OUR TP TO PATROL THE MALAYSIAN NS HIGHWAY IN MALAYSIA? WHY CAN'T YOU BE REALISTIC AND TALK ABOUT THE ACTIONS (OR THE LACK THEREOF) BY THE TP ON SINGAPORE HIGHWAYS???<br></span></div>
