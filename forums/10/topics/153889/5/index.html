Consideration to other road users, in front and behind.<br><br>Lane 1 is for overtaking, if you can't make the speed, then drive on Lane 2 or 3. I'm with you on this point.<br><br>Nevertheless, safety is of upmost importance. There are times when road conditions dictate that you drive at a lower speed and you just have to adjust accordingly instead of swearing and honking at those in front of you. We want to minimize accidents right?</div>
