            <div class='col-md body'>" ItÂ’s been almost three and a half months since the PAP government amended a law [on April 19, 2004] permitting the transfer of $ingaporeÂ’s reserves to government companies and statutory boards without the need to get the presidentÂ’s approval. The Finance Ministry, headed by General Lee Hsien Loong, has said that the transferred money cannot be spent without the presidentÂ’s approval. The reason given for permitting the transfers is this: "at times, an activity or function would need to be transferred for the sake of 'efficiency or effectiveness'." There was no debate whatsoever in parliament despite the presence of two opposition MPs. In the past, former president Ong Teng Cheong had publicly stated he had difficulty getting the government to tell him exactly what was $ingaporeÂ’s reserves.

If it did took place, why wasnt this reported?</div></blockquote>Sorry for reviving this dead thread, but i just happened to come across this thread and am surprised that no one has linked to the Straits Times Article.<br><br>Here it is:<br><br><blockquote><br><br>More foreign-born kids to get citizenship<br>By Lydia Lim<br><br>PARLIAMENT yesterday approved changes to the Constitution that will enlarge the pool of overseas-born children who enjoy the right to Singapore citizenship by descent.<br><br>Children born abroad to Singaporean mothers will now enjoy the same right to citizenship by descent as those with Singaporean fathers.<br><br>Advertisement<br><br>Children born overseas to Singapore citizens by descent will also qualify for citizenship. However, their parents must have lived in Singapore for a total of five years or more previously, or for at least two out of the five years before their birth.<br><br>The changes are a key plank in the Government's plan to boost the citizen population in the face of a baby shortage as the number of newborns plummeted to an all-time low of 36,000 last year.<br><br>Yesterday, Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Lee Hsien Loong said the moves are to update the citizenship laws, which have remained largely unchanged since the 1960s, as more citizens now work, study, live and start families abroad.<br><br>Indeed, between 2000 and 2002, the number of foreigners granted permanent residence under the sponsorship of their Singaporean spouse shot up from 4,000 to almost 5,800. The number of foreign-born children granted citizenship went up from 1,900 to 2,700 - by 41 per cent - between 1991 and last year.<br><br>The change in allowing citizenship by descent from female Singaporeans reflects the fact that many women are married and overseas 'but have parents here and they keep their links back here'.<br><br>Recognising that more people now need to travel for work, the residence requirements for permanent residents applying for citizenship have also been relaxed.<br><br>A PR needs to be resident here for at least two years before he can qualify to be a citizen. The maximum period he can be away during that time used to be six months. It is now 12 months.<br><br>During yesterday's debate, three women MPs cheered the fact that citizenship laws will now be gender neutral.<br><br>Miss Irene Ng (Tampines GRC) delivered an impassioned speech on equality for all citizens.<br><br>'Often we are told we live in a patriarchal society... but I just want to caution against using such cultural arguments to justify any unequal treatment of our citizens. In the long run, people will not accept that citizenship can be fully practised other than among equals.'<br><br>Replying, Mr Lee maintained that Singapore was still a patrilineal society. He cited as evidence the many women who ask their MPs for help after their husbands desert them and stop supporting the family. Few men do the same, he noted.<br><br>'But it is shifting gradually, so we are also shifting slightly less gradually,' he said.<br><strong><br>Parliament passed five other amendments to the Constitution. One was a change to allow the transfer of reserves from the Government to organisations listed in the Fifth Schedule of the Constitution. The schedule is a list of statutory boards and government-linked companies whose reserves cannot be drawn down without the approval of the Elected President.<br></strong><br></blockquote>Now...this is like camouflage 101. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
