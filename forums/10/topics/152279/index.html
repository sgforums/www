            <div class='col-md body'>Foreign talents.Why?Becoz if a country wants to attract foreign talents,she must possess some attractive qualities for foreigners to work and eventually migrate n stay at that place.<br><br>Take for instance,U.S.A n Australia,why many ppl from all around the world wanted to work n stay there?Reasons is becoz they are developed countries,high-salary based,good social welfare if u become their citizens(at least better than Singapore,which our government only know how to exploit their ppl),vast land,big market n democratic politics(This can attract ppl from communist countries such as mainland China n Singapore).<br><br>But let us look at what our country possess,the size of our country is soooo small.In international language or what our dear Lou Ah Goh's wife say,our country size is "peanut"!!!By bringing in so many foreigners,our populations will become "over-crowded".(P.S.Some ppl should practise swimming now becoz one day we might migrate to the sea <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> )<br><br>Also,we have limited market n job market which are becoming obvious in recent years.This will bring in social problems.Moreover,our politics are not transparent,which also make it least attractive to foreigners.So when our country leaders like Lou Ah Lee,Lou Ah Goh n Siao Ah Loong say want to bring in foreign talents,they must ask themselves,do they have enough "quality n quantity" to attract those foreigners or not,ALAMAK!!!!</div>

I think it is disturbing that we are tagging individuals with sterotypes based upon the country of their origin. Sure, he might be from China, she might be from India, but that does not make them any more inferior than us. Instead, we should take it upon ourselves to make sure that they feel Singapore, the Singaporean way, and that it is the diversity they bring that make us all the more richer and stronger. Yes, they outrun us in school, they take our jobs, but it is, we must admit, that they are better in that field. We must, all of us, rise up to this challenge they bring and just make ourselves better to be competitive. It is really distgusting watching individuals kicking the dust, creating for themselves false illusions of superiority.<br><br>However, that does not mean we must become some playground for all trying to find a better life. We are a nation crafted out of the blood and sweat of our forefathers, our parents and ourselves, we must never allow our country be trodden over by individuals who think they can enter into this society just because they want to. Thus, while we should be open to diversity, we should also be stringent of the quality of the individuals who want to become citizens of this state.<br></div></blockquote>how would u feel if u got replaced by a CMI FT at work?</div>
