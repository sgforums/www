Guess I might have not been exactly clear in my earlier post. Apologize for that. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Anyway back to the topic proper, I was actually thinking along the line that if the current screening process could have been improved upon, then we might not even have the current pool size of Â‘less-academically-inclinedÂ’ students.<br><br>For all we know, it could be well be a matter of sufficient time for the effective communication of understanding currently allowed in the existing examination structure and duration which may be inaccurately classifying students into the above mentioned categories.<br><br>Regardless of that particular concern for the moment, I believe the main interest that you are looking forward for discussion would be whether we should have an alternate system that in theory, is supposed to be better and more effective in maximizing the full talent and potential of these Â‘Less-Academically-InclinedÂ’ (herein after referred to as Â‘LAIÂ’) students.<br><br>The notion if implemented, would probably come as something similar like the recent Sports or Art Schools? Except that this alternate system will cater mainly for LAI Students of course.<br><br>Ideally, the allowing of more time and slowing of teaching pace should be something which can be viewed as beneficial to the LAI students.<br><br>However, taking into considerations that this will actually be something which involves even more drastic and significant of an even more in-depth form of Â‘StreamingÂ’ for the students, my personal view is that it would probably be better if we remain as of the current path Â– which is to continue having all EM1, EM2 and EM3 students housed under a single school AND to gradually do away with the untimely streaming process at the primary school level.<br><br>If we are truly sincere in making proper improvements to the general Education System, then we should strive along this paradigm shift with the reminder to keep the level of unnecessary stress level low and to maximize real learning under a more generous and flexible pace, WITHOUT compromise to invisible but important concerns such as taking into account how an identified LAI student may view or be viewed upon by his /her immediate surrounding environment.<br><br>To do this, a possible arrangement could be to introduce and extend flexi-learning hours in schools after the official school hours.<br><br>To do this, participating schools should first have a single session which officially should end by 1300hr.<br><br>With one hour of break allowed for meal and relaxing, Flexi-learning time can commence after 1400hr with a DIFFERENT teacher who is not responsible for the normal classroom time teaching of the subjects to the particular class of students.<br><br>A ideal Flexi-learning class can be grouped according to subjects, and the students in it made up of the various classrooms from the same level.<br><br>Apart from promoting lateral interaction opportunities, the self confidence of students could be raised when stigmas about EM1 students being extremely smart and EM3 students being lousy in studies can also be corrected more easily thru the studentsÂ’ efforts in communications as well.

And just to rectify on a particular misconception above also, I am for any suitable changes to the System as well.<br><br>The only concern that I have expressed above is that I feel an Evolutionary paced style of Change would come to be better accepted by the general public, and on controlling concerns, more effectively and efficiently manageable as compared to those which belonged to a Revolutionary style.<br><br>Coming on to the concern with regards to the cluster of population who may not be able to follow up with the pace of the Mainstream and be falling through the gaps, we have to acknowledge that this is actually not a simple or isolated matter to take care.<br><br>Going back to a couple of extracts that both you and gerrykoh has provided us with in some of the earlier posts above, gerrykoh has actually mentioned a young 17 year old girl who is without qualifications and without interest in studying, while you raised a concern on what nature of help could be made available for those who are1) underage to work and 2) whom have dropped out of school.<br><br>What is worth noting from the two different cases above is that while gerrykohÂ’s example involved someone without the market deemed appropriate qualification, the subject in mention is however, of legal age to work.<br><br>By the longitudinal view, it is without a doubt that gaining employment for the young lady would be a severe challenge given todayÂ’s employer expectations.<br><br>But so long as the young lady is WILLING to lower her expectations on her beginning working career path, she will still hold a chance of gaining success eventually over the long run Â– should she preserve and work on diligently towards her goals.<br><br>The doors of Education in Singapore, fortunately remains relatively open to most even when they can be way pass the typical student age.<br><br>For the young lady, the avenues for her to return back into a private school once more for her Â‘NÂ’ or Â‘OÂ’ levels, an ITE certificate, a polytechnic diploma, or even a basic degree. These avenues and opportunities has always been open to people of higher age as we may see from working class in age 30s and 40s furthering their knowledge in ITE or polytechnic night classes.<br><br>Returning back to your example of someone who is underage and out of school however, when the Law prescribes the minimum age allowed for a minor to work, the stipulated age limits stays, irregardless of who the employers are Â– be them from the Private or Public sector.<br><br>This could be a sad fact, but we must remain firm that there can be no double standards allowed.<br><br>The vacuum which is created in the example is regrettable.<br><br>Under such circumstances, the only possible option that comes to mind at the moment might only be to intervene INDIRECTLY to effective eradicate on the possible arise of such scenarios again.<br><br>A possible stoppage to such scenarios could be enforced through extend the duration and coverage of Compulsory Education in Singapore from its current six years coverage over primary education, to an additional of 4 years over secondary education to make up on a minimum of 10 years compulsory education.<br><br>Not only will this extension serve to provide a more realistic match to the minimum level of Education that the population in Singapore will require in order to stay relevant to the changing world, the extension can also go on to ensure that under all possible worst case scenarios Â– even the most academically un-inclined student will still be educated to at least a Â‘NÂ’ level qualification, even if it means he / she may only have 3 or 4 subject passes.<br><br>The mere possession of a GCE Â‘NÂ’ level certification can at least help to open doors to positions in basic office or secretary work. This in turn, improves and better ensures on higher survivability rate for a Â‘LAIÂ’ individual for a worst case scenario when he / she will need to fend for their livelihood after coming out from school and they do not receive any more form of Education from then onwards.<br><br>While it will be truly a challenge to fully address and attempt to extend a helping hand out to every single one of those whom may have unfortunately fallen through such gaps away from the Mainstream, the minimum help that the public sector may in the least offer to this particular group in conjunction to the above, would be to open employment opportunity doors for low complexity jobs such as those of a Corporate Support nature.<br><br>With the candidature selection criteria preference REVERSED, the selecting job seeking candidates as based on those with the lowest BUT within the established qualification criteria parameters and on age factor, e.g. giving selection preference on an open position to a 40 years old over a 20 years old, this will all be a form of help to LAI individuals.<br><br>The principles for the above should be based on considerations with regards to qualifications, age and factors like, in comparative assessment to the probability chances of the same candidate securing another job out in the private sector.<br><br>On ending note, my personal opinion is that the task and responsibility of Â‘pulling the bottom upÂ’ should be more of the responsibilities of the Elites.<br><br>Under the Doctrines of Sun Tze, a country as akin to an organizational body, establish Elite Systems because upon training, an Elite can then disseminate, pass on, and handle knowledge and order of diversified natures downwards in a more effective and efficient manner as compared to multiple directives coming straight down from only a centralized source.<br><br>Since such is the order, and having been armed with better and more accurate understanding on the actual conditions going on at the Ground level, Elitists should bear on their shoulders, more of such inherited responsibilities and to constantly review and introduced improvements and relief changes to the respective system or field which they either be leading or charged with the care of .<br><br>And reverting this into the education-related context of our discussion, perhaps this could imply something by the relevant policy analysts maybe?<br><br>Change need not always come one way only from the CRPP. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div>
