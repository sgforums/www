Guess I might have not been exactly clear in my earlier post. Apologize for that. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Anyway back to the topic proper, I was actually thinking along the line that if the current screening process could have been improved upon, then we might not even have the current pool size of Â‘less-academically-inclinedÂ’ students.<br><br>For all we know, it could be well be a matter of sufficient time for the effective communication of understanding currently allowed in the existing examination structure and duration which may be inaccurately classifying students into the above mentioned categories.<br><br>Regardless of that particular concern for the moment, I believe the main interest that you are looking forward for discussion would be whether we should have an alternate system that in theory, is supposed to be better and more effective in maximizing the full talent and potential of these Â‘Less-Academically-InclinedÂ’ (herein after referred to as Â‘LAIÂ’) students.<br><br>The notion if implemented, would probably come as something similar like the recent Sports or Art Schools? Except that this alternate system will cater mainly for LAI Students of course.<br><br>Ideally, the allowing of more time and slowing of teaching pace should be something which can be viewed as beneficial to the LAI students.<br><br>However, taking into considerations that this will actually be something which involves even more drastic and significant of an even more in-depth form of Â‘StreamingÂ’ for the students, my personal view is that it would probably be better if we remain as of the current path Â– which is to continue having all EM1, EM2 and EM3 students housed under a single school AND to gradually do away with the untimely streaming process at the primary school level.<br><br>If we are truly sincere in making proper improvements to the general Education System, then we should strive along this paradigm shift with the reminder to keep the level of unnecessary stress level low and to maximize real learning under a more generous and flexible pace, WITHOUT compromise to invisible but important concerns such as taking into account how an identified LAI student may view or be viewed upon by his /her immediate surrounding environment.<br><br>To do this, a possible arrangement could be to introduce and extend flexi-learning hours in schools after the official school hours.<br><br>To do this, participating schools should first have a single session which officially should end by 1300hr.<br><br>With one hour of break allowed for meal and relaxing, Flexi-learning time can commence after 1400hr with a DIFFERENT teacher who is not responsible for the normal classroom time teaching of the subjects to the particular class of students.<br><br>A ideal Flexi-learning class can be grouped according to subjects, and the students in it made up of the various classrooms from the same level.<br><br>Apart from promoting lateral interaction opportunities, the self confidence of students could be raised when stigmas about EM1 students being extremely smart and EM3 students being lousy in studies can also be corrected more easily thru the studentsÂ’ efforts in communications as well. In a way, parents can also sigh a breath of relief when they know that their children will no longer need to be tagged with a very distinctive and perceptional disadvantage of being publicly declared a Â‘LAIÂ’ student, i.e. EM3.<br><br>Having a teacher who does not teaches the levelsÂ’ normal classes also helps to ensure that inherent skeptics or perspectives about a studentÂ’s can be more effectively minimized to a level where the occurrence of teacher biasness can be better controlled.<br><br>In implementation, the Flexi-Learning class should be made open to walk-in volunteers so as to convey clear that such classes are not remedial in nature, but rather, a more in-depth and relaxed alternate pace of learning opportunity. For identified LAI students however, they should be involved under as a compulsory practice.<br><br>The concept of Flexi-Learning does not only apply merely to academic related areas. Alternatively, variety of non-examinable but personal improving course could also be introduced to students under this mechanism.<br><br>For the Science avid, more complex and non-curriculum covered areas such as basic botany could be introduced earlier to interested takers who need not fear learning as a phenomena which will ALWAYS come to be associated with an examination at the end of the course.<br><br>While the above in mention only covers Operational concerns, we do need to take into account that there will still be an Administrative burden which existing teachers in schools are unlikely to carry on in additional to their already packed spectrum of duties.<br><br>Hence this is just a note to acknowledge that in order for the Flexi-Learning alternative to be introduced or even work, consideration and re-design of existing systems in place will also have to be tweaked along for the fine tuning of the entire concept.<br><br></div></blockquote>Juz watch the entire National Day Rally.<br><br>At last, they are finally willing to place more emphasis on (i) actual REAL LEARNING, (ii) reducing on the current syllabus and (iii) pursuing a modular approach in addition to non-core subjects. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>
