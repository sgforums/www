            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by oxford mushroom:</div><div class="quote_body">7. Ah, I understand your question now. My fault for not making it clear then. You understood the word 'limited' as a verb, meaning to restrict. I was using it as an adjective, to mean 'small in size' or 'few in number'. This is how an online dictionary defines it:<br><br>adj 1: small in range or scope; "limited war"; "a limited success"; "a limited circle of friends" [ant: unlimited] 2: subject to limits or subjected to limits [syn: circumscribed] 3: including only a part 4: mediocre [syn: modified] 5: not excessive 6: having a specific function or scope; "a special (or specific) role in the mission" [syn: special] 7: not unlimited; "a limited list of choices"<br><br>8. Agree. Apart from being overwhelmingly anti-crime (which our population supports), our judicial system prides itself on being very efficient, defined by conventional benchmarks like the number of cases heard. However, are we sacrificing justice for the sake of efficiency? Rumours have it that judges themselves have remarked, "We are clearing cases, not hearing cases."<br><br>9) Well, you will have to persuade the majority of the population to change their opinion then. Educated or not in your view, in a democratic system, the majority voice rules. It is not right for the minority to impose its will upon the majority, is it?<br><br>10) Future guilt? Sorry, what's the question? I don't know what you mean.<br><br></div></blockquote>Oxford mushroom,<br><br>thx for ur prompt reply. (I must be repeating this phrase too many times now.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">)<br><br>1 &amp; 2) I know the dictionary definition, anbd i thank you for clearing the misunderstanding. Yet, the issue isn't really cleared yet: there must be some mechanism that causes a limited number of appeals to be present; the question is how is this achieved?<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" title="Exclamation"><br><br>3) I share your sentiment.<br><br>4) In actuality, if you want to talk about the philosophy of democracy, it goes both ways. And Knowledge is a crucial measure of democracy. Just as it is wrong for the minority to impose their view on the majority, so it is wrong theoretically for the majority to bully the minority into conforming to their view, which is why countries like the USA have laws protecting gays (I'm NOT going to debate this issue here), to protect these minorities. Of course, practice differs...<br><br>But anyway, we can't really be sure that the people support or not support the Death Penalty because they are not informed enough about it. The results from a poll of them on their perception on the Death Penalty will be analogous to asking p1 kids whether they think George Bush or John Kerry will be a better president of the USA, when these kids undertand nuts abt the kind of people Bush and Kerry are, and maybe not even what is the USA.<br><br>5) Ivevco kindly pointed out that the name of the movie I was asking for was "<span style="font-style: italic;">Minority Report</span>".  My question to you was, what makes you 100% sure that a guilty person once released, will commit the same crime again? Or that, even if under a deficient release, the same person won't get caught for committing another crime? Anyway, to think abt it, abolitionists are NOT calling for an abolition of Criminal Punnishment, merely for the abolition of the Death Penalty. By all means, use life imprisonment if necessary; that way no other crime will be committed by the guilty party too. And at least, the amount of irreparable damage done by a wrong life-sentence conviction is less than the amount of irreparable damage done by a wrong Death-Penalty conviction, which is essentially infinite.<br><br>Btw, it is by empirical observation i.e. the scientific method that I determine that Singaporeans are not educated enough on this issue, not based on my own sentiment.<br><br>thx.<br><br>Cheers,<br>the (still abolitionist) pikamaster</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by pikamaster:</div><div class="quote_body">there must be some mechanism that causes a limited number of appeals to be present; the question is how is this achieved?<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" title="Exclamation"><br></div></blockquote>All capital punishment cases go to appeal upon conviction automatically. I think your question is why the number of <strong>successful </strong>appeals is so low. The reason, I think, is the nature of the legal process. You can only appeal on point of law and if the High Court judge has ruled correctly based on the law, you will lose the appeal. As I have mentioned before, the problem is that during the investigation and trial, the prosecution has all the advantage. They can detain the suspect for long periods, interrogate them without the presence of the defence lawyer and have access to all the forensic experts. By the time you go to trial, the defence team has very little to support its case whilst the prosecution has built up a formidable case against the accused. This is made worse by the fact that our courts are so efficient, cases go to hearing so quickly that the busy defence lawyer often does not have enough time to do a good job at preparation.<br><br>You must understand that in an adversarial system, the judge can only decide based on which side gives a more convincing argument of the case. If the prosecution has all the advantage, chances are the prosecution will win the argument. To be fair, if the prosecution finds out in the course of their investigation that the accused is innocent, they will drop the case before going to court.<br><br>4) You said, "...so it is wrong theoretically for the majority to bully the minority into conforming to their view..." But when we are dealing with an issue like this, when the question is whether we should retain the death sentence or not, there can be only one answer, 'yes' or 'no'. If society is divided in its opinion but with the majority insisting that it should stay, can be it right to ignore its wishes? Surely in a democratic system, the way to resolve such a dispute is to put it to the vote and that majority rules.<br><br>One way to know how the population feels about this issue is a referendum, which our government is always against (for reasons I do not agree with). Another way is to support opposition parties who campaign against capital punishments in the General Election. We may never be sure how Singaporeans will vote on this, short of a referendum; but judging from coffee-shop talk and the media reports after the Huang Na case, I don't think you will have much public support.<br><br>5) Your other question, ".. what makes you 100% sure that a guilty person once released, will commit the same crime again?"<br><br>I don't think that is the reason for retaining the death sentence. It is not fear that the criminal will re-offend that we put someone to death. I think the main justification for capital punishment is the belief that there must be retribution for wrongs done. Kind of karma: whatsoever you sow, you shall reap....an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth. It is what drives the father of a murdered daughter to insist on witnessing the hanging of the murderer with his own eyes. Without that, he cannot find closure and society believes that he should not be denied that satisfaction. In some societies and cultures, if the State does not perform this duty adequately, the relatives of a victim will feel a need to avenge the wrongs done by vigilante action.<br><br>Finally, does it mean that if Singaporeans are not sufficiently educated about an issue, we should decide what is right for them, instead of allowing them to decide for themselves? That sounds very much like the paternalistic approach of our government.</div>

I didn't exactly mention foreigners in my post, did I? unless, of course, u think I am a foreigner, which then you would be sadly mistaken.<br><br>And anyway, I've been wondering if the anti foregn-talent sentiment actually derived from the government's own attitude toward "foreign interference in domestic affairs"...<br><br>The fact is, by adopting such an attitude, you are basically closing urself to any form of constructive criticism that might come from overseas. And that, I have to say, is a rather un-democratic as an action in itself. And that is rather childish too, since we are still a young nation and should learn from those more established than us.<br><br>And besides, public debates are not going to be very useful, given the tight control the government has over the local media in defence of what it calls "national interest". The government is certainly not going to sacrifice even a fraction of public support for the sake of showing objectivity in the Death Penalty issue. Look how quickly it canned the response to the NKF issue after people began suggesting, in letters to the forums, that information on all the board members of NKF should be made public, and that other large-scale groups and GLCs like (unsurprisingly) Temasek Holdings should expose their pay and benefit packages in full detail. In fact, the minster even made a public statement that people should start feeling pity for Durai, and worse still manipulated his poor daughter's statements to suit this particular purpose.

I have no objections having their representatives speak in Singapore, as long as they observe and respect our laws.

Overpopulation is an issue but by no stretch of imagination can one use the death penalty as a solution to this problem. It almost sounds as if we are going to cull humans to solve overpopulation. There are other more effective ways. Even forced sterilization, barbaric as it is, would be preferable.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Pika, though some human rights advocates might not see gay rights as part of the "agenda". This article might interested you still:<br><br>August 5, 2005<br>inaccurate reporting by gay media fuels islamaphobia: al-fatiha<br>By Faisal Alam<br><br>Faisal Alam, founder of Al-Fatiha, warns against the gay mediaÂ’s failure to accurately report on stories which fuels growing Islamaphobia and hatred towards Islamic world; and urges gays and lesbians to view the queer liberation movement through a broader lens of social justice and human rights.<br><br>In the wake of the recent London bombings, the Western world has been propelled into another vicious cycle of revenge against Muslims and the Islamic world. While mainstream media around the world have more accurately represented the outpouring of condemnation by Muslim organisations and institutions against the attacks in London, the gay and lesbian media in the United States has unfortunately succumbed once again to the false belief that Islam condones acts of violence including suicide bombings, executions of civilians and even the killing of homosexuals.<br><br>Started in 1997 by Faisal Alam (top pic), the Al-Fatiha Foundation now has seven chapters in the United States (in Atlanta, Houston, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, New York City, San Diego and Washington DC), and affiliate organisations in Britain, Canada and South Africa. The group is holding its 5th International Retreat for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Intersex, Questioning Muslims &amp; their Allies Sept 2 - 5, 2005, in Atlanta, Georgia, USA.<br>On July 19, a number of exiled Iranian organisations reported that two teenagers, one aged 18 and the other a minor (who's age is reported to be either 16 or 17) were hanged in Iran, a country that President Bush infamously labelled as part of the "axis of evil." The news of this horrific execution was blasted across gay and lesbian media websites with pictures that depict the final moments of the teenagers as they were escorted to face their inevitable death. On June 20, the largest gay and lesbian political organisation in the United States, the Human Rights Campaign issued a press release condemning the execution and calling on Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice to condemn the brutal killings in Iran and similar attacks on sexual and gender minorities in other countries.<br><br>While the gay and lesbian media in the United States and even the Human Rights Campaign jumped quickly to condemn the executions, government officials in Sweden and the Netherlands announced that they would halt any extraditions of gay people to Iran. OutRage!, a queer political organisation in the UK even went as far as calling for the European Union to institute trade sanctions against Iran for its on-going assault against sexual and gender minorities. While these Western organisations and governments quickly came to the judgement that Iran was displaying a brutal form of oppression, very few people took the time to research the details of the case or even consult with experts who deal with such news on a daily basis. In fact it was almost a week later that we began to read more accurate accounts of why the teens were executed from international human rights groups including Amnesty International, the Human Rights Watch and the International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission Â– all of whom have contacts in Iran and ways to confirm news of such incidents from independent sources.<br><br>While no one will ever know why these two young men were executed in Iran, what remains clear is that the hysteria surrounding the executions was enormous and only fed to the growing Islamaphobia and hatred towards Muslims and the Islamic world. The fact that the executions occurred in Iran also fed the frenzy of rumours that Iran will be the next target in the so-called "War on Terror." While it may not seem that the execution of two young men propagates the notion that Iran is part of the "axis of evil" one must only look at the lack of outrage expressed at the recent news of three men who were sentenced to be stoned to death in Nigeria for their supposed "homosexuality." Unfortunately the graphic pictures that accompanied the news from Iran only added fuel to the fire that is burning around the world in the minds of those that continue to perceive Islam as a religion of violence and terror. Furthermore, the lack of investigation into the case before a worldwide call to action was proclaimed will probably only perpetuate the cycle of violence against sexual and gender minorities in countries like Iran.<br></div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>There are two lessons that should be learned from this tragic case:<br><br>1) The first is that it is imperative for Western organisations, queer and non-queer, to build connections with progressive NGOs and other groups on the ground in countries like Iran. While many feminist groups and HIV/AIDS organisations have done a tremendous job in reaching out to sister organisations around the world, queer groups in the West have done very little to help become part of the growing international queer movement. Apart from efforts of organisations like Amnesty International and its LGBT program, the International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission, the Astraea Foundation and the Human Rights Watch in the United States, very little effort has been made to educate Western LGBT communities about the real and accurate situation faced by sexual and gender minorities abroad and how to support them in ways that will not cause further backlash. By creating a movement of solidarity, we can begin to more accurately report news and accounts of human rights abuses, while also calling upon our own communities to take action and speak out against such abuses - but only when the time is right and when it is in the best interest of those that we seek to help. Otherwise we will fail to accomplish our real objective - to help alleviate the suffering of queer people in countries like Iran. In fact our actions if not conducted properly may very well add to the targeted arrests of gay men and the subsequent torture and death that they may face, in a country such as Iran.<br><br>2) Secondly, we must begin to view our gay and lesbian liberation movement through a broader lens of social justice and human rights. While we seek to condemn the executions of gay teens in Iran, we must remember that our own country (the United States) is one of only five in the entire world that executes juvenile offenders. In fact it was only in March 2005 that the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that the death penalty could not be applied to juveniles who committed crimes when they were under the age of 18. Since 2000, countries that have been known to have executed juvenile offenders include China, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Iran, Pakistan and the United States. Thirteen of these 21 executions of young people have occurred in the United States. While other governments in the Western world continue to move toward a consensus that the death penalty is an inhumane form of punishment Â– no matter what the crime Â– the United States refuses to outlaw capital punishment. In 2004, China, Iran, the United States, and Vietnam accounted for 97 per cent of the executions recorded by Amnesty International. While activists in the United States are quick to condemn the executions of people in the Islamic world, we refuse to look at the issue of capital punishment as it applies to all people Â– regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity. The outlawing of capital punishment is not a "gay" issue Â– but it is a matter of social justice and human rights.<br><br>In a time when Islamaphobia flourishes in Europe and the United States, it is imperative for the gay and lesbian media to look beyond its Western "pink" glasses. We must not feed into the hysteria surrounding the so-called "war on terrorism," and the assault on law-abiding Muslims. Nor must we let our anger and outrage against regimes like those in Iran interfere with our work to strategically condemn human rights abuses against sexual and gender minorities, in consultation with individuals who's lives will be affected by our actions.<br><br>Gay and lesbian media, together with LGBT activists must work together with international human rights organisations that have great experience in dealing with news of horrific human rights abuses. Together, with building connections and supporting LGBT organisations abroad, we can continue our work to build a truly international queer movement for equality and liberation.<br><br>Faisal Alam is a queer Muslim activist of Pakistani descent. As the founder of Al-Fatiha, Faisal has represented the LGBT Muslim community at national and international conferences and forums, speaking out about the many challenges facing queer Muslims around the world. Faisal's professional work has included HIV/AIDS education and prevention, LGBT political organising, and women's reproductive rights. Faisal currently resides in Atlanta, GA where he continues his social justice work to build a world of peace, love and justice.</div>
