The USA is a hypocrite nation and international bully. It is better to take the Swedes as the yardstick.</blockquote>If america have it, why shouldn't singapore ? Talking about human rights, I find America to be one of the countries that was considered to be more "advanced" compared with other countries. We r not aiming to be the number one in "human right" record.<br><br><blockquote>There are instances where a person has been wrongly framed for murder and evidence clearing him of involvement came about a few years too late.

Even if u jail a person and he live in prison fro many years, u can't undo the damages tat had been committed to him.</div>

It is the same as driving at a speed of 50km is legal while driving at 120 km is not. The extent is important.<br><br><blockquote>A lot of ppl are greeed for money and they committed crimes for it.So should they be all hanged due to greed? </blockquote>In the eye of the law, the kind of crimes they commit is important, not the motive. A person stealing money from pickpocketing and another who perform kidnapping will get different sentence because the potential harm it caused is different<br><br><blockquote>Yes, drug traffickers are wrong.But when drug are available,a person has a choice not to take it.So just put the blame totally on drug traffickers is wrong. </blockquote>In singapore, the person taking the drugs is considered to be an offence too. In fact they too get to be jailed after the were caught with drugs twice or more. So maybe it is more comforting to u tat drug traffickers is not blame totally.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> They just get blamed more  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
