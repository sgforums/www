U can't take the drug in its raw form. The form which u see on the street now is heavily mixed with other substances to lower the purity. It is something like alcohol.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Inhumane to ban smoking?Don't make me laugh,pls.</blockquote>Wat so funny about tat statement ?<br><br><blockquote>What u said is right.But drug addicts take drug at their own free will,isn't it? </blockquote>So ? Then might as well sell firearms in singapore since both buyer and seller transact at their own will isn't it ?<br><br><blockquote>I say the govt is double standard because selling cigarettes is legal while drug traffickers get hang.What i want to stress is the punishment for drug trafficker is not only inhumane but also too heavy for the crime. </blockquote>I don't see much double standard here. As said much before selling drugs and selling cigerrettes is much like driving at 50km and 150km on the road<br><br><blockquote>Both selling cigarettees &amp; drug traficking are motivated by money.Both cause harm to cosumers.One is legal and the other get hang.Still no inconsistency of principle?</blockquote>Might as well say selling ice cream is legal while selling drugs is not. I mean your point to compare with cigerrettes is already a bad point to start off with<br><br><blockquote>There are many drug addicts in S'pore.PAP govt should be blamed for such a situation.Perhaps the PM &amp; ministers concerned should be hang for their faults (since they support death penalty).Fortunately i don't support death penalty,So they shoud resign instead</blockquote>Statistically speaking, the number of drug addict in singapore is much lesser compared with other countries. Hence if going by your line of thinking, then we should conclude the gov is doing a good job.<br><br><blockquote>A govt can enact a law that all thieves should be chopped off their hands.Then when some thieves' hands are chopped off as punishments,the govt would say they know the law and yet they commit the crime so it is not fault of the govt.</blockquote>Theives r theives, kidnappers r kidnapers, murderers r murderers, drug traffickers r drug traffickers.Different crimes deserve different treatment. It is not uncommon to have death penalty for drug traffickers in many countries. If u say it is the gov fault, then u r condemning perhaps most of the countries leaders.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Cutting off hand is cruel,so is caning a person bleeding.<br><br>Killing a person is not cruel?Stupidissmart, your sense is different from common ppl.</blockquote>I never say it is not cruel. i was saying it was necessary. U think jailing a person is not cruel ? He have wasted his years in his limited life and tat probably is a much cruel act than caning. All punishments r curel, otherwise everyone will perform cruelty to other people.<br><br><blockquote>Firstly, death penalty is inhumane.Many advanced countries have abolished such punishment.S'pore has become an advanced country.We should similarily follow. </blockquote>Many advanced countries have not abolish the death penalty as well. Moreover every country have a different views, different cultures and different needs. We shouldn't just follow blindly<br><br><blockquote>Secondly,drug traffickers do not intentionally want to kill anyone.They commit the crime for money and the addicts buy drugs voluntarily and most of them don't die after taking drug.So to use death penalty on drug traffickers is wrong under the principle of law.</blockquote>Drug trafficker intentionally wanted people to become drug addicts and tat is enough reason to kill them. If there is no drug trafficker, then there wouldn't be drug abuser and lives of the society will be protected. To use the death penalty to protect society is right and just and fulfil wat a law should do, protect the innocent.<br><br><blockquote>What if a relative of yours was framed for murder, executed and evidence absolving him of all involvement shows up 10 years later? WHat are you gonna do?  </blockquote>Wat if ? There is a lot of wat if. Wat if your relative get to be gang raped and murdered and the murderer get away with 5 years of jail ? Wat if your son who is a scholar but goes to the drug and becoem a drug abuser. In his desperation for money, he use a knife and points at your wife for money. I am sorry man, ther r mistakes but we still have to mete out justice if required</div>
