Do you think moral conscience alone can play a very large role in ensuring that <strong>most</strong> people are deterred from trafficking drugs (good money <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> ) or to vent their anger on the death of someone <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"> ? If anyone thinks so, well that person is naive!<br><br>Countries abolish the death sentence not because it cannot reduce crime but because they find it in their higher self that it is their responsibility to make sentences more humane. There is no way we can measure how much the death sentence had deterred people from commiting crimes. A crime deterred is a figure cant be noted. No need bombastic survey or findings, just ask youself (anyone in this forum) are u deterred by death? If are you not, then no other penalties can stop u, if you are, u got the answer.<br><br>Are u deterred by death?<br></div>

So it is not onli the consideration of confidence alone as u try to paint but confidence through an extent the weightage of fruit and consequences. Death sentence in my opinion act on the consequence.<br><br>If there is this person who jumps into execution of plan without considering any consequences as u try to paint, death sentence had failed as a deterrent so as any penalty the law can offer.

Further more it is in my opinion (and i believe the government's opinion) that death serves a better (not foolproof as no penalty is) deterrent.<br><br>Yes life sentence provides a buffer period but death penalties provide such grace too. In Singapore a person will not be executed immediately and a buffer will be allowed in which that person will be in jail for a period of time. I agree that life sentence allows a greater buffer period and yes it is the flaw of death penalties.<br><br>Life sentence has it flaws too. The greatest flaw in life sentence (it is the greatest punishment for that country) is that a prisoner serving it will not be detered by any greater punishment from murdering more people or causing more trouble in prison. A person facing a death penalty will before execution experience the same lack of deterrent but at least he would be a possible killer or troublemaker for the next 50 years until he die of natural death.<br><br>Which penalty do not has flaws? If we will to based our judgement on flaws alone, we cant even determine if anything is justifiable anot. Thus the entire discussion had varied from the debate on the flaws of penalties to the argument on the effectiveness of penalties.<br><br>Based on my opinion and my findings that death (although it has flaws) is an effective deterrent against crime and it's moral righteousness cant be determined clearly, it should be allowed.</div>

The law agrees that human and animals have their rights to be treated with respect and dignity, to be protected from ill treatments.

Ever heard of sth called child/maid abuse?<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>A punnishment can be morally right if it achieves justice properly without crossing over into the world of vengeance. The reason why capital punnishment is immoral is because in capital punnishment, the State is conducting vengeance on the behalf of the murder victim's family, sometimes even without their consent. And that's for murder; for drug-trafficking, you are conducting vengeance for the drug addicts, when possibly all the addicts want  are freedom from the influence of drugs.<br><br>Jailing is morally right as long as the prisons have acceptable conditions - obviously, they have to be spartan - and prisoners don't undergo torture while they are in jail. Think of it, jailing is merely a more severe form of "grounding".<br><br>Caning is immoral because it constitutes torture and physical abuse.<br><br>Taxation is not immoral in itself, since funds are required to run a country, but excessive taxation eg. continual raise of transport fares, unexplained increases of GST etc is immoral, as is the granting of excessively high salaries to top government officials with the hypocritical aim of preventing corruption.<br><br>the pikamaster</div>

Get real if u think that the sentencing of even the lightest penalty didnt come about from the slightest consideration of vengence and accountability to the victim.<br><br>Well although justice is about vengence, the structuring of the penalties (not sentencing of penalties) is based largely on the consideration of it as a deterrent because it is the responsibility of the state to ensure law and order and little is the state responsible for conducting vengence for the victims.<br><br><blockquote>Jailing is morally right as long as the prisons have acceptable conditions - obviously, they have to be spartan - and prisoners don't undergo torture while they are in jail. Think of it, jailing is merely a more severe form of "grounding".</blockquote>To say that jailing is 'morally right' is wrong. Everyone by birth have their entitlements and rights to be free. Not only about rights and entitlements, humans always aspire to be free. Humans are willing to the extent of fighting and dying for their right to be free. It shows how much we humans value our rights to be free and possibily as much as our rights to live at times. Since the right to be free is given to us by birth and is highly regarded by us to the extent we are willing to die for it, it is morally wrong to take that very right away (be it a life time or a period of time).<br><br>Jailing is morally right as long as the prisons have acceptable condition is an excuse and a lie like execution is morally right as long as death is quick and relatively painless.<br><br>Jailing is morally wrong but for social utility, a neccesary tool of law for every society and thats why it was legalised by all states. Remember no society is governed only by what is morally wrong or right but what is pragmatically neccesary.<br><br><blockquote>Taxation is not immoral in itself, since funds are required to run a country, but excessive taxation eg. continual raise of transport fares, unexplained increases of GST etc is immoral, as is the granting of excessively high salaries to top government officials with the hypocritical aim of preventing corruption.</blockquote>I will not want to go into this as it deserve a new thread on it's own.<br></div>
