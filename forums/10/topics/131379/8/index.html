Imagine a 18year old girl was hanged, juz becoz they found drugs in a 'hidden compartment'. Guilty or not, I believe the young girl deserves a second chance in life.<br><br>And SIS &gt; FYI, the max limit on the various drugs are very very low, making it a <strong>MANDATORY DEATH SENTENCE</strong> (judge cannot chose other sentence) for anyone found with more than the specified amount (which is a small amount).<br><br>PRP is right in the comment that drug traffickers are not DIRECTLY responsible for harming drug addicts - it is the addicts who harm themselves, no one else. The Death Penalty for drug traffickers in SG is not in line with the guidelines set by the UN.<br><br>A search on google about Singapore, some website says Singapore is a popular transit for drugs. Goes to show no matter the harsh laws on drug trafficking, SG is still very popular as a transit/destination for these traffickers.<br><br><strong>Most controversial is this law presumes a person to be Guilty and the burden is on the person to prove himself otherwise. </strong><br><br>Quoted:<br>Anyone found guilty of trafficking, importing or exporting the following specified amounts of drugs faces a mandatory death sentence: more than 1,200 grams of opium, more than 30 grams of morphine, more than 15 grams of heroin, more than 30 grams of cocaine, more than 500 grams of cannabis, more than 1,000 grams of cannabis mixture, more than 200 grams of cannabis resin, more than 250 grams of methamphetamine. The manufacture of the same drugs also carries the death penalty. The UN Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions has called for the death penalty to be eliminated for drug-related offences, referring to the Safeguards for the protection of the rights of those facing the death penalty, which state that the scope of crimes subject to the death penalty should not go beyond "intentional crimes with lethal or other extremely grave consequences."<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><br>Actually, one of the reasons for justice may be to right out the wrong for the victim. Though it was never stated as such, it do gives the idea tis is a form of revenge </blockquote>If law gives such an idea, then it must do alot more to fit into our "civilised" society. Law should never be an avenue for revenge.<br><br><blockquote><br>However we have to compare between the final result of the soceity instead of just individual. </blockquote>It is my belief that no one person is lesser than another, thus, if the law strives to sacrifice an <strong>innocent</strong> person or a group of innocent minority in favour of the majority, then this system is making a mockery of justice. We should be judged as an individual, on our deeds, not just so as to make way for the majority. Innocent or Guilty, <strong>NOT</strong> minority or majority!<br><br><blockquote><br>DO u agree tat if a death penalty, it do deter many forms of serious crimes such as murdering, firearms transaction, kidnapping, bank robbery and drug abuse ? If u compared statistic, u will find tat overall, more people benefited from tis system. It make little sense to save an apple by throwng away a basket of them </blockquote>The whole idea of the death penalty and other forms of punishment is indeed to deter and "scare" people. However:<br><br>1. Does Capital punishment really work <strong>better</strong>? "Scientific studies have consistently failed to find convincing evidence that the death penalty deters crime more effectively than other punishments." Statistics of drug abusers in SG rise and fall thru different times even long after our implementation of the death penalty for drug traffickers, indicating the fact that death penalty does not effectively deter these traffickers.<br><br>2. Is there a better way to prevent crime?  the best way to deter crime is to increase the certainty of detection, arrest and conviction. Most criminals think they can get away with it, esp drug traffickers, which is why they did it in the first place, and may even do it again. If detection is improved up til the stage of almost fail-safe, drug traffickers will realise that it is very difficult or impossible for them to get away undetected.<br><br>3. What should we do with the criminals? put them away, or kill them so that the rest of us live in peace? or help them integrate into the society? condemn them because they made a mistake out of folly or becoz they had little education to begin with?<br><br>i quote again:<br>"Are we assisting the socially excluded to reintegrate into society or are we disposing them off [sic] as rejects?"<br><br>4. Do we really need to kill them? <strong>Does it reflect well the state of civilisation that we have? </strong>Are we still living in a society that encourages execution? Is it humane? This goes a long way to show how "civilised" we really are.<br><br><blockquote><br>Wa about firearm ? It is the same isn't it ? U r deemed to possessed firearms when u really have firearms isn't it ? Wat else could have been added in to prove a person is a drug trafficker ? Maybe the best way is to make the public wary of being a victm to such a crime and be more careful in dealing with their belongings. </blockquote>The fact that our law shifts the proving part to the accused is totally in opposite of the fundamentals of law. If they need evidence, motive, etc to prove a person guilty of murder, I don't understand why the case of drug trafficking has such a superficial and simplified condition. They dont need to produce any other evidence, the only condition is to find u in possession of a banned drug. Possession not necessarily mean found on your body or bags, it can also mean a location where u have the keys to, perhaps a room, ur drawer/locker or ur car. This can open up to a huge range of possibilities!<br><br>What else could have been added you asked.<br>1. Does suspect have a motive? e.g. Suspect having financial diffculty? Suspect is an addict himself? Suspect bring in for friend?<br>2. Does suspect have any means of contact with the suppliers? there's no way i can get drugs if i dont even know where to get from!<br>3. Any proof of ownership or knowledge of possession of illegal drug? physical contact will probably leave fingerprints. Also further proves that suspect has knowledge of possession. If I have never seen or touched it, there is a chance that I have no knowledge of it.<br><br>There can be so much more that can be done to prove that the accused has knowledge of possession of illegal drugs. However, our law does not require all these. <strong>Is it becoz they are lazy or cant be bothered to find more evidence to prove their case? Or is it becoz a human life is nothing to them? Why else would the condition be so simplistic and easily established? </strong><br><br>Making the public more aware of their own belongings is a good idea. However, no matter how alert we can be, sometimes some people can still be pickpocketed. Likewise, putting stuff into a tired and unsuspecting traveller is easy, much easier in the case of the common Singaporean - we have grown to be very careless people as a whole. Therefore, should a careless person be sentenced to death?<br><br><blockquote>If u talk about drug abuser, than u should be glad tat the amount stipulated is actually very great. </blockquote>Contrary to what you said, the amount is very little. That is why sometimes a drug abuser, whom does not deserve death according to our law, suddenly and automatically becomes labeled as a drug trafficker and his punishment becomes death.<br><br><blockquote><br>Also u will find tat the drug addict cases drop drastically after harsher laws were implemented. Furthermore, I believe it is common sense to know at harsher punishment give higher deterence. Otherwise migt as well free all criminals again since if the lower the punishment the more deterence it gives out  </blockquote>Repeat what i have said before, statistics show that there's increase of drug abusers in SG even after implementation of death penalty for drug traffickers is a good indication that harsher punishment (death sentence) doesnt work. So it is really not our common sense we should trust, rather the actual facts and statistics.<br><br>So now i ask - why not mete out an <strong>EVEN HARSHER</strong> punishment since the death penalty does'nt work? Should we extend the punishment to execute the guilty's family members as well? Common sense says this harsher punishment should work better to deter. hahah back to Ancient China system! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The following link provides a study concluding that there is strong evidence of deterrent effect for capital punishment.

Shepherd<br>Additional information is available for the following registered author(s):<br>Â·	Hashem Dezhbakhsh<br>Abstract<br><br>Does capital punishment deter capital crimes? We use panel data covering the fifty states duringthe period 1960-2000 period to examine the issue. Our study is novel in four ways. First, we estimate the moratorium's full effect by using both pre- and postmoratorium evidence. Second, we exploit the moratorium as a judicial experiment to measure criminals' responsiveness to the severity of punishment; we compare murder rates immediately before and after changes in states' death penalty laws. The inference draws on the variations in the timing and duration of the moratorium across states provide a cross section of murder rate changes occurring in various time periods. Third, we supplement the before-and-after comparisons with regression analysis that disentangles the impact of the moratorium itself on murder from the effect on murder of actual executions. By using two different approaches, we avoid many of the modeling criticisms of earlier studies. Fourth, in addition to estimating 84 distinct regression modelsÂ—with variations in regressors, estimation method, and functional formÂ—our robustness checks examine the moratorium's impact on crimes that are not punishable by death. Our results indicate that capital punishment has a deterrent effect, and the moratorium and executions deter murders in distinct ways. This evidence is corroborated by both the before-and-after comparisons and regression analysis. We also confirm that the moratorium and executions do not cause similar changes in non-capital crimes. The results are highly robust.<br></div>

IMO, it is inaccurate at best.<br><br>How did i come to that conclusion?<br><br>I quote <strong>AGAIN</strong>:<br><br>"Claiming that the death penalty has been effective in controlling the trade in illicit drugs, the Singapore authorities reported an overall decline in the number of drug abusers arrested between 1994 and 2001....According to the website of the Singapore Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB), a total of 3,393 drug abusers were arrested in 2002. The number of new drug abusers increased by 16% compared to the figures for 2001."<br><br>This is very good evidence that the number of drug abusers (and thus their supplies via traffickers) rise and fall <strong>REGARDLESS</strong> of the death penalty which had been implemented in SG a long time ago.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>If death penalty works well as a long term deterrant, there shouldn't be a rise at all isn't it?</blockquote>Rise or fall in cases of drug abuse is not only a function of the deterrence against trafficking. Another crucial factor is success in enforcement which determines drug availability and consequently, market price. Yes, drug abusers have to pay market price to use illicit drugs.<br><br>Sadly, their misery contributes to the wealth of drug traffickers and peddlers.

Mr. Akabori, who was in prison for thirty-five years after he was forced to sign a confession by police, also appealed to the public: "Many people died in prison or are executed, even if they insist on their innocence.

Believing in a "lesser evil" is avoiding the fact that it is still an evil. Listen to your heart, not to your mind. AI is not unbiased certainly, but bias doesn't make the information they report inaccurate. They could be reporting a selective set of facts, which is after all the same modus operandi as the Straits Times itself, except that the latter salvages itself.<br><br>By trying to convince yourself tt something is the "lesser evil", you are effectively trying to consciously deem it as good while subconsciously still feeling the urge in your subconscious to condemn it. There's the Chinese proverb "ge an guan huo" : "watching the other shore while it burns." What does such a person think? "It is the lesser evil than my house being burnt down, so I can't do anything about it. As long as i remain unhurt, it is good"<br><br>Anyway, read this review about Amnesty International on Ciao!:-<br><br><a href="http://%20http://www.ciao.co.uk/amnesty_org_Amnesty_International__Review_5315416" rel="nofollow"> http://www.ciao.co.uk/amnesty_org_Amnesty_International__Review_5315416</a><br><br>Your nickname is Sun Tze. This guy wrote "the art of war", and one of teh most famous statements in it is "Know thyself, Know thy enemy, and a thousand battles will be yours to win." By succumbing to the thought of something being a "lesser evil", you are refusing to know yourself. And obviously, you won't have a drive to know your enemy - the Death Penalty.

Shepherd<br>Additional information is available for the following registered author(s):<br>Â·	Hashem Dezhbakhsh<br>Abstract<br><br>Does capital punishment deter capital crimes? We use panel data covering the fifty states duringthe period 1960-2000 period to examine the issue. Our study is novel in four ways. First, we estimate the moratorium's full effect by using both pre- and postmoratorium evidence. Second, we exploit the moratorium as a judicial experiment to measure criminals' responsiveness to the severity of punishment; we compare murder rates immediately before and after changes in states' death penalty laws. The inference draws on the variations in the timing and duration of the moratorium across states provide a cross section of murder rate changes occurring in various time periods. Third, we supplement the before-and-after comparisons with regression analysis that disentangles the impact of the moratorium itself on murder from the effect on murder of actual executions. By using two different approaches, we avoid many of the modeling criticisms of earlier studies. Fourth, in addition to estimating 84 distinct regression modelsÂ—with variations in regressors, estimation method, and functional formÂ—our robustness checks examine the moratorium's impact on crimes that are not punishable by death. Our results indicate that capital punishment has a deterrent effect, and the moratorium and executions deter murders in distinct ways. This evidence is corroborated by both the before-and-after comparisons and regression analysis. We also confirm that the moratorium and executions do not cause similar changes in non-capital crimes. The results are highly robust.<br></div></blockquote>THis is an extract from a forum on the Death Penalty in the USA:<br><br>The other point about the second question you raised: Does this person deserve to die? Well, I know we're not going to get off into the moral aspects of it, but my position is that no one deserves to die at the hands of the government. But, not withstanding that fact, it's a question of luck. If you went to the Illinois maximum-security prison and looked at the 20 worst cases of people on death row, and then you looked at 20 individuals convicted of first-degree murder, you would find that there's not that much difference in terms of the brutality, the heinousness of the crime, between the 20 people serving life with no parole and those on death row. It's serendipity. To some extent, it's what judge that individual wound up in front of. What defense lawyer represented the individual who got life versus the individual who got death? Who was the prosecutor in the case?<br><br><a href="http://www.fathom.com/course/10701044/session3.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.fathom.com/course/10701044/session3.html</a><br><br>the pikamaster</div>
