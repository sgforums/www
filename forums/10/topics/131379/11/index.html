HR groups are not here to run the government; they are not present in order to contest in elections. HR Groups, like AMnesty International, were created not in the way that political lobbies are created. They were created by normal citizens, not politicians, citizens who wanted to make sure that Governments took proper care of their citizens. It is HR Groups which condemn Aung San Suu Kyi's arrest; it is HR Groups who alert the world to the sad situation of Africa, to the War in Rwanda, to Indonesian and GAM atrocities in Aceh. Most HR Groups detach themselves from direct involvement in political affairs, so that they can be free of the political cloud.<br><br>If the HR Groups shut up, then there would be massive injustice in this world, because unfortunately governments are usually not good at keeping the promises they make to their own people, let alone other peoples: look at G8 and Africa, as an example.<br><br>the disguated pikamaster</div>

Where governments are willing to cooperate, the Rights Groups work with the UN and the government to implement solutions to problems. They even help in Africa. They establish Land Mines removal programs and so on. Obviously, if you only read the Straits Times, you wouldnt' know that since PAP has a clear agenda against HRGs. Unlike what you think, HRGs are not mere sitting ducks. Oh ya, do you know that there are HRGs that help run elections too? like ElectionWatch, for eg? and ElectionWatch cooperates with Human Rights Watch as well. So, who says HRGs don't do anything.<br><br>HR Groups do not participate in government/elections  not because they are cowards, but because they prefer remaining impartial in their respective research into Human Rights violations, and not be detracted by political interests that might skew their assessment of Human Rights.<br><br>They give solution, only pple like u don't want to listen, then claim that they don't give solution.

A person can feel that doing 'this thing' is immoral, but another might feel otherwise. Laws cannot afford to be subjective. You should take a trip down to the Supreme Court. Look up and you will see a craving of Justice. She is blind and is holding a balance. This is to symbolise that justice treats everyone equally. There is no room for subjective morals. It's either, you commited the crime or not.<br><br>I personally feel that capital punishment is needed. A few of you had mention that capital punishment is a form of vengence. But i feel you misinterpret the meaning of vengeance. When someone has vengeance, he gets personal satisfaction. If you don't believe me, go look up the Thesaurus, you will find that the word 'satisfaction' is linked to 'vengeance'. Anyway getting back, when someone gets punished by the law, the government doesn't get any satisfaction whatsoever. Before you argue that those associated to the victim will get satisfaction, well in some ways they do, but they did not carry out the punishment. Thats the difference.<br><br>Gd'day  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

There is an ideal moral state to which every person and every nation need to aim for. When we measure a law, we measure its effectiveness usually, but that doesn't mean that we cannot measure it morality. we can in fact, measure its effective morality in theory.<br><br>Earlier in this thread, I explained something about a Plane of Harm. Every action and every consequence of the enactment of a law has its own spot on the Plane, so each has a definite amount of individual harm and social harm which it causes. Likewise, each person has a posiiton on the Plane too, accounting for the relativity of morality, since each person has a different position, and this point is called the person's Morality Threshold. The four corners of the Plane are: Suicide/Invisible Harm, World Annihilation/Invisible Harm, Skin-deep World Annihilation, Skin-Deep Suicide. None of the extremes are good. In fact, the ideal morality point is the centre point of the Plane. if an action or an effect is located between a Threshold and the Edge of World Annihilation, it is considered moral by the person in question; if it lies between the Threshold and the Edge of Suicide, it's immoral. We assume of course that the person fights for his/her own survival.<br><br>The point of course is, how does the law  determine what is a crime, and how does it weigh the strength of punishment? Using the idea I presented above, U can see why The Death Penalty can be objectively considered (without emotional overtones) as Vengeance. Clearly, anything resembling vengeacne would be closer to the Edge of Annihilation, and logically u can see that that is the position of the Death Penalty on the Plane of Harm: between the Edge of Skin-Deep Harm and World Annihilation.  And obviously, in the analysis thus far, I am not using any dictionary, adn certainly not a linguistic, but a scientific definition of Vengeance.<br><br>As for the other issue on satisfaction, The government gets satisfaction from the execution of any person. In ancient times, Kings and Emperors were extremely pleased whenever they executed people in Court. Conisdering the impersonal nature of Government in modern times, one might be forgiven for assuming that such satisfaction is absent. However, we must be clear that corporate satisfaction, like the kind experienced by Durai when he gets an exceedingly large paycheck + many bonuses, is experienced by ANY government that enacts the Death Penalty. They gain satisfaction from the supposed increase in socio-political stablility granted by the utilization of teh Death Penalty. I mean, if the Death Penalty provides no satisfaction, why the heck is the govt always boasting about its effectiveness?<br><br>the analytical pikamaster</div>

Many of them go crazy and take their own lives in the prison cells.

For Schapelle Corby, she is an unfortunate casualty. Maybe her human rights instinct brought her to Indonesia as a show of goodwill to support the Indonesian tourism. Again, I say, try very hard to unearth evidence to free herself.<br><br>If death sentence is completely removed, terrorists in Indonesia will have one less deterence as if jihad isn't a strong enough motive for them to kill. If there are no death sentences, they will be sitting in the jail and maybe orchestrating more attacks from within the cells.<br><br>The life of the innocents that you mentioned surely is not more precious than the lives of people who would otherwise be murdered, raped, trafficked-drugs etc if death sentence has been removed?<br><br>Human rights activists can maybe start a charity fund to support life imprisonments as substitute for death sentence.  I think the innocent people being put to death need to be proved and the unfairness of justice system where criminals were eventually executed because of the injustice need to be improved. First and foremost  those who are accusing it to be unjust should do more than talk. Stand for elections. Join the judiciary system. If you are not happy or don't trust it, go change it. Don't sit next to the driver and shout directions. Take over the wheel.<br><br>Nothing will ever be 100% perfect. And in this case, a society with a horrible, scary death sentence as deterence is much better than a society without. If you don't want or can't steer the wheel, you are free to go live in other countries where there are no death sentence.</div>

An executed person cannot be un-executed. You would cause less pain to the "murderer's" family in the case of a wrongful conviction. To look at it this way, what is the point of a post-mortem acquittal?<br><br>And insofar, we have not even thought about the psychological and emotional welfare of our law enforcement officers, namely the executioners. How are we polluting their social attitudes if we keep letting them get blood on their hands. Why don't the CJ himself pull the rope?<br><br>2) Firstly: there is no disagreement that punishment is required. Something that is required can't be (morally) wrong to have. The key issue is with the type of punishment. Look at it this way: Is it more moral to allow for the spaying of stray cats by the SPCA or allowing the AVA to cull the cats?<br><br>Anyway, look at my reply to niehur. Scientifically, life imprisonment is more moral than the Death Penalty since logically, it does less external social harm i.e. It is closer to the Ideal Moral Point than the Death Penalty, although both are closer to the Edge of Annihilation than the Edge of Suicide. In fact, the Death Penalty, in a micro-sense, would lie directly on the point of Skin-Deep Annihilation, since you are clearly killing a person. Skin-Deep does not carry any indications of shallowness here; it simply means that there is no consequent emotional harm done to the murderer as a result of the Death Penalty - well, duh, obviously there can't be since he is already DEAD, and can't feel or think anything.<br><br>Even in the macro-sense, that is if we now looked at the impact on the entire society from this enforcement of the Penalty, the impact on the society for teh Death Penalty would be greater than for the life imprisonment, simply because there is more emotional pain and stigma attached to the relations of the murderer.<br><br>Thus, you can say empirically that life-imprisonment is more moral than the Death Penalty.<br><br>3) see 1)<br><br>4) see 2)<br><br>thx.<br><br>the still abolitionist pikamaster</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yoz niehur,<br><br>look at my reply to Mephistopheles as quoted for you below:-<br><br><blockquote>Originally said by Mephistopheles:<strong><br>Mephistopheles,<br><br>if you read my last reply to skyline, you would have read that morals are relative, but morality is objective in itself. There is an ideal moral state to which every person and every nation need to aim for. When we measure a law, we measure its effectiveness usually, but that doesn't mean that we cannot measure it morality. we can in fact, measure its effective morality in theory.<br><br>Earlier in this thread, I explained something about a Plane of Harm. Every action and every consequence of the enactment of a law has its own spot on the Plane, so each has a definite amount of individual harm and social harm which it causes. Likewise, each person has a posiiton on the Plane too, accounting for the relativity of morality, since each person has a different position, and this point is called the person's Morality Threshold. The four corners of the Plane are: Suicide/Invisible Harm, World Annihilation/Invisible Harm, Skin-deep World Annihilation, Skin-Deep Suicide. None of the extremes are good. In fact, the ideal morality point is the centre point of the Plane. if an action or an effect is located between a Threshold and the Edge of World Annihilation, it is considered moral by the person in question; if it lies between the Threshold and the Edge of Suicide, it's immoral. We assume of course that the person fights for his/her own survival.<br><br>The point of course is, how does the law determine what is a crime, and how does it weigh the strength of punishment? Using the idea I presented above, U can see why The Death Penalty can be objectively considered (without emotional overtones) as Vengeance. Clearly, anything resembling vengeacne would be closer to the Edge of Annihilation, and logically u can see that that is the position of the Death Penalty on the Plane of Harm: between the Edge of Skin-Deep Harm and World Annihilation. And obviously, in the analysis thus far, I am not using any dictionary, adn certainly not a linguistic, but a scientific definition of Vengeance.<br><br>As for the other issue on satisfaction, The government gets satisfaction from the execution of any person. In ancient times, Kings and Emperors were extremely pleased whenever they executed people in Court. Conisdering the impersonal nature of Government in modern times, one might be forgiven for assuming that such satisfaction is absent. However, we must be clear that corporate satisfaction, like the kind experienced by Durai when he gets an exceedingly large paycheck + many bonuses, is experienced by ANY government that enacts the Death Penalty. They gain satisfaction from the supposed increase in socio-political stablility granted by the utilization of teh Death Penalty. I mean, if the Death Penalty provides no satisfaction, why the heck is the govt always boasting about its effectiveness?<br></strong></blockquote>Statistics doesn't always complement ethics. Remember, behind every number is a person and/or set of persons. The Principle of yin and Yang says that no matter how much evil there is in a person, there is always some good; the Bible phrases it another way: Even the brigand will give his son bread to eat.<br><br>So there, here it is.<br><br>the tired pikamaster</div>

The point being that if a reformed citizen is returned to a productive role in society, the economy is not harmed so much by him being moved away. Talking this about 1 prisoner may not seem much significant. But multiply that by the number of inmates in the jails and you get a very large number of "unemployed".<br><br>2) The terrorist is removed whether he is executed or given lifetime imprisonment. And what better is the Death Penalty than life imprisonment if these cannot stop recruitment of terrorists; Doesn't this then go against the effectiveness of such a tactic in the "War on Terror"?<br><br>3) Look at FADP's website. There, they give yous tatistics which show that racial minorities are most often executed. Besides, the point is: do the statistics used to support the Death Penalty offer a fair comparison by includeing all those factors you mentioned?<br><br>4) no comment.<br><br>5) Right you are. And does the Death Penalty help to attain this goal of educaitonal accessiblity to all? Hmm... I really doubt it does.<br><br>6) The problem is that Singapore is NOT a democracy - it is at its best an authoritarian state, and at its worst a dictatorship. the PAP is the Master of groupthink and propagandizing (read: brainwashing). Seriously, given that the PAP controls almost everything in Singapore, how can Singapore be considered a democracy?<br><br>7) The Lee Dynasty is a barrier to progress. The PAP co-opts (and corrupts) many intellectuals already, small wonder why the opposition seems to be lacking. Le tme ask you one question: What would you like the opposition to be on par with the PAP for?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> *jeez*<br><br>9) Look at my previous post to you.<br><br>thx,<br>the abolitionist pikamaster</div>
