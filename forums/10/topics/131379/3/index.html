These people deserve heavy penalty but not dealth.<br><br>Of course in some cases there is a thin line between manslaughter and murder thats why we need law to differentiate under legitimate means.

            <div class='col-md body'>skyline63, I realize that your language can be a little offensive to some and would prevent others from having an objective discussion with you.

That it is his obligation to take revenge is nonsense- our notions of fillial piety DO NOT extend that far. If you follow your father into crime, you are not only bringing harm to your country, society but also to your family as well.<br><br>A truly righteous and morally upright son will realise what his father has done wrong and move on, learning not to make the same mistake.
