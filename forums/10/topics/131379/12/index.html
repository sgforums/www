            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by pikamaster:</div><div class="quote_body">Mephistopheles,<br><br>if you read my last reply to skyline, you would have read that morals are relative, but morality is objective in itself. There is an ideal moral state to which every person and every nation need to aim for. When we measure a law, we measure its effectiveness usually, but that doesn't mean that we cannot measure it morality. we can in fact, measure its effective morality in theory.<br><br>Earlier in this thread, I explained something about a Plane of Harm. Every action and every consequence of the enactment of a law has its own spot on the Plane, so each has a definite amount of individual harm and social harm which it causes. Likewise, each person has a posiiton on the Plane too, accounting for the relativity of morality, since each person has a different position, and this point is called the person's Morality Threshold. The four corners of the Plane are: Suicide/Invisible Harm, World Annihilation/Invisible Harm, Skin-deep World Annihilation, Skin-Deep Suicide. None of the extremes are good. In fact, the ideal morality point is the centre point of the Plane. if an action or an effect is located between a Threshold and the Edge of World Annihilation, it is considered moral by the person in question; if it lies between the Threshold and the Edge of Suicide, it's immoral. We assume of course that the person fights for his/her own survival.<br><br>The point of course is, how does the law  determine what is a crime, and how does it weigh the strength of punishment? Using the idea I presented above, U can see why The Death Penalty can be objectively considered (without emotional overtones) as Vengeance. Clearly, anything resembling vengeacne would be closer to the Edge of Annihilation, and logically u can see that that is the position of the Death Penalty on the Plane of Harm: between the Edge of Skin-Deep Harm and World Annihilation.  And obviously, in the analysis thus far, I am not using any dictionary, adn certainly not a linguistic, but a scientific definition of Vengeance.<br><br>As for the other issue on satisfaction, The government gets satisfaction from the execution of any person. In ancient times, Kings and Emperors were extremely pleased whenever they executed people in Court. Conisdering the impersonal nature of Government in modern times, one might be forgiven for assuming that such satisfaction is absent. However, we must be clear that corporate satisfaction, like the kind experienced by Durai when he gets an exceedingly large paycheck + many bonuses, is experienced by ANY government that enacts the Death Penalty. They gain satisfaction from the supposed increase in socio-political stablility granted by the utilization of teh Death Penalty. I mean, if the Death Penalty provides no satisfaction, why the heck is the govt always boasting about its effectiveness?<br><br>the analytical pikamaster</div></blockquote>An excellent analysis!</div>

(3.2 million versus $750,000 in Florida). This cost is weighted UP FRONT - in the initial trial, not in the appeals process as so many believe. Since Florida's death penalty law was re-written in 1972, our state has spent more than $1 billion on its death penalty system, for a return of only 58 executions. That's more than $18,000,000 per execution, and for what return? Is this a good use of your tax dollars? Don't take our word for it.

            <div class='col-md body'>There are more than one reason for capital punishment.<br><br>It is a deterrent to some extent but no punishment will ever be able to completely deter the criminal. In this regard I do agree that the death sentence only takes out one criminal from circulation but does not necessarily stop another from committing the same crime. It is difficult to know how many are deterred because of capital punishment because you never know what would have been the incidence if the law were not in place. Comparison with other cities is the best guide we have but no two cities or cultures are exactly alike.<br><br>There is not much mention so far about the need for victims (or the State as the broader representative) for vengeance. Since Hammurabi gave his famous law code, many societies have felt a need to see retribution for wrongs done. "An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth" may be odious to radical leftists but it is for the society to decide if that principle is past its time. So whilst Europe and some US states have abolished capital punishments, other US states strongly believe it should remain. I believe that Singaporean society at the moment wants the death sentence to stay. Each time a hidious crime like the Huang Na case occurs, we read from the media of the populace baying for blood. The government is responding to public sentiments on such matters.<br><br>What I disagree with is the process. In the Huang Na case, the accused was not allowed to see his lawyer during his interrogation despite repeated applications by his lawyer. The reason given was that the crime was heinous but I fail to see what that has to do with the proper administration of justice. Especially when we do have capital punishment, an accused person should have every safeguard against a wrongful conviction, which is quite possible in our adversarial system.  However, there was no hue and cry over this although it had been widely reported. In many western jurisdictions, his evidence taken without the presence of a lawyer would have been inadmissible. Why is that so? Perhaps because Singaporeans are so inflamed by the crime that they are willing to look away....<br><br>So forget about abolishing the death sentence because the population still supports it. We should reform our police investigation and legal process, if we can....<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just to add, anyone feels the prosecution has way too much power in trying to secure a conviction in Singapore? Does the desire to deal out justice in a swift manner result in any miscarriage of justice?

Think that is one reason Singapore does not want lawyers to be involved early as it makes it harder to convict. We also do not spend the same amount in expert opinions...there is legal aid in Singapore but the amount is so little the accused cannot afford the fees of top experts. The trial is kept short in Singapore with few avenues of appeal and even lower success at appeals. All these factors make it cheaper to execute than imprison someone for life.   </div></blockquote>Oxford Mushroom,<br><br>Firstly, you did not answer my qn at all. My question was whether legal fees in the USA and UK were constant for every case or whether they very from case to case.<br><br>But anyway, with regards to your information, I see only that Singapore is being economically-minded once again. Even if all these factors make it cheaper to execute then imprison someone for life, they beg alot of questions.<br><br>1) Doesn't the Court like to claim that it practices the "innocent until proven" idea? Why then is there the rush to convict? Are we treating the police as saints? Police are humans, just like any other.<br><br>2)  If the accused cannot spend money to hire top experts, then  is the trial being fair to the accused?<br><br>3) Which is a more serious punnishment, life imprisonment or the Death Sentence? Shouldn't the latter have more avenues of appeal than the former, given its severity?<br><br>4) How does the Supreme Court, and by extension, the govt, regulate the rate of success of appeals? Don't you agree that this is a very shrewd political maneuvring and circumvention of the idea of justice i.e. this is highly unethical? I am shocked that you can speak such a statement so coolly.<br><br>Just because executions are cheaper than life sentences doesn't make them any more morally correct.<br><br>Please answer all these questions.<br><br>the worried pikamaster</div>

As I said, I disagree with the process of convicting and executing a prisoner on death row. We do need to reform the current process:<br><br>1.   The principle of 'innocent till proven guilty' is enshrined in our legal system which we have inherted from the British but even that is being challenged in these days of terrorist attacks.

That problem is true everywhere. The world is not fair, I am afraid.

I don't know what you mean. Nobody 'regulates' the success of appeals. An appeal to the Court of appeal is automatic in capital punishment cases and has to be based on point of law. If the defense lawyer cannot give a good reason for the appeal, it fails. I do not believe there is political interference with the decision of the court in individual cases.

As in the Huang Na case, the lawyer cannot be present at the interrogation and is not even allowed to see his client until the police has extracted every piece of incriminating evidence. By the time the case goes to trial, the accused has already admitted his guilt on so many counts that all a lawyer can do often is just plead on mitigating circumstances.

At least, you are not unthinking like some others around here.<br><br>7) you stated in your post before this one that successful appeal cases were limited even more than the number of cases allowed to go for appeal. So I was asking you, how is this limitation carried out?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> I'm faulting the entire judicial system, not just one court.<br><br>9) Public support is misguided, and largely due to govt propaganda in education or elsewhere. like I said, it is not EDUCATED public opinion.<br><br>10) Can you predict future guilt?

            <div class='col-md body'>7. Ah, I understand your question now. My fault for not making it clear then. You understood the word 'limited' as a verb, meaning to restrict. I was using it as an adjective, to mean 'small in size' or 'few in number'. This is how an online dictionary defines it:<br><br>adj 1: small in range or scope; "limited war"; "a limited success"; "a limited circle of friends" [ant: unlimited] 2: subject to limits or subjected to limits [syn: circumscribed] 3: including only a part 4: mediocre [syn: modified] 5: not excessive 6: having a specific function or scope; "a special (or specific) role in the mission" [syn: special] 7: not unlimited; "a limited list of choices"<br><br>8. Agree. Apart from being overwhelmingly anti-crime (which our population supports), our judicial system prides itself on being very efficient, defined by conventional benchmarks like the number of cases heard. However, are we sacrificing justice for the sake of efficiency? Rumours have it that judges themselves have remarked, "We are clearing cases, not hearing cases."<br><br>9) Well, you will have to persuade the majority of the population to change their opinion then. Educated or not in your view, in a democratic system, the majority voice rules. It is not right for the minority to impose its will upon the majority, is it?<br><br>10) Future guilt? Sorry, what's the question? I don't know what you mean.<br><br></div>
