So the system becomes the system tat restrict a person free will himself as well ? The system canes another for hurting a person in a fight, so the system become the person who assault the offender himself ?

Now if we do not have the death penalty, the possible greatest punishment is simply lifeterm imprisonment. Is tat enough to deter people from committing serious crimes ? There r many people who don't mind jail sentence, especially people who had lived in jail for a long time before being released. They in fact may yearn to go back to jail, a system where they r already used to. Wat is going to stop them from committing offences such as bank robbery, murder, drug trafficking or acts of terrorism ? Secondly, if a person hate another very deeply and killed him. Is tat fair for the innocent person who was murdered ?

Why does the drug trafficker gets death penalty while the casino operators get gahmen approved licences to provide services for promoting the vice? </blockquote>For drugs, the person who takes it DEFINITELY have harm done to his body. For casino, only very few people who gambles becomes an addict and commit crimes. Drugs is also physically addicitive, while gambling is at most mental, making it easier to kick or not be addicted. If u look at the law, even illegal casino operators do not get death penalty when they r caught since the harm, as deemed by the judiciary system throughout the world, agree tat the potential harm of casino is much lesser than drugs.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><br>There r always cases tat people get punished for an offence they never do, but then if u r the judiciary system, wat should u gonna do ? We can't let everyone be freed isn't it ? It is sad to punish an innocent person but there is no better solution. If u do not want to punish the innocent, the only way is to free all criminals, which obviously is worst off for the society<br></blockquote>1. Please distinguish between NO <strong>CAPITAL</strong> punishment and no punishment at all. There should be some system to keep the society safe from certain people. I am against DEATH SENTENCE/capital punishment, <strong>not</strong> against the whole judiciary system. Removing the Death Penalty DOES NOT automatically mean all criminals are free to go. The punishments for fines and imprisonment can remain WITHOUT the death penalty.<br><br>2. I'm not sure if u have been to law classes. <span style="font-style: italic;">INITIALLY</span>, one of the very basic ideas behind criminal law is that ONLY when a person is PROVEN BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT, will he/she be pronounced as guilty. Another good point to note is that imprisonment was originally meant for people who are dangerous to the society, i.e. people who committed criminal acts such as murder, robbing, kidnapping, theft, rape, etc. There is a need for these offenders to be kept away from the society to protect the general public.<br><br>Of course, over the years, various different amendments were made in different countries/states, so much so that it is sad that sometimes the basic ideas are forgotten or altered. Now we get, IMHO, absurd punishments such as IMPRISONMENT for people who didnt change their window rivets, AS IF the person committed a CRIMINAL ACT. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> Please check again what is considered a criminal act and what is the idea behind imprisonment. Seems like the law now uses absurd (IMO) penalties to "scare" people into doing what they want them to, in this case, to change to approved window rivets. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> If scaring people works so well, why not juz change EVERY SINGLE penalty to imprisonment or death to "scare" potential "offenders". (ok abit off-topic but i juz wanna show how the law can sometimes deviate from its basic ideas).<br><br>Similarly, a person found with an excess of a certain drug is getting the <strong>MANDATORY DEATH SENTENCE</strong>, I hope the authorities consider the background of the person, whether the accused has connections with drug traffickers/suppliers, if not, since there is a <strong>doubt</strong> that the person is able to source for the drugs, the general requirement for 'proving beyond reasonable doubt' cannot be established, and in this case, the accused should not be pronounced guilty and sentenced to death. Judgement must not be placed solely on the fact that the accused was caught in possession of the drug, which is very superficial. However, if u read on you will find that this is probably wishful thinking on my part.<br><br><blockquote><br>I hope u understand tat punishment is necessary isn't it ? Now if we do not have the death penalty, the possible greatest punishment is simply lifeterm imprisonment. Is tat enough to deter people from committing serious crimes ? There r many people who don't mind jail sentence, especially people who had lived in jail for a long time before being released. They in fact may yearn to go back to jail, a system where they r already used to. Wat is going to stop them from committing offences such as bank robbery, murder, drug trafficking or acts of terrorism ?<br></blockquote>Yes, I agree punishment is necessary, the question remains - where to draw the line, and whether capital punishment is <strong>effective</strong> at all.<br><br>Like PRP said "Even with capital punishment,there are still drug traffickers.So the punishemnt is really not effective."<br><br>Some very interesting quotes i get from Amnesty International. This is a very good article.<br>http://web.amnesty.org/library/index/engasa360012004<br><br>"Scientific studies have consistently failed to find convincing evidence that the death penalty deters crime more effectively than other punishments. Criminologists have long argued that the best way to deter crime is to increase the certainty of detection, arrest and conviction."<br><br>"Singapore is believed to have the worldÂ’s highest per capita execution rate, relative to its population. "<br><br>"Claiming that the death penalty has been effective in controlling the trade in illicit drugs, the Singapore authorities reported an overall decline in the number of drug abusers arrested between 1994 and 2001....According to the website of the Singapore Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB), a total of 3,393 drug abusers were arrested in 2002. <strong>The number of new drug abusers increased by 16% compared to the figures for 2001</strong>."<br><br><blockquote><br>Secondly, if a person hate another very deeply and killed him. Is tat fair for the innocent person who was murdered ? The innocent gets a heavier punishment than the guilty.<br></blockquote>"Any humane criminal justice system could not continue to justify the retention of the death penalty based on retribution."<br><br>"I do not now believe that any one of the hundreds of executions I carried out has in any way acted as a deterrent against future murder. Capital punishment, in my view, achieved nothing except revenge". Former British executioner Albert Pierrepoint."<br><br>"The death penalty is a violation of one of the most fundamental of human rights: the right to life. It is the premeditated and cold-blooded killing of a human being by the state in the name of justice. It is the ultimate cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment. There is no escaping the risk of error which can lead to the execution of an innocent person."<br><br>"The eradication of the supply of drugs is important but equally important is the alleviation of social conditions that encourage would-be traffickers or addicts. The socially excluded young and poor school dropouts are the most affected and drug addictions are disproportionately high among males with poor education... <strong>Are we assisting the socially excluded to reintegrate into society or are we disposing them off [sic] as rejects?</strong>"<br><br><blockquote>Chinese saying: When a men works in society, they cannot afford to be idealistic and have little choices in the things they do<br><br>Men have to be realistic, even making decisions tat may cause harm to a minority to protect the majority. There is no way a justice system can be removed. There is no way to be sure all prosecuted r not innocent. There r no better options. So wat to do ? Free all criminals ? </blockquote>So u agree to the idea to "kill all people wrongfully than to let one slip off?" Wow! <strong>You have no regard for the innocent??!</strong><br><br>There are many more states that do not support capital punishments, are they unrealistic and too idealistic?<br><br>Supporting the idea of harming the minority of innocents just so to protect the majority is undeniably discriminatory. What if one day you are to be executed because you are carrying an infectious and fatal disease becoz the deaths of you and "your kind" will ensure the safety of the rest of the people? Do you think it is right to do so? If this is allowed, soon it will turn to differences between race, religion, social classes, and what-have-you. The strong majority bullies the weak minority, is this your idea of justice? People should be judged on whether they are found guilty, not because they are in the minority.<br><br>Since you agree that there is no way to be totally sure that all prosecuted are not innocent, all the more should a death penalty be abolished! Better options are available, such as better crime detection, fairer trails and procedures, transparency, etc. Like I said, removing the death penalty does not mean other punishments are removed as well.<br><br></div>

However we have to compare between the final result of the soceity instead of just individual. DO u agree tat if a death penalty, it do deter many forms of serious crimes such as murdering, firearms transaction, kidnapping, bank robbery and drug abuse ?

Maybe the best way is to make the public wary of being a victm to such a crime and be more careful in dealing with their belongings.<br><br>If u talk about drug abuser, than u should be glad tat the amount stipulated is actually very great. The amount of drugs could last them for a long time and thus normal drug abusers will not have in possession of such amount unless they r really drug trafficker.

A car driving at 120 km/hr is speeding but a person driving at 200km/hr is worse still. The resulting impact is different.

If u talk about more gambling addicts, tat may not be true for some countries but true for singapore. Tat is simply because the problem of drug trafficking has been lowered significantly due to heavy punishment and education involved.

Also u will find tat the drug addict cases drop drastically after harsher laws were implemented. Furthermore, I believe it is common sense to know at harsher punishment give higher deterence.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Wrong in legal principle</span></strong><br><br>There is no argument that drug traffickers should be punished.The argument is whether drug trafickers should be punished with dealth penalties.Whether one support capital punishment is a moral choice.I believe capital punishment is wrong while Stupidissmart believes it is right.<br><br>Let's just say capital punishment is acceptable.My next question is whether drug trafficking deserves such punishment.Under the principle that "an eye for an eye",drug traffickers shouldn't be given death penalties because it is not the drug traffickers who may kill drug addicts but rather drug trafficers who excessively abuse the drugs &amp; kill themselves.If a person take too much alchoholic drinks or smoke excessively &amp; died,can Stupidissmart blame their death on sellers of alchoholic drinks or cigarettes?</div>
