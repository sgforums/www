You can always ignore them. What is more, there are countries without capital punishment yet their streets are safer than ours. High time for us to examine why this is so.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes. We all will be judge in one day. The problem is alive or death ? Who is going to confirm it ? That is the problem.  How would you know ? and Why you know ? You don't even have the answer to that.<br><br>How am I going to say there will be a judgement after death ? Maybe after death... everyone goes heaven and enjoy. There is no sin and everyone is free ! And there is no such things as HELL. There is no such things as suffering. And everyone is free ! No one will be judge again !<br><br>I pity those who are alive yet don't understand. People must be control by laws so that they will not kill one another. People must have fear to stop them from taking things that is not their. People must have fear to stop to harm others. People must have fear and rules to obey. That is life ! Or else.... it will be messy ! Chaos ! Then....... make no differents from the days in the past. People kill one another, Rape woman, Use Children as slave. Etc.<br><br>Lock them up is not a solution. It's just lock up. If can escape... free already. There is still hope to do crime if FREE. But Death is different. They died cannot escape again. So............ they will stop all those crime of harming others !<br><br>Poor child ? Only those who still believe they are living in wonderland is a child. That is really pityful. They are still in their childhood brain in an adult body. Human right group is an greatest example of all. A group of grow-up will living in a 3 years old brain.</div>
