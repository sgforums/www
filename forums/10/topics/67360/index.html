            <div class='col-md body'>As a postgraduate student, you should have little difficulty getting a job if you you look in the right places - in the employers' perception, you are distinguished from the undergraduates, who tend to be workers of very variable quality.<br><br>As for looking in the right places, the newspaper classifieds would not be the place to do it.  In those ads, employers would not primarily be looking to hire international students, and some of them may think that hiring you may involve extra paperwork.  Besides, you are competing against applicants who pose no potential work rights issues, and who can commit full-time.  I would suggest your university's student job site - you would fit the bill for potential employers there.<br><br>Silly question - if you're at UOSQ, why are you in Sydney?  If you know anybody at the University of Sydney, see if you can get access to their job site (I expect it would be a password-protected site) - the serious players tend to advertise at the older universities.  My best two roles came from Melbourne University's site, including the one where I got around the 20-hour rule.<br><br>That was actually a bit of an odd case.  I got along very well with my potential employers, to the point at which they selected me as a postgraduate student over fully qualified psychologists.  I explained the 20-hour rule to my boss, and she said fine - on the books, she would hire me for 20 hours a week but double my hourly rate, so she got the other 20 hours for free.  I have found the most receptive organisations to be those that have a staff of about 10-20, and have been around for about 8-10 years.  Such organisations that I have encountered tend to be new enough to not be weighed down by bureaucracy, and are old enough to be reasonably stable.<br><br>Apart from the university sites, try either seek.com.au or mycareer.com.au, and look for contract, temp or casual roles.  When they ask you if you are a resident, you are in fact considered a resident by the Australian Tax Office, albeit with the work limitations.  By the way, do you have a tax file number yet?  If not, apply for it ASAP at your nearest ATO office - it should take less than a week to come through and you will need it if you're going to be paid.  Anyway, you can explain to employers that you have the right to work in Australia for 20 hours a week.  If it is a contract or casual role, that will not affect them at all.<br><br>With your work experience, as well as your postgraduate status, you may as well go for something in finance.  Try Seek or mycareer - they should have plenty of part-time roles in that field.  You might want to apply for this bookkeeper role that turned up on Seek ($25K a year could ease a lot of pain for a student :mrgreen):<br><br>http://www.seek.com.au/users/viewdetails.asp?Action=jobsearch&amp;JobListAction=ViewOneAd&amp;JobSearch=true&amp;AdID=3259281<br><br>If I were in your position, this is something that I would feel reasonably confident about applying for.<br><br>Another approach is to send your CV to temp agencies, not to the employers themselves (they rely on the agencies for their recruitment).  I'm not sure which agencies operate in Sydney, but you can call any recruitment agency and ask if they do temp agency work  - even if they don't, they are likely to be able to tell you which agencies would be appropriate.<br><br>A side issue would be your English language skills.  Being educated in Catholic schools throughout my education in Singapore, I had absolutely no problems with this, but if you do have language issues, that could be a barrier to be aware of.  It's not a racist thing - the fact is that you will need to be able to communicate clearly in order to do the job right.<br><br>Anyway, all the best.  Feel free to ask any more questions if you need to.  Also, PM me if you want me to take a look at your CV and provide feedback - I used to be a recruiter in Melbourne.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To be honest..<br>Postgrad studies means jack all here. What counts is being a team player, being 'aussified'.. ie you go out to the pub with them, join them in their activities etc. (from experience, mostly drinking). You also need to have references that are aussie. So maybe for the first job, try to get whatever you can and not complain about pay/work/conditions.<br><br>Tell me the truth..when you talk.. do you sound singaporean?<br>Do you assimilate with the Aussies?<br><br>i got my part time jobs by referrals. I also worked for my co-op year and stayed on after that year for like casual work. I also had someone get me a job in a cafe which i really liked, got paid really well and had the best time! I stayed there for about a year.<br>Have you considered 'menial' work. I know my brother looked down on me for waitressing, but hey.. paid my school fees, rent and bills.</div>

However, as he has mentioned wanting to do something finance-related as well, I'm obliged to point out that your scenario does not apply as a blanket term.  I can attest that my doctorate has opened a lot of doors, and that many employers have had a relative bias against undergrads.<br><br>As for the accent thing, I would agree with you, although I don't know how applicable it is to the finance field.  My accent is a bad mix of Sinagporean, Irish and British - my British project manager was rather amused and bemused by my quoting Shakespeare.  As for the assimilation, I wouldn't know enough about the effects of not assimilating - the Aussies seem to take to a loudmouthed, cigar-chomping, scotch-swilling larrikin of a Singaporean ex-paratrooper.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks for the responses guys..actually i have tried `menial' jobs like being a waiter and sandwichhand, most of the time they need referral and experiences. Just got laid off by this singapore restaurant here, they actually wanted somebody to do the preparation of food, dishwashing, serving for $7 an hour and doing that for two locations, 7 days a week.<br><br>Thought was pretty alright initially (I do not know the rate) till i realise the job was more than demanding but rather EXPLOITING!!<br>U guys have similar experiences?<br><br>My accent is not singaporean in that sense, as i was with a US investment bank before and i am quite well travelled.<br><br>However, does it really help by telling those temp agencies that i don't mind getting paid for 20 hours while the rest of the time i can work for free?<br><br>Please advice.

            <div class='col-md body'>Good God, no!  The job was already listed as a full-time role when I applied for it, but I applied anyway.  The "20 hours free" idea was instigated by my boss -I just precipitated the situation by applying for a full-time role, then mentioning the 20 hour limitation only once I got to the interview.  By that point, I had gotten my foot in the door and impressed them enough for them to come up with the offer.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>NIGHTSKY, the best advice i can give you is..<br>NOT TO F-ing work for asian restuarants! Do you have Aussie friends from uni, ask them what they do. And see if they can refer you to their employer.<br><br>Or look around your local cafes to see if they require waiters. This is the truth about my cafe job. I was paid $15.50 plus super and my shifts were 7.5hrs each time with 1/2 hr break that was paid for. I could eat to my heart's content during my break and grab whatever i wanted at the end of my shift.... but i also paid tax for it. DO NOT under any circumstances accept asian restaurant jobs for like cash payments. If you had an accident at work.. ie you cut your finger, fell and broke your arm etc. You are NOT covered by work cover cos it's dodge. And don't be afraid to pay tax, you'll get most of it back if you are in a low income group or less than 10K a year. And with regard to super, you can roll it out to your singapore CPF when you return.<br><br>You have to like not sit there in your shell by talking to asian students only. Good luck with job hunting. Also do you have a career guide website or something that you can go to so that you can find employment that suits your hours?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks guys, all your advices are invaluable to me and for those reading them here in OZ looking for casual positions.<br>Generally, asian restaurants tend to be exploitative in this aspect. But when u are looking for a job desperately, u tend not to be chosey.<br><br>It can be rather frustrating and disappointing at times though. I am looking at some job sites while writing this. My course is actually a collaboration with the Univ of S Queensland, thus it is a pte college that is conducting the course therfore we have no career nor job assistance available. That's the tough part!<br><br>Went to the Temasek club (Singaporean networking club) for help in this matter but sadly, nobody is willing to point me the right direction except telling me how tough it is to get a job here. After a while, i don't see the point in joining them anymore. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>So i took it at my own stride to do cold calling and handing people my resumes..<br><br>Well, i will just have to continue till something comes along, right?<br><br>Nah, will not give up that easily...</div>

The koreans perform poorly in this aspect in my  opinion. It takes time to fit into any culture but always the willingness and desire to blend in must be there first..</div>

Adapting and embracing the prevailing culture is something all migrants and international students have to do. Its a matter of asscociation or disasscociation. One can can still adhere to his or her values and virtues from their upbringing and assimilate to another culture. Drinking beer with another friend you call mate doesnt make you an aussie. Knowing the meaning to fair dinkum doesnt make you an aussie. Knowing the lyrics and tune to Advance, Fair Australia doesnt make you an aussie. Even wearing the yellow and gold of the wallabies and crying your eyes out when Johny Wilko scored a last min drop goal doesnt make you an aussie Think white paper. The years you spent in singapore will have certainly developed your personality and mentality to a certain extent. There is no way an international student or migrant can claim absolute change. It just a matter of choice, do you cover it up with another color and change the whole persepective. (White on black gives grey). Or do you start on a fresh part and leave yourself enriched.<br><br>know what you mean about the students who have everything paid for them - they usually have very little clue about what's going on because they're too busy mucking about.<br><br>I really feel that this is an unfair statement. I was blessed that i came from a family that could support my 3 years of studies in sydney. But its not my fault that they could and no offence to you yours couldnt. Perhaps your family was able to see you through your studies but you wanted to relieve them fianancially, if thats the case, kudos to you. But you shouldnt take away anything from people who have the fianancial capabilities. Just because they can, doesnt mean they will turn out wayward or perhaps less successful. Vice versa, it might not make you any better then them. Character builiding perhaps? Its too large a group of people to generalise.<br><br>Sorry if i came out too harsh, just wanted to share an opinion. Hope no offence was taken. Just wanted to share my observations and cause i hold australia dearly. Once again, apologies.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>No offence taken, Ytsejam.  Those are good points that you have raised.<br><br>Vis-Ã -vis your first point, my phrasing was too loose - mea culpa.  What I really should have written was "What's the point of going and living in another country if you're going to stick exclusively with your own culture?".  I was referring to students, say from XYZ, who only joined the XYZ student's club, associated only with students from XYZ and packed up and went home with only the barest interaction of the local culture.  I disagree with your assertion that assimilating into the local culture is something that international students have to do - the students I described above have done an excellent job of asserting their right not to do so.  Especially in a rapidly globalising environment, I think that giving up such an opportunity to expand one's cultural scope is a shame.<br><br>As for the second part of your first point, you assume that there was something to change from.  From what you have written, it appears that you are reasonably comfortable with being Singaporean, or at least you are not uncomfortable with it.  That is where we differ.<br><br>I acknowledge that there are some handy skills that I developed during my years in Singapore - rote learning helped me develop my memory capacity, and this has come in handy, and the work style that I developed during national service has held me in good stead.  However, since well before I went to Australia, I had already known that I did not identify with Singapore culturally.  Since the beginning of secondary school, there were many cultural factors that I disagreed with, and despite it making me a loose cannon on deck, I have stayed true to myself and not regretted it.<br><br>I can see how you misinterpreted my comment about the back shed.  That was simply a tongue-in-cheek response to Lingo's observation that I fit into the Aussie culture.<br><br>Do I see myself as an Aussie?  No - nationality forms no part of my identity.  I see myself as an individual, to some extent influenced by my work and the company I keep, but mostly defined by my personal philosophy.  In fact, this is one thing that seems to make me un-Singaporean - what others call patriotism, I see as jingoism.  I don't presume to impose my views on those who think it is patriotism, and I appreciate the courtesy being returned.  Oddly enough, this approach seems to sit well with the Aussies that I know - they are individuals above all.<br><br>As for your second point, I agree that it is an unfair and sweeping statement - I offer my unmitigated apology.<br><br>Just for the record, my parents had enough funds to support my living costs a number of times over.  I simply chose to make my own way through that to remind myself of the astronomical value of the school fees that my parents were paying.  This approach served me well from the beginning of my undergraduate years to the end of my doctorate.  If opinion is anything to go by, the president of the Singaporean studentsÂ’ club once remarked that I was held as the benchmark of singlemindedness by most of the Asian students there at the time.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sorry Lingos if have hit a nerve. But i wasn't insinuating that you were poor. Same for Ged. The point here is that just because you chose to work despite being fianancially capable, doesn't mean everyone else who is must. And to those who don't, doesnt mean they are in anyway inferior to you. People live their lives differently, just because you chose to live the way you did, you shouldn't be blinded by your own views. It's really unfair to sterotype students who don't work overseas. Once again, no offence intended.</div>
