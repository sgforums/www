In China, those who are above 70 don't need to pay for the transport charges.  In China, the govt does not make it compulsory for the people to buy annuity, instead the people are paid pension.  Look at it China is so many many times bigger than Singapore with such a large population, the govt can afford to pay pension, why not the sickening PAP.  So, PAP is worse than the communists!</div>
