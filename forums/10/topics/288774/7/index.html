These people need encouragement and support from us to be daring to put in their effort to cast their votes for the oppositions on election day.   Tell them we should give opposition the chance if we are all so unhappy with the way the tyrants, PAP are running the country.</div>

It all depends on the quality, calibre of the candidates.   It very much depends on what they have in store for the nation if they get voted.   I have to say this, sometimes personality does matter, too!   Talk about personality, those MIW PAP just don't have it, except for people like Dr Tony Tan.</div>
