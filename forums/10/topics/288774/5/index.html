He has said that for him to succeed he needs more people. Perhaps 10,000 people on the streets as there is no way the police is going to arrest everybody. That is the support he truly needs.<br><br>Since you are such an ardent supporter and acknowledged that an individual complaining to UN is no use and the only way out is to support Chee, then walk the talk and stand beside him the next time he protests.

            <div class='col-md body'>"The Government can jail 10 persons; it can even jail 100 persons but it cannot jail 10,000 persons. A nonviolent action campaign needs to have the participation of the masses if it is going to succeed. But remember that mass movements always start with the leadership of the few who have the courage to make sacrifices and the vision to bring the people into the future. Many countries have faced similar circumstances as ours, some with situations much worse, but through the intelligent and persistent use of nonviolent action, they were all able to overcome the dictatorial regimes and establish democracy in their countries."<br><br>- Chee Soon Juan.<br><br></div>
