Of pressing concern should be of Darfur, Zimbabwe, Myanmar, Iraq etc.<br><br>We belong to a very privileged few in the world. On the world stage, whatever problems that we encounter are seriously menial. As we type and share our concerns here at this point, there are people dying out there, children prostituting themselves and workers getting seriously abused.<br><br>Going back to the topic, "can we lodge report to the United Nations on our difficulties ?". The answer is yes you can and in fact i'm sure that they know whats goin on here as well. To expect them to do anything about it is probably equivalent to a tai tai complaining about the prices of her Guccis and LVs while the main concern is food prices if you get what i mean.</div>
