Obscene? cant me that obscene as compared to what some CEO get for golden handshake<br></div></blockquote>Sorry everyone, just have to quote part of Sylvia Lim's speech (AGAIN) on this:<br><br>"While I do agree that this is an opportunity to have a public airing, the debate arouses a feeling of deja vu, harking back to the other transparent debate about whether to have casinos in Singapore. The revision was presented in Parliament in a form of Ministerial statement under Standing Order 44 where no vote will be taken. Not one thing said by any MP will change the decision of the government. I would personally very much like to know what each individual Minister feels about taking more than $2m of taxpayersÂ’ money home each year, while fellow citizens struggle with rising costs and taxes.<br><br>Secondly, Minister Teo mentioned that it was not right to look at how much political leaders elsewhere earn because our Ministers cannot become Ministers in other countries. But the comparison is logical because we are comparing similar skill sets and responsibilities funded by the public. Looking instead at 2/3M48, how valid is it as a measure of a MinisterÂ’s worth? Is it possible that, in fact, some of our Ministers are doing better in Cabinet than they would have done in their previous careers? <strong>Can we say that each and every Minister in Cabinet now would have become a top-earning banker, accountant, lawyer, engineer or CEO? We have seen instances of civil servants and military personnel embark on 2nd careers in the private sector, and find the business world a whole new ball game; and some, in fact, flounder. </strong><br><br>Thirdly, Minister attempted to show that Cabinet salaries were not in the rarefied zone of high fliers by plotting a graph of 1,000 residents and Malaysians. Even so, 1,000 out of the resident workforce of about 1.9 m (as at mid 2006, according to Labour Force Survey) is less than 0.1%. To be in this group of 1,000 is already to be in a very privileged few and as far as the public is concerned, is already in the rarefied zone. "<br><br>And wat makes Spore so special that our ministers have to have such opportunity cost consideration? Are other countries' leader all not CEO material at all? Is the US president having a much easier job than LHL, or even easier than all our ministers?</div>

He worked in the private sector for a while ya know.. and Yale is by no means cheap.<br><br>I think Bill Clinton was paid rather well too when he was a lawyer. Probably 100K USD a year at least. A lot of Presidents were quite well off when they entered office.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>at least two people were sued in open court by TT Durai and they lost... you can say that at that time, they had "no proof" that TT Durai was corrupted... but was he? You bet your life.</div>

Anyway, I have very little faith in the justice system here in SG when cases are very close to the Government blind spots.<br><br>To quote a fomer Chief Justice :<br><br>In 1995<br>Chief Justice Yong held that any Law which deprived a person of his life or personal liberty was valid and binding as long as it was validly passed by parliament. The courts, he said, 'is not concerned with whether it is also fair, just and reasonable as well'.<br><br>So a CJ is not concerned whether a law is just and reasonable?<br><br>More recently, with the Falungong Activists.<br><br>Judge Tung: "But I am not here to judge whether you are right or wrong"<br><br>So a judge is not concerned between what is right and wrong. Isn't the law made for the purpose of upholding righteousness?<br><br>So based on the above statements by Judges or Fomer Judges (one of them a fomer CJ no less) among other things, I cannot say that just becase they have stayed within the Law they are corruption free. (Btw, PAP can change the law single handedly, both ordinary and constitutional laws.)<br></div>
