            <div class='col-md body'>LOL, if this thread is locked no loss to us what, after all Gazelle is the TS, and not to mention he started a rubbish topic to begin with. Did he not start this as a "rigged" topic, asking the ridiculus to begin with?<br><br>How can the common man act as the CPIB?<br><br>And how does our ministers being corrupted or not by letter of law have anything to do with the morality of their recent actions? As it has been pointed out, just because you are legal does not mean you are not corrupt.<br><br>That is so common-senscial that is not even worth talking much about, and not surprisingly attention soon shifts to focus on other more interesting things.<br><br>I wonder what does his friends and family think about his habits once they are out in the open? Do they happily support him poking around people's clothing? Odd he seems so proud about it.<br><br>Rubbish topic attract rubbish to be revealed in it, Gazelle got pretty much what he asked for, which is much ridicue and multiple PWNage!<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
