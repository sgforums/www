Some prefer to stay home &amp; rest.<br><br>My fren's Filipino maid who has worked for over 15 yrs has every Sun off. She can afford to cos her pay is high.</div>

A equivalent of a Major is only paid about S$150 per month.

            <div class='col-md body'>i agree with oxford mushroom that maids are employees, and not daughters and as such, there is a limit to what we can control.<br><br>However, even employers in all industries demand certain behaviour and standards from employees, i,e, integrity, diligence etc.<br><br>The nature of a maid's job is all the more complicated because she lives with the family, and also takes care of the young children.  I'm sure employers wouldn't want a promiscuous maid/liar to interact with children.  So we impose our own set of expectations on the maid, which should be humanely reasonable, of course.<br><br>Problems almost always occur in inter-personal relationships, and it sometimes is up to the individual maid &amp; employer to build a trustworthy relationship that is based on mutual respect, and not ill-treatment and abuse of the maid or vice versa.<br><br>That said, going back to the original topic in this thread, one day off a month is really an indication of how "fair" employment laws really are in Singapore.<br>A more humane and fair (across all industries) ould be one day off in a week.  And if, like what some people are concerned about, like maids getting in trouble (which is very true), perhaps a more stringent set of rules can apply to maids with such historical "records"?</div>

Why shouldn't I employ a bangla who is willing to work longer hours for less when these Singaporean uncles demand double that amount for a 5-day week? Why should I be limited by the 30% limit on foreign workers in my employ when I can completely outsource my operations overseas? At least foreign workers will not have to leave their families to work for me.<br><br>So Singaporeans should enjoy a 5-day week to spend more time with their families when foreign maids cannot even take a day off a week to meet their friends. Why? Because Singaporeans are the elite of South-east Asia?<br><br>Singaporeans are hypocrites and deserve to lose their jobs to foreign workers..</div>
