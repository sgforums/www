Not becasue they don't deserve it but more because they'll get into trouble easily.<br><br>Firstly, they over spent, like many girls they like to pamper themselves. Also transport fares and expenses would eat up their savings.<br><br>Secondly, there are lots of foreign male workers who are out there preying on these young maids and the maids may just fall for them. Then when they got pregnant. They would have to be sent back. Or worst still, accused their employers of rape... etc. Though it can be proven easily, the hassle of having to go to the police station, the legal proceedings will give you hell.<br><br>Thirdly, they start to compare amongst themselves how good their employers were and eventually, they believe they are under paid, over worked and exploited by their employers. They start do develop plans against their employers.<br><br>There could be more problems certainly. Off days are not solutions for their welfare. I would suggest to employers, if possible, bring them outings with the family on weekends. Treat them like one of us. Allow them to wake up a little later on Sundays, don't have to cook or do household chores on Sundays. Eat out on weekends and allow something like light duties on weekends. Reward them with bonuses or ang pows. Buy them some clothes, etc<br><br>Put it simply, you must know what are they doing and they should kept within sight.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> </div></blockquote>i can identify with wad u are saying here. guess only people who had maids before in the house can identify with what u are saying.<br><br>Anyway, in the end, my family decided to do away with maids. too troublesome to tackle all the problems.<br><br>so now im the official floor sweeper n mopper  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

You are so lucky.<br><br>My bro's filipino maid ran to the police station at 4 am one morning. Filed a rape report against him and claimed the rape took place 8 months ago. This was after she renewed her contract and came back after one month home leave.<br><br>Just last weekend, my sis-in-law's maid claimed her dead father came and wanted her to go home for Hari Raya in Indonesia. She cried hysterically and talking to his father's spirit at the coridor. I had to come and speak to her father and reason with "him".<br><br>My colleague's maid lagi jia lark. Ran a brotel using his home while he and his wife were at work. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>
