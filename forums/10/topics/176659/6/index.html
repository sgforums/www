Do you really think I don't know how the system works?<br><br>Yes there are strikes at times at work but hey I don't have a problem living on minimum wage - I started with 37k and worked myself up , once I started earning a bit too much - I just cut down to part time work  or offset measures.

For some postgrad courses with HECs - it is dependent on your degree - my friend who is a permanent resident cannot get a HECs funded place because of his results. I got HECs because my results are good for my basic degree. HECs loans are relatively easy to pay back. The most u get for income tax is 27% and if your bracket is below 60,000 and above 38,000 - the HECs payment is an additional 3.8% - comes about 31% or so .<br><br>There are people who make it and there are people who don't. The ones who don't are the ones who go back complaining about how lousy australia is . One thing I like about Australia is that they look at  merits you have earnt while working  , not because you are on government scholarship .  You are not condemned . Opportunity is wide if you know how the seize the chance. Let me teach you a new term now - salary packaging . Go ask your friends if they ever use it - that is what offsets the tax rate the most .<br><br>Oh ya , do you know some taxi drivers in melbourne  have a few properties? So don't tell me about people suffering from a lack of degree. I know an aussie student who works part time as a clinical assistant and part time as a garden designer- that boy earns alot and he invests it . How admirable is that? Of course he is stingy with his money . Oh yeah one of my ex colleague's husband is a plumber - I don't see them having a problem with 2 houses and 2 mercedes benz. Get to know an accountant  - use the bank's offer for such free financial planner etc. Many ways to cut down tax .<br><br>My ex colleague , Miko , started off as having the same pay  and then rising upwards but  the clever bugger actually managed to land a mortgage 50% of his property in 4 years, and oh yah he paid 50% upfront - how he did it was to see an accountant and a financial adviser and they gave him good advice on expanding his money ( we are talking a 300k property)  . I managed to save 14k in 2 years , so what is the problem here? When you move , you always incur a "relocation" debt , like it or not - therefore your job must be able to pay off your debts in 3 months or else it is not a good choice of work . Be extra careful how money goes out in Australia - because I notice when I look at my bill - how much I get charge , what is taking money out from me on a regular basis etc . Go for the cheapest !<br><br>Who are you kidding? In Singapore , everything is money and who has the most money has the most say , with money I would come back and live in Singapore . In Australia , life is slower and nicer - and yeah we do earn alot better but we also have a life . Hey how would I know ? BECAUSE I WORKED IN SINGAPORE since I was 15 ( part time jobs, odd jobs , full time professional job etc) .<br><br>Thank you very much , I have seen the grass on Singapore's fields ...but no thanks - I prefer australia's</div>

I am in my 40s.<br><br>Employers are reluctant to recruit older candidates because they believe such workers are not healthy and would cost them in medical expenses. I find such discrimination grossly unfair.<br><br>As the population ages, Singapore needs to keep older workers employed for longer. Older candidates should be assessed and recruited according to the same criteria as younger ones.<br><br>If this issue is not addressed soon, older job seekers would become disillusioned and leave Singapore to take up jobs overseas. It would be a shame to lose talented, able and healthy workers to other developed countries due to this age discrimination.<br><br>Why should we be penalised when we have taken up the Government's challenge to upgrade our skills and qualification?<br><br>Sharon Lee Soh Leng (Ms)<br><br></div>

Those who perform badly are entitled it if they go to a third tier ( meaning : no reputation) university because no one wants to get into those universities unless they are desperate enough to get a degree. Either that or they applied to do a course which not much people want to do  like horticulture , rural agricultural management etc .<br><br>PR basis for postgrad depends on what you want to study .Bearing in mind there are 2 systems - HEC HELP and FEE HELP . Very limited post grad courses are HECs based unless the government wants to train professionals which are in shortage like teaching, public health and nursing.<br><br>If anyone tells u they are taking HECs for medicine , law and business post grad - then they are seriously BSing you or themselves  because these 3 have no HECs - they do have bursaries to help the unfortunate but NO HECS.<br><br>FEE help is the stinger - it loans money to students and they pay full price ( near to international fees ) to study in the course. When taxes come , they are very very screwed because 1 year could mean anything from 12k to 30k depending on what they are doing<br><br>The group 8 universities are the first tier .<br><br></div>
