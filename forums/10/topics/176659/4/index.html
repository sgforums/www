According to MOM statistical data, Long-term Unemployed Persons refers to unemployed persons who have been unemployed for 25 weeks or more.<br><br>A2. Yes. They include persons who were not working but were taking steps to start their own business or taking up a new job after the reference period.<br></div></blockquote>Thanks for your information. I am quite ignorant about MOM's jobless figure. If they classify jobless figure as anyone who is jobless for more than 25 weeks and still seeking jobs, then this group should not be called unemployed but more appropriately temporary unemployed or economically active unemployed group..<br><br>If they subtract from the total figure of long-term unemployed (exceeding 25 weeks) those who are no longer looking for jobs due to hopelessness in looking for jobs, then the jobless figure might look artificially low.<br></div>

Less on assumptions and academic and more on practical application of knowledge at all level and new technologies which work.<br><br>Computer-related manufacturings and software developments and hand=phone upgrades are all areas we can tap on since we have many educated graduates in these fields from the past who may be now unemployed and staying at home to look after children.<br><br>So there should be Sun Sze Art of War ministers to lead and create holistic start-ups from A to Z to bring out these industires as what Taiwan did in the early 1970s to start up their computer industries.<br><br>Problem is: our ministers may be uninformed or lacking passion in such areas. So at the end we may be unable to move from here to upgrade our economy and we will have to keep giving some excuses about lack of results or our market being too small etc in such areas.<br><br></div>
