According to MOM statistical data, Long-term Unemployed Persons refers to unemployed persons who have been unemployed for 25 weeks or more.<br><br>A2. Yes. They include persons who were not working but were taking steps to start their own business or taking up a new job after the reference period.<br></div>

More business, more contracts. They like it too cos they are free to do other stuff and also make good money while fulfilling those contracts. Business is competitive man, but I thrive on it cos I am very very competitive.
