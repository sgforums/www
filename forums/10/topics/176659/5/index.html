Where have you been all the while? In Aussie land?</blockquote>If government really put a lot of money into technology, I will be happy. The thing is, most of these jobs go to foreigners. Like the info tech security, they are not going to hire locals to monitor our traffic, instead, outsiders are hired to do it. Number one reason for it is because Singapore don't offer info tech security courses in universities. And to go into this specific field is damn hard, according to one of those in the field. He says you need to go through lots of tests, know a lot about business, and most importantly, experience in the info tech security field. You can start from scratch, like being a technician, but it is a very long way to go.</div>

If you see the gp , medicare will compensate you the standard 29 dollars and you cover the gap ( which is usually 1 to 5 dollars more) . Medicare also subsidises CXR and all essential diagnostic tests . They placed a price restriction on pharmaceuticals which USA is trying to get rid of  via the free trade agreement,  called the PBS scheme - the maximum you pay as a resident is 23.70 for an approved necessary drugs ( i.e. lipitor)  which may cost 125 dollars in Singapore. Of course if you want diet drugs (i.e. sibutramine) then you pay full cost . 2 Inhalers , antibiotics x 2 boxes , steroids cost me 23.70 for my broncho pneumonia in the past 2 years - it is as good as it gets.<br><br>The  medicare is levied in your income tax each year on an annual basis - tagged to the income you earn plus you get rebates from private health insurance which covers dental ( teeth is gooood with 2 free checkups)  , optical ( paid 40 bucks for an armani specs and claim the rest hahah) , chiro/physio , medical equipment etc. Of course if you use public system only - then you have to be placed in waiting lists but if you have private healthcover - you jump the queue lah . Emergencies are always first though regardless of public or private.<br><br>Australian housing is cheap if you know how to drive.  HDB only 99 years - Australia free hold for your kids, your grand kids , your great great grand kids, your great great great grand kids . You tell me which is truly your own .<br><br>If you are a resident , uni fees also cheaper if you do well in school and get into HECs system - which can be defered and taken out of your income ( when you start full time work) .<br><br>Yes taxes are high but the pay is even higher than Singapore . I earn at least twice or thrice as much here after taxes are taken out  than what I earn in Singapore. So which place is better?<br><br></div>

If you see the gp , medicare will compensate you the standard 29 dollars and you cover the gap ( which is usually 1 to 5 dollars more) . Medicare also subsidises CXR and all essential diagnostic tests . They placed a price restriction on pharmaceuticals which USA is trying to get rid of  via the free trade agreement,  called the PBS scheme - the maximum you pay as a resident is 23.70 for an approved necessary drugs ( i.e. lipitor)  which may cost 125 dollars in Singapore. Of course if you want diet drugs (i.e. sibutramine) then you pay full cost . 2 Inhalers , antibiotics x 2 boxes , steroids cost me 23.70 for my broncho pneumonia in the past 2 years - it is as good as it gets.<br><br>The  medicare is levied in your income tax each year on an annual basis - tagged to the income you earn plus you get rebates from private health insurance which covers dental ( teeth is gooood with 2 free checkups)  , optical ( paid 40 bucks for an armani specs and claim the rest hahah) , chiro/physio , medical equipment etc. Of course if you use public system only - then you have to be placed in waiting lists but if you have private healthcover - you jump the queue lah . Emergencies are always first though regardless of public or private.<br><br>Australian housing is cheap if you know how to drive.  HDB only 99 years - Australia free hold for your kids, your grand kids , your great great grand kids, your great great great grand kids . You tell me which is truly your own .<br><br>If you are a resident , uni fees also cheaper if you do well in school and get into HECs system - which can be defered and taken out of your income ( when you start full time work) .<br><br>Yes taxes are high but the pay is even higher than Singapore . I earn at least twice or thrice as much here after taxes are taken out  than what I earn in Singapore. So which place is better?<br><br></div></blockquote>yeah abt the medicare it may be so, but for housing, if you go to any of the rental company, there are still many people that can't afford their own housing so yeah ppl that can afford will get a free hold, but what about those that cannot afford? in singapore how many ppl don't have their own houses as compare to australia?<br><br>as for the uni fees, i have friends that are PR and grumble when they have to pay the fees back on top of the tax and some of them are struggling with such a huge chunk of paycheck going into payment. also most of them went back to their countries after study as they can't afford such a high repayment.<br><br>as long as you are a citizen or pr you are entitled to use HECS to defer the fees until you start work and not when you are doing well.<br><br>no doubt you get to defer, but you don't get subsidize like in SIngapore, so the good thing is we are pretty heavy subsidize but need to pay on the spot, while australia you don't get that but you get to pay when you started off. so trade off is do you want to be heavily in debts before you even start working? either way there are pros and cons to it.<br><br>tax are high, you still earn more then what you get in singapore, but think of those that do not have a degree, they don't always earn enough and don't forget in australia they always have strike to ask for increase in pay when they already have a minimun wages system in hand. and this minimum are already higher as compare to most countries.<br><br>good example is my uni lecturers do go on strike organised by unions for requesting more wages during the peak period of uni.<br><br>finally, the things in australia is expensive too, like eletronics good, computer etc are way much more expensive then other countries. the only cheap thing perhap is the car which i really envy of the price that they are paying. but wel in australia you can't live without one like in singapore.<br><br>anyway as i said before there is no perfect country to live in, it all depend on what is our piority in life and if ppl think that money is their main piority then maybe singapore is not a place for them. each pros come with it own package of cons so there no such thing as perfect, we just have to work our way around it.</div>
