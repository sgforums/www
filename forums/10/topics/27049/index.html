            <div class='col-md body'>who will benefit most... if changi airport control tower is hit by a suicide 'JI terrorist'......?<br><br>currently... changi airport CT controls civilian air traffic over a huge expanse covering the entire southern half of south china sea... east and west malaysia airspace and part of indonesia airspace....<br><br>could it be?......<br><br>1. malaysia who have always wanted regional air traffic control to be from KL newest airport?? a disabled changi CT would effectively results in KLIA as the new de facto regional air control centre....<br><br>2.

BUT a radar for air traffic control is also a national symbol meh??? since when??? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>IF i am a TRUE BLUE JI terrorist... wont it be more 'GLORIUS' if i chiong the plane into terminal 1 or terminal 2?? the damage would be more spectacular and you effectively clear Changi airport right off the global map.....<br><br>Why the idea of chionging on the control tower.... seems to me... the intention... was not at hitting a singapore symbol.... They seems more intent on taking out the CAAS air traffic control..... to the benefit of you know who......*look north*<br><br>lastly.... if i want to hit a singapore symbol of power.... i would have gone for the parliament house opposite the funan centre.... Even the tall tall banking buildings looks far better then changi tower.....<br><br>I suspect... a malaysian hand in the JI......affair.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>give it a rest tripwire... read this.<br><br>http://www.singapore-window.org/sw02/020921ag.htm<br><br>i think they would have put in more effort to train whoever they intended to unleash on poor 'lil singapore... at least along the lines of the Confrontation... at least the HAD explosives, were properly trained and succeeded in setting it off at mcdonald house...<br><br>this is just a half-baked attempt at matyrdom which went badly wrong... airlines don't shift overnight to other airports offering better rates... and it is actually possible to have a temporary setup to replace the control towers even if they were blown up. 80-90% of the capabilities could be restored within hours.<br><br>good idea to crash planes into T1 and T2, but i don't think the JI actually had the funding or the training to pull it off. the Al Q plan took months and lots of money. if Al Q had been determined to pull something off here, they would have succeeded. they wouldn't have relied too much on a bunch of half-trained imbeciles.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, everything is possible... Since these terrorists do not conform to conventional thinking, it is hard for us to try and find out their intentions, especially if they wake up one day and say "hey, lets bomb some radars, that will confuse everyone". So lets leave the guesswork and investigations to the ISD, there is no point for us to ponder over such matters which is beyond us.<br><br>As for half-trained, I do not know, but they have a cause and are determined to reach it, it is just that they were arrested before they could pull off anything. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to turn a plane downwards, or pull a pin on a grenade, I don't think we should under-estimate our enemy.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think that some of you have are very complacent on this issue. Terrorism and terrorists cannot be under-estimated by any measure. You and I know that they can do anything they want, whichever way they want, especially if they operate in small cells, or even individually. I agree that the JI has been given a big blow as many members were arrested for what they had tried to do, but that is no guarantee that there are no more members, or there are no more groups out there. I find it very rhetoric when someone says that they can't have the capability to do that. It is a very complacent mentality, must you wait until something happens before it can be changed?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i don't mean to imply that we should do nothing until something blows up. but it doesn't help to exaggerate a threat out of proportion.<br><br>like i said before: these people never stood a chance because Sg is so small. u can't take a shit without them knowing what u ate the day before!! how on earth were they going to refine so much fertiizer into TNT without anyone finding out! but the press was talking about it as if the fertilizer could explode by itself! <strong>hello! its fertilizer! not plutonium!! </strong><br><br>and i did not say that we ought to have left these people alone. that they were caught is a good thing. they <strong>could</strong> have done a lot of damage and they had every intention and commitment to do so.<br><br>but they were no where close as far as the physical preparations were concerned and it would have been extremely unlikely that they could get that far under the constraints they were working under.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>CX, I agree with your general views, but maybe you could change your perspective. I concur that it is extremely difficult for them to produce explosives here, and perhaps the media is being too hyped up on this issue, however, we must realise that explosives and bombs are not the only way they can work. If your arguments are based solely on the fact that they will rely on explosives, then I agree with your views. If that was only an example, then I beg to differ.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>not that i'm being bigoted or anything but they WERE intending to use bombs and they failed. no point speculating that they COULD have used other methods.<br><br>bombs were chosen with good reasons. its a terrorist favourite. its loud, its effective and it makes a point. it makes people sit up and listen.<br><br>u don't get the same effect by unscrewing a water pipe with a monkey wrench. u could try driving a truck through the gates and crash it somewhere but u won't get very far.<br><br>they don't just have means. they also had ends the hoped to achieve with these means so they won't use ANY available method, but methods which can correspond to these ends.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Makes sense, but these guys are labelled terrorists for a reason. They do not conform to logical thinking, and it is suicide if we try to figure out what they are going to do by OUR logic. In other words, we may never know how they think, not even top psychologists will be able to do it.</div>
