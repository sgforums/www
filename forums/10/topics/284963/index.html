            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Time for a "Protest Corner"?</strong><br><br>Ever since Myanmar entered a state of mayhem, the issue of peaceful assembly has surfaced in Singapore once again.<br><br>The two issues became intertwined when Burmese around the world gathered on the streets of their newfound home countries to protest against the cruelty of the Junta military government, accompanied by their newfound countrymen.<br><br>There were perceptions that the responses of the Burmese community in Singapore and their citizen counterparts became somewhat muted in the hands of the authorities.<br><br>This stood out like a sore thumb when measured against the treatment by governments towards similar protests in other countries around the world.<br><br>The Singapore government has, to its modest credit, allowed only pockets of peaceful gatherings in the island state - indoors - whereas a local student whose online application to conduct an outdoor protest out of support for his Burmese friends was rejected.<br><br>In my view, it is perhaps time to ponder over the idea of establishing an outdoor "Protest Corner" in Singapore.<br><br>Just like how it erected a "Speakers' Corner" in Hong Lim Park at the start of September 2000 to facilitate public-delivered speeches, the "Protest Corner" can facilitate public-initiated civil society action - albeit with rules necessary though not necessarily appreciated.<br><br>Never mind that the Speakers' Corner today is nearly as silent as a wall because if the "Protest Corner" results in the same, all the more there should be no reason for the authorities to lose sleep over it.<br><br>Article 14, clause (A) of the Singapore Constitution, under "Freedom of speech, assembly and association", states "every citizen of Singapore has the right to freedom of speech and expression".<br><br>14 (B) continues with "all citizens of Singapore have the right to assemble peaceably and without arms".<br><br>At this point, (C) being "all citizens of Singapore have the right to form associations" as well as the exception clauses (2) and (3) are irrelevant to and accordingly omitted from this discussion.<br><br>Relatively speaking, the Speakers' Corner fulfilled the requirements of 14 (A) and a "Protest Corner" could serve to fulfill 14 (B).<br><br>There are three foremost reasons why this idea should be seriously considered.<br><br>Firstly, the government can be saved the embarrassment of not satisfying clauses etched in the Constitution that it neither cannot nor desires of it to be rid of and therefore, is justifiably expected of any government to defend arduously.<br><br>Otherwise, it may fail to convince quarters of Singaporeans who decry that the exception clauses are upheld more often than what lies outside them.<br><br>Secondly, it will allow groups of people to assemble peacefully out of their beliefs for human rights without infringing upon the human rights of the rest of the non-participating Singaporeans, who may find themselves obstructed from their next appointment due to protests occurring at an unanticipated time and place getting in their way.<br><br>The principle of this is the same as to why governments "occupy" certain "terrain" to prevent black markets from taking root.<br><br>Thirdly and finally, it serves as a good training ground for the Singapore police to handle and manage crowds, an area they are predictably not experienced in and may overreact in the event of further developments in circumstances.<br><br><a href="http://melvintansg.blogspot.com/2007/10/time-for-protest-corner.html" rel="nofollow">http://melvintansg.blogspot.com/2007/10/time-for-protest-corner.html</a></div>

They wanted a free-speech venue - for other Singaporeans, not themselves.<br><br>Of course, the restrictions were another cause - primarily the ban on microphones.<br><br>I notice that since the Speakers' Corner was set up, freedom of speech has become a less-discussed topic. In the past (late 90s) it dominated a discussion board. Even acts of illegal speeches have now switched to illegal protests.<br><br>As for "safety", personally, I have recorded about 5 times with the Kreta Ayer Police Post and am still in one piece <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Really, to actively participate in politics (party or activism), one can come out in one piece. Avoid doing it alone and seek guidance. Some may see bravery as the "right way" and do not want to participate in an "easy way" but these self-defined parameters are sometimes used as reasons for avoidance from politics.<br><br>This will also be a litmus test on the society.<br><br>Regards</div>

I cannot find a reason to arrest these black supporters shopping in their favorite T-shirts.  One kind of thing I suspect may happen is a signal like the case of people complain sg no freedom to voice out like hyde park,  something may be introduced to signal that even this silencer style can lead one to trouble. This is only my uneducated, wild wild guess based on a nightmare I had last night.<br><br>As of now, I cannot find any way to stop this black saturday from being carried out , if someone 'crazy' enough wants to launch it again. Tho  I  cannot find a way, this does not indicate I support it. In fact, as I gazellianly pointed out, I am not going to say I am in favor of this, in public.  I remain neutral in the public eye.

Tang Liang Hong was, but they are all politicians, not people who go to Speakers' Corner.<br><br>Mr Brown was censored by TODAY and had his column dropped. Yes, MICA overreacted. But was in no way persecuted. He still has his blog running. TODAY is no big deal.<br><br>No one has been sued for defamation for speaking at Speakers' Corner. The only one who was charged (not sued) was Chee who spoke on the tudung issue which was a racial issue banned from being highlighted at Speakers' Corner. Tan Kim Chuang and former SPP (Vice Chairman?) S Kunalen has made the most number of speeches (more than 200 each?), being there every weekend. Nothing happened.<br><br>A lot of fear is perceived because we use wrong examples and without looking at the various cases as individual ones and examine them with more detail.<br><br>On closer look, the only thing that can get one of these suits is if one implies legal impropriety on a person's part. I don't fully agree that such things cannot be questioned because, PAP wants proof before you raise such allegations, but if you don't ask, you don't know.<br><br>Then again, if PAP relents, will people use this privilege to score political points until the government cannot work? And if the government cannot work, won't the people suffer?<br><br>I have also raised this example before many times over last 10 years that Chiam See Tong sued two ministers for alleging that the former plotted the SIA illegal strike in 1982 (when it was another SDP member whom Chiam and the CEC expelled) and Chiam won out of court settlement.<br><br>Regards</div>
