            <div class='col-md body'><p>Bros, do not be fooled by the loyalties of some of these so called new Singaporeans. I at least know 1 family who works this way:<br><br>Husband came to Singapore first. Got a job in Singapore and successfully obtained an employment pass to work here. Then got wife into Singapore with dependant pass. Wife later also found a job here in Singapore.<br><br>After awhile, both successfully obtained their PRs. They were invited to become Singapore citizens at first but they simply put it aside. Their 2 sons were subsequently born in Singapore but were PRs since both husband and wife were PRs.<br><br>Later, the guy opted to become Singapore citizen but wife and sons remained as PRs. He became a citizen for our red passport as he has to travel a lot and it was a hassle to keep applying for visas with his old passport. Wife remains as PR cause they decided that one of them should retain their original nationality since they plan to retire back in their home country one day. With the money they make here and their CPFs, they can go back to do business, buy lands etc. Hence, it's impt to have one of them still retains the original nationality.<br><br>And finally, since they do not intend to have their sons to serve NS, they dont want them to become citizens. That is why the wife gave birth to their kids when husband and wife were still PRs.<br><br>So much for new citizens' loyalties....<br><br>Yup. I know a few too, PRC chinese. They will move on when the kids are bigger. No NS.<br><br>Yes, that family I quoted is also from PRC... <br><br>18557.5 in reply to 18557.4 <br><br>THe PRCs are not stupid, the ones I know are here for business and employment. Or some to "run $$" from China.<br><br>Loyalty to this country? I never expect it from them.<br><br>One of the family members got sin citizenship enough liao. No need whole family. THey work on this loop hole.</p></div>
