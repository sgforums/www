              <p>We cannot consider ourselves latter generations of foreigners. simply because we have no "home" country to go back to. We are descendents of immigrants but we are definitely not foreigners.</p>
              <p>I don't deny the it will be ideal for foreigners to take up jobs in the lower grade level. This does indeed help cut down living costs and increase price advantage and does benefit Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>Companies seeking to manufacture labor intensive and low unit cost products.. they will not look at setting up factories in Singapore, with or without FT. Since the high cost of living will not make such operation viable.</p>
              <p>Singapore has her niche in the higher tech and higher unit value market.</p>
              <p>But if this segment gets saturated with FTs.. it will defeat the purpose of having low cost foreign labor.</p>
              <p>Then perhaps.. the next question will be.</p>
              <p>Out of so many FTs.. how many has their own families living here with them.. in Singapore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Like many foreigners in the US markets.. they live frugally.. send most of their earnings back home to build a better life for their families where cost of living is so much lower. So it doesn't matter if they get a lower pay than SG guys.</p>
              <p>However, SG guys cannot benefit from such arrangement. Unless we all plan to retire in another country.</p>
              <p>Companies will try to provide an equitable pay package in order to retain employees.</p>

              <p><br>It is a totally different story in school. It is healthy competition since the local and foreigner are competing in similar condition. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>
              <p>In the real world, even if you have the same experience, qualification as FT, if the FT is willing to work at lower pay, the job will most likely go to him. Many FT are just working here temporary so the high cost of living has less effect on them. They can rent a place and save enough to go back and enjoy life.</p>
              <p>But does it make sense for Singaporean to rent a place like FT? If Singaporeans are to lower their pays to match that of FT (which is a vicious cycle), how are they supposed to survive when they retire? Hand-out from gov (which unfortunately is not a welfare one)?</p>

              <p>The main thing i see actually is, if we do not employ the lower
                      wage FT in Singapore, they will still be employed elsewhere around
                      this region. In the end, businesses would still go to their cheaper
                      services which will then be in other neighbouring countries other
                      than Singapore...</p>
              <p>Of course, this seriously drive down local wages. Then again,
                      why compete in areas in which you have no comparative advantage?
                      Why not in an area in which you could ride or control it? One
                      example would be a friend of mine; he started a company
                      specialising in bringing FTs to Singapore to work, handling their
                      work permit and all other necessary documents, etc... In such
                      industries, the company could possibly earn near 10k to 20k when
                      small, and near 100k when on a big scale...</p>

              <p>Your friend just is earning a fortune at the expense of his fellow Singaporean.

              <p>your point is valid if singapore is just starting out. however, there are already a few generations of singapore's entrenching their roots here. so, that sense of nationhood and loyalty it there. why bother with the pledge and `majulah singapura' if so....</p>
              <p>FTs are here to fill a gap and sustain singapore's economic competitiveness. singapore is attractive to FTs whose own country lag behind singapore. most who came from developed countries would not settle here. they will see this as an opportunity to enrich themselves, experience a new culture and bone a few asian chicks and then go back with bragging rights.</p>
              <p>this is a warped analogy, but in some ways, singapore is like a hooker. you extend this open invitation to anyone outside to come, stayover and have your fill as long as you contribute to its(singapore) well being economically, or is enrich by it. all in the name of survival.</p>

              cost products.. they will not look at setting up factories in
              Singapore, with or without FT. Since the high cost of living will
              not make such operation viable.</p>
              <p>Singapore has her niche in the higher tech and higher unit value
              market.</p>
              <p>But if this segment gets saturated with FTs.. it will defeat the
              purpose of having low cost foreign labor.</p>
              <p>Then perhaps.. the next question will be.</p>
              <p>Out of so many FTs.. how many has their own families living here
              with them.. in Singapore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Like many foreigners in the US markets.. they live frugally..
              send most of their earnings back home to build a better life for
              their families where cost of living is so much lower. So it doesn't
              matter if they get a lower pay than SG guys.</p>
              <p>However, SG guys cannot benefit from such arrangement. Unless we
              all plan to retire in another country.</p>
              <p>Companies will try to provide an equitable pay package in order
              to retain employees.</p>

              <p>It is true that Singapore has her niche in the higher tech and higher unit value market, but for how long more? As they say, China's strength is not only in its cheap and abundant labour, but cheap, abundant and well educated labour.</p>
              <p>It is a bit different from the situation in US, mainly because of China's extreme close proximity to Singapore. In addition, India is fast catching up in terms of technology. This close proximity results in immigrants from India and China that building up Singapore in the past. Businesses can simply move their Asian operations from Singapore to some neighbouring country.</p>
              <p>The above points shows one thing which I had tried to raise, which is, FTs settling in neighbouring countries will one day offer competition with a price so low that businesses will be willing to try them out. Slowly and surely, such businesses will move out of Singapore, and thus in order to price as competitively, one of the main costs, salary, would have to be lowered.</p>
              <p>So my point is, why not gather the FTs here instead, and keep the businesses here? Of course, there's the side effect of a lower pay bracket... which is something that might still happen if FTs are competing in a nearby country.</p>

              <p><br> It is a totally different story in school. It is healthy
              competition since the local and foreigner are competing in similar

              <p>In the real world, even if you have the same experience,
              qualification as FT, if the FT is willing to work at lower pay, the
              job will most likely go to him. Many FT are just working here
              temporary so the high cost of living has less effect on them. They
              can rent a place and save enough to go back and enjoy life.</p>
              <p>But does it make sense for Singaporean to rent a place like FT?
              If Singaporeans are to lower their pays to match that of FT (which
              is a vicious cycle), how are they supposed to survive when they
              retire? Hand-out from gov (which unfortunately is not a welfare
              one)?</p>

              <p>You have a point. But it is not perfectly similar conditions. As a forumer has pointed out before in another thread, there are PRC scholars who had completed till 3rd year uni, then jump at a scholarship to retake the 4 years of uni at NUS. This is because the competition in China is too strong, and by doing so, he gets the branding of overseas scholar + very good results because he learned most things before.</p>
              <p>Then again, as I have said in the previous page, last post, why compete in an area where you have relative low comparative advantage? No matter the criticisms of the book Rich Dad, Poor Dad, there's one thing which I feel is true: Blame the government, blame the tax structure, blame your boss, and you will be stuck in a rut, forever stuck in the 'rat race'.</p>

              <p>That is only an example; you will have to know where your strengths and weaknesses are in order to identify which areas you have comparative advantage in. It doesn't mean you have to die die only follow that pathway.</p>
              <p>If you seroiusly think engineering and IT are skills which have no "comparative advantage", and thus perhaps no necessity to learn or anything else, then you are truly stuck. Anyway, I thought the concern was that the main comparative advantage the FTs have is being able to accept a lower pay bracket to work in the field for the same experience level? There are definitely other areas in which we can exploit situations; we just have to keep thinking</p>

              <p>And can we really be so sure that these people provide a skill that us Singaporeans cannot do? I see many Singaporeans get displaced from jobs that they probably excel in, because of some Indian FT that comes along and is better at boasting about his achievements, only for this FT to submit his resumes to other countries and leaving Singapore shortly after that.</p>
              <p>Even USA has a new law to protect their own citizens (Thou shalt not hire a foreigner until thou can provide sufficient justification on why a US citizen cannot do the job). Why is our multi-million govt doing a full striptease (opening doors so widely that we are complete naked), and allowing people who have no principles or morals to come here, grab some gold, and then leave with the gold? And during this period, your own people suffer.</p>

              month and above. What sort of talent is that?</p>
              <p>And can we really be so sure that these people provide a skill
              that us Singaporeans cannot do? I see many Singaporeans get
              displaced from jobs that they probably excel in, because of some
              Indian FT that comes along and is better at boasting about his
              achievements, only for this FT to submit his resumes to other
              countries and leaving Singapore shortly after that.</p>
              <p>Even USA has a new law to protect their own citizens (Thou shalt
              not hire a foreigner until thou can provide sufficient
              justification on why a US citizen cannot do the job). Why is our
              multi-million govt doing a full striptease (opening doors so widely
              that we are complete naked), and allowing people who have no
              principles or morals to come here, grab some gold, and then leave
              with the gold? And during this period, your own people suffer.</p>

              <p>I fully believe that the PAP has gone atrociously arrogant, and that they should have a big and painful fall like Taiwanese KMT or Malaysia's BN, so that they wake up their freaking idea, and learn how to treat their citizens properly.</p>
              <p>I cannot believe words from Goh Chok Tong who said that raising the GST is unpopular policy, but its ok, because Singaporeans will just forget and vote for the PAP come next election.</p>
              <p>I can tell you, come next election, if the stupid PAP-supporters or cheapo Singaporeans (who get bought over coz of some stupid hundred dollar payout) vote for the PAP and let them win big again, the first thing they will do after that is to increase the GST to 10%.</p>

              <p><br>To answer your question. Most people will want to be in a winning team. No doubt. FT will rather go to US than Singapore because Singapore is not even winning at all.</p>
              <p>And sad to say, the government is depending on FT to allow Singapore to gain an edge over the rest rather than depending on the locals.</p>
              <p>It is a chicken and egg story with snowball effect. And to government's decision, FT is the one that is able to initiate the snowball effect.</p>
