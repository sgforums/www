              <p>Thought we should help own singaporean citizen first, and RPC or others later after we takecare of our own singaporean or pink ic holder. It seem the govt is not doing it and far from doing it!!</p>
              <p>1) Why job created so many go to foreigners when so many singaporeans are jobbless and cant get jobs. (mean foreigners 100% employed, pink ic holder many unemployed..no figure how many.)</p>
              <p>2) Homes go to foreigners, singaporean waiting long long and expensively for theirs.</p>
              <p>3) Comcare, CDC should do a professionally social way of handling then giving impedence in term of the long question forms and 40 mins ".interview"...But if a foreigners get strangled in the street immediately they are entertain without fuss..</p>

              <p>1) Any statistics showing that many Singaporeans are jobless? What is the percentage? If you want to include housewives and students who want to get jobs too, I've no comments.</p>
              <p>2) How many HDBs (those that Singaporean wait) go to foreigners?</p>

              <p>1) I have calculated before, although that was for 4 months ago</p>
              <p>880k foreigners (non-residents) employed<br> 500k PRs employed<br> 1204k Singaporeans employed and 46k unemployed<br><a href="/forums/10/topics/294807?page=2">http://www.sgforums.com/forums/10/topics/294807?page=2</a></p>
              <p>As of Feb 08, the statistics have been proven very close by a CNA article stating 900k foreigners employed.</p>
              <p>So please show us your source, statistics or calculations, before making such a big claim</p>
              <p>2) You are making a comparison between foreigners buying private property vs Singaporeans queuing up for HDB. Please tell me how fair a comparison that is.</p>
              <p>Foreigners buying private property? Do you know that for a foreigner to buy a new private house, they need to apply for a permit? (I cannot confirm for condo yet) <br>Do you know how many foreigners are actually renting places to stay?</p>
              <p>You are obviously just trying to compare expats vs commoners. Again, how fair do you think this comparison is?</p>
              <p>3) Obviously you have not got what I'm saying. I have not denied there are other Singaporeans out in the street. I'm against your statement of <br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">if a foreigners get strangled in the
                                          street immediately they are entertained without fuss.</span></p>
              <p>Are you very very sure of this underlined statement you have made?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And ya, you don't just come in into a forum for the first time, and make certain claims without showing your source and calculations, and attempt to spread your anti-foreigners sentiments here. And yes, I'm Singaporean.</p>

              <p><br>1) You want to talk about economics when economists claim that a 2% to 7% unemployment rate is technically full employment, with 20th century British economist William Beveridge stating that an unemployment rate of 3% was full employment? My statistics showed full employment technically. And I'm still asking you for your statistics. My statistics only showed 3.6% unemployed Singaporeans within the Singaporean work force. Surely you would know, since you continuously want to talk about economics, the definition of frictional unemployment.</p>
              <p>But if you want to tell me 3.6%, of which includes frictional unemployment, is many to you, I've nothing to say too. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2) Your claim is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Homes go to foreigners, singaporean waiting long long and

              <p>Don't tell me this statement is not saying that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">homes are going to foreigners, while Singaporeans can only wait for a home.</span></p>
              <p>You were not even talking about demand and supply here. Why link to it when your statement which you cannot substantiate yet?</p>
              <p>Or if you are talking about demand and supply, are you trying to imply that there are not enough homes at all for Singaporeans to stay because demand is higher than supply, thus Singaporeans have to wait, but somehow or other, foreigners do not have to wait at all?</p>
              <p>Note: I'm pointing out the "waiting long long" part, not the "expensively" part</p>
              <p>Unless you are trying to mean something else, in which case, please phrase it in a more proper manner.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>I do not deny that needy should get help with lesser fuss, but still, what are you trying to prove when you state the underlined statement, something which you cannot even tell me you are very very sure of?</p>

              <p>So does numbers really reflect the real life scenario of the people ?</p>
              <p>Since we do not have a minimum wage law, with the influx of FT..isnt it true that it will only depress wages?</p>
              <p>So,  cost of living increasing and wage going down.. the situation in Singapore will only get worst, yes ?</p>

              <p>Yep, let the people decide whether you are making baseless judgements, without any proof to back your claim, and without being able to tell me you are very sure of certain statements you yourself have made. Without even a shred of evidence, it is hard for you to convince anyone you are not making assumptions. Not to mention that you are already making anti-foreigners statements by telling me that if I'm a non-Singaporean, I do not need to reply you.</p>

              <p>Finally, you fully portrayed your anti-foreigner sentiment by <br>3) One question first..are you a singaporen?no dun have to

              <p>FT are basically competing with locals for basic housing.. so
                  that does impact the HDB availabilities .. and at the same time
                  push up prices.</p>
              <p>Since HDB's pricing is based on current market value, it only
                  makes new home harder to obtain for new couples looking to start a
                  new family . How can this be good ?</p>

              <p>I'm sympathetic too, and I have opt to continue my donations to community chest even after being 'forced' to do so during NS. But I get what you mean... Apologies to lolar for that...</p>

              <p>Again, I have to say that I have not made any statement about
              competing pay with FTs. I have no idea what you think is in my
              mind.</p>
              <p>And to think that there's no competition within schools from
              foreigners (especially in NUS) is an extremely short-sighted
              viewpoint. You just have to hear the number of people in school
              complaining to know.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And I still have no idea on how has a NS environment got to do
              with competing with foreigner.</p>

              <p>Pardon my ignorance Eagle,</p>
              <p>But your postings does seem rather pro-FTs.</p>
              <p>Also, you are aware that FT need not give up their home country's citizenship just because they choose to take up Singapore Citizenship right ?</p>
              <p>Some PRC I know.. who are both US citizens AND keep their PRC status.</p>

              <p>Actually from what I have seen, many FTs are renting houses, though I don't have any stats to back me up. Basically, it is still, at least to me, the rich in Singapore getting richer and the poor in Singapore getting poorer. The rich do buy housing properties to rent out to such people; the returns could be rather high. Although FT do compete with basic housing, they would compete mostly in the rental side. Of course, this does affect on the buying side because the rich sorts of 'hoard' properties, and yep, pushing up the prices.</p>
              <p>The main thing i see actually is, if we do not employ the lower wage FT in Singapore, they will still be employed elsewhere around this region. In the end, businesses would still go to their cheaper services which will then be in other neighbouring countries other than Singapore...</p>
              <p>Of course, this seriously drive down local wages. Then again, why compete in areas in which you have no comparative advantage? Why not in an area in which you could ride or control it? One example would be a friend of mine; he started a company specialising in bringing FTs to Singapore to work, handling their work permit and all other necessary documents, etc... In such industries, the company could possibly earn near 10k to 20k when small, and near 100k when on a big scale...</p>
