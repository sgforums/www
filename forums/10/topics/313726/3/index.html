              <p><br> To answer your question. Most people will want to be in a
              winning team. No doubt. FT will rather go to US than Singapore
              because Singapore is not even winning at all.</p>
              <p>And sad to say, the government is depending on FT to allow
              Singapore to gain an edge over the rest rather than depending on
              the locals.</p>
              <p>It is a chicken and egg story with snowball effect. And
              to government's decision, FT is the one that is able to
              initiate the snowball effect.</p>

              <p>That's made even worse when you have indian "FT"s who are good at boasting but then later on, the company finds that these people can't do their job.</p>
              <p>So what happens? A Singaporean who is capable of doing it is deprived.</p>
              <p>The Govt can do something to help minimize such cases from happening, and not perform a full striptease whereby any tom dick or harry can come to Singapore and snatch jobs.</p>
              <p>AND... pls edit your wrong mindset. This is NOT a corporation and this is NOT a market. This is A COUNTRY. A country has citizens whom the country should look after in the best interests of the country, the society, and the individual (of which the last is lacking very badly).</p>
              <p>Citizens are NOT like FTs who have a second place to run to, or looking for the next place after treating Singapore as a stepping stone.</p>

              <p>The PAP government does not release statistics of FT dont they? For eg in what sector and what kind of positions, which company are they employed in. </p>
              <p>I am pretty sure that the PAP does take of Singapore citizens in the sense that they employ local ISA agents, "journalists", "police", "army", entertainers, Singtel and other GLC low level execs. No job, sign on lah. Iron rice bowl what. I wonder if unemployment is due to the hostile economic environment to small businesses and the unentrepreneneurial nature of Singaporeans. That being said I am pretty neutral on the issue of FT. Its not as if a local cannot be trained to do the same job and the level of competence (IF not so competent to begin with).</p>
              <p>The problem has to do with pay and that local men has to do NSF duty every year, thus reducing their productivity and competitiveness. If you were a boss, who would you employ - a cheaper person who can do the same job and who does not need to go to NSF? FTs are part and parcel of the global market, virtually everywhere. However how many FTs do you REALLY need to boost an economy, improve local skills etc? Is there an official quota based on skills etc?</p>
              <p>Immigration is a hot button issue in America as well - difference being USA is half of a big continent + some islands whereas Singapore is a 600 sqkm island + several smaller islands.</p>
              <p>As we all well know, everyone on Singapore island is replaceable, EXCEPT for LKY's band of millionaires.</p>

              <p>I thought there is someone posting in ST forum regarding this job vacancy. He posted job vacancy in ST Classified and received more reply from foreigners than locals (3 locals VS 50+ foreigners applications if i'm not mistaken). He continued to state that locals do not really care about his small company.</p>
              <p>Probably we should look into this. Why do we tend to underestimate small company? Foreigners are fighting so eagerly for it while locals do not really care about it.</p>
              <p>It is also important to note that Singapore has more MNCs. MNCs are foreign companies, they do as they like and they are NOT obliged to hire Singaporeans although it will be easier if they so. But if there is cheaper labour cost, why should they spend more money on higher labor cost?</p>

              <p>That's because.. foreigners don't know what they are getting themselves into.</p>
              <p>They don't know the kiam siap culture in mini Companies.</p>
              <p>In their eyes.. they see a ticket out of their home country.. and a chance to live in Paradise.</p>
              <p>Yes.. companies only look at cost.. in the end it's the net profit they care. If they can get labor for free.. you think they don't want ?</p>
              <p>If you have been to Guam or the Vietnamese sweat shop.. you will know why we need gahmen policies to protect the people's interest.</p>

              <p>First off, 3 locals apply and 50 foreigners could simply mean that more FT are AVAILABLE to take the job.

              <p>We are given the opportunity but few are willing to explore further in SMEs because of the high risk. It is common fact but we also need to realize that we can't depend too much on MNCs - MNCs can just choose to leave anytime and leave all of us jobsless.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You can't always jump to 'openning big company' unless you have capital. you should start small and expand slowly. Probably the job advertisement is for SME but at least if the company expands and you perform well, you will be rewarded (either bonus or promotion)</p>
