            <div class='col-md body'>Yesterday after long time I received an invitation from this friend<br>to visit this pub called Insomnia in Chijmes. The party was supposed<br>to start at 9p.m. but I reached there early, my friend and her group<br>were not there yet. I thought that I will just hang around and come<br>back later. When I came back at 9:20 my friends were already inside<br>and there was a long queue outside. Well, I waited for 25 mins. in<br>the queue. Meanwhile, I chatted with two guys who were in front of<br>me in the queue, Stefan and Marco from Germany!! Nice guys! They<br>have been in Singapore for a week now and have planned to visit KL<br>and Bangkok next. Meanwhile, the queue moved and my number came. I<br>was really shocked to know from the Caucasian guy at the door that<br>this is a special party and only members and regulars are allowed.<br><br>Then I asked him, "I have been here quite few times and I didn't see<br>you checking any membership cards or anything and there's nothing<br>written on the information board as well! It just says Women and<br>Men's Party on Wednesday."<br><br>His reply was, "I don't care I can't let you in!". I felt so bloody<br>insulted and knew exactly why he just can't let me in even I'm<br>paying cover. Although most of the people in the queue were<br>tourists, over 90 % of them were Caucasians.<br><br>I know this is very common in western countries. In fact, I faced<br>the same problem when I visited Frankfurt on a business trip. But I<br>was always so proud to tell that this will never happen in my<br>adopted home, Singapore. How proudly I used to tell this to those<br>visitors from Europe!<br>Couple of months back I remember similar thing happened to our<br>friends.It was a same place Insomnia. Let's come together and boycott this place Insomnia and end racism.<br><br>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>When you experience such discrimination, do not back down and let them run roughshod over you.Do not get violent but maintain your firm stand.Demand that they prove it's a private party or else they let you in.Ask them to show proof of invitiation of reservation, if the boorish bouncer objects, ask to see the manager and let all in ear-shot know that this is an illegal act.When and if the manager arrives, make him understand what is going on and tell him in no uncertain terms that he'll be reported to the relevant authorities for misleading advertisment.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You are right one should not back down. ThatÂ’s why I asked him those questions that he is not checking any invitations or membership cards and then how tourist can be regulars. But that guys was so rude.  I thought no point fighting for an entry because even if I go in I donÂ’t think I can enjoy the evening. I guess the guy on the door himself looked like manager sort of. BTW how to report to relevant authorities in such cases?<br><br>Regards<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks LazerLordz, but I think one need to be a member of CASE and also I have no claims. Instead I just wrote it to St and Today lets see now whether they publish or not.<br><br>cheers</div>
