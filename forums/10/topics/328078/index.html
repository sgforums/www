              <p>''Chee siblings, 5 others charged'',2 years after the offences,</p>
              <p>for taking part in an unlawful assembly and/or procession</p>
              <p>during IMF-WB 2006 meeting.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Why prosecution now but not earlier</strong></span></p>
              <p>It is a answer we all want to know.But i think it is</p>
              <p>related to AG and his high ranking officers's wisdoms.</p>
              <p>After reviewing the files of 72 hours stand off,</p>
              <p>they decide go ahead.Just like that.</p>
              <p>An offence is offence.AG in 2006 did not pursue do not</p>
              <p>bar the current AG to pursue.Did gavaman or AG promise</p>
              <p>not to take action?</p>
              <p>This kind of'' No active action'' promise from gavaman only</p>
              <p>guranteed related to s 377A.LKY said pllice would not charge into bedroom</p>
              <p>and current AG said no one will amush u in bushes for s 377A.</p>
              <p>Read ST interview with new AG.</p>
              <p>Look out.This is an unusual AG---without Fears and Favours!!</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>72 hours stand off waste of security resources</strong></span></p>
              <p>The then security force was too generous to Chees.</p>
              <p>They could just  take Chees off the street after adequate warnings.</p>
              <p>There is no need IMF -WB to teach us how to run the country.</p>
              <p>IMF-WB better spend time now to teach USA,UK etc how to fix the</p>
              <p>over--lending problems aka sub--primes crisis!!</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Dunt ask Chee go to jail while u watch the Game</strong></span></p>
              <p>Many of u just do the arms chair politicians by critizing PAP</p>
              <p>this or that.U juys cheer the Chees but dare not</p>
              <p>go into the track and run.What a shame.</p>
              <p>To me,u just asking Chees,like Gopalan Nair did,go to jail</p>
              <p>as many as possible then Chees will succeed!!</p>
              <p>But u stay at home ,watching TV!!</p>

              <blockquote>SEVEN people were charged in a magistrate's court on Thursday with
              taking part in an unlawful assembly and/or procession in 2006.
              <p>Chee Soon Juan, 46, secretary-general of Singapore Democratic
              Party, his 46-year-old sister, Chee Siok Chin, and national serviceman
              Teoh Tian Jing, 23, each face two charges.</p>
              <p>The Chee siblings are accused of taking part in an assembly near <a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/Breaking%2BNews/Courts%2Band%2BCrime/Story/Raffles%20%20-%20http://www.rednano.sg/sfe/map.action?view=map&amp;querystring=252+north+bridge+road&amp;map.x=21&amp;map.y=8">Raffles City Shopping Centre</a> with a few others on Sept 10, 2006, and six days later, at a procession near the Speakers' Corner at Hong Lim Park.</p>
              <p>Teoh allegedly took part in a procession near the Speakers'
              Corner as well as in front of Parliament House on the same day of Sept
              16, 2006.</p>
              <p>SDP chairman Gandhi Ambalam, 65, and assistant treasurer Jeffrey George, 44, are accused of the three incidents.</p>
              <p>SDP supporter Yap Keng Ho, 46, and Harkirat Kaur, 29, who does
              freelance editorial work, are accused of one charge each involving the
              Speakers' Corner and Raffles City gathering respectively.</p>
              <p>Harkirat indicated that she wished to plead guilty and her case will be mentioned on Sept 1.</p>
              <p>Except for Teoh whose pre-trial date is on Aug 27, the others will appear in court again on Sept 3.</p>
              <p>If convicted, they can be fined up to $1,000 each.</p>
              <p>During the court session, most of them cited the Constitution
              which gives citizens the right to freedom of speech and expression.</p>

              <p>Uncle Yap's story about keep an arm's length from SDO here</p>
              <blockquote>Although I assisted SDP'e election campaign in 2006, I found my fight
              had been too much compromised and softened to suit the SDP.
              Particularly, I disagreed with them that they withdrew the NKF issue
              for election after being sued, and allowed 10 CEC members to apologize
              to the lame bastard famiLEE. Therefore after the GE, I began to have
              much reservation in further accepting any party policy of SDP and I
              stopped wearing SDP's party T-shirts.<br></blockquote>

              <p>I htink, other country people see it will laugh man, what are the cops doing to those 6 people at speaker korner and in the first place they will laugh at the fact that singapore has a speaker corner designated for speaking.</p>
