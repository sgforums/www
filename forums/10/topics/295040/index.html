            <div class='col-md body'>More government funds for CCCs to help the needy: Dr Balakrishnan<br><br>By May Wong, Channel NewsAsia | Posted: 02 December 2007 2025 hrs<br><br>More government funds for CCCs to help the needy: Dr Balakrishnan<br><br>SINGAPORE : The government wants to pump in more money into Citizens' Consultative Committees (CCCs) to allow them to provide additional assistance programmes to better help needy Singaporeans.<br><br>Community Development, Youth and Sports Minister, Vivian Balakrishnan, announced this at a dialogue session with some 200 Changi Simei residents on Sunday.<br><br>The dialogue, which lasted over an hour, was held after he toured Simei.<br><br>This is Dr Balakrishnan's first such visit to the area.<br><br>Touring the Simei neighbourhood, Dr Balakrishnan is aware that Singaporeans are growing more concerned about the rising cost of living.<br><br>Last month, the government announced that inflation - which is the rise in prices for goods and services - could hit a high of five percent for the first quarter of next year.<br><br>The last time inflation hit a high of four percent was in July 1991.<br><br>And at a dialogue session, many residents asked how the government will help, especially the low-income, with increasing living costs.<br><br>Speaking to reporters later, Dr Balakrishnan assured that the government is monitoring the situation closely, but will start by making sure CCCs have sufficient funds for more help programmes.<br><br>He said: "That means, for instance, outreach programmes and then to be able to help families in need with additional vouchers for food or even additional cash vouchers as well as to work with local organisations and vendors and hawkers, so that we make sure that we can give that assurance, that nobody will go hungry in Singapore. These plans are still being formulated but I am confident I can give that assurance."<br><br>Every year, CCCs have an annual fund of S$42,000 to tap on to help the less fortunate residents.<br><br>Singapore has 84 CCCs, but Dr Balakrishnan said, in fact, many don't end up spending that money.<br><br>He said: "So it's not for lack of money, but we'll make sure that if the needs go up, more funds (will be) available. So what I'm signalling is that we can and we will do more if needs increase. But I also want to share with you that I've also been tracking the number of appeals for help both in terms of those who apply to the Community Development Councils (CDCs), as well as those who applied to the CCCs.<br><br>"And actually if we compare the third quarter of this year's figures with the third quarter of last year, actually, overall, the numbers have come down. The reason for that is clearly because the economy is doing well and more and more people are able to get jobs or to get wage increases.<br><br>"But I'm also aware that even if the general economy improves, there may still be a segment who risk being left behind. So my focus is to make sure that this small segment has adequate attention and adequate resources available."<br><br>To better reach out to needy Singaporeans, a new hotline named ComCare Call will also be launched next month.<br><br>This toll-free number 1800-222-0000 will be directed to the various help organisations like the CDCs.<br><br>What the organisations will do then is to identify the kind of assistance a family requires and then customise it to meet their specific needs.<br><br>Dr Balakrishnan added that now is the best time to beef up Singapore's multi-layered social safety nets because of the good employment rate and growing economy.<br><br>Singaporeans can then enjoy the fruits of labour later once the government ensures the safety nets can withstand the stresses of increased inflation and future challenges.<br><br>Dr Balakrishnan said more details for the additional funding for the CCCs will be announced in the Budget speech next year. - CNA/ch<br><br></div>

How long must we pretend that the needy in Singapore exist in Mars? Yes, they exist but somewhere out of MY universe. Can we really blame them for not being to find jobs or just having a general despair with their lives? What kind of imposition are we placing on other Singaporeans, instead of listening and trying to reconstruct what they actually feel, think and breathe?<br><a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/portal/site/STI/menuitem.c2aef3d65baca16abb31f610a06310a0/?" rel="nofollow">http://www.straitstimes.com/portal/site/STI/menuitem.c2aef3d65baca16abb31f610a06310a0/?</a><br><br>Does it mean that because we are educated that we think that people are merely lazy? Or do we think we have done our job just because we have policies* available to help the people? It is one thing to have policies, it is another to have enough people to implement them effectively. It is one thing to be educated, it is another to think that every Singaporeans have the same opportunity as you to be educated.<br><br>As James Scott argues, I paraphase, LetÂ’s not conflate stateÂ’s policies with the actual social reality and implementation on the ground. Wise words indeed.<br><br><strong>Help for the poor: So close, yet so far<br><br>By Vivi Zainol, For The Straits Times</strong><br><br>WHY do needy Singaporeans continue to fall through the cracks despite the GovernmentÂ’s array of public aid schemes?<br><br>To tackle this question, 18 of my students at Ngee Ann Polytechnic interviewed more than 30 low-income households for a vacation module. They found the biggest barriers to be education and language.<br><br>Many are illiterate. With little knowledge or understanding of schemes to help them, itÂ’s not surprising that some say they know the Government is helping them, but they feel it is not doing enough.<br><br>Some would rather get an extra job than ask for help. Others struggle to make themselves understood and say they do not have the time, money or energy to make return trips to their MP or Community Development Councils (CDCs) to ask for more help.<br><br>For those who did bother, a common complaint heard by students was that the CDC officers are rude.<br><br>Several years ago, as a Straits Times community reporter, I had heard the same comment when I asked a woman with three children, and whose husband was in jail for a drug offence, why she did not ask for help. Describing how her experience with CDCs turned her off, she said a CDC officer had sarcastically asked her: Â‘DidnÂ’t your husband leave you any money?Â’<br><br>Â‘If he had, why would I be asking for help?Â’ said the troubled woman, who had contemplated suicide.<br><br>One group of Ngee Ann students decided to observe CDC officers in action after receiving the feedback. At one CDC, officers were unfailingly polite - it was the low-income group which was being demanding and uncooperative. However, all the CDC officers were Chinese - help-seekers speaking Malay and Indian had to struggle to make themselves understood.<br><br>At another CDC, student Nurlina Fatima Shafrin, 18, recalled how a CDC officer was heard commenting loudly to another officer nearby on how Â‘irritatingÂ’ the people who had come to ask for help were, even when the latter, who were filling up forms, could hear them.<br><br>What is interesting to note is that interviews by students uncovered a perception among low-income earners that the higher-educated tend to look down on them and are arrogant. Formally attired CDC officers also unintentionally give the impression that they are less approachable.<br><br>Not all CDC officers are trained social workers - there are not enough social workers to go around in Singapore.<br><br>Also, some members of the low-income group can be downright prickly, believing they have a right to receive handouts from the state.<br><br>But surely everybody deserves good customer service regardless of income group? The poor have their pride too.<br><br>Could CDCs perhaps train their staff to understand the sensitivities and psyche of the lower-income group? Steps could also be taken to ensure that staff on duty speak different languages and dialects. Members from the low-income group could even be employed to help.<br><br>ItÂ’s good news indeed to hear that the Government has raised public assistance spending from $96 million to $140 million, and ComCare funding from $43 million to $67 million. With that much money allocated to the needy, it makes sense to ensure these funds reach the ones who need immediate assistance.<br><br>Take Mr Ramasamy Ratran, a 52-year-old Indian man, who was a pitiful sight when my students and I chanced upon him. He was lying on the dusty floor in his rented two-room flat, having been discharged from hospital just two weeks earlier.<br><br>Fortunately, a former female neighbour and a male friend had taken it upon themselves to look after Mr Ramasamy, who is epileptic and living on his own. Medical social workers had settled his hospital bills, but he was getting no financial help while he was recuperating and unable to work.<br><br>Â‘Can you please help him? He needs help. When I first came two weeks ago, there was no electricity. His flat was in total darkness,Â’ pleaded the former neighbour, who had helped to top up his prepaid utilities smart key to get the electricity back on.<br><br>Mr Ramasamy was not the only one my students and I found in need of assistance. When barber Yahya Pinghani, 39, was hospitalised for a kidney problem, he could not work and had no daily income for weeks. His children skipped school that week because there was no money for the bus fare.<br><br>Mr PinghaniÂ’s wife Murni, 41, complained how, after three weeks, her single friend who had applied for help with her at a CDC had already received assistance while she and her family were still waiting. She revealed that her family owed a whopping $4,000 in utilities bills.<br><br>CDCs do give $200 once-off emergency assistance, after which the needy wait six to eight weeks for CDCs to respond. So what do they do when help is a long time coming? Many see their MPs, getting a $50 cheque for their trouble, or resort to collecting food from voluntary welfare organisations. How many know that they can get immediate assistance from your Citizens Consultative Committee? I did not either, for that matter, till I asked around.<br><br>Perhaps it is time that bulletin boards in HDB flats were put to better use. They could advertise where the poor can get help and give details of the schemes. Many low-income earners are illiterate, but the ones who are not will surely help to spread the word around.<br><br>It could also be made mandatory for medical social workers in hospitals to inform social workers or CDCs when a person who is from the low-income group is discharged so they will give him temporary financial assistance during his recovery period.<br><br>Last year, the Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports (MCYS) set up a community care network for the elderly in Ang Mo Kio. Under this scheme, grassroots leaders are trained by family service centres to identify needy households.<br><br>Perhaps if this outreach scheme is formally extended to include all needy Singaporeans, not just the elderly, it could be used to ensure no one falls through the cracks and to explain the help schemes available to the needy.<br><br>MCYS minister Vivian Balakrishnan recently called on Singaporeans to be eyes and ears on the ground, saying Â‘we need the whole of societyÂ’ and not Â‘an army of bureaucratic civil servantsÂ’, when he outlined $140 million worth of initiatives for the low-income group.<br><br>The findings of the 18 Ngee Ann polytechnic students who ventured out of their classroom may not be conclusive, but simple observations like theirs should not be belittled.

If we have free and fair election then your mention of 66.6% will have some meaning in it.<br><br>That will be another topic where citizens will be able to decide whether GRC is depriving them of voting or free elections. Of course they can do as they like for now as long as they have the police and the court in their pocket.<br><br>Many of the 66.6% default voters may not even be bothered about building a Singapore nation for all. They may only be caring for themselves so do not read too much into their votes or default votes due to GRC abuse.<br><br>For now we are merely discussing by common sense whether the government by over-charging citizens everything until many cannot survive is really doing citizens kindness by now trying to give them a few crumbs to keep them off suicides.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Really ah? Then how come more and more people are asking for financial help?<br><br>The Sunday Times<br>2nd Dec 2007<br><br>We can barely stay afloat, say low-income folk<br><br>ADMINISTRATIVE assistant Noor Zeen earns $1,350 a month and has not paid her utility bills for the past four months.<br><br>Prices of everyday goods have gone up and she finds that she no longer earns enough to cover household expenses.<br><br>The 28-year-old divorcee said her monthly utility bill alone has gone up by at least $20. The breadwinner in her family, she lives in a four-room flat in Hougang with her mother, her eight-year-old son and her late aunt's two children.<br><br>Cash-strapped and with unpaid utility bills of about $600, Madam Noor asked her MP, Madam Cynthia Phua (Aljunied GRC), for financial help last week.<br><br>After the soft-spoken woman poured out her financial woes, Madam Phua put her on short-term financial assistance that will provide her with $200 for the next three months.<br><br>The economy may be buoyant, but low-wage earners such as Madam Noor have been telling MPs and social workers that they can barely stay afloat because the cost of living has been going up.<br><br>These workers say that their wages are not rising as fast as inflation.<br><br>In October, inflation rose to a 16-year high of 3.6 per cent. Two months ago, prices of food staples such as bread and noodles went up by 20 per cent. Soaring oil prices have also driven up pump prices and electricity tariffs.<br><br>Median monthly starting pay for cleaners and labourers has in fact fallen by nearly one-third, from $860 to $600, between 1996 and last year.<br><br>Twelve MPs and social workers interviewed said pleas for financial help from residents are growing louder but most could not give figures.<br><br>In Jalan Besar GRC, MP Lily Neo said she sees about 60 hard-luck cases a week at her Meet-the-People sessions. In the past, she saw about 40 cases.<br><br>She said: 'Each week, I find myself busier and busier, staying longer and longer, because there are so many people asking for financial help.''<br><br>Madam Halimah Yacob, an MP for Jurong GRC, said some of the low-income residents are holding two jobs and doing overtime, yet they still ask for rations of basic items such as cooking oil and Milo because they do not earn enough to feed their families.<br><br>Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Hong Kah GRC) observed that those on financial aid schemes are showing up more often at Meet-the-People Sessions.<br><br>'They used to come once every three months. Now, some come back every couple of weeks to ask for food and utility vouchers,' he said, because their cash is running out faster.<br><br>Mr Charles Chong (Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC) said he was even told off by a retiree who had asked for financial aid.<br><br>The elderly man told the MP: 'I'm retired, in my 60s, have no job and living off my savings. But GST is up, food prices are up, inflation is up. The only thing that has not gone up is the banks' interest rates!'<br><br>Mr Sim Boon Choon, 68, is in the same boat as the retiree. He tries to stretch every cent of the $290 in public assistance that he receives every month.<br><br>A loaf of bread now costs 20 cents more and the price of a packet of 20 Milo sachets is up by 40 cents. Even chicken rice and kway teow soup at the hawker centre cost 50 cents more.<br><br>To save money, he has stopped eating out for all his meals. Dinner is a simple meal of bread and Milo. To save electricity, the bachelor does not switch on the lights in his one-room Telok Blangah flat.<br><br>Even then, he finds himself running out of money before the month is up. 'I'm already very thrifty but the money is still not enough,' he said in Hokkien. Shocked<br><br>In March, public welfare recipients such as Mr Sim had their monthly allowance raised from $260 to $290 to offset the impact of the GST hike and rising cost of living.<br><br>But social workers said the $30 increment is not enough, given that inflation has risen so high.<br><br>Ms Grace Lee, centre director of Care Corner Family Service Centre (Toa Payoh), said the centre has been receiving more requests for the monthly free food packages of rice, instant noodles and canned food.<br><br>At least 100 packages are handed out, compared to 80 a few months back.<br><br>Over at the Care Corner Seniors Activity Centre in Toa Payoh, programme executive Lim Siew Eng said the elderly poor who show up for free daily lunches are asking for larger portions to take home for dinner. A typical lunch consists of rice, mixed vegetables and meat.<br><br>MP Cynthia Phua said she has been advising the elderly in her ward to rent out the rooms in their flats to generate income.<br><br>She said: 'A can of luncheon meat used to cost $1.30. Now it's $2.50. Not everyone can afford that, especially the elderly who are not working and depending on handouts.'<br><br>MPs said that they try not to give cash to residents seeking aid because they cannot ensure that the money is spent on food. They prefer to give food vouchers.<br><br>While utility, service and conservancy rebates, and Workfare payouts have helped, the MPs hope that the Government would come up with schemes which help those without income cope with the rising cost of living.<br><br>Pasir Ris-Punggol's Mr Chong said: 'The current schemes that we have, such as Workfare, help those who work. But for the elderly who are retired and sickly, we need to find new schemes for them.'<br><br>The Government has said that it will not keep prices artificially low by controlling price increases to help people cope with the rising cost of living. Its aim is to get the basics right - housing, jobs and affordable necessities.<br><br>It also tops up the wages of low-income workers through Workfare and gives various cash handouts and rebates. A total of 2.4 million Singaporeans are eligible for $650 million in GST credits and senior citizens' bonuses this year.<br><br>It is not just the low income who are feeling the pinch. Mayor for Central Singapore district, Mr Zainudin Nordin, said families living in four- and five-room flats are trying to downgrade to smaller flats because they cannot afford the cash portion of their mortgage.<br><br>He said: 'These families find that they need that few hundred dollars for other necessities now that prices have gone up. They can't afford to put aside any cash for housing.'<br><br>For housewife Norliza Maidin, 40, the rising cost of living could not have come at a worse time.<br><br>Her husband was retrenched from his warehouse supervisor job last year and now earns $1,500 - $500 less than his previous pay.<br><br>The couple have two sons -- aged five and one - and Madam Norliza's elderly mother lives with them in a four-room flat in Jurong.<br><br>Madam Norliza limits the family's electricity usage to $3 a day, chooses the cheapest fish and buys the cheapest groceries.<br><br>But she still finds herself with no savings at the end of the month. Sometimes, she has to borrow money from friends.<br><br>After being out of the workforce for five years, she is back in the job market because she wants to supplement her husband's income.<br><br>'I want to save for a rainy day. And buy better food for my children, such as salmon and not just selar,' she said.<br><br>With inflation expected to go up to 4.5 per cent next year, MPs such as Madam Phua think that the number of financial aid requests they are receiving is only the tip of the iceberg.<br><br>She said: 'I believe more will ask for financial help. This is just the beginning.'</div>
