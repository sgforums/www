How really private are our so-called private universities, private hospitals, transportation companies, SIA ,etc?  Is anything here really not under the tight control of the PAP and their cronies?  The government is intolerant of criticism and their attitude to opposition parties borders on paranoia (maybe all the bleedy elite minister need to rotate Â‘vacationÂ’ in IMH!).<br><br>The government is busy courting foreign talent.  Taking the example of establishing Singapore as a Â‘life scienceÂ’ hub, they are even willing to pay above market rates to attract them.  Our Universities have been asked to increase the number of foreign students intake.  Singaporeans have wrote in (even in this forum) that after taking diploma/degree courses in life sciences, the jobs go to foreigners.  So who benefits?  The foreign talents use Singapore as a stepping stone to the west.  Many of our local talents feeling discriminated and unappreciated, migrated.<br><br>If memory serves you mentioned in another post that the gahmentÂ’s ridiculously high payrise has nothing to do with importing foreign talents.  In a sense, yes, but put it against the backdrop of the middle and lower income families seeing their income dwindling and the cost of living increase, and see if you can understand the resentment against the PAP for taking care of themselves first (yet talk constantly of doing great sacrifice for us all!) and against these over-paid foreigners who will be here only temporary.  The gahment is like more interested to take care of foreign talentsÂ’ interest than in the interest of Singaporeans.  I think they like to be first in the world so this is a world record Â– must be only government who cares more for foreigners than their own citizens!<br><br>And if the PAP is doing such a fine job, why then did Uncle Lee make that gaga statement of rejoining Malaysia?  I wondered then if he was going senile or whether he felt Singapore was drowning and needed a lifeline!  And which idiotic minister said our elderly can move to Malaysia?  So getting rid of Singaporeans to make way for foreigners?  In other words to read in-between the lines, young Singaporeans had better migrate and establish themselves overseas now while they are young and able.  DonÂ’t wait till you are old because the government doesnÂ’t give a s.h.i.t. about you!<br></div>
