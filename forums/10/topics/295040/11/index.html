But that is not the case. Want to know why?<br><br>Because Singaporeans are arrogant. Just count the number of times you've heard of a graduate entering the market, refusing to accept jobs below his income expectation.<br><br>As for work quality, you guys who work can attest to the much better work ethic the average FT has over the Singaporean. In a free economy, who's going to pick the Singaporean?<br><br>Don't blame the inflow of FT for 'stealing' your jobs. It's just not true. The jobs were never yours in the first place for them to steal. If you prove yourself incapable of competing in a free economy, you are the weakest link.<br></div></blockquote>Singaporeans and foreign talents (FT) do not have the same equal footing. Singaporeans have family ties here, they intend to live here for the longer term and make financial committments like buying a house.<br><br>How does a Singaporean compete with FTs? They can squeeze 10 person to an apartment to save money. Are the average Singaporean family able to do that? Can you sqeeze your parents and your sister and yourself into a room and lease out the other 2 rooms of your HDB? These FTs have lower expectations on everything in life, from hygiene, to quality of food and comforts.<br><br>These FTs have families back home, SGD 100 they remit back to China become RMB 500. A frugal family in China can probably survive on that for a month, give the same amount of SGD 100 to your dad or mom, see how long it last in Singapore. Singaporean's fixed cost is high because our roots and families are here.<br><br>The FTs does not need to pay CPF, which effectively wipes off 20% of a Singaporean's cashflow.<br><br>A Singaporean graduate after completing University education has debt obligations to meet, family to support and a certain level of living standard to maintain.<br><br>A Chinese FT University education in China is much cheaper compared to Singapore, therefore they have no debt, or less debt to repay.<br><br>Are you sure the Chinese has better work ethics, or are they just willing to accept a higher level of risk?<br><br>Take for instance the numerous cases of tainted food and hazardous products. Doesn't it show that they are willing to take in more risk and compromise on quality, health and safety.<br><br>If you buy a bowl of noodles in a canteen from China and a bowl of noodles in a canteen in Singapore. You will notice the vast differences in the standard of hygiene.<br><br>Labour is not 100% mobile even in a free economy, as labourers have emotional attachments to their country and people around him. It is not easy for everybody to move to a certain country and adapt. The reason why our economy is so open to FTs is caused by our government's policy of increasing the FT population. They no doubt have their reason, which I think is mainly economic and political in nature. Economically, they know that price is always sticky downwards, therefore their intention of importing more foreign talents is to push down price levels. But it seems like their plan to decrease price levels have failed, because we have seen then astronomical increases in ministerial salaries. If price levels have indeed gone down due to competition between foreign talents and Singaporeans, there would be no need to increase Ministerial salaries.

Like your tragedy of the commons (dissipation of rents), with so many foreigners competing for resources with the locals, it will lead to inflation and substandard of living for locally bred Singaporeans.

They kinda got overtaken, overrun and overthrown. In that order.<br><br>Foresight is just as important as hindsight.</div></blockquote>If our government has foresight, then alot of economic wrongs would not have happened.<br><br>During the early years, our government's reliance on foreign direct investments (FDI), instead of building up our own industries. Our MM (then PM) decided to take the blue pill (easy pill) to heal all our woes, which resulted in severe economic hardship when these FDIs decided to pull out of Singapore to China. On the other hand, Hong Kong promoted more free spirited entrepreneurism which resulted in lots of home grown industries.<br><br>Till today, our government is still competing on the wrong level. Instead of looking into innovations, they want to compete on price, which is losing strategy because Singapore cannot compete with China in terms of price. Only way is R&amp;D and product innovation, but our system of authoritarianism does not promote free spirited entrepreneurism, because nobody is willing to take risk to explore alternatives.<br><br>Take for example, bungee jumping. Would such a thrill ever be discovered by a Singaporean in Singapore? Never!!! Why??? It's because before you take on the free spirited exploration, you will be contemplating about the different laws you would be breaking and be put in jail for many years. Thus innovation will never happen in Singapore unless regime change happens. So for the better part of the next 10-20 years, we will be competing with the world economy in terms of price rather than quality and innovation.<br><br>Free spirited entrepreneurism needs freedom and democracy to grow, Singapore just doesn't have the two.<br><br></div>
