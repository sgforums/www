            <div class='col-md body'>the only countries that allow their people to go hungry are war torn countries like iraq, sudan, ehtopia, etc.<br><br>if singapore is touting to be a world class country, then the end goal to achieve is to give a fruitful environment that decent family men and women are live and bring up their children.<br><br>however, the main goal is very different and extremely materialistic. U cut tax on the high income bracket but u raise the cost of the fundamentals. this model will only benefit the rich and tax the poor even more.<br><br>my circle of friends are mainly family men in their 40s and they are facing an uphill task to provide for their family. mental anguish over their children studies, their job securities, cost of living are constantly on their mind. This is psychologically draining and i can see the burnt out spirit in their eyes. Most had resigned to their faith, same goes to their children.<br><br>u cant break free from the chains of mental pressure. shall we say that these "weaklings" deserve their just rewards, or damn that they should be like that given their less than glorious economic background?<br><br>what is humanity when the care for others are gone?</div>

It's about increasing opportunity cost.<br><br>Let's say I have a million dollars to give away. If I announce that I'm giving 2000 to the first 500 ppl to come to my house, EVERYONE would come, needy or not. That's because the opportunity cost is greatly shadowed by the potential rewards.<br><br>If I changed the rules a little, and now announce I'm just giving out 100 dollars to the first 10000 ppl to come, I'll get a more selective bunch of ppl. The people who don't really need 100 dollars will think twice before coming.<br><br>Playing down the pattern, we'll see that the most effecient way of making sure only the needy get money is to give out maybe 10 dollars each. You REALLY have to be desperate to travel all the way down to get 10 dollars.<br><br>But that's not effective right? We don't want to give out 10 dollars to ppl who need 100. But how do we give out 100 without having tons of freeloaders who don't need it?<br><br>Enter the mountains of forms designed to increase opportunity cost without reducing rewards. Take me for instance. Tell me I get 100 dollars just for travelling to town, and I'll go this instant. Tell me I have to fill up a form, and I'll still go. Tell me it's 5 forms, and I'll probably hesitate before going. If it's going to be 5 forms now, 3 forms next week and another 5 in a month before a 3 month wait for the cash, I'm staying at home. The point is, people who REALLY need the money would still go.<br><br>And that's the whole point.</div></blockquote>Let's say it a person need <strong>exactly</strong> $50 to survive a week. So if there are 3 men, a rich, a average and a poor travel to town to get the weekly $50 handout, what is the cost to each of them? And how much to travel from town back home? Finally, what the amount of money left the rich, average and poor will be getting? Is it still the full amount intended? (Unless you assume that rich will only take taxi, average take bus, and poor <strong>WALK</strong>).<br><br>And of cause, according to the ministers, POOR can't eat in food court, they should to eat something cheaper, maybe rice and soya source or salted fish? No, no, of course they will not go hungry, only malnutrition, but that's all right because they are POOR, isn't it?<br><br>If a poor bread winner of a family who has no saving in bank is suddenly retrenched, somehow, he and his family can survive without food, electricity, clean water, transport (of course, they can always walk even if hungry) while the authority take their time to test the family determination before deciding if they are REALLY POOR.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

You've suggested that a mountain of forms are needed to validate the poor from the free-loaders.<br><br>Has it occured to you that the terms '<span style="color: red;"><span style="font-style: italic;">poor'</span></span> and '<span style="color: red;"><span style="font-style: italic;">uneducated</span></span>' come in unison? The mountain of forms are more likely to put off the poor rather than the educated free-loaders.<br><br>And i still don't see how tasting a food sample supports your argument. I may or may not have an intention to purchase the food, but i won't know until i actually try it yes?<br><br>I'm still waiting to see a roadmap from our overpaid government as to how they plan to improve inflation and conditions for the poor. All we've heard is the usual rhetoric from the ruling party, but no <span style="text-decoration: underline;">REAL</span> plan to convince the majority that they have it in the works. Cost of living is rising astromically, and it appears the govt are contend to let it max out and burst on it own.<br><br>At least Khaw Boon Wan was brave enough to put forward an unpopular policy of means testing to free up hospital beds from being 'free-loaded' by those who can well afford higher classes. We'll see how that works out in the next few years.<br><br>For the rest, maybe we should wait till the ministers lose touch with the people the same way Samy Vellu has lost the respect of his peers. Moving ahead, our million-dollar leaders should realise that meet the people's sessions are hardly sufficient to solve today's problems.<br><br>Will they learn from our neighbour's mistakes?</div>

But i'll try to answer the questions anyway.<br><br>1) Are you asking me about transport cost? Because the point i was trying to raise was utility. The poor gain more utility from a smaller pot. This is the mechanism that allows them to gain more value as the process of getting the pot gets more complicated.<br><br>2) I'm not very up to date with the news, i'm afraid. Can you quote me the minister who said that? It's a characteristic of the poor to be unable to afford better food. If they could afford better, they wouldn't need you to champion here for them.<br><br>3) Like I said. Blame the fact that we humans are disgusting when it comes to distribution of free resources.

I'm actually of the opinion that they deserved a much bigger hike a long time ago. Taxi prices have been kept unnaturally low. It's the reason you can't get cabs most of the time. The invisible hand isn't working.<br><br>minister pay increase has nothing to do with the poor. Don't pull non-issues into the argument just because it has something to do with the government. As for GST increase, it's a direct contribution to the problem of course, but as i said before, in every capitalist society, someone has to be lower class. And progress is always going to sting for the lower class. It's an inherent problem no one can solve. As such, GST is a source of the problem, but cannot exactly be blamed or solved.</div>
