These plans are still being formulated but I am confident I can give that assurance."<br><br>Every year, CCCs have an annual fund of S$42,000 to tap on to help the less fortunate residents.<br><br>Singapore has 84 CCCs, but Dr Balakrishnan said, in fact, many don't end up spending that money.<br><br>He said: "So it's not for lack of money, but we'll make sure that if the needs go up, more funds (will be) available. So what I'm signalling is that we can and we will do more if needs increase. But I also want to share with you that I've also been tracking the number of appeals for help both in terms of those who apply to the Community Development Councils (CDCs), as well as those who applied to the CCCs.<br><br>"And actually if we compare the third quarter of this year's figures with the third quarter of last year, actually, overall, the numbers have come down. The reason for that is clearly because the economy is doing well and more and more people are able to get jobs or to get wage increases.<br><br>"But I'm also aware that even if the general economy improves, there may still be a segment who risk being left behind. So my focus is to make sure that this small segment has adequate attention and adequate resources available."<br><br>To better reach out to needy Singaporeans, a new hotline named ComCare Call will also be launched next month.<br><br>This toll-free number 1800-222-0000 will be directed to the various help organisations like the CDCs.<br><br>What the organisations will do then is to identify the kind of assistance a family requires and then customise it to meet their specific needs.<br><br>Dr Balakrishnan added that now is the best time to beef up Singapore's multi-layered social safety nets because of the good employment rate and growing economy.<br><br>Singaporeans can then enjoy the fruits of labour later once the government ensures the safety nets can withstand the stresses of increased inflation and future challenges.<br><br>Dr Balakrishnan said more details for the additional funding for the CCCs will be announced in the Budget speech next year. - CNA/ch<br><br></div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Apply the same Goddamn logic u used when u justified your cushy salary increase cos there's never a good time to help the poor! But u should do so ANYWAY!</blockquote>Do you see how much of yourself you revealed via this innocent sentence? To a truly selfless person, every minute is a good time to help the poor. Why is there ever a bad time to help the poor? Your reasoning here is unsound.<br><br>But the truth is, you can't always help the poor. Again I raise the subject of tragedy of the commons, because it is so universal in our nature. Help the poor too much, and they grow to depend on it. Refuse help, and the story may have an ugly ending.<br><br>But for the sake of your understanding, let's have an exercise. You seem to consider yourself a decent human being, so let's assume you're incorruptable. Because I trust you so much, let's give you 50 million to spend or distribute as you please amongst the needy for the year 2008. How would you go about doing it?<br><br>You seem to care alot for the homeless. Let's find them some shelter first, right? 50 Million can build quite a few homes. Let's get started. But wait, there's a housing shortage. Nevermind, we'll just build more, right? Argh, these damn flats sure take a long time to build.<br><br>In the meantime, let's see if we can rent out existing old flats to help solve the immediate problem. Oh, the poor can't afford the high rents? Let's make rental lower! We have 50 million to distribute, after all. Subsidies all around!<br><br>But see, now we have a problem. we're now renting out flats at ultra low prices. VERY attractive prices. Now the middle class wants in on some of that action. Those flats aren't bad, and they can cut their rents by half just by pretending to be poor! Oh no! Now we're short on housing again!<br><br>Ahhh, but we're smart, yes we are. We'll make them PROVE they are poor. Enter paperwork, stage right. But those pesky freeloaders aren't dumb either. Begin the arms war. Fast forward a few months, and now we have tons of paperwork to fill up just to buy a candy for 10 cents off.<br><br>OK the housing thingy was a bust. Let's try another idea we've been pushing around. Let's just give them the damn money and let them rent their own damn houses. Oh look what's this? More freeloaders. Just as I was getting used to a paperless afternoon. Sigh. Back to drafting up more paperwork.<br><br>It's pretty nice to find a high horse to sit on while shouting to the heavens : "FEED THE HUNGRY! LIBERATE THE POOR!"  In reality, it's a slow, agonising process to help the lower class. Some of them are there because of inherent behaviors that put them there in the first place, such as gambling or just plain laziness. So when you finally get the greedy middleclass people out of the equation, how are you going to seperate the deserving poor from the undeserving poor?<br><br>Think about it.<br>How long would you give yourself?<br><br></div>
