Let's just give them the damn money and let them rent their own damn houses. Oh look what's this? More freeloaders. Just as I was getting used to a paperless afternoon. Sigh. Back to drafting up more paperwork.</blockquote>The flat example u raised is perfectly valid. Yes, there are probably pple cheating on HDB rental flats that were meant for low income individuals. There are loopholes that can be exploited.<br><br>But does it change the fact that the vast majority of the occupants of such housing are indeed, economically disadvantaged individuals?<br><br>Is there a greater good that can be balanced against the lesser evil here? So what if a few bad hats make a pig's ear of the system? Isn't it more important that the majority that truly needs help gets it, rather than to put them through a circus act to fill out a dozen forms and make them wait while u verify that they are indeed, "deserving" of assistance?<br><br>I do see your point. But I find it disturbing to have the mindset that all applicants are undeserving of assistance unless they prove that they are not cheating when we really don't know the actual percentage of applicants who are cheating.<br><br>Is it not more meaningful to give first, then have a good system to follow up and check for frauds? Save resources on the application. Divert them to the checks.<br><br>That way, we have a more proactive approach to helping the economically disadvantaged, we cut some red tape and save some paper (and trees) along the way, and the checks can be substantive and properly legislated, with penalties for fraud that can include reimbursement of all money paid and public shaming of such parties.<br><br><blockquote>It's pretty nice to find a high horse to sit on while shouting to the heavens : "FEED THE HUNGRY! LIBERATE THE POOR!" In reality, it's a slow, agonising process to help the lower class. Some of them are there because of inherent behaviors that put them there in the first place, such as gambling or just plain laziness.
