It's part of the system. Just like to build big cities, you need big ugly sewers.<br><br>The problem here is, in the last few decades of relative isolation, the government has managed to make the lower class too secure. Secure to the point people have forgotten we have a bottom class. And now that they are suddenly visible again, everyone blames the government.<br><br>Smell the wind people. This is the real world. This is how it actually works in the rest of the world. The fact that the government has made considerable strides in eliminating the problem altogether for so long is testament to it's success.<br><br>To get to the top, we have to step on each other.

The invisible hand isn't working.<br><br>minister pay increase has nothing to do with the poor. Don't pull non-issues into the argument just because it has something to do with the government. As for GST increase, it's a direct contribution to the problem of course, but as i said before, in every capitalist society, someone has to be lower class. And progress is always going to sting for the lower class. It's an inherent problem no one can solve.

The govt sector, responding to the 'call', decided to pay themselves more. Likewise the private sector had to compete, lest they lose their most valued employees. Likewise the supplier of noodles, the canned pork distributor and flour producer.<br><br>All decided it was also in their best interest to raise prices to stay 'competitive'.<br><br>Whether you like it or not, every minute event plays its role in the current situation; your attempt to discount and disassociate the issues mirror those of the govt. Denying mistakes does not solve problems; it merely serves to thicken one's pride beyond reason.<br><br>Actions such as sizable tax rebates for various income groups, transport rebates and govt subsidies on specific food supplements (imported and locally manufactured) could help act as a short term buffer while they figure out a long term solution.<br><br>Yet the govt has not acted on any course of action, other than to speculate and ask citizens to weather the storm and rein in their expenditure.<br><br>"Frugal times ahead for Singaporeans' screams today's headlines.<br><br>Gee, I don't need a million dollar minister to give me that kind of advice.</div>
