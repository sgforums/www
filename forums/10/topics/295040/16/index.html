How do you find out he or she is representing them?   If you are not happy that this person voice out concern and show compassion, tell us the reasons why this person should not?<br><br>If you show no compassion, don't stop people from showing compassion and concern.   You sound very cold blooded like the PAP.   You seem all the way out to discourage people to be kind.<br><br>Anyone who has no stupid brain will know that nobody will go hungry in Singapore.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by mancha:</div><div class="quote_body">"No Singaporean will go hungry" is nothing but a political punchline.<br><br>There will always be those who become destitutes. No matter which country. And these destitutes should not be seized upon to critize the government. They are not proof that the government is incompetent.<br><br>To live, anywhere in this world, some self discipline is required. Once this self discipline is lacking, it will be downhill for that individual. No matter what economic or political system a country is run on, the individual must exercise some responsibility for his own well being. This is a brutal truth.<br><br>Therefore the old lady collecting cardboards, or cans, is not the fault of the government, if she chooses to continue doing what she can do rather than reach out for a handout.<br>And that man, with brackish and tattered clothes, and long unkempt mattered hair, with a bag of his possessions, has lost his will to live. Could be a love lost, or personal tragedy. Still that is his choice.<br><br>But for those willing to receive help, there is help. And more help. That is what Dr. Balakrishna is saying.<br>But the availability for this help, many a times escape those in the "sandwich" class. There are people there who are also genuinely in need. But help is not for them. Because  they own their fully paid up four-room flat.<br>But then again this has to be pitted against the guy who drives a Mercedes, and want the government to pay his utilities bill for him, because he can't afford to. He, his wife and children can't sleep without aircon.<br><br>Therefore there should be a more equitable means test, for government assistance, rather than the "you must be really down and out" to qualify for a paltry assistance.</div></blockquote>Agree. There are lots of views expressed in this post, but I happen to be able to come across the above which neither supports nor blames, either the govt or citizens entirely.<br><br>I fully agree that that an individual must bear some responsibility for his/her own well-being. Or else, everyone would be arguing endlessly on different interpretations of who is really needy and how to help the needy.<br><br>That said, I agree fully with the last paragraph on a more equitable means test for government assistance.<br></div>
