There are good reasons why FTs are allowed here, Singapore lacks certain expertise and we need them to contribute, to impart what they have to offer.  But you may not be aware that there are jobs that Singaporeans are capable of doing but FTs or FWs are doing the jobs.   Just got to know a company in Singapore hires a foreigner from India or Bangladesh to work as domestic helper/cleaner in the office.    A local firm hires China Chinese to work as engineers, account assistant and clerk.<br><br></div>
