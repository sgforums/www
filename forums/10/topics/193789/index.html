            <div class='col-md body'>When the Feedback Unit first got started, it was full of rules and regulations as if the forumers are ignorant how to post and keep to relevance of the topic.<br><br>So many forumers' posts were deleted because they were afraid of abuses by the forumers.<br><br>I strongly disagreed with such an immature stand of the Feedback Unit and stopped posting. Many fellow forumers felt the same way with Feedback Unit complaining to the Straits Times and Newpaper that some forumers were rude or a certain police report was lodged against a certain forumer.<br><br>So at the end there was no posting to Feedback Unit and what happened today? Feedback Unit no longer deleted posts except may be for very exceptional situation where a post is totally out of the line.<br><br>Channel News Asia has unfortunately adopted the same old policy of the Feedback Unit. Soon, it may lose people's support. Without people, no organization or leader will be able to claim credit of leadership or trying to be arrogant that they are righteous.<br><br>Today hopefully the YPAP website will realise that if it wants to communicate with all Singaporeans, it should not be so paranoid about people. There will be people who are out of line or for some reason difficult to please and air frustration. YPAP should not just because of some smaller percentage of such individuals use the sledge hammer of deleting posts to control the minority.<br><br>Governing a country and encouraging people to come forward to serve is a much bigger objective than the need to control a few miscreants if there indeed are such indviduals.<br><br>Be more open and inclusive and everything will change as people become more inclusive. Have some confidence in your leadership abilities and do not keep harking back to control freaks for inspirations for the control freaks can achieve only limited succcess not totally involvement in building a greater country.</div>

If citizens who are now left with only one medium of communication (press and media totally under the control of government) are also prevented from freedoms in discussing problems and issues, there will be real danger of boil over of dissatisfaction and problems from the masses.<br><br>I don't see your logic that forumers or cyberspace need some more control. If controls are required there are the general laws anyway to stop anyone from defamation.<br><br>They are not kids to be forever told to obey the autocracy just to make their jobs easier, give them more powers to sue and increase their own salaries and make citizens' lives more difficult.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes I agreed that there is a danger in any multi-racial society with people uttering racist remarks in public and newspapers.<br><br>But hasn't our government passed enough laws to deal with such dangers. Havn't we already licensed press and prevented it from publishing any such racist remarks, and in the process controlling citizens' freedom to criticise government for wrongs without discrimination.<br><br>Haven't we tinkered with the one-man-one-vote election system to one-man-one-GRC system in the name of preserving racial harmony but in the process depriving citizens of their right to choose the best candidates they want being prevented to do so with walkovers created by many GRCs.<br><br>Haven't we heard all the strident scare tactics about the danger of defamation ending up with ruling party using defamation laws liberally to stop political oppositions from criticising the ruling party for NKF mistakes and lack of accountability in governing the country. Where is the line drawn between defamation and remarks holding the government accountable for NKF mistakes. Is not the ruling party getting unnecessarily sensitive about racist remarks and defamation so as increase their power to govern as they like and to interpret meanings and innuendos of racist and defamatory remarks as they like?<br><br>If we still cannot see the current practice of politicians using the presumptuous danger of racism and breakdown of law and order as scare tactics just to allow them to pass more draconian laws to deal with criticism of wrong doings and to serve one-party rule agenda, then we have no one to blame but our own naivety as citizens.<br><br>May I ask : have we lately come across increased cases of defamation and racism that we must keep hyping on the over-sold law and order scare tactic again and again. Can we not grow up and talk about other bigger problem facing our society and not be tied to the old bags of tricks in justifying high-handed government and support the wrongs in governance.<br><br>Will any citizens with common sense not seen that the government has been passing laws to suit themselves and their narrow agenda and this tendency is now the greatest danger facing Singapore society which needs to be addressed.<br><br>If government now want to tell citizens about the need for law and order in the internet and the needs to prevent disorders or racism, do we citizens trust them again that indeed there are so much racists in the net and the politicians will not use new laws of the net to stop citizens from checking on their NKF mistakes which up to now they have refused to admit as their own.<br><br>What is forum and internet anyway ? Is it not now the only venue for expressing citizens unhappiness about wrong government policies what government is afraid it will happen and will now want to control?<br><br>Can it control internet when internet is world-wide and everywhere? Do you want to listen to such propaganda as a citizen and believe in anything ending in instability of society caused by clamp-downs of freedom for politicians' own ease of dealing with dissent.</div>

It only takes a small vocal minority to trigger a racial riot. Prior to the Rwanda genocide, newspapers and radio broadcasts were used to incite hatred against the Tutsis. The media is a powerful tool that can be abused by anarchists.<br><br>The immaturity and the lack of sensitivity demonstrated by those in the forums who make malicious and slanderous remarks against individuals and religions will provide the fuel for such a disaster.<br><br>Express your opposing views by all means within the law. But surely there must be redress for anyone who becomes the victim of malicious and baseless allegations?

All over the world, parliamentary democracy has defined government as (1) Executive (2) Legislature (3) Judiciary with each having its own role and responsibility for the larger purpose of government the whole country with equity, fairness, justice and equality of citizens before the law.<br><br>There is a common practice to separate the role of executive, legislature and judiciary in order to be fair, just as to law and fact not to allow any executive to govern all in one.<br><br>Owing to a loophole in our Constitution, in Singapore, our government has been given certain discretionary power to pass laws to restrict the rights of citizens as to what is moral, what is public order and what is interest of the public as posted in "Definition of True Democracy".<br><br>So our government has indirectly over time restricted citizens' constitutional rights including their rights to be heard as to law and facts in a trial with equity, fairness in our court.<br><br>Our government by abolishing the jury trials in serious cases is leaving every issue of laws and fact to the judge who in turn is appointed by or with the sanction of the executive who is in control of the prosecution.<br><br>The judge is supposed to have fair and is now given a free hand to decide on the laws and fact. But the judge also knows full well that his career path and remuneration is determined by and with recommendation of the executive.<br><br>So when a judge is hearing a political defamation suit who will he pay attention to in hearing of law and facts.<br><br>The reason for abolishing of jury system as we have heard from our politicians is that sometimes the jury might be swayed or tempted by good defence argument to free criminals based on emotive presentation by smart defence lawyers.<br><br>But is it not equally true that the judge may well listen to over-assertiveness of the prosecution directly or indirectly influenced by the executive thereby blurring our executive, judiciary to the greater detriment of government and justice.<br><br>By abolishing the jury system we are removing a critical element in the justice system - right of the accused to be heard as to his fact by a more neutral or independent jury best able to grant him justice - paving the way for the judge to listen to wishes of the ruling party given in pre-announced policies and other politically motivated pronouncements.<br><br>In our autocratic system, our leaders are already acting as judge and jury so what will be the greater dangers to society? Will the greater danger be lawlessness and disorders caused by politically defamatory or inflamatory speeches, when the executive has abolished jury trial of facts. In any cases of political defamation against the opposition politicians, in the absence of any fact-hearing panel, could we expect the trials to be fair, equitable as to laws and facts.<br><br>Who will have influence the facts - the judge who has to worry about his career after what has happened to past judges who got transferred after their giving of verdict the other way.<br><br>In Singapore with the last bastion of fair hearing of fact or defence - the judge is the only person who can be relied upon to be fair but how fair can he be when he has to worry what will happen to his career which is determined by the executive.</div>
