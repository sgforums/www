            <div class='col-md body'>At first glance, this Windows Inspection / Replacement ruling is like casting a wide net, which is unfair, but a convenient method for our government to address the issue of falling windows which is indeed deadly.<br><br>I mean, why can't they think a little deeper and give some considerations to those who $40 will put a strain on their daily existence, given the current economic climate?<br><br><strong>Many residents in Singapore say mandatory window inspections will be a cost burden </strong><br>By Joanne Leow, Channel NewsAsia<br><br>SINGAPORE: A day after the announcement that all high-rise flat owners will have to pay for windows to be inspected, many residents Channel NewsAsia spoke to were unhappy they'd be forced to pay for such checks. Even the GPC chairman for National Development says window inspections should not be made compulsory as it would be a cost burden.<br><br>Dr Teo Ho Pin thinks residents should be inculcated with a sense of responsibility instead.<br><br>Advertisement<br><br>Residents should make sure their windows are safe through regular visual inspections, he said.<br><br>As someone with a Doctorate in Building, he doesn't see the necessity for mandatory inspections.<br><br>"The impact of the safety to the general public is quite different from structural failure. A structural failure may endanger many lives as compared to a fallen flowerpot or a fallen casement of a window. I don't see that there is a need for residents to carry out statutory inspections of the windows.<br><br>"What we should do is inculcate a sense of responsibility in the residents that they should make sure their windows are safe through regular visual inspections and by making efforts to consult the experts if they think that their windows are not safe. That is a better approach instead of making compulsory to inspect their windows by appointed accredited inspectors. That would be a cost burden," said Dr Teo who's also the Mayor of North West CDC.<br><br>And some of his Commonwealth Drive residents agree.<br><br>Said 45-year-old Sum Kah Meng who's just paid for the upgrading of his flat: "HDB is simply passing the buck to the end users, the main responsibility should fall back to HDB. Inspections are wasting time, if after the inspections the window still drop who's at fault now? So it doesn't mean you spend $40, you will have peace of mind, I don't think so."<br><br>Another crucial point is how various factors like design, maintenance and the environment interact to cause windows to fall.<br><br>While a window's durability might depend on how you take care of it, some say that the old-fashioned casement windows which relied on hinges might have been safer than ones that rely on rivets.<br><br>This is because they weren't dependent on one or two points to support the entire window.)<br><br>Some experts believe that one of the factors leading to the increased incidence of fallen windows was the introduction of the friction stay window in the 1980s, especially with aluminiuim rivets.<br><br>But designs are continually improving, like these brand new friction stay windows in Commonwealth Drive.<br><br>They have an added brass piece here that acts as a safety device.<br><br>It prevents too much stress from being placed on just one rivet. - CNA<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This Window issue is really becoming rediculous! Now, contractors are so much in fear that they are taking up insurance to protect them from claims for danages and injury should a window fall after their inspection or installation.<br><br>I think once a window has been inspected, and that the parts used are approved and qualified by HDB, irrigardless of who installed it, I feel it it is HDB who should answer should anything happens thereafter. Because they approved the material used!<br><br>Also, if an owner decides to upgrade or change their window/s, they should ensure that proper window maintenance is upkept to prolong the the window's life, and ultimately it's durability and safety in use. I always note the condition of my window everytiime I open or close them. In the past, I have personally engaged a contractor to change my window which exhibited signs of wear and tear on the hinges, without anyone having to tell me so. I mean, this is pure common sense and initiative, if not some degree of considerateness for those who passes below, or parked their vehicle below my flat. I was worried that the window may fall off, and kill someone or damage someone's car.<br><br>It is common sense to take note of such things as windows with loose hinges are dangerous, that placing flower pots on wndow ledges and parapets is dangerous, or that throwing things down can be fatal. All these things are supposed to be in everyone's knowledge without reminder by authorities or incidents, when living in high rise flats.<br><br>This issue is becoming downright embarrassing!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I have 3 suggestions for future HDB flats:<br><br>1) Instead of making it mandatory for Window Inspection, I hope HDB could re-look/review the way HDB flats are design. One way to solve this issue might be to extend an area with concrete on level 1 of every HDB flats. Anything(not only Windows) that drop(accidentally or 'intentionally') from higher floors will not hit the ground floor where ppl walk past, thus no one will be hurt. I have seen some older HDB flats with such design. I still perceive that this issue can be solved thru' other alternatives (HDB flats design, HDB flats window design &amp; installation, material usage, etc). This is also a better solution in the long-term, and this will not increase the living expense of common SIngaporeans/HDB tenants.<br><br>2) How about have sliding windows for future HDB flats? The windows can be slide fully behind the wall of the room/house. This will allow a bigger space of window rather than windows that slide towards half of window space.<br><br>3) How about corner off an area on the ground floor of every HDB flats where windows will fall onto, so that no ppl will walk under it?<br><br>Anyone with better suggestions can also share. Maybe someone can email or discuss with HDB about this. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>February 26, 2004<br>Gates must envy HDB's solution<br><br>By Soh wen Lin The Straits Times<br><br>IT looks like the Housing Board (HDB) is facing a windows problem, and this one has nothing to do with Microsoft.<br><br>HDB's windows problem, however, also threatens what techies call "the blue screen of death" - that scenario when one's PC software interface rolls over and dies - but in HDB's case this threat is to whoever happens to be walking at the bottom of a block of flats with, it seems, suicidal windows hanging high above.<br><br>If I were Microsoft founder and richest man in the world Bill Gates, known the world over for my business genius, I'd still be extremely envious of the way HDB gets to manage its windows problem.<br><br>Because while the Mac and Linux software camps may rant constantly about Microsoft's death grip on the market, it just doesn't seem as all-consuming as the power HDB has over its customers.<br><br>After a gamut of viruses wreaked havoc across the global market of Microsoft Windows clients, the company had to take responsibility for the workmanship on its software -admitting that it could be improved to fend off sabotage attempts from vicious virus programmers.<br><br>It also provides clients with ongoing diagnostics and patches for free on the Internet.<br><br>Or else, it could, in the longer term, risk losing customers to its Mac and Linux rivals.<br><br>But in the case of the HDB windows, even if high-rise windows were installed by HDB during an upgrading programme between 1987 and 1998, which was co-paid for by the flat owner, the flat owner still has to come up with more cash to upgrade his window rivets if they are not up to industry standards, which HDB changed after it installed those windows.<br><br>And the responsibility of providing diagnostics, in this case inspections, will be borne largely by private contractors, and paid for largely by flat owners.<br><br>And if some weakness fails to get caught, and a physical "blue screen of death" incident occurs, the penalty of a fine or jail term sits squarely on the shoulders of HDB's customers.<br><br>Contractors are now worried sick that they will also be held liable for such incidents if they were involved in the inspection of that suicidal window.<br><br>The reasoning for introducing the new window laws was that a similar law worked well for crashing air-conditioning units.<br><br>But, as unhappy flat owners are saying in letters to the newspapers, air-conditioning units are always individual additions and so logically are the sole responsibility of the individual.<br><br>But when it comes to the windows that HDB installed, how come part of the buck still gets passed on to the individual? And even if such inspection and upgrading fees are waived or subsidised for needy flat owners, unhappy residents counter that such an offer still doesn't address the principle of the matter.<br><br>In Microsoft's case, one could simply tell such rabidly unhappy customers to vote with their wallets and switch to some other software system.<br><br>But in HDB's case, which caters to an overwhelming majority of Singapore's residents, where can unhappy customers possibly go?<br><br>Unfortunately, the "switching cost"Â� in this scenario could be more dire.<br><br>Fed-up residents who can't afford private property units may instead opt for the long-term rental market, which might dilute the residents' sense of rootedness in Singapore, or worse, another country, with their talents, children and CPF accounts.<br><br>It may seem petty, threatening to switch out just because of a window.<br><br>But for some it could be another frustrating episode after witnessing so many upgrading programme contractors go bust and disappear, leaving behind debris, rats, bugs and potentially dengue-inflicting mosquitoes.<br><br>Or waiting for a seemingly endless period of time for a new home in a block which unfortunately didn't prove popular enough to get built.<br><br>But it's not too late.<br><br>I think most people believe that since the construction industry's representation group as well as the law got roped in to put this new windows management system in place, HDB has the resources and influence to be more magnanimous in the matter.<br><br>The investment by HDB would be worth it, to avoid a fallout involving more than metal frames and glass.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by ShutterBug:</div><div class="quote_body">February 26, 2004<br>Gates must envy HDB's solution<br><br>By Soh wen Lin The Straits Times<br><br>IT looks like the Housing Board (HDB) is facing a windows problem, and this one has nothing to do with Microsoft.<br><br>HDB's windows problem, however, also threatens what techies call "the blue screen of death" - that scenario when one's PC software interface rolls over and dies - but in HDB's case this threat is to whoever happens to be walking at the bottom of a block of flats with, it seems, suicidal windows hanging high above.<br><br>If I were Microsoft founder and richest man in the world Bill Gates, known the world over for my business genius, I'd still be extremely envious of the way HDB gets to manage its windows problem.<br><br>Because while the Mac and Linux software camps may rant constantly about Microsoft's death grip on the market, it just doesn't seem as all-consuming as the power HDB has over its customers.<br><br>After a gamut of viruses wreaked havoc across the global market of Microsoft Windows clients, the company had to take responsibility for the workmanship on its software -admitting that it could be improved to fend off sabotage attempts from vicious virus programmers.<br><br>It also provides clients with ongoing diagnostics and patches for free on the Internet.<br><br>Or else, it could, in the longer term, risk losing customers to its Mac and Linux rivals.<br><br>But in the case of the HDB windows, even if high-rise windows were installed by HDB during an upgrading programme between 1987 and 1998, which was co-paid for by the flat owner, the flat owner still has to come up with more cash to upgrade his window rivets if they are not up to industry standards, which HDB changed after it installed those windows.<br><br>And the responsibility of providing diagnostics, in this case inspections, will be borne largely by private contractors, and paid for largely by flat owners.<br><br>And if some weakness fails to get caught, and a physical "blue screen of death" incident occurs, the penalty of a fine or jail term sits squarely on the shoulders of HDB's customers.<br><br>Contractors are now worried sick that they will also be held liable for such incidents if they were involved in the inspection of that suicidal window.<br><br>The reasoning for introducing the new window laws was that a similar law worked well for crashing air-conditioning units.<br><br>But, as unhappy flat owners are saying in letters to the newspapers, air-conditioning units are always individual additions and so logically are the sole responsibility of the individual.<br><br>But when it comes to the windows that HDB installed, how come part of the buck still gets passed on to the individual? And even if such inspection and upgrading fees are waived or subsidised for needy flat owners, unhappy residents counter that such an offer still doesn't address the principle of the matter.<br><br>In Microsoft's case, one could simply tell such rabidly unhappy customers to vote with their wallets and switch to some other software system.<br><br>But in HDB's case, which caters to an overwhelming majority of Singapore's residents, where can unhappy customers possibly go?<br><br>Unfortunately, the "switching cost"Â� in this scenario could be more dire.<br><br>Fed-up residents who can't afford private property units may instead opt for the long-term rental market, which might dilute the residents' sense of rootedness in Singapore, or worse, another country, with their talents, children and CPF accounts.<br><br>It may seem petty, threatening to switch out just because of a window.<br><br>But for some it could be another frustrating episode after witnessing so many upgrading programme contractors go bust and disappear, leaving behind debris, rats, bugs and potentially dengue-inflicting mosquitoes.<br><br>Or waiting for a seemingly endless period of time for a new home in a block which unfortunately didn't prove popular enough to get built.<br><br>But it's not too late.<br><br>I think most people believe that since the construction industry's representation group as well as the law got roped in to put this new windows management system in place, HDB has the resources and influence to be more magnanimous in the matter.<br><br>The investment by HDB would be worth it, to avoid a fallout involving more than metal frames and glass.<br></div></blockquote>Finally some decent articles by the straits times...i would hope with our emerging crop of journalists, we would be able to publish more critical statements to keep our gahmen on their toes.<br><br></div>
