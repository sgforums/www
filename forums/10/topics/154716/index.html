            <div class='col-md body'>Since this thread is still ard.. Ard me to post another article..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> This has everything to do with politics..<br><br>NDP chooses lesbian activist as new leader<br>Alison Brewer wins easily on the first ballot (Telegraph Journal)<br><br>New Brunswick New Democrats have chosen an openly gay social activist and founder of the province's Morgentaler abortion clinic as their new leader.<br><br>With a convincing first ballot victory at the NDP leadership convention, Allison Brewer, 51, made history Sunday, becoming New Brunswick's first openly gay party leader.<br><br>While Ms. Brewer acknowledged her win is "an historic day for the lesbian and gay community", she said she's not a single-issue candidate and vowed to lead her party to a majority government.<br><br>"I will make my presence felt and I want Bernard Lord and Shawn Graham to know that I am on my way," she said after her win in front of 81 party members at the Fredericton Inn.<br><br>Ms. Brewer took 62 per cent of the votes on the first ballot to defeat fellow candidates Pam Coates, a Saint John poverty activist and Oscar Doucet of Acadieville. Ms. Brewer earned 248 of the 397 votes, which included mail-in ballots. Mr. Doucet earned 96 votes while Ms. Coates received 47.<br><br>Despite being tagged as the frontrunner, Ms. Brewer, her face filled with emotion, sighed an audible "phew" when the results were announced and the crowd gave her a lengthy standing ovation.<br><br>"You're my leader. You will always be my leader," said Ms. Brewer's son, Will, 20, tears streaming down his face as he hugged her.<br><br>Ms. Brewer takes over the leadership from Saint John Harbour MLA Elizabeth Weir, who stepped down this weekend after 17 years at the helm. Although Ms. Weir has been elected to the legislature four times and has become one of the most respected and recognized politicians in New Brunswick, she was never able to translate her personal popularity into more seats for the New Democrats.<br><br>Ms. Brewer is pledging to do that by focusing on re-building the party's organization, recruiting quality candidates, reversing the party's sagging finances and travelling across the province to spread the NDP message. Ms. Brewer said her first step toward that goal will be to phone Nova Scotia NDP Leader Darrell Dexter to learn from him how he turned his party around and increased their seats in the legislature.<br><br>"Then I am going to start phoning as many (New Brunswick) party members as I can."<br><br>She said Her first trip will be to the province's north shore where organization has been lacking but where there is opportunity for the NDP to make gains.<br><br>A unilingual anglophone, Ms. Brewer has committed to learning to speak French.<br><br>Ms. Brewer said although she will jump at the first opportunity to run for a seat in the legislature, she isn't concerned at this point that she is not an MLA. She said Ms. Weir will continue to voice NDP concerns in the legislature while she works behind the scenes on party organization.<br><br>"I can do the work of building the membership, preparing us for the next election and preparing us to arrive in droves in the legislative assembly," she said, adding that she believes the NDP can form the government in New Brunswick.<br><br>"It's not just empty rhetoric. There are some amazing people in this province, amazing people in this party who are going to work to make this happen," she said.<br><br>Ms. Brewer, the mother of three grown children, comes to her new role with a diverse resume as a former journalist, social activist and former executive director of the Morgentaler clinic in Fredericton. Although her roots are in New Brunswick, she recently spent four years in Iqaluit, Nunavut as a government communications adviser and senior adviser to government on women's issues. During her time in New Brunswick, she was active with the Conservation Council, the Capital Credit Union and Parents for Children with Special Needs. In October, she earned a Governor General's Award for her work as a union and human rights activist, a feminist and a disability rights activist.<br><br>In New Brunswick, she was at the forefront of a battle with Fredericton Mayor Brad Woodside, who refused to proclaim Gay Pride Week.

Will Washington be the 2nd US state to allow gay marriage?<br><br>Washington State Gays Wait For Marriage Ruling<br>by 365Gay.com Newscenter Staff<br>Posted: September 26, 2005  12:00 am ET<br><br>(Olympia, Washington) A decision could come at any time in a case seeking marriage rights for gay and lesbian couples in the state of Washington. Arguments challenging the state's ban on same-sex marriage were made before the Washington Supreme Court last March. The case involves eight same-sex couples who were denied marriage licenses in King County.<br><br>In August, King County Superior Court Judge William Downing said that the Washington State Constitution guarantees basic rights to lesbian and gay people - and that those rights are violated by a state law prohibiting same-sex couples from marrying.<br><br>Downing's ruling went on to say that the couples must be given marriage licenses. One month later, a court in Thurston County ruled similarly.<br><br>The Supreme Court typically issues its rulings on Thursdays and same-sex couples have been anxiously checking the court's web site weekly for months.<br><br>Equal Rights Washington, the state's largest LGBT rights group, says it expects if the suit is successful gay and lesbian couples could immediately apply for licenses. The first weddings would take place following a three-day waiting period, which would make it a Sunday.<br><br>Equal Rights is optimistically looking forward to winning the case. It's prepared a check-list for couples who are prepared to Marry "Anything that can be taken care of ahead of time, so it's not just a scramble," Fran Dunaway, executive director of Equal Rights Washington told the Seattle Times. "There'll be dresses to buy; suits to iron, flowers to be picked up. It would be a powerful experience for a lot of people."<br><br>Legal experts say the court could rule in any of three ways: It could declare DOMA unconstitutional and grant same-sex couples the same rights as heterosexuals, uphold DOMA, or ask the Legislature to resolve the issue.<br><br>A conservative group opposed to same-sex marriage is already calling for an amendment the state constitution. The Supreme Court of New Jersey will hear a similar bid for gay marriage in the Garden State in this session and New York's highest court is likely to get a third case later this year.<br><br>Seven same-sex couples in New Jersey are suing to marry. (story) Represented by Lambda Legal, they argue that the New Jersey Constitution guarantees them the right to wed. In New York, arguments were made this month in a mid level appeal of a ruling that the state's ban on gay marriage was unconstitutional. The case, and two others in the Empire State, is likely to end up in New York's highest court - the Court of Appeal.<br><br></div>

Ms. Brewer earned 248 of the 397 votes, which included mail-in ballots. Mr. Doucet earned 96 votes while Ms. Coates received 47.<br><br>Despite being tagged as the frontrunner, Ms. Brewer, her face filled with emotion, sighed an audible "phew" when the results were announced and the crowd gave her a lengthy standing ovation.<br><br>"You're my leader. You will always be my leader," said Ms. Brewer's son, Will, 20, tears streaming down his face as he hugged her.<br><br>Ms. Brewer takes over the leadership from Saint John Harbour MLA Elizabeth Weir, who stepped down this weekend after 17 years at the helm. Although Ms. Weir has been elected to the legislature four times and has become one of the most respected and recognized politicians in New Brunswick, she was never able to translate her personal popularity into more seats for the New Democrats.<br><br>Ms. Brewer is pledging to do that by focusing on re-building the party's organization, recruiting quality candidates, reversing the party's sagging finances and travelling across the province to spread the NDP message. Ms. Brewer said her first step toward that goal will be to phone Nova Scotia NDP Leader Darrell Dexter to learn from him how he turned his party around and increased their seats in the legislature.<br><br>"Then I am going to start phoning as many (New Brunswick) party members as I can."<br><br>She said Her first trip will be to the province's north shore where organization has been lacking but where there is opportunity for the NDP to make gains.<br><br>A unilingual anglophone, Ms. Brewer has committed to learning to speak French.<br><br>Ms. Brewer said although she will jump at the first opportunity to run for a seat in the legislature, she isn't concerned at this point that she is not an MLA. She said Ms. Weir will continue to voice NDP concerns in the legislature while she works behind the scenes on party organization.<br><br>"I can do the work of building the membership, preparing us for the next election and preparing us to arrive in droves in the legislative assembly," she said, adding that she believes the NDP can form the government in New Brunswick.<br><br>"It's not just empty rhetoric. There are some amazing people in this province, amazing people in this party who are going to work to make this happen," she said.<br><br>Ms. Brewer, the mother of three grown children, comes to her new role with a diverse resume as a former journalist, social activist and former executive director of the Morgentaler clinic in Fredericton. Although her roots are in New Brunswick, she recently spent four years in Iqaluit, Nunavut as a government communications adviser and senior adviser to government on women's issues. During her time in New Brunswick, she was active with the Conservation Council, the Capital Credit Union and Parents for Children with Special Needs. In October, she earned a Governor General's Award for her work as a union and human rights activist, a feminist and a disability rights activist.<br><br>In New Brunswick, she was at the forefront of a battle with Fredericton Mayor Brad Woodside, who refused to proclaim Gay Pride Week.
