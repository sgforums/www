              <p><br>Since when does cheap foreign labour lower the cost for products and services in Singapore? These cheap foreign labour have a lower cost base in their home country. If they remit SG$200 back to China, it becomes RMB1,000, which is more than sufficient to sustain his parents.</p>
              <p>These cheap foreign labour drive down the salary of the Singapore market, having less salary while the cost of products and services have gone up. Doesn't this equate to a decrease in real wages (decrease in purchasing power) and an increase in the cost of products and services? Since 2004, have there been any decreases in anything (apart from electronic obsolescence)? My plate of chicken rice was SG$3 in 2004, it has gone through 4 increases and is currently selling at $3.80.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Networking and Globalisation from the merely skilled? You believe that an MNC would use the networks of a merely skilled individual? Ask any boss, for the reason for employing foreigners, they will tell you it's either no Singaporean wants to do it (in other labour markets, wages would increase to raise the labour supply, but in Singapore, they chose to import PRCs for the job), or it's because the foreigners are cheaper (due to their lower cost base back home). But then again we don't have proper labour union to fight for workers' rights, that's why the workers get trampled on by powerful corporations.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ask yourself this question also.</p>
              <p>Do we really live in a truly globalized world where there are no borders?</p>
              <p>Can a Singaporean move unrestricted to a Nordic country and make his home there?</p>
              <p>If the Nordic countries welcome foreigners to be citizens like Singapore, I think I would have moved over long ago.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Globalisation is just a lame excuse for all the aggrieved labour policies that they have committed.</p>

              <p>Singapore is hardly a nation suffering under the cruel aegis of the development of underdevelopment. Globalization in the context of Singapore means the exploitation of other nations in favour of Singapore, not vice versa.</p>
              <p>Singapore has profited from globalization like no other nation on earth.</p>
              <p>As for the cost of living in Singapore, I must respectfully beg to differ. Take for instance a country like Australia, a nation whom, thanks to a functioning democracy, does not employ slave labour. You can expect your chicken rice to cost a neat AUD$12.50 (SIN$15.50).</p>
              <p>Singapore needs strong networks, in fact, Singapore cannot survive without them. It a testament to how lucky Singaporeans are that they have leadership, elected or not, that realizes Singapore's unique set of strength and weaknesses. That leadership has realized that Singapore may need to liaise very closely with the emerging economic super power that will be China in the near future. It is no mistake that Singapore seems biased toward the immigration of Chinese nationals. What is wrong with importing and nationalizing a set of persons immediately ready to fulfil Singapore's need?</p>
