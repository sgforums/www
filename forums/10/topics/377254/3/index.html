              <p>And in reply to your question on whether we need so many foreigners,</p>
              <p>1. I have never said we need foreigners. I only said we should welcome them if they come.</p>
              <p>2. I fight hard and work hard to prove to my boss that paying me more is worth it because my work output is way better than getting a cheaper option from India or Philippines. I prove it, I do not go to my boss and whine to him that he should not hire foreigners.</p>
              <p>3. Foreigners are gonna come regardless of what you say. And you said there are too many? Then tell me how many is too many and how many is enough, and how many is too little? And why.</p>

How many is too little? How many is just enough? Since you asked me that question means you think there are too many foreigners in Singapore and hopefully to make your statement credible, you must know, surely!, how many is too many?</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">As for myself, thanks for your warning. Yes it may happen. And you know what in this sentence of yours, you just answered your questions why many of the foreigners are here. They have proved they are better. You said that, not me and one day, if they proved they are better, I have got nothing to say, my friend.</span></p>

              <p>Maybe after going through so many rounds and rounds of discussions, i would accept that maybe we have long gone out of point. Well I accept that.</p>
              <p>Me, a PAP supporter? I can safely say I am neither a PAP supporter nor a PAP basher. Maybe I belong to a group of people that is very commonly found amongst SIngaporeans. The attitude we have towards the government is commonly known as apathy. Simply put, we dun care.</p>
              <p>The government has laid a solid foundation and at the same time, I do admit they have screwed up many Singaporeans, Singaporeans like my uncle who cannot make ends meet. Many people would then ask, there you see, then why dun you screw the government for making things difficult for your uncle? Well you see, my uncle cannot make ends meet and guess what, he spends $200 every month on 4D and smokes 2 packets of Marlborough every day. He even needs to borrow money from my Grandfather. From anyone;s point of view, we will blame the government for making everything expensive, that is why a person like my uncle who only finish Sec 2 cannot make a living. But has my Uncle truly helped himself by not buying 4D and stop smoking or smoke lesser? He has not, and if he doesnt help himself, how can he blame anyone else?</p>
              <p>Hope this further clarifies my stand on governmental issues and policies.</p>

              <p>haha i marvel at your perception of what people say. I did not say everyone who cannot make ends meet is a gambler. I only say, if you dun help yourself, how can you blame others. in Singapore, there are the REALLY poor and there are those who DESERVES to be poor. I met an uncle in a Chai Chee rental one room flat while distributing groceries, he is almost 70. His wife was just warded in hospital but he seems cheerful as he was repairing his bicycle. His bicycle enables him to ride around collecting old stuff to sell to earn that little amount of money. He is old, uneducated and no one wants to employ him but he do whatever he can to survive. This uncle is REALLY poor and deserves help.</p>
              <p>But you know, this uncle has a son. The son is 43. Secondary school education. While his father is working collecting old stuff. He chooses to sleep at home and blames people for not wanting to employ low educated people. You know what, if his Father can find a way to survive while all he, an abled 43 yr old man can just sleep at home for the last 2 years, he DESERVES to be poor.</p>

              <p>Sorry i never defend. I only wanted a reasonable explanation why having foreigners in Singapore is no good. To me, a lot of rants here do not seem to be targetted at the foreigners but instead at the government. I always believe in peaceful and reasonable discussions. Ghandi was against the colonial masters then. Did Ghandi go around fucking them? No, he sought his own peaceful way to spread his propaganda, I think that is more effective.</p>
