              <p><br>Since when does cheap foreign labour lower the cost for products and services in Singapore? These cheap foreign labour have a lower cost base in their home country. If they remit SG$200 back to China, it becomes RMB1,000, which is more than sufficient to sustain his parents.</p>
              <p>These cheap foreign labour drive down the salary of the Singapore market, having less salary while the cost of products and services have gone up. Doesn't this equate to a decrease in real wages (decrease in purchasing power) and an increase in the cost of products and services? Since 2004, have there been any decreases in anything (apart from electronic obsolescence)? My plate of chicken rice was SG$3 in 2004, it has gone through 4 increases and is currently selling at $3.80.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Networking and Globalisation from the merely skilled? You believe that an MNC would use the networks of a merely skilled individual? Ask any boss, for the reason for employing foreigners, they will tell you it's either no Singaporean wants to do it (in other labour markets, wages would increase to raise the labour supply, but in Singapore, they chose to import PRCs for the job), or it's because the foreigners are cheaper (due to their lower cost base back home). But then again we don't have proper labour union to fight for workers' rights, that's why the workers get trampled on by powerful corporations.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ask yourself this question also.</p>
              <p>Do we really live in a truly globalized world where there are no borders?</p>
              <p>Can a Singaporean move unrestricted to a Nordic country and make his home there?</p>
              <p>If the Nordic countries welcome foreigners to be citizens like Singapore, I think I would have moved over long ago.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Globalisation is just a lame excuse for all the aggrieved labour policies that they have committed.</p>

              <p>Singapore is hardly a nation suffering under the cruel aegis of the development of underdevelopment. Globalization in the context of Singapore means the exploitation of other nations in favour of Singapore, not vice versa.</p>
              <p>Singapore has profited from globalization like no other nation on earth.</p>
              <p>As for the cost of living in Singapore, I must respectfully beg to differ. Take for instance a country like Australia, a nation whom, thanks to a functioning democracy, does not employ slave labour. You can expect your chicken rice to cost a neat AUD$12.50 (SIN$15.50).</p>
              <p>Singapore needs strong networks, in fact, Singapore cannot survive without them. It a testament to how lucky Singaporeans are that they have leadership, elected or not, that realizes Singapore's unique set of strength and weaknesses. That leadership has realized that Singapore may need to liaise very closely with the emerging economic super power that will be China in the near future. It is no mistake that Singapore seems biased toward the immigration of Chinese nationals. What is wrong with importing and nationalizing a set of persons immediately ready to fulfil Singapore's need?</p>

Their average wages are at least 3-5 times of Singaporeans <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.jobaroo.com/working-livingandworking.html">(e.g. waiters and retail assistant makes AUD 15 to AUD 25 per hour)</a>. Singaporeans can only contend with 3rd world standard of living in the future, given the government's policy on letting in more 3rd world workers to push down wages.<br><br>The explanation for low wages given by P4P was global competition, seems like competition only applies to Singapore ONLY. But not to countries such as Australia or New Zealand.<br><br>P4P lackeys here complain that some of these countries like Australia, New Zealand, etc have high tax structure. But given their wages, they still make more than the average Singaporeans and could afford more despite their high tax structure. Notwithstanding that they do not need to pay for healthcare and basic education.<br><br>***This comparison is based only on the after tax spending power of low wage earners of both countries. I do not think that we need to compare the after tax spending power of high income earners, because they are still extremely well off after taxes.***<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Singapore:</strong></span><br><br>Income per year: SG$12,000<br>Income Taxes: 0%<br>GST: 7%<br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Spending Power After GST: SG$11,160 [SG$12,000 x 93%]</strong></span><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong></strong></span></p>

              Singapore's unique set of strength and weaknesses. That leadership

              <p>yes. true indeed. <strong>at the cost of sg own citizens. </strong>Just take a look around. Aunties and uncles picking up cardboards, aluminium cans. Not to mention those working in hawker centres or eateries. Why? Simply because the labour laws arent designed to assist the elderly. Instead, by importing foreigners, from china or india, it surpresses the average domestic wage. Furthermore, since there isnt a minimum wage criteria imposed, you'd find workers earning a meagre 300-500dollars a month. Barely enough to afford a roof over their heads, let alone getting by with day to day neccessities.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>Ill just give a brief
                                      extract from the article::</strong></span></p>
              <p><strong>Low wages</strong></p>
              <p>Singapore has a GDP (PPP) per capita higher than Switzerland,
                                      but our wages are way below the Swiss.<br> The UBS study found that employees in Copenhagen, Zurich, Geneva
                                      and New York have the highest gross earnings. With its extremely
                                      high gross wages and comparatively low tax rates, Switzerland is a
                                      very employee-friendly country.<br> The net wages used have been deducted for taxes and social
                                      security.<br> Zurich and Geneva have wage indices (gross) of 119.8 and 107.5
                                      respectively. In contrast, Singapore has a wage index of only 31.3,
                                      comparable with Moscow (30.9), Tallinn (28.7) and Johannesburg
                                      (26.7).<br> In the Asia-Pacific region, it is exceeded by Tokyo (83.0), Sydney
                                      (74.1), Auckland (44.1), Hong Kong (42.3), Taipei (35.5)
                                      and Seoul (32.3)</p>
              <p><strong>Low domestic purchasing power</strong></p>
              <p>Where does an average income buy the most products and services?
                                      Wages alone do not determine the standard of living in a particular
                                      city or country.<br> A better way to measure prosperity is to divide the average annual
                                      salary by the total price of a selected basket of goods and
                                      services (as used in the UBS study). This tells us how much
                                      purchasing power local wages.<br> Again, Zurich (106.9), Sydney (95.9) and Luxembourg (95.4) topped
                                      the list – its citizens have the highest domestic purchasing
                                      power.<br> Singaporeans have a low purchasing power of only 39.9, comparable
                                      to Kuala Lumpur (39.5), Warsaw (34.0) and Bogota (33.7).<br> Other countries in the Asia-Pacific region which are ahead of us
                                      are Tokyo (82.2), Auckland (68.9), Taipei (58.9), Hong Kong (58.1)
                                      and Seoul (57.4).<br> In other words, though the cost of living is higher in Tokyo, the
                                      average Japanese has a domestic purchasing power more than twice
                                      that of an average Singaporean.<br> Though Malaysia is still a developing country and has a GDP (PPP)
                                      per capita of only $14,215, less than 3 times of ours, the ordinary
                                      Malaysian citizen has about the same domestic purchasing power as
                                      the Singaporean.</p>
              <p><strong>Low relative purchasing power of wages</strong></p>
              <div>This is calculated in the UBS study by using a specific,
                                      highly uniform product that is available everywhere in the same
                                      quality, and then calculate how long an employee has to work to
                                      afford it in each city.<br> For the purpose of this article, the iPod nano (with 8 GB of
                                      storage) is used.<br> An average wage earner is Zurich and New York can buy a nano from
                                      an Apple store after nine hours of work. A Singapore worker will
                                      have to work three times longer after 27.5 hours.<br> The figures for selected Asia-Pacific cities are as follows: Sydney
                                      (9.5hrs), Tokyo (12hrs), Auckland (16hrs), Hong Kong (19hrs), Seoul
                                      (22hrs) and Taipei (23.5hrs). Again we came in last among the 4
                                      Asian Tigers.<br>  <br> <strong>Long working hours</strong></div>
              <div>People work an average of 1,902 hours per year in the surveyed
                                      cities, but they work much longer in Asian and Middle Eastern
                                      cities, averaging 2,119 and 2,063 per year respectively.<br> European cities had the lowest working hours per year. A global
                                      comparison showed the people in Lyon and Paris spend the least
                                      amount of time at work: 1,582 and 1,594 hours respectively.<br> Singaporeans spent on average 2,088 hours at work per year with 11
                                      days of vacation.<br> This is less than Hong Kong (2,295) and Seoul (2,312), but more
                                      than Tokyo (1,997), Taipei (2,074), Sydney (1,747) and Auckland
                                      (1,884).<br> Singaporeans also took the least number of holidays after Hong
                                      Kongers (10 days/year).<br> <span style="color: #3366ff;"> <br> <strong><strong>High cost of living</strong></strong></span></div>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;"><strong>Singapore was ranked the
                                      second most expensive place to live in after Tokyo, surpassing Hong
                                      Kong for the first time.<br> Let us compare the food prices in Singapore and other developed
                                      countries since food is a basic necessity.<br> In the UBS study, a basket of 39 food items is put together and
                                      weighted mainly according to Western European consumption habits.
                                      The average worldwide cost of the basket is USD385.<br> In Asia, Tokyo topped the list with an index of 124.7, followed by
                                      Hong Kong (96.5), Singapore (89.4), Seoul (89.0), Taipei
                                      (67.9) and Sydney (66.3</strong>)</span></p>

Singaporeans can only contend with 3rd world standard of living in the future, given the government's policy on letting in more 3rd world workers to push down wages.<br><br>The explanation for low wages given by P4P was global competition, seems like competition only applies to Singapore ONLY. But not to countries such as Australia or New Zealand.<br><br>P4P lackeys here complain that some of these countries like Australia, New Zealand, etc have high tax structure. But given their wages, they still make more than the average Singaporeans and could afford more despite their high tax structure. Notwithstanding that they do not need to pay for healthcare and basic education.<br><br>***This comparison is based only on the after tax spending power of low wage earners of both countries.

              <p><br>I doubt he even care about the facts and reality here in Singapore.  Seems he just post crap just to make Singaporeans look bad.</p>
              <p>NOt to mention about Australia,  in asia employees in Hong Kong are getting better salary than Singaporeans.    The ruling party of Singapore is into brainwashing Singaporeans to accept low salary while they keep increasing cost of the essentials here.   They stated that doing more than one person's job and get low salary is the trend these days.   What bullshit theory or trend is this ?  This is solely beneficial to the PAP and companies while lowly paid employees struggling to make ends meet to feed the govt and cope with the loans, ever increasing costs of living here.    </p>
              <p>Well the aussies pay high taxes but in their old age the govt take care of them.    Over in Singapore, almost everything is money to government and the govt force Singaporeans to buy annuity for our old age.   Despite earning so much , sucking so much $ from us they wanna do away with  responsibility to take care of the old.    </p>

              <p>This debate rages anywhere where nationalism flourishes. Why then do governments encourage nationalism? Because without it, nations would founder and collapse. It is therefore a necessary evil.</p>
              <p>If your intent, angel3070, was to rally support for your agenda against the PAP immigration policy, then I am afraid it has failed, and furthermore you have no one but yourself to blame. It was not the eloquence of your contemporaries that struck you from your pill box, but rather your own lack of cogency and wit. Please, for the benefit of future issues you would like to champion, invest some earnest time, effort and thought before spilling your half formed sentiments. Subsequent readers may find the resultant dialogue enlightening, or at least entertaining. It is a simple correlation, the more research you can afford, the more effort others must expend to dismiss you.</p>
              <p>Low skilled foreign workers do not drive up the cost of anything, in fact, they lower costs. The use of low skilled foreign workers in Singapore amounts to modern slavery, and is definitely in the interest, and to the benefit of the citizens of Singapore. They fulfil roles you would not spit upon, for remuneration you would cry over.</p>
              <p>As for highly skilled workers, what are you really complaining about? The best players get picked first primarily because everyone wants their team to win. Do you or do you not want skilled players on your team?</p>
              <p>Now comes the grey area, the importation of the merely skilled. Foreigners who compete against locals for jobs that the locals can do at any rate. I can only argue that there are other reasons for inviting other nationalities into your country than immediate monetary gain that have more to do with networking and globalization than anything else.</p>

              <p>low skilled foreign workers may lower business operating cost but not necessary reduce the cost of living in Singapore. Giving that SG imports food and material , and for years govt crowding out local entreprenuer for secured govt jobs with over and beyond market rate salary that drives up wage cost .  </p>
              <p>I think majority of Singaporean understand that SG is an open city and there is a need to invit foreigners, but the percentage has crowding out the local the base. </p>
              <p>Network is for Singaporean to go overseas to make the contact, certainly not at the low skill.    </p>

              <p>Don't go off the beaten track, since when did I talk about globalisation pertaining to trade, my question was to your statement on using networks of the merely skilled. When I asked question A, you do not get points for providing answer B.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You said cheaper PRC labour leads to cheaper goods and services? You still have not answer any of my questions above. You just conveniently sidetrack everything like the MIWs. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You cannot use Singapore mentality to compare with the lifestyle of a comparable GDP per capita economy. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> If you compare your Singapore wages to any other comparable GDP per capita economy in the world, you will be shortchanged.</p>
              <p>By the way, Singapore has a higher GDP per capita than Australia. But why are Singaporeans paid less wages compared to Australians?</p>
              <p>How much are Australians paid?</p>
              <p>How much are Singaporeans paid?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>How much are the average cost of houses in Australia?</p>

              <p>If your plate of chicken rice cost more in Australia, you can always prepare your own food to bring to the office. FYI, groceries are comparatively cheaper in Australia than Singapore.</p>

              <p>singapore does not have natural resources. so govt has to rely on imports and exports to make the economy run.</p>
              <p>It does not have adequate resources to produce/manufacture its own products so some things are expensive like beef etc.</p>
              <p>Because the govt rely alot on foreign investors to create jobs for us. one of NTUC's policy was to create full employment rather than help us do collective bargaining for higher wages. We worked for sg economy very hard with low wages and instead of rewarding us by making our jobs safe, now they tried to introduce foreign labours excessively. Now our jobs are threatened and our already v low wages have to be reduced further in order to compete with the foreign workers like prc, which their standard of living are much lower than ours. Why do they come to sg to work? cos the wages when compared to their countries are much much higher. Some of them maybe have no commitment. They just want to earn more money. Some of us who might have families, how to survive?</p>
              <p>No wonder other countries say sgreans are stupid fools. Cos we dun know wat is people's power.</p>
              <p>Govt does not like the idea of implementing minimum wage law either. It will drive away foreign investors. No wonder sg is ranked the top country for investors to start business.</p>
              <p>we work as cheap labours in order to make sure sg economy keeps on running but on the other hand, "incapable people" in the govt plays with our hard earned money n lost in investments projects.</p>
              <p>i have said b4 there is this commercial that says got peanuts to eat better than no peanuts.</p>
              <p>It sends out the message got job with low pay better than no job. So dun complain.</p>
              <p>so who are to blame? foreign workers competition? lack of natural resources? companies that wants to cut costs at the expense of us? Govt's foreign investor policy?   </p>
              <p>oh and japanese wage comprises of a component called family allowance. WHY THE FUCK WE DUN HAVE WAGE COMPONENTS LIKE THIS? wat we have are CPF? is CPF beneficiary to us??? SG sucks Japan Rules.</p>
