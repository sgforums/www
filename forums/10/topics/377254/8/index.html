              <p>I beg to differ. Considering we already have an ageing population, we need to derive new foreign sources to muster up our workforce other than rely solely on our own people. Foreigners are paid to do majority of the blue-collar jobs or other "unwanted" jobs we refuse to. It helps to a certain extent, judging by the fact majority of our people are pursing higher intellectual education and jobscopes - R &amp; D, commercialization, etc.</p>
              <p>Besides, this happens to any other 1st world country. Native population goes down when people are career-minded and having kids at a later age or non at all. So on and so forth.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #800000;">Does it mean that we must suck up to every superpower? Even though they might have a stronger and better economy than us, do we Singaporeans have to lower ourselves to this standard? What makes you think that the PRC Chinese will accept us? I have been studying in the university for 3 full years and I can clearly see that the a large majority of the PRCs and other foreign students tend to stick to their own group, rather than spend time interacting with us locals. Let me put it this way, if they are a minority in Singapore, they will try to interact with us so that they can better survive here. However, now they are existing at such large number that they don't need to do so. They are now creating their own community and not integrating into our society! Now this is the real problem.<br></span></p>
              <p>For those who have been emphasizing on the migrant nature of Singapore, let me remind you of this fact. We spend 40+ years to build up our own identity, taking form of common "improper" Singlish as our form of communication, common love of food from various other cultures etc. I am proud to say that even when I go overseas, all I need is to listen to someone talking on his or her phone to know if they are fellow Singaporeans. Now, do we really want to demolish all these foundations that we have built? To go back to the times where Raffles divided the different races into different areas? This is the reason why Singapore has so many racial riots and tension in the early years.</p>
              <p>I am alright in facing and competing with them in University. But I felt disadvantaged instead and this is the main problem. First, we have to serve NS, and right after that, we entered University. After two years of brain inactivity. Now, we are faced with scholars that are brought over from different countries to fight with us. I am still alright with that. But, while we are given one year free stay in hostel (I am living 2 hours drive from the University), they are given 2 years so as to adjust to a "foreign land". However, it means that while we locals are fighting hard to balance study and CCAs, they are free to concentrate on their study in one entire year! Now that is one of the explanation  why their result are better than us. I am aware of this as the foreign students went flloding to elect for office bearers position for different societies and clubs in their second year, and some got elected with the "help" from their fellow friends.</p>
              <p>Secondly, the Government always said that our study is subsidized. But do you know that the foreign students are also entitled to the same subsidy? They do have an additional condition, that is to work in Sinagpore for three years. So do we locals get extra subsidy if we work in Singapore for three years? Lastly, we have to keep our fitness at peak as we got to report for IPPT every year, while the foreign students are all welcome to spend their weekends off to wander and enjoy their life in Singapore. Furthermore, for those who failed (I am the lucky one, lol), they had to go for RT after their lessons.</p>
              <p>There are many who said that it is our duty to serve the country, which I agreed too. But the problem is why the country is shortchanging us while we are doing our best for her? Why are the foreigners given so much advantages over us?</p>

              <p>Next, we can talk about the economical value that these FT can bring to us. I feel that it is perfectly fine for them to take up jobs that the Singaporeans do not want. But are we really talking about this? Are we really complaining about how the construction workers snatch our ricebowl? The main problem lies in they are snatching away jobs that we want! It is okay to have competition, but it is not okay when the education system did not prepare us well for this competition.</p>
              <p>Every year, the University takes in a certain number of local students as undergraduate, but how about the rest? Are they really "not talented"? What makes the Government thinks that the foreigner are more talented? Some of the PRCs cannot even speak proper English and has problem constructing a proper sentence! This makes me really wonder, how many locals are rejected entry due to poor GP grade and how many poor English-speaking foreign student that our University takes in every year?</p>
              <p>Every year that we take in one foreign student, it means one fewer future local graduate in Singapore. And looking at their current population in Singapore Universities, I have no trouble wondering why PM Lee commented that there are a lack of local "talents" in Singapore.</p>
              <p>One more point, is it really our facult that the birthrate is low? I feel that it is PAP's own making. They tried to solve the problem of economy by bringing in more competition, in the name of creating more job opportunities. But what is the consequences? The Singaporeans are so worried about making sufficient money for their future that they have problem finding time and space for babies! This is not something that can be solved by throwing more cash. I believe that for those families with children, the monetary reward is not their objective in the first place.</p>
              <p>But what will happen to a society where the locals have problem finding a suitable and affordable housing? For example, when I graduated, I need to pay off my study loan, give money to my parents and service housing locan etc. And according to our minister, 30% of the salary goes to housing loan is an appropriate amount. But some of us have more than that commitment, we need to worry about other loans and liability as well. What is more important, by the time I graduate, i am at the age of 25, and in order to make enough money to support my own family before my presence becomes a liability to the society, I don't think I will want my future wife to risk having a baby at a high age (Down syndrome probability increases rapidly after age of 30 for baby).</p>

              <p>Please...Not those Stupid Communist China again!!!!</p>
              <p>Mainland China can never become a real superpower if they continue to believe in Communism.</p>
              <p>Already,her neighbouring countries have one by one turn into democracy nations.Russia(former Soviet Union),Mongolia..etc.Eastern Europe n Philipphines,Cambodia also turn from an autocracy government to democracy nations.</p>
              <p>If China was to look around her surrounding,she will find herself more n more isolated by other countries.Other than trade,other nations dont really give a damn about Communist China.It is just like a bunch of kids want money from an elderly,but have no affection towards him or her.Nowadays,even Russia open fire on China fishing boat,the Communist government also dare not to retaliate back to Russia.Due to the fact she still need Russia technology.</p>
              <p>Strictly speaking,China is not a superpower.Whether be it now or the near future.Her technology in military is not as advance as Russia n United States.Her politics thinking is also not mature,still sticking to communism or autocracy(or even worse than autocracy) type of government.Thats why only dictator like LKY can communicate with them.Becoz he is as stupid as Communist as he get older.</p>
              <p>To make thing worse,Communist China one-child policy is killing them!!!Now,maybe they might think their population is too much.But as they get more n more developed,they will find that their population will drop at a shocking rate.And they will have trouble trying to support their highly increase ageing population.</p>
              <p>And,Human are not like pigs or animals.That is,when u want them to born more,they will born more.When u want them to born less,they will listen.Singapore ever shrinking fertility rate is a very good example.Earlier days LKY discourage ppl from having too many babies,n even fine them after parents have over 2 children.Now,even LKY,LHL,n GCT try to encourage Singaporeans to born more babies,include giving out goodies,the plan simply fail!!!</p>
              <p>But then again,although LKY mistakes in birth control policy,he still allow Singaporeans to born 2 children.He n his party members still have abit of humanity(at that time,of coz).But Communist China only allow their countrymen n women to have only "1 child"?LOL!!!!</p>
              <p>If that one child die at the age of 14-26 yrs old,do their parents still got mood to have another child?And all the hardship n money that invested in that one child will get wasted!!!Is that what those Communist politicians want to see?To see their ppl suffer,so they can clap their hands n laugh?LOL!!!!(Spit on those Communist hypocritical <a href="mailto:b@stard">b@stard</a>!!!)</p>

              <p>Doesnt he has any freaking clue that English now is the most important language around the world?Especially in World conference,this kind of global meeting,that it will be more presentable to use English so that the majority members will know what u are talking about.</p>
              <p>Or is it becos this Communist Pig Premier know no English?</p>

              <p><span style="color: #800000;">Does it mean that we must suck up to every superpower? Even though they might have a stronger and better economy than us, do we Singaporeans have to lower ourselves to this standard? What makes you think that the PRC Chinese will accept us? I have been studying in the university for 3 full years and I can clearly see that the a large majority of the PRCs and other foreign students tend to stick to their own group, rather than spend time interacting with us locals. Let me put it this way, if they are a minority in Singapore, they will try to interact with us so that they can better survive here. However, now they are existing at such large number that they don't need to do so. They are now creating their own community and not integrating into our society! Now this is the real problem.<br></span></p>
              <p>For those who have been emphasizing on the migrant nature of Singapore, let me remind you of this fact. We spend 40+ years to build up our own identity, taking form of common "improper" Singlish as our form of communication, common love of food from various other cultures etc. I am proud to say that even when I go overseas, all I need is to listen to someone talking on his or her phone to know if they are fellow Singaporeans. Now, do we really want to demolish all these foundations that we have built? To go back to the times where Raffles divided the different races into different areas? This is the reason why Singapore has so many racial riots and tension in the early years.</p>
              <p>I am alright in facing and competing with them in University. But I felt disadvantaged instead and this is the main problem. First, we have to serve NS, and right after that, we entered University. After two years of brain inactivity. Now, we are faced with scholars that are brought over from different countries to fight with us. I am still alright with that. But, while we are given one year free stay in hostel (I am living 2 hours drive from the University), they are given 2 years so as to adjust to a "foreign land". However, it means that while we locals are fighting hard to balance study and CCAs, they are free to concentrate on their study in one entire year! Now that is one of the explanation  why their result are better than us. I am aware of this as the foreign students went flloding to elect for office bearers position for different societies and clubs in their second year, and some got elected with the "help" from their fellow friends.</p>
              <p>Secondly, the Government always said that our study is subsidized. But do you know that the foreign students are also entitled to the same subsidy? They do have an additional condition, that is to work in Sinagpore for three years. So do we locals get extra subsidy if we work in Singapore for three years? Lastly, we have to keep our fitness at peak as we got to report for IPPT every year, while the foreign students are all welcome to spend their weekends off to wander and enjoy their life in Singapore. Furthermore, for those who failed (I am the lucky one, lol), they had to go for RT after their lessons.</p>
              <p>There are many who said that it is our duty to serve the country, which I agreed too. But the problem is why the country is shortchanging us while we are doing our best for her? Why are the foreigners given so much advantages over us?</p>

              <p>Next, we can talk about the economical value that these FT can bring to us. I feel that it is perfectly fine for them to take up jobs that the Singaporeans do not want. But are we really talking about this? Are we really complaining about how the construction workers snatch our ricebowl? The main problem lies in they are snatching away jobs that we want! It is okay to have competition, but it is not okay when the education system did not prepare us well for this competition.</p>
              <p>Every year, the University takes in a certain number of local students as undergraduate, but how about the rest? Are they really "not talented"? What makes the Government thinks that the foreigner are more talented? Some of the PRCs cannot even speak proper English and has problem constructing a proper sentence! This makes me really wonder, how many locals are rejected entry due to poor GP grade and how many poor English-speaking foreign student that our University takes in every year?</p>
              <p>Every year that we take in one foreign student, it means one fewer future local graduate in Singapore. And looking at their current population in Singapore Universities, I have no trouble wondering why PM Lee commented that there are a lack of local "talents" in Singapore.</p>
              <p>One more point, is it really our facult that the birthrate is low? I feel that it is PAP's own making. They tried to solve the problem of economy by bringing in more competition, in the name of creating more job opportunities. But what is the consequences? The Singaporeans are so worried about making sufficient money for their future that they have problem finding time and space for babies! This is not something that can be solved by throwing more cash. I believe that for those families with children, the monetary reward is not their objective in the first place.</p>
              <p>But what will happen to a society where the locals have problem finding a suitable and affordable housing? For example, when I graduated, I need to pay off my study loan, give money to my parents and service housing locan etc. And according to our minister, 30% of the salary goes to housing loan is an appropriate amount. But some of us have more than that commitment, we need to worry about other loans and liability as well. What is more important, by the time I graduate, i am at the age of 25, and in order to make enough money to support my own family before my presence becomes a liability to the society, I don't think I will want my future wife to risk having a baby at a high age (Down syndrome probability increases rapidly after age of 30 for baby).</p>

              <p>I refer to your first para, they compete jobs at the coffee shops with locals.   I heard of a case of a lowly educated lady went to look for job at coffee shops and was rejected because they prefer the Chinese from China.  How I hope in PAP's next life they will face this sort of situation.</p>

              <p>Please...Not those Stupid Communist China again!!!!</p>
              <p>Mainland China can never become a real superpower if they
              continue to believe in Communism.</p>
              <p>Already,her neighbouring countries have one by one turn into
              democracy nations.Russia(former Soviet Union),Mongolia..etc.Eastern
              Europe n Philipphines,Cambodia also turn from an autocracy
              government to democracy nations.</p>
              <p>If China was to look around her surrounding,she will find
              herself more n more isolated by other countries.Other than
              trade,other nations dont really give a damn about Communist
              China.It is just like a bunch of kids want money from an
              elderly,but have no affection towards him or her.Nowadays,even
              Russia open fire on China fishing boat,the Communist government
              also dare not to retaliate back to Russia.Due to the fact she
              still need Russia technology.</p>
              <p>Strictly speaking,China is not a superpower.Whether be it now or
              the near future.Her technology in military is not as advance as
              Russia n United States.Her politics thinking is also not
              mature,still sticking to communism or autocracy(or even worse than
              autocracy) type of government.Thats why only dictator like LKY can
              communicate with them.Becoz he is as stupid as Communist as he get
              older.</p>
              <p>To make thing worse,Communist China one-child policy is killing
              them!!!Now,maybe they might think their population is too much.But
              as they get more n more developed,they will find that their
              population will drop at a shocking rate.And they will have trouble
              trying to support their highly increase ageing population.</p>
              <p>And,Human are not like pigs or animals.That is,when u want them
              to born more,they will born more.When u want them to born less,they
              will listen.Singapore ever shrinking fertility rate is a very good
              example.Earlier days LKY discourage ppl from having too many
              babies,n even fine them after parents have over 2 children.Now,even
              LKY,LHL,n GCT try to encourage Singaporeans to born more
              babies,include giving out goodies,the plan simply fail!!!</p>
              <p>But then again,although LKY mistakes in birth control policy,he
              still allow Singaporeans to born 2 children.He n his party members
              still have abit of humanity(at that time,of coz).But Communist
              China only allow their countrymen n women to have only "1
              child"?LOL!!!!</p>
              <p>If that one child die at the age of 14-26 yrs old,do their
              parents still got mood to have another child?And all the hardship n
              money that invested in that one child will get wasted!!!Is that
              what those Communist politicians want to see?To see their ppl
              suffer,so they can clap their hands n laugh?LOL!!!!(Spit on those
