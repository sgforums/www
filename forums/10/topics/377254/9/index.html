              <p>agree with you that in a communist state, there is no public election of governmental representative, and there is no official freedom of religion. I will add that decisions in communist state are made by the party rather than the parliament. The country is supposed to be run by communist idealogy.</p>
              <p>However, Communist idealogy was meant to take from the have and give to the have not, to prevent exploitation of the underpriviledged, narrow the gap of the rich and the poor, and it is ideal, but it is not realistic.</p>
              <p>today, you can't preach other religion in a religious state, such as those in the ME; countries without public election are called dictatorship, and those with elections results rigged by vote buying are not much of a democracy.</p>
              <p>My question was referring to the statement "Mainland China can never become a real superpower if they continue to believe in Communism." The real problem is that China's communism is not the true communism that strive for even distribution of wealth for its people. China will be a power the international community cannot ignore, whether you call it superpower or not. </p>

              <p>well the chinese government may applied economics incentives but it does little to social cohersion...if you read news the repeated reason is always about Han chinese moving into minority area affecting lifestyle.</p>
              <p>Its one aspect for government to recognizes the different ethnicity in China is another to be aware of their live style...I am sure there are deeper social issued such as mixed married and religion is another big issued with the chinese government.  </p>
              <p>much like PRC FT moving to Singapore encroaching citizens living quarters and not able to converse with English given that there are non Chinese speaking citizens. I mean you would have the social awareness that you don't bringing pork to a meal shared with muslim because it is offensive.</p>
              <p>These are acceptance of differences and awareness that social policies need to instill thru educating and rise awareness, and not just about these belong to China...thats generic.</p>

              <p><strong>From our Correspondent</strong></p>
              <p>According to the 2009 Population Trends report, Singapore’s total population at end-June was 4.99 million with 3.73 million Singapore residents and 1.25 million non-residents.</p>
              <p>Though the number of PRs and citizens are not revealed, the National Population Secretariat puts the figures for the number of PRs at 0.48 million and citizens at 3.16 million:</p>

              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>This means that only 63.3 per cent of Singapore’s population are citizens with the number of non-Singaporeans, including PRs growing fast.</strong></span></p>
              <p>There are about 15,000 new births in 2008 and 100,000 new citizens and PRs. For every citizen born in Singapore, there are 6.7 PR and new citizen.</p>
              <p>If the population growth and intake of foreigners remain at the same rate, there will be 1 million new citizens and PRs in 10 years time with only 150,000 births.</p>
              <p>The percentage of Singapore citizens will decrease to 50 per cent or less if the government continues to “import” foreigners at such a rapid rate.</p>
              <p>The relentless influx of foreigners had led to rampant inflation, sky-rocketing of prices of HDB flats and a stagnation of the wages of the lower-income group.</p>
              <p>A recent report released by property company ERA revealed that 40 per cent of the buyers of HDB resale flats are foreigners.</p>
              <p>The lower income group has also seen their salaries stagnate or even declined over the last decade due to the easily availability of cheap foreign labor who flocked to Singapore to earn a living.</p>
              <p>The rising resentment and disgruntlement on the ground against the government’s liberal immigration policy had prompted Prime Minister Lee to reassure Singaporeans lately that he will “slow down” the intake of foreigners. However, he was quick to add that the policy will remain essentially unchanged though it will be tweaked.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>With no opposition in Parliament, the ruling party is given complete power and autonomy to govern the nation as it likes. Singaporeans are completely under the mercy of the PAP. Unless there is a change in status quo, Singaporeans should be mentally prepared to live with more foreigners in their midst in the future.</strong></span></p>

              <p>If based on the 2009 statistics, it is confirmed that Singapore Citizens make-up only 63.3% of the entire population, what if the baseline is moved back to 1970 or 1989 ?</p>
              <p>Using the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.singstat.gov.sg/stats/themes/people/hist/popn.html">‘Statistics Timeline of Population Census’ (*1) </a>- the rate of increase in the number of citizens to the total population ratios during 1989, 1999 and 2009 - will reveal a more shocking trend.</p>
              <p>From 1970 to 1989, the increase in citizens to the total population had reflected closely to the natural birth rate, showing the slow growth - (low birth rate and tight immigration rules) - of only 634,000 over a period of 19 years.</p>
              <p>From the data reviewed, one will notice that the percentage of citizens to the Total Population is declining through the years.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1970 - Total Population Nos: 2.074.5 - * - No of Citizens: 2,013.6 -  * - 97.064%</p>
              <p>1989 - Total Population Nos: 2,930.9 - * - No. of Citizens: 2,647.6 - * - 90.334%</p>
              <p>1999 - Total Population Nos: 3,958.7 - * - No of Citizens: 3,229.7 - * -  81.585%</p>
              <p>2009 - Total Population Nos: 4,987.6 - * - No of Citizens: 3,733.9 - * - 74.863%</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>From 1989 to 2009, the increase in new citizens showed a steep growth that can only be from a liberalised entry of foreigners - amounting to a total of 1,086.3 million, which form about 41% of the number of citizens in census year 1989.</p>
              <p>If 1970 is used as a baseline, the increase in citizens between 1979 to 2009 will amount to 1,720.3 million of new citizens arriving since 1971 onwards.</p>
              <p>This new citizens will number 85.43% on the total number of Citizens in 1979.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If population arrival is used to influence the Elections Results, coupled with the total grip on government machineries to block the legitimate political activities of all Singaporeans, plus the total control of print and broadcast media, and further boosted by the political gerrymeandering prior to and during Elections - do we need to wonder how the Ruling Political Party managed to keep itself in power for 52 years ?</p>

              <p>If I remembered correctly, the population must have growth by 1 m over the past 10 years. At the low birth rate over these years, the population growth must be due to high number of PR intake.</p>
              <p>As citizen, we entitled to know the make up of these PR likes country, age, education, race, etc The attibutes of these PR intakes had a long term impact to Singapore future in term of their quality, coutry or origin. I am currently working in China and I have many Chinese friends who received PR but return to China for work and residential. Singapore is not a prefer place for many of these Chinese but a safe haven should there be uncertainty  in China.</p>
              <p>On the other hand, I know of many past Indian colleagues who not only make their home in Singaore but brought along the entire village mates, friends when they settled into this country.</p>
