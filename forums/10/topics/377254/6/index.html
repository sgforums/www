              <p>I am self employed in Singapore and earn very good money. I did not wait for someone to hand me a job, I created one for myself. If you'd look, your short history abounds with hard working people who became very successful in Singapore through dedicated and consistent effort. What more can you ask?  I love this country and as soon as the government sends me the invitation I will accept citizenship.</p>
              <p>I am not a supporter of the PAP, although I am not so emotionally engaged that I cannot see the forest for the trees, i.e I am able to appreciate some of the things the PAP has done for this country.</p>
              <p>If you do not appreciate your country, and remember the Singapore has been primarily shaped by the PAP, then I can only opine that perhaps you'd be happier somewhere else.</p>
              <p>Might I suggest Australia ;)</p>
