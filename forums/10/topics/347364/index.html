              <p>2. 200 PMETs jobs to be held by Singaporeans.</p>

              <p><br>Ok Uncle, since u want me to stick to the question, i re phrase my questions.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>PM question to MNC</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"May i know how much will our Govt gain from your investment"</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>MNC replied</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"with 1000 workers at a levy of say $250 per pax, you get to collect 250,000 per month + Gst + foreign workers tax."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"We will also receive 23% corporate tax per year, as we targeted our profit before tax (EBIT) will be 3 millions per year, you get about $690,000 + property tax + Gst +infrastructure tax etc etc will come to approx 1 million per year"</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Next the 200 singaporeans will hv jobs and pay you tax and Gst, ERP, etc etc will make you gain another $200,000"</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"We will also sponsor  and support your events and function by budgeting a $50,000 per years set aside for social economy purposes"</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Therefore, in a nutshell, u/govt will gain about 1.5 to 1.8 millions just by saying yes to us, that is roughly half your annual salary, if I am not wrong"</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>PM asked</p>
              <p>"Oh! got any year end gift for me???"</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>MNC replied</p>
              <p>" That is not the question, we will discuss these in private"</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>PM replied</p>
              <p>"Good deal, we just shake legs and got to hv 1.8millions ++ year end gift, why not?"</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>MNC asked</p>
              <p>" so it is alright to employ foreigner workers here?"</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>PM replied</p>
              <p>"By all means, we get to hv levies and tax too, the more the merrier"</p>

              <p>Practical and realistic, and not corrupted?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If she ever does that, i would personally have her head on a pike and plant it in market square for all to condemn. The highest office in our land calls for integrity and honesty, that she abused it is worse than treason.</p>
              <p><br>If the top is corrupted, how much more will everyone in the system be equally so?</p>
              <p><br>I would do so ONLY if i have such evidences and not just rumours or hearsay.</p>
              <p><br>fortunately for me, the evidence is here and in her own words, readied herself for implication and prosecution. She had lost her moral compass and is not fit to lead.</p>
              <p><br>And fortunately for you too that nickname are used here. For if you used your real name, and if i am your employer, i would sack you first because you had lost your moral compass and is a thief.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There is such thing as practical and realistic, but there is a fine moral line drawn between it and utter evil.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To Bear: Just an example only. Legal MNCs and not from the porn industry, illegal drugs or tainted milk ones.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To Angel: You forgotten to add at least $1.4million annually will circulate for our domestic economy when the foriegn workers spend at least $30 per person per week, helping the non - PMET earn a living. And that's just based on 1000 workers alone. Have not counted in the est 1.5million here now ;-)</p>

              <p>To Angel: You forgotten to add at least $1.4million annually will circulate for our domestic economy when the foriegn workers spend at least $30 per person per week, helping the non - PMET earn a living. And that's just based on 1000 workers alone. Have not counted in the est 1.5million here now ;-)</p>

              <p>I see. So earning 4 to 5 times more than the US president is not corruption? Having relatives in top positions in various companies is not corruption?</p>
              <p>*shrugs* you are an idealistic person. Not practical at all.</p>
              <p>Every organization does things with multiple objectives. Donate to charity? Raise awareness of company. Best do charity that is a focus of the current govt so that there is a greater possibility of getting that elusive govt contract.</p>
              <p>evidence? There are so many open secrets in Singapore. Right in front of you, but cannot openly condemn it, or you will be hauled to court.</p>
              <p>This IS Singapore. CREATED by LKY, who puts every form of control into our law.</p>
              <p>Can't help you if you are too idealistic.</p>
              <p>There is no need to curse and swear on this forum. You can't achieve your objective pissing everyone off, if you even have an objective at posting in this forum in the 1st place.</p>
