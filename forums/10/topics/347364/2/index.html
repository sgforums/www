              <p>Both Angel and Poh were perfectly on-topic. They responded to xtreyer's scenario by putting his question into the context of the Singapore government, which is the PAP, dealing with MNCs. For a government, in fact any government, does anyone really think that they are a group of self-sacrificing, altruistic 'leaders'? Who believes that? The object of power is power. And as power corrupts, absolute power corrupts absolutely. As evident from the disparate gap between the lives of national leaders and the common people, it is clear who is serving who.</p>
              <p>The issue is that xtreyier, for a man of 'science', simply lives in a world of theory. He must be one of those theoretical 'scientists'. Just like the topic on protectionism, he surrounds himself with theoretical outcomes while engages in name-calling when anyone tries to inject a degree of realism by taking into consideration corruption and conspiracy.</p>

              <p>Very much agree. And yes, you are right that it's normal fare and we should not give extra credit to SG leaders.</p>
              <p>But the threadstarter was talking about honest leadership, and condemning me for telling him the realities of life, (that our leaders have multiple objectives in all they do, since they behave like a corporation). He believes naively in the idea that our leaders are self-sacrificing and put citizens in front of everything else.</p>
              <p>He said that what I described is utter evil.</p>
              <p>I say that he is just a kid, coz there is no such thing as utter evil in the world. It's just a perspective of things. This is just a practicality of life.</p>
              <p>And he is in hiding, not daring to face up to the realities of life.</p>
