Unlike salaried workers, there is currently no requirement for the self-employed to make regular contributions to their Ordinary and Special Accounts.<br><br>"Although they are required to contribute to Medisave, not everyone does. In fact, less than half of the self-employed have paid their Medisave contributions in full. This spells trouble... When they grow old or cannot work for one reason or another, how are they going to pay their medical bills?<br><br>"Even for those who have Medisave, the average balance for those aged 55-59 is only S$12,500 or about half that of salaried employees. This is not enough to prepare them for their future healthcare needs."<br><br>Mr Goh urged the self-employed to save while they are still working and able.<br><br>If the self-employed decide to save through regular CPF contributions, they will also get the bonus interest rate which is better than bank rates for savings accounts, he added. - CNA/ac<br></div>
