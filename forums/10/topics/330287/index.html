              <h1>Documentary: U.S. intelligence behind 9/11</h1>
              <p><em class="annotation">On
                  the anniversary of 9/11, an Italian-produced documentary called ZERO,
                  investigating the tragedy, is opening in Russia. The documentary has
                  already sparked controversy and U.S. networks have rejected the film,
                  as the authors believe that the official version of events surrounding
                  the attacks can't be true.</em> The events of September 11 2001
                  sent shockwaves around the world as hijacked aircraft crashed into the
                  World Trade Centre, bringing the landmark buildings down, the Pentagon,
                  and into a Pennsylvania field in the wake of a failed attempt by
                  passengers to regain control.<br> <br> The Empty space at Ground Zero in Manhattan stands as a memorial to the
                  collapse of the towers, which killed nearly 3000 occupants and rescuers.<br> <br> The makers of the documentary claim that the report of the official
                  U.S. commission into the tragedy of September 11, 2001 is false.<br> <br> One of the films authors, Giulietto Chiesa, who's also an Italian
                  member of the European Parliament, says some of the facts concerning
                  the tragedy remain very suspicious and that a lot of questions are
                  still unanswered.<br> <br> <span style="font-style: italic;">“The people who organised 9/11 are
                  people who knew the geopolitical and energy situation in the world very
                  well. They knew exactly how the attack will change the future of the
                  world,”</span> Chiesa said.<br> <br> The film claims the reason for the collapse of the two towers of the
                  World Trade Center in New York was not the planes crashing into them
                  but a controlled detonation of explosives planted inside the buildings.
                  Referring to witness corroborations, they pose the question of how two
                  of the worlds largest buildings collapsed on their own footprint, and
                  without significantly affecting nearby buildings.<br> <br> Chiesa says he was shocked by the absence of U.S. air defense on the
                  day of the attack, which allowed the hijacked planes reach the World
                  Trade Centre.<br> <br> He also finds it strange that, just three days after 9/11, U.S.
                  officials were able to name all 19 terrorist involved. The film
                  presents evidence that CIA specialists not only new about the planned
                  terrorist attack but assisted them in gaining U.S. visas.<br> <br> The documentary also raises questions about whether the aircraft
                  involved in the Pentagon attack was a Boeing-757. Adding to these
                  questions is the absence of any footage from the many cameras installed
                  around the U.S. Defense HQ, any wreckage from the aircraft, or
                  passenger bodies.<br> <br> The documentary also raises doubts, not only about Osama Bin Laden’s
                  involvement in the attack, but also the existence of the Al-Quaeda
                  terrorist organisation.</p>

              <p>That's the usual NWO horseshit you find on internet.</p>
              <p>It's complete horseshit.</p>
              <p>Notice that most conspiracy theories of the NWO type are propagated by americans.</p>
              <p>One of the reasons why this is so is because of the propagandist nature of the american mainstream media.</p>
              <p>USA mainstream media is dominated by financial and corporate interests and is biased towards their point of view, covering up a lot of things and giving a narrow propagandist outlook on global events.</p>
              <p>Over time, some americans "woke up" from this slumber and is aware of the propagandist nature of their media.</p>
              <p>From this disillusionment of the state of politics and mainstream media in their country, there came confusion about what is really going on in america.</p>
              <p>Who is running the show?</p>
              <p>Why are they lying to me?</p>
              <p>Why are certain facts not widely known?</p>
              <p>In this search for the "truth", in their confusion and intellectual sickness, spawned the conspiracy theory of "NWO".</p>
              <p>A chaotic and moronic nonsense about secret societies, hidden agendas, one world government etc.</p>
              <p>The truth is that there is some influence of hidden groups, secret agendas etc, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">but not</span></strong> to the level claimed by these crackpots.</p>

              <p>the NWO theory itself has a basis. its deeper significance is related to conspiracies, scams and attempts to mislead the world . IT HAS A SUPPORTING BASE and we should not discount it. Sh^t happens in the world.</p>
              <p>Sheep with 2 heads being born, a woman who can lift a truck in a miracle event to save her child and people who can eat glass. If these can be real, why not the NWO?.

              <p>Poh Ah Pak, the news u posted may not be related to NWO. Bush, Rockefellar, or Osama theories. But indeed it could have happened, and can have happened. Did u realise it?</p>
              <p>If it was a planned attack, there is some mysterious elements behind it, and the agenda unknown. This aspect itself suggest  a conspiracy theory. Till then it remains as one.</p>
              <p>Definition of Conspiracy theory:   a theory that explains an event as being the result of a plot</p>
              <p>when someone get murdered, the policeman investigates and comes up with the conclusion, until then it remains a mystery or in other words a conspiracy theory . The policemen himself in his mind will conjure up images, scenarios like crime of passion, violent crime, or the crime driven by financial motives in order to find clues to the case. In other words his own conspiracy theory. It will be this thinking which will lead him to start off somewere and progress.</p>

              <p>It is natural human trait, to find out the truth, the mind conjures up these imaginary scenarios to start off with a lead. But if NWO is b*llshit, the foundation that caused the NWO theory to emrge is not. The base fundamentals have a logical supporting aspect.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>the other reason is , if there is such a NWO agenda, the opponents to it will try to deter their plans by keeping ahead of it. They do this by presenting all possibe scenarios which can occur  like the NWO , one world government, stories They are the metaphors for the base fundamental of that theory.</p>
              <p>its just like politics . Politics propagate an idea before hand when that idea has not been proven true but yet its possible.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>its just like LkY saying "opposition wll ruin s'pore in just 5 years". It had not yet happened, but its possible though. So the best way to prevent it from possibly happening is to prevent it from taking shape in the first place.</p>

              <p>But the problem is that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">there is no such thing as NWO agenda.</span></p>
              <p>There is however a lot of propaganda on internet talking about NWO agenda.</p>
              <p>By the way what is your definition of "NWO" agenda?</p>
              <p>There is a lot of propaganda talking about bigfoot.</p>
              <p>But that doesn't mean that there actually is a bigfoot.</p>
              <p>But there is at least a definition of bigfoot.</p>
              <p>A big hairy upright walking creature.</p>
              <p>That is bigfoot.</p>
              <p>There is a lot of propaganda talking about aliens.</p>
              <p>But that doesn't mean that there actually are aliens.</p>
              <p>But there is at least a definition of alien.</p>
              <p>A lifeform that does not exist on earth and comes from other worlds in outer space.</p>
              <p>That is alien.</p>
              <p>So what is your definition of "NWO" agenda?</p>
              <p>Or are you just chasing shadows?</p>
