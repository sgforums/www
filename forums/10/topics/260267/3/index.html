The police then reminded the public that anyone participating in Chee's planned rally and march would be committing an offence.<br><br>On September 13, 2006, Chee invited both Mr Paul Wolfowitz, President of World Bank and Mr Rodrigo de Rato y Figaredo, Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund, to his planned rally on September 16, 2006. At a press conference the next day, Chee announced that his application to be a civil society representative to Singapore 2006 as a representative of the Open Singapore Centre, was rejected by the IMF/World Bank. His sister and party's member Chee Siok Chin's application to represent the Alliance for Reform &amp; Democracy in Asia, was approved by the IMF/World Bank but was rejected by the Singapore government.On September 15, 2006, Chee released a podcast that warned Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong that the Singapore 2006 event was a "public relations disaster" for Singapore.<br><br>On September 16, 2006, Chee started off the "Empower Singaporeans Rally and March" at 1100 at the Speakers' Corner, Hong Lim Park but was stopped by the police when he started his march. As the police had formed a human barricade to stop him whenever he resumed his march, Chee announced at 1730 that there would be a rally the following day in front of the Parliament House. Nevertheless, Chee was stopped from leaving the park unless he agrees to stop the protest immediately. Left with no choice, he stayed at the park with his party's members and supporters.<br><br>On September 17, 2006, Chee announced his plan to continue the protest by remaining at the park until the start of the IMF-World Bank meetings two days away. On September 18, 2006, after hours of negotiations with police, Chee went to Raffles City to hand out pamphlets to the public and he returned to the park. Chee stopped his protest accordingly at noon on September 19 and he concluded that his protest had achieved its purpose. Chee further announced that the just concluded 72-hour protest was only a start. Chee mentioned that for the next few months, more activists would be recruited and trained, and more activities would be organized for the campaign to bring pressure on the Singapore Government to reform. </blockquote>though he was right in being complaining about rising incomes, and the hardship of the working people. he was being complacent about what he's doing and insisting on protesting and podcasting until PAP give up, but although he failed. he and his sister keep going on to complain, until PAP fall.

Tell people to "Get out of Singapore" is merely a symptom of a larger problem that happens in Singapore; that inferiority complex fostered upon the population by a Govt that constantly blares out the weakness of Singapore to justify some silly policy.
