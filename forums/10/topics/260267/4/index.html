Just how did this Govt come about in the first place? Just where did the people in the civil service, a bungling bunch of fools the people at the top are, come from?<br><br>No, I never asked you to care about whether or not I am allergic to stupidity. The point of the problem is that, as Atobe has said, is that you confuse political loyalty with loyalty to country. A country's reputation is how the people make it. If they don't care, well, that's their business.<br><br>And you are not being clear here but rather very emotional in your dwelling in patriotism, revealing the time honored fear of many Singaporeans when they realise they are actually Emperors with no clothes. A price will be paid for every action, just as a price will be paid when citizens in their country do not so much as whimper when their Govt abuse its powers for its own ends. There will always a price to be paid. A country that lives in denial thinking that safety is the most important will nonetheless stagnate eventually. Tell people to "Get out of Singapore" is merely a symptom of a larger problem that happens in Singapore; that inferiority complex fostered upon the population by a Govt that constantly blares out the weakness of Singapore to justify some silly policy. The result is a lack of can-do spirit that is dead as a dog as it is.</div></blockquote>Don't you think that PAP is trying to help people now with Lee Hsien Loong being the Prime Minister instead of the former Goh Chok Tong and Lee Kuan Yew? After Lee Hsien Loong started his term, alot of happenings have been around, such as the Progress Package which was implemented by him himself, more and such. And one more thing, most people who founded the Singapore government in the mid 1900s were from other countries like Malaysia and etc.<br><br>Read what he said, he was referring to YOU. And not me, unless he was referring it to me, he was referring to YOU, that you are confusing political loyalty with loyalty to country. If you think that's how a country makes it, why aren't most countries successful in their reputation like not being supportive with the president/prime minister and riots going on? Its already a miracle that Singapore's reputation is quite good in the eyes of the world out there.<br><br>Our government may be using their powers for their own will but don't you think picking on the Singaporean citizens are bad? Do you think they are taught the Singapore's reputation by their teachers? No, right? If they were taught, they will support the government. But no, they did not learn that, so now you see that most residents of Singapore are very ignorant about Singapore's reputation and one more thing, the residents are innocent, they did not do anything wrong. A country which might be safe now may not mean that they will be safe in the future. That I agree. But do you think a country which is dangerous now will be dangerous in the future? Hardly, it will take years and years for it to become safe. Saying "Get out of Singapore" is a habit of a average Singaporean. It was never taught by the Government. But I have to agree with one thing, a true Government is a office where the people and the residents of a country are true to one another and cares about their reputation. But "Get out of Singapore" is a habit, you can't reteach them, if not, why do you think Singapore has their own unique language: Singlish? Some other countries have their unique language too. You think the government can reteach their spirit? They can reteach themselves, when they feel like its time to do it themselves. Who says that the Government have a say about it? Other countries can't even have a say about its residents.<br><br>I'll say that if ever our Singapore's reputation goes down, PAP goes down, Chee Siok Chin/Chee Soon Juan take over Singapore, nothing where Sylvia Lim/Low Thia Khiang can do. Not even Chiam See Tong can do anything about it. And there will be the 85% that will not support the reign of these two.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Firstly, as Anti PAP as I am, I do not think Chee is PM or cabinet material, maybe MP. But thats not the point. Many people fear that supporting the actions of Chee (not the SDP directly) will bring about the fall of the Government. Not going to happen folks. Its trying to vote out the incumbent who have engineered elections to give themselves maximum advantage.<br><br>But if reforms were to happen via the ballot box, it will happen in phases.<br><br>1. Opposition gains 1 or 2 GRCs (very possible next GE)<br><br>If the Opposition prove cabable enough.. then<br><br>2. PAP has less than 66% seats but more than 51% (probable GE after next)<br><br>This is the tipping point. This is when PAP really get a run for their money. All parties have an opportunity to prove to the people that they deserve to be in charge. Any party has to get thru this phase first, even before we start talking about SDP being in charge. So SDP in charge is not in danger of happening, not in the near future, but I would personally like to see political reforms in terms in individual rights in Singapore, which is part of what the SDP is propagating. That the Singapore Govt is supressing the voices of the people who disagree with the govt.</div>

A Govt is a product of its citizens and its failings is also a product of the culture's failings. It is not so simple to distinguish the failings of a Govt from its citizens. Nazi Germany did not come about because it came out of no where. It came because people supported it wholesomely and cheered as they went to war. Loyalty to a country whose citizens willing stand by and do not question the Govt's actions and even if they do so but not stop the Govt, the blame rests firmly on its citizens who do not use their brains to think, becomes meaningless. Do not forget that the Govt is staffed by its own citizens and not by foreigners, though some used to be in our case. One might be loyal to only its country yes, but ultimately, it is the duty of the citizenry to think and do something about it. If they don't do a thing about it, but do nothing, what is the difference between loyalty to one's country and his Govt?<br><br>And sadly, as you say, Singaporeans have to relearn their own freedom. But i doubt it would happen unless something seismic in SIngapore happens. By then, reputation is the last thing on our list to care about.<br><br>And by the way, the Govt has given some progress package before years ago under GCK. This isn't the first time Govt doled one of these packages out. And if the Govt were doing something for its citizens, it would have done more than what it is doing right now, profiting from the citizens' monies.</div>

After Lee Hsien Loong started his term, alot of happenings have been around, such as the Progress Package which was implemented by him himself, more and such. And one more thing, most people who founded the Singapore government in the mid 1900s were from other countries like Malaysia and etc.<br><br>Read what he said, he was referring to YOU. And not me, unless he was referring it to me, he was referring to YOU, that you are confusing political loyalty with loyalty to country. If you think that's how a country makes it, why aren't most countries successful in their reputation like not being supportive with the president/prime minister and riots going on? Its already a miracle that Singapore's reputation is quite good in the eyes of the world out there.<br><br>Our government may be using their powers for their own will but don't you think picking on the Singaporean citizens are bad? Do you think they are taught the Singapore's reputation by their teachers? No, right? If they were taught, they will support the government. But no, they did not learn that, so now you see that most residents of Singapore are very ignorant about Singapore's reputation and one more thing, the residents are innocent, they did not do anything wrong. A country which might be safe now may not mean that they will be safe in the future. That I agree. But do you think a country which is dangerous now will be dangerous in the future? Hardly, it will take years and years for it to become safe. Saying "Get out of Singapore" is a habit of a average Singaporean. It was never taught by the Government. But I have to agree with one thing, a true Government is a office where the people and the residents of a country are true to one another and cares about their reputation. But "Get out of Singapore" is a habit, you can't reteach them, if not, why do you think Singapore has their own unique language: Singlish? Some other countries have their unique language too. You think the government can reteach their spirit? They can reteach themselves, when they feel like its time to do it themselves. Who says that the Government have a say about it? Other countries can't even have a say about its residents.<br><br>I'll say that if ever our Singapore's reputation goes down, PAP goes down, Chee Siok Chin/Chee Soon Juan take over Singapore, nothing where Sylvia Lim/Low Thia Khiang can do. Not even Chiam See Tong can do anything about it. And there will be the 85% that will not support the reign of these two.</div></blockquote>oh yes, so you hail lee hsien loong.
