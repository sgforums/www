The latter is not obliged to abdicate and hand the throne to Charles (or William), whereas LKY, when he handed over the Premiership to GCT in 1990, would be expected to fade quietly away into the shadows. THe same would be expected of GCT 2 years ago when he passed the reins to LHL.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>if there ever is a father of singapore, no one's more befitting of that tittle than our LKY.  while it is true that our country has progressed tremendously under his charge, one can't help but wonder if we would have been very much worse off without him.  look at hong kong, taiwan and korea, without LKY we might have ended up like these countries, not ncessarily worse off, just different.  if we look around, where there is a community of hardworking, enterprising individuals, such as penang, there would be relative prosperity even without a supposed legendary leader.<br><br>in any case, i certainly hope that there can be grace on our MM's part to extend his services to the nation with perhaps a token allowance rather than a full salary, like a community service.  after all, his government has in recent years retired many senior officers even before they touched 60.  these people are encouraged to play an active role in community through volunteer work.  perhaps leading by example would be apt?</div>
