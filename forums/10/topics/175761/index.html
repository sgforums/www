I'm sick of hearing what he thinks.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"> Its bad enough having to live with his son running the country. For once I was looking forward to a government that does not have LKY in the picture and here he goes again screaming that he will be contesting the next election too. As they say once you have tasted power its very hard to give up the comfort of it all. Its been nice to see pictures of LKY and the Mrs riding camels in the desert out in the middle east and rubbing shoulders with the rich sheikhs all on the pretext of working. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">  He probably needs to justify that he is working and not have anyone question the exorbitant salary he pulls in on his appointment as a Mentor Minister.  Maybe its time he takes sun set holidays with his wife using his own money and not wasting taxpayers money <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> </div></blockquote>MM Lee has done good for the country, made Spore into a well known<br>financial centre.</div>
