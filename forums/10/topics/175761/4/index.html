            <div class='col-md body'>Creative campus tie-up<br>By Nicholas Fang<br><br>CREATIVE Technology, the Singapore company which produces soundcards used in computers around the world, yesterday joined hands with a Malaysian university, in what is said to be the first tie-up of its kind here.<br><br>The alliance will mean that students of Malacca-based Kolej Universiti Teknikal Kebangsaan Malaysia will be taught in the premises of Cubic Electronics, a wholly owned unit of Creative.<br><br>About half the university's 3,000 technical students are expected to be taught on the premises each day. The arrangement will earn Cubic an undisclosed rental.<br><br>Creative said Cubic staff have also created an industrial training manual for the students, which will be available for use in a training programme from October.<br><br>Creative chairman and chief executive officer Sim Wong Hoo said the alliance will let participants sample the experience of working in a company while still studying.<br><br>He said his company stands to benefit in an intangible way, as students learn and develop their own ideas on industrial design - an important area for Creative. He likened the possible benefits to the gains which Silicon Valley has enjoyed because of its proximity to Stanford University.<br><br>With Creative now branching out into trendier products such as MP3 players, there is a greater need to focus on design and packaging, he said. And this is where the tie-up is expected to help.<br><br>'We need a lot of such talents in the industry... and we are willing and committed to invest in training these talents,' Mr Sim said.<br><br>The tie-up resulted from a space problem the university had. It was operating out of its temporary campus a few kilometres from Cubic's Malacca facility, and a rapid increase in student numbers meant it had to find more space, which Cubic offered to rent at its facility.<br><br>This led to a memorandum of understanding (MOU) between the two parties, said the rector of the university, Datuk Mohamed Ruddin Abdul Ghani. The MOU was signed yesterday.<br><br>Under the terms of the MOU, about 120,000 sq ft at Cubic's Malacca unit will be used to house university lecture halls, laboratories and studios for research and development.<br><br>The university, founded in December 2000, offers courses covering such fields as mechanical engineering, electronics and computer engineering, information and communication technology and research and development.<br><br><strong>When asked why he had not approached Singapore universities to implement a similar programme, Mr Sim said: 'In general, there is a lot more flexibility here in Malaysia.<br><br>There are fewer restrictions here in terms of land use, unlike in Singapore where there are strict rules on what land can be used for.<br><br>'And the Malaysian government has been very willing to accommodate our plans here.</strong><br><br>Mr Sim said that Cubic will now bring forward its second phase of development, which will cost between RM20 million (S$9.2 million) and RM25 million.<br><br></div>

They are a hindrance and barrier<br>to ordinary people like us.<br><br>-----------------------------------------------------<br><br>"Frog3" wrote in message<br>news:KK8CXJAD37298.5179282407@frog.gilgamesh.org...<br><br>Lee Kuan Yew can keep his illusions about a citizenry<br>brutalized by a police state in a bankrupt system turning<br>out to be entrprenuers. Just for the record he openly<br>denigrated Singapore's most successful entreprenuer,<br>Sim Wong Woo when Sim's Creative hit a bad patch about 4<br>years ago.<br><br>Lee believed that his "top talent" could do better.<br>==================================================<br>==<br>I will give u a more interesting story about Sim Wong Woo<br>and the scholars and the government.<br><br>Whe SWW had developed the 8 bit cound card, he came to<br>NCB (National Computer Board, now known as iDA)to explain<br>what he has done and why he needed $ 250K to market this<br>at Comdex ( trade show in the U.S.) The CEO of NCB was<br>Lim Swee Say (current Minister) and the Chairman was<br>Tan Chin Nam (now Perm Sec of MoM).<br><br>Both of them ended up ridiculing him, saying that no one<br>would every want to hear a sound from the PC. And moreover<br>also mentioned that he was just a poly dip holder and thet<br>he needs to develop something for the local market for<br>which NCB would give him assistance. They also shunted him<br>to TDB, which finally ended up giving him a $15K grant to<br>participate.<br><br>SWW went to Walden's office who ended up giving him $800k<br>immediately for an undisclosed stake and the rest as they<br>say is history.<br><br>In 1994 and 1995, after Creative's success, the CEO of<br>NCB ( Ko Keng Hwa, now CEO of EDB) and various other<br>officials tried very hard inviting him to sit on committes,<br>Boards and others. He didnt even return calls.<br><br>In one year when the nomination committee nominated him<br>for the Entreprenuer of the year award (1994, I think) he<br>declined. That year it was given to the Thakral group.<br>Subsequent year, needed a personal persuation from the PM.<br><br>He has considerably mellowed down but I dont think he has<br>forgotton the insult and embarassment.<br>==================================================<br>=======<br><strong>In late 1993, Aztech wanted to do the sound cards and<br>actually hired 2 engineers from Creative. ITI (information<br>Technology Institute) which has now become KRDL and Aztech<br>signed a joint MOU to develop multimedia products. But,<br>their real agenda was to try and reverse engineer Sound<br>Blaster and make a better chip.</strong> After 5 months they did<br>come up with a prototype, but was highly unreliable.<br>Aztech pursued other initiatives and tried to clone<br>SoundBlaster. They infringed several copyrights and lost<br>their case both in singapore and U.S.<br><br>All, I am saying is that if at all there was roadblocks,<br>it was the Government.<br><br>Hence I respect SWH for having been steadfast in his<br>approach. I take my hats of for him<br>==================================================<br>======<br><br>FYI Aztech is a GLC<br></div>
