            <div class='col-md body'>No matter what LKY has done, he is still a founding father of Singapore. We can openly disagree with him, but we shouldn't call him names.<br><br>Having said that, I am am quite disappointed with the elitist attitude of the LKY and the PAP goverment. Singapore was born in a time dearth of talent, it is understandable why they place so much value on talent that time.<br><br>But today Singapore has has changed tremendously,there is more room for people to develop different kind of talents  but we are still stuck with LKY's belief of genetics and IQ theory.<br><br>The result is Singaporeans have developed an Us Vs Them mentality. When the ordinary Koreans speak of the rising samsung or the K-pop wave, they feel that they are a part of it, even though its still a small group of people driving this wave.<br><br>In Singapore, Singaporeans do not feels proud of Singapore's achievement. We are constantly reminded how capable the goverment is, how lucky Singaporeans are, how the most talented are in the goverment - The success of Singapore is their success. They are the "luling class", we are the highly skilled worker class or peasant class. The Plato's republic experiment has turned out really sour for national identity.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>LKY has with the help of men like Dr. Goh Keng Swee, Dr. Toh Chin Chye and Hon Sui Sen succeeded in building the nation's industrialization, and its necessary infrastructure and public housing from the early 1960s to about the beginning or mid 1970s.<br><br>However since 1970s, he had accumulated power through the people and become arrogant about his own invincibility and refused to accept alternative views. He had engaged in too much rhetorics and self-indulged in his own brand of talents, leadership, pragmatism and meritocracy which had produced a top-heavy elitist administration which do not blend with the people.<br><br>He had neglected broad-based education successfully practised by advanced countries like Finland and Switzerland which had maintained high standards of living without all the dropping wages and job losses as has happened for many years since 1997s. Singapore was going downhill lagging behind other developing Asian tigers.<br><br>As a result of practising too much conceptual governance based on rhetorics and assumptions, Singapore has lost its shine and its economy and social progress nose-dived, Hundreds of thousands have since lost their jobs and domestic sector of the economy was ailing.<br><br>Throughout the prolonged recessions from the 1997s to 2002, LKY was seen as helpless and unable to turn around the economy except by blaming the poor economy on the external forces and had failed to produce benefits in job creations or upgrading of the low-based economy.<br><br>He practised tight controls and regulations to snuff out political alternative voices and gerrymandered the election processes to hold himself and his party to perpetual power regardless of the greater good of the nation.<br><br>He had practised high fees and taxes charging some of the highest prices for housing and transportation in the world.<br><br>Despite the major mistakes of his many past policies as posted in the 20 major problems in another thread, he did not do anything concrete to solve problems or was passionate about fighting for the people. Clearly he had retrogressed and was no longer effective in producing results as he did in the 1960s. He charging of the highest full market prices for HDB flats has caused many citizens' losing their retirement CPFs worsen by his charging the highest costs for all basic and essential government services.<br><br>Tried as he did from the 1980s, he was slow in upgrading the economic competitiveness except by persistent taxing and charging for the highest housing and transportation costs etc.<br><br>He had forgotten that leaders should possess the passion to serve for the greatest good of the greatest numbers. He was seen as practising the narrow policies of ensuring his own continuing election successes.<br><br>He seems to be interested only in securing high rewards regardless of the sufering of the people many of whom remain unemployed for long periods despite high educations.<br><br>The domestic sector of the economy has been in the doldrums due to lack of success in restructuring the initial industrialisation model to value-adding and high techology model as other Asian tigers are achieveing.<br><br>Despite the constant feedbacks of the people the leaders are found during recessions to keep increasing all the fees and recovering full costs to create reserves for unessential purposes like the 7 wonders.<br><br>Singapore economy was the last the recover from the last two deep rececessions with property dropping by 40 %. He had lost sight of working for the people and work for them as servants to bring about greatest benefits to the greatest number of citizens who as a result was trapped in serving the world's highest mortgage debts. Despite the prolonged recessions reserves were not put to use except for the government own narrow purposes of spending on image like the 7 wonders.<br><br>The above-stated major mistakes of LKY in his leadership has dented his initial achievements. The biggest mistake is that he had forgotten that it is leader's duty to fight for the greatest number.</div>

WE lost our freedom to VOTE when the GRCs  are here! WE lost our jury system as a check and balance toward the corruption of the whole justice system.
