                                    low-tech city are not unfounded. By Seah Chiang Nee.<br> Jun 14, 2008</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">AFTER 
                                    more than 10 years of building schools, a young friend, 
                                    who is a civil engineer, has put away his hard hat to become 
                                    a teacher in a secondary school.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">It was 
                                    a big career switch for him and a loss to the profession. 
                                    He had graduated from Purdue University, one of the top 
                                    engineering schools in America.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Another 
                                    friend, an electronics engineer, distanced himself from 
                                    his computers and became a professional photographer.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">These 
                                    are two cases that I am personally aware of in the decline 
                                    of a profession that was once considered the cornerstone 
                                    of Singapore’s development.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Many 
                                    engineers have moved into the more profitable financial 
                                    sector or sales and service jobs that are in greater demand.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">It’s 
                                    happening in the legal profession, too. The number of lawyers 
                                    in Singapore has been in gradual but steady decline in the 
                                    last few years.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">“The 
                                    attrition rate of lawyers is high, and the supply is not 
                                    sufficient given the rising demand here,” said a recent 
                                    report.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">This 
                                    professional decline is propelled by globalisation and the 
                                    state’s move into a service economy. It is beginning 
                                    to worry parents who sacrifice much to send their children 
                                    for higher education.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Some 
                                    engineers, I am told, are planning to get on the casino 
                                    bandwagon. Two mega gambling resorts are due to begin operation 
                                    here in 2010.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">With 
                                    more than a million foreigners working here in low-level 
                                    work, this decline is leading Singaporeans to wonder whether 
                                    the city is losing sight of its high-tech strategy.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Retired 
                                    civil servant Ngiam Tong Dow, for one, is worried that the 
                                    country may be heading towards a high cost, low-tech economy 
                                    like London and losing its competitiveness.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Britain’s 
                                    economic decline set in because ‘their best and brightest 
                                    from Oxbridge, instead of going into engineering and running 
                                    factories, went into the (financial) City of London’, 
                                    he said.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">“City 
                                    of London ... they are not creators of wealth, they are 
                                    just shuffling assets around the place,” Ngiam said.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">This 
                                    had allowed the United States to overtake Britain because 
                                    “while some of their best went to Wall Street, their 
                                    best still go into engineering,” he added.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">If Singapore 
                                    were to follow suit “I think we are done for”, 
                                    said the bureaucrat, who helped to pioneer Singapore’s 
                                    economic development</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Recalling 
                                    the 1970s, Ngiam said: “I used to tell everybody, 
                                    what I want is 1,000 engineers, 5,000 technicians from the 
                                    polytechnics, and 10,000 Institute of Technical Education 
                                    workers. ‘You give me that, I grant you a job’.”</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">That 
                                    has worked only too well. At the peak 40% of the university 
                                    graduates were engineers.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Local 
                                    institutions were meeting domestic demand with “a 
                                    steady pipeline of 30,000 engineering and technical manpower 
                                    each year”, a minister said.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">And 
                                    according to the Ministry of Manpower, the engineering-related 
                                    sector still provided the largest number of job vacancies 
                                    over the past two years.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">In 2006, 
                                    a third of the 3,639 top ten professional job vacancies 
                                    were in engineering, it said.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">And 
                                    of the top 50 chief executives in Singapore, a third were 
                                    engineers by training. An official said there are more than 
                                    50,000 practising engineers in Singapore, 50% of whom are 
                                    women.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">It is 
                                    not known how much of these rosy statistics were made up 
                                    of foreigners.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">And 
                                    as casino gambling and tourism catches hold, the profession’s 
                                    future has become cloudier. Singaporeans will likely gravitate 
                                    towards better paying jobs, irrespective of their training.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Interest 
                                    in engineering courses has already been dropping.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Five 
                                    years ago, 30% of the 16,000 polytechnic applicants chose 
                                    engineering as their first-choice course. Last year, only 
                                    about 15% of 18,000 students did so.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Foreigners 
                                    are, however, making up for the drop. One economist said: 
                                    “We may be facing a future where many of the developers 
                                    of technology and their managers will be foreigners.”</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Singapore 
                                    is in transformation and there are few sacred cows that 
                                    cannot be slaughtered.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">This 
                                    means Ngiam has a good reason to worry about the future 
                                    of the engineer.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">In his 
                                    first major speech, new Education Minister Ng Eng Hen said: 
                                    “More education does not necessarily mean more growth, 
                                    as most politicians and economists unthinkingly suppose.”</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">At a 
                                    time when Singapore is planning a fourth university, Ng 
                                    countered the argument that having more universities stimulates 
                                    economic growth,</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Tertiary 
                                    institutions, he said, should maintain a “focus on 
                                    quality”, rather than “expanding education thoughtlessly”.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Some 
                                    economists fear the government may be tempted by quick GDP 
                                    growth at the expense of building on its high-tech strategy 
                                    when it imports such a large number of cheap migrants.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Years 
                                    ago, under different circumstances, Singapore had vowed 
                                    not to allow itself to be addicted – like the Europeans 
                                    – to cheap foreign labour.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">After 
                                    years of strong economic – and population – 
                                    expansion the country is where Europe is, having an army 
                                    of low-skilled workers from abroad.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Nearly 
                                    a million foreigners came, not to mention another 700,000 
                                    permanent residents.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">They 
                                    wait on tables, build our homes, clean our streets and perform 
                                    numerous tasks that keep the country going.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">The 
                                    biggest change, however, is in government strategy, in the 
                                    view of some commentators.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Whatever 
                                    professional skill was needed in the past, the emphasis 
                                    used to be to train Singaporeans.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Today, 
                                    this need has all but gone. Instead to save time and money, 
                                    the government is turning to the world to tap its readily 
                                    available supply of professionals.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">One 
                                    side effect isn’t pretty. While foreigners arrive 
                                    in large numbers, more of Singapore’s homebred talents 
                                    are leaving to settle abroad.</span></p>

              <p><em>i think with globalization it is all the more important to develop the only resource that we have i.e. singaporeans.</em></p>

              <p>Man, this article is hitting a gong in my head. It’s very true. Engineering,
              i can say from my personal experience, is definitely on the decline. I have
              been a student of engineering throughout my life (i still am) and i have
              been in engineering profession for more than 5 years.</p>
              <p>Some of the things i noticed:</p>
              <p>1. Starting salaries are suppressed and have remained the same for the past
              10 years that i know of:  $2700 for a fresh degree grad and $1700 for a
              diploma grad. I don't see the situation improving either as companies (&amp;
              government?) want to keep costs low and keep importing cheap external labor.</p>
              <p>2. The starting salary being paid to degree graduates and Masters Post-graduates
              seems to have lost competitiveness compared to the starting salaries being
              offered in emerging countries like India.
              I know a few students from India
              who completed Masters at NUS being offered only $3000 (what’s more, some of
              them even have 3 years of experience). Some of them have returned immediately
              after graduation, telling me that they can earn better pay back in India.
              I was actually stunned by this. Can't imagine the salary levels here loosing competitiveness
              with some "third world" country. Hopefully the day won’t come when we
              have to benchmark our salaries against someone in "Bangladesh".</p>
              <p>3. There doesn’t seem to be any respect for the engineering profession.
              Everywhere, i read, see and hear about finance and business and such but
              nothing much about engineering. When have you ever seen a successful engineer
              being interviewed in the papers or in the television, when have you seen
              articles highlighting the achievements of engineers and their contribution to
              our society. Once in a while some media attention is given to engineering not
              out of respect but out of propaganda. Heck, even property and insurance agents
              get more coverage and are glamorized than engineers. (no offense to the agents
              though).</p>
              <p>4. As someone mentioned, a lot of engineers are jumping ship. I have always
              been passionate about engineering, i just hope i don’t have to jump ship
              myself.</p>
              <p>5. There was an article mentioning the highest paid engineer, doctor,
              lawyer, accountant etc in Singapore.
              I think it was published in the straits times during the time when the
              ministers were debating about pegging their pay to the industry standard. The
              highest paid engineer was earning something like 25% of what the highest paid
              lawyer or accountant was earning and that engineer was the CEO of ST or some
              big firm. Imagine, the highest paid engineer earns only one fourth of other professions
              and you got to be a CEO for that too. Shows the wide disparity in salary
              levels.</p>
              <p>Of course, what i have mentioned can be debated as someone might have had a
              different experience. But i think, discounting a few exceptional cases,
              whatever i have mentioned holds true for the general engineering population in Singapore.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>from my observation, most of my peers now view engineers are more senior, better paid technicians. it explains for the decline in popularity.</p>
              <p>and why would you want to seek a dull job as an engineer, which offers only a fairly decent salary, not too much, not too little, when you are hearing all around you of bankers and financial managers who are retiring as millionaires in their 40s?</p>
              <p>in other words, there is fewer incentives for people to take up engineering as oppose to less technical vocation such as financial consultants, bankers, etc.</p>
              <p>and it doesn't help much with the current negative trend of employing cheaper foreign engineering "talent", at the expense of local engineers.</p>
              <p>look around, why are so many middle age engineers out of job, since looking at the rate of influx of foreign engineers, singapore is clearly still in need of engineers?</p>

              Can't blame them. Imagine having to work as a quasi-blue collared worker (most type of engineers) for the rest of your life with no hope of retiring due to the pitiful pay and high cost of living.
              
              Can't see what future holds for 60+ year old engineer with white helmet in a dirty or sunny  environment.

              What do sons and daughters of MPs study? Yeo Choo? Tong's daughter? Lee Hsien Loong's son/ children?

              Don't parents want the best for their children?
              
              Do engineers mix with people of lower status (workers)? Can network with powerful people? Feathers of the same type flock together? What type of environment engineers work in as compare to other professionals? Which jobs obsolent fast?
