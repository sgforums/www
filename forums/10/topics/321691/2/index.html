              <p>They have natural resources such as bauxite, coal, iron ore, copper, tin, gold, silver, uranium, nickel, tungsten, mineral sands, lead, zinc, diamonds, natural gas, petroleum. We have no natural resources.</p>

              <p>Ours is  701 km square with population 3.5 million citizens.</p>
              <p>Not to mention, australia has the 4th largest current account deficiet in the world</p>
              <p>Not to mentioned, it is far from asia, in a continent of its own and have no immediate neighbours that offers cheap labour.</p>
              <p>Go figure how they manage their country and why we in singapore have our own limitations. Do compare Apple with Apple and not Apple with Oranges. Not all here are fools or blind to your insidious half truths attempts.</p>
              <p>And don't bother to use Hong Kong please! Their next generation will be communists by 2047 and have no need to build their reserves. They only live for today, and can afford to do so with their budget surpluses for their tomorrow belongs to CCCP.</p>

                                  and up till now the Health Regulatory Authority or Minister remained
                                  unaccountable for those negligence or mistakes committed. Do we have an
                                  independent judiciary after what has been found in Devan Nair suits
                                  which he won in Canada ? Unless you are blind you should be able to see
                                  the prima facie in all the records on NKF parliamentary reports.</span></p>

              <p>Sidetrack:</p>
              <p>Thanks for responding to my previous posting about my problem
                      with ACRA. I must have pushed the wrong button, my whole thread is
                      deleted.</p>
              <p>Anyway, I have replied in another new thread, titled "5 Reasons:
                      ACRA is unfair".</p>
              <p>Thanks.</p>
              <p>I
                  have come across the same problem. It is easy to lose your post if not
                  careful with buttons.</p>
              <p>Your problem with ACRA cannot be solved easily by
                  legality alone. We appear to have two layers of government.</p>
              <p>One
              is legalistic with all civil servants complying with strict rule of law
              irrespective of unfairness created which is beyond the power of civil
              servant to intervene and another is election time law or appeasement.</p>
              <p>That is why we
              need a diary for recording of such cases of injustices and unfairness
              and get all active citizens to put them up on public forums for
              appeasements solutions. </p>

              <p>Go figure how they manage their country and why we in singapore have our own limitations. Do compare Apple with Apple and not Apple with Oranges. Not all here are fools or blind to your insidious half truths attempts.</p>

              <p>Wages in Europe and US would be alot more than Singapore.</p>
              <p>Yes, Australia has GST, but their GST does not apply to basic food items, unlike Singapore which taxes basic necessities like food, approved childcare supplies, educational supplies and medical supplies. Moreover with their GST, they provide free hospital care, the same cannot be said for Singapore which charges an arm or a leg for hospitalisation.</p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Yes, your point of contention has always been natural resources. But do you know how mining industry works? Do you think that the Australian Government is directly involved in the mining and sale of these natural resources? Think again.</span></span></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining">While exploration and mining can sometimes be conducted by individual entrepreneurs or small business, most modern-day mines are large enterprises requiring large amounts of capital to establish. Consequently, the mining sector of the industry is dominated by large, often multinational, mostly publicly-listed companies. See <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Category:Mining companies</span></span> for a list. However, what is referred to as the 'mining industry' is actually two sectors, one specializing in exploration for new resources, the other specializing in mining those resources. The exploration sector is typically made up of individuals and small mineral resource companies dependent on public investment. The mining sector is typically large and multi-national companies sustained by mineral production from their mining operations.</a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining_in_Australia">A number of large multinational mining companies including <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">BHP Billiton</span></span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Newcrest</span></span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Rio Tinto</span></span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Alcoa</span></span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Chalco</span></span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Alcan</span></span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Xstrata</span></span> operate in Australia. There are also a lot of small mining and mineral exploration companies listed on the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Australian Stock Exchange</span></span> (ASX). Overall, the resources sector represents almost 20% of the ASX market by capitalisation, and almost one third of the companies listed. <sup id="cite_ref-year_book_2005_7-0" class="reference"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">[8]</span></span></sup></a></p>
              <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining_in_Australia">Mining contributes about 5.6% of Australia's <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Gross Domestic Product</span></span>. This is up from only 2.6% in 1950, but down from over 10% at the time of federation in 1900. <sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">[9]</span></span></sup> In contrast, mineral exports contribute around 35% of Australia's exports. Australia is the world's largest exporter of coal (35% of international trade), iron ore, lead, diamonds, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">rutile</span></span>, zinc and zirconium, second largest of gold and uranium, and third largest of aluminium. <sup id="cite_ref-Costello_9-0" class="reference"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">[10]</span></span></sup></a></p>
              <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining_in_Australia">Of the developed countries, perhaps only in <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Canada</span></span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Norway</span></span> does mining play as significant a part in the economy; for comparison, in Canada mining represents about 3.6% of the Canadian economy and 32% of exports <sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">[11]</span></span></sup>, and in Norway mining, dominated by petroleum, represents about 19% of GDP and 46% of exports.<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">[12]</span></span></sup> By comparison, in the United States mining represents only about 1.6% of GDP<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">[13]</span></span></sup>.</a></p>
              <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining_in_Australia">Despite its export importance, the mining sector employs only a small proportion of the workforce - roughly 129,000 Australians, representing only about 1.3% of the total labor force <sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">[14]</span></span></sup>.</a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Essentially what the government does is sell the land to these stock exchange listed mining companies and leave the sourcing and procuring of minerals to these private companies. The government gets paid for the lease of the land in the form of either a fixed sum or annual sum, alot like the selling of commercial land in Singapore. The money obtained from the sale or rental of these mines goes into helping the citizens of Australia as claimed by you. But where has the money from the sale of commercial land in Singapore gone. Unless you going to start arguing with me, telling me that these publicly listed companies on the stock exchange gives donation to the Australian government for no apparent reason, that I have nothing else to comment. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></span></strong></span></p>

              <p>Don't understand your one liners telling us the geographical and demographical statistics. If it's accurate I don't dispute it, but it serves no purpose in your argument, other than to add facts to mislead others into thinking that your previous statements are also facts.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Whether you have neighbours that have cheap labour is irrelevant. I don't understand your logic in this statement. Anyway, finished products are not only limited to sale to your close neighbours, these days even grapes produced in South Africa can be imported to Singapore for consumption.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The only difference between Hong Kong and Singapore is that in Hong Kong there is no dynastic succession, even in China the tenure of the President is limited to 2 terms (I think).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If a father can pass his inheritance to his sons and then from sons to grandsons, won't it be more beneficial for a regime to promote dynastic succession.</p>

              <p>Why does this happen?</p>
              <p>Because we do not have a strong opposition voice in parliament.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Why don't we have a strong opposition in parliament?</p>
              <p>Because they suppress opposition candidates, therefore good opposition candidates don't dare to participate in elections.</p>

              <p>In Sun Tzu's Art of War, it is the technique of making an example of another.</p>
              <p><em>Sun Tzu lived in 6th century BC China.  He caught the attention of the emperor who was in the middle of a war.  As a test of Sun Tzu's teachings the emperor gave him 180 of his women to command.  Sun Tzu commanded the women but they did not respond.  They giggled.  Sun Tzu had the emperor's two favorite concubines (who were the generals in this female army) beheaded!  The emperor tried to stop Sun Tzu but he responded that he was given a commission and was entitled to run his army the way he wanted.  The women were beheaded.  The women then did as Sun Tzu bid, marching in formation, etc.  The emperor then dismissed Sun Tzu after this demonstration was over.<br></em></p>
