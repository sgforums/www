              <p> </p>
              <p>you have misjudged the singapore govt. I am a PAP member serving at one of the branches.  What the govt is doing is for the benefit of the citizens of singapore. The figures you have given is right. there is no other govt in the world which spoon feed their population. take for eg china.  The communist govt has not made efforts to erradicate the corruption ot poverty. The govt is fond of many propaganda including Taiwan issue always embarking on taking over the island by force constant threats.</p>
              <p>In dia for eg. None of the politicians are educated and care only for their pockets. the mass of population is isolated.  Poverty,corruption,crimes e.t.c are all on the rise no action is taken the law is not stringent.</p>
              <p>you have to be gifted to live in a safe economy like sigapore and thank the govt for taking care of each and every citizen.  Unlike other countries singaproe do not possess any natural resources to substitute one source for another. 90% of the products are imported from rice, to water, electricity.vegetables e.t.c.   as for your 1st statement.  Taxes is based on your annual income not welfare and subsidies. this so called welfare and subsidies is to cushion singaporeans from the globla warming. Many lower income groups are encountering difficulties in family management., savings e.t.c. at present situation due to rising cost of oil and other products including raw materials everyone living working in singapore is affected so govt provides subsidy to those in need. recently govt announced subsidy of inflation bonus followed by usinons which is providing between $100 to $1000. This includes all singapore citizens and PR. Others not included.  though the govt increased the GST to 7% they are providing some incentive to all singaproeans to survive.  The govt has embarked on foreign investment  to boost the Singapore Economy so the the Deficit is prevalent  everyone is affected by the GST rise bowever it is anticipated over the past 5yrs.  In fact in teh next 10 yrs the economy is expected to grow  and also the cost of living.  No doubt singapore has become more expensive the govt has taken measures to protect its citizens. Nobody is neglected.  the singapore govt is making the right move.</p>

              <p>other participants eat lunch / dinner bento box, RC members eat buffet style with MP.</p>
              <p>although RC chairman or RC member cannot particpate in lucky draw, but participant goodie bag, participant take one, RC members take more than one from balance quantity.</p>

              <p><br>Your reply is very typical of the kind of responses the government has been often giving to people's criticisms of its many wrong policies NKF type of hoarding being only the tip of the iceberg.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This kind of response can be summarized as "Counter-criticism by selective comparisons by quoting worse case scenarios in other countries to diverse from relevant issues"</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Why don't you just reply to the key points in my posts instead of diverting to intentions of government or selectively quoting worse cases elsewhere to avoid answering to relevant issues.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have written to MPs recently of my proposals to review the constitution to avoid GRC type of tweaking of laws to serve incumbent party's own interest, ministerial salary issue, wrongful acquisition of land as seen in the Geylang Land acquired for 20 years without being put to intended public use.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>All that I get is a reply from one MP who merely repeated what the Minister of Law has said that there existed appeal process for hearing of grievances. If Ministers are truly interested to work for the people, who are their real paymasters and not MM or PM, such a thing as MPs speaking up only for establishment or minister's view will not happen.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So you can see that the MPs are no longer bringing up real problems and issues to the parliament and are just merely digits to legitimise the narrow agendas of a few in power which are no longer for the benefits of majority of citizens.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This kind of governing cannot be for the benefits of the people like you mentioned.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Look at how leaders call oppositions lies when ministers are not keeping to their promises as happened in introductions of COE, ERP posted in other threads.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Before the leaders start suing the oppositions or anyone they have to ensure their ministers are keeping to promises as mentioned in other thread. If the ministers cannot then when oppositions start criticising them there is no justification to go to court to sue such people for telling lies.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We need a caring government which will be governing keeping their promises and governing from the larger perspective of serving the reasonable expectations or needs of the people.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Otherwise our leaders do not have the morality to govern the people.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Without morality the rule of laws leaders are always talking about will be empty slogans.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As grassroot people, or Member of PAP, I do hope you will be able to offer some assistance and play a useful role and not be only yes-man to earn your own favors but will bring up real issues and problems to the MPs and seek change.</p>

              <p>DO you think your PAP govt has done their best to help the ppl of singapore during the current uncertain state of the economy and ever rising cost of living and inflation?</p>
              <p>Has the govt the lead to reduce their expenditure or expenditure of the ministeries expenses so that more money can be save and diverted to help the needy.</p>
              <p>you tell me what is the nos of the 60 unions company that benefitted the one time paid off of inflation bonus? 40,000?  maybe 90% of singaporeans dont get any at all.</p>

              <p>Mr  Robert teh,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>you have misjudged the singapore govt. I am a PAP member serving
              at one of the branches.  What the govt is doing is for the
              benefit of the citizens of singapore. The figures you have given is
              right. there is no other govt in the world which spoon feed their
              population. take for eg china.  The communist govt has not
              made efforts to erradicate the corruption ot poverty. The govt is
              fond of many propaganda including Taiwan issue always embarking on
              taking over the island by force constant threats.</p>
              <p>In dia for eg. None of the politicians are educated and care
              only for their pockets. the mass of population is isolated. 
              Poverty,corruption,crimes e.t.c are all on the rise no action is
              taken the law is not stringent.</p>
              <p>you have to be gifted to live in a safe economy like sigapore
              and thank the govt for taking care of each and every citizen. 
              Unlike other countries singaproe do not possess any natural
              resources to substitute one source for another. 90% of the products
              are imported from rice, to water, electricity.vegetables
              e.t.c.   as for your 1st statement.  Taxes is based
              on your annual income not welfare and subsidies. this so called
              welfare and subsidies is to cushion singaporeans from the globla
              warming. Many lower income groups are encountering difficulties in
              family management., savings e.t.c. at present situation due to
              rising cost of oil and other products including raw materials
              everyone living working in singapore is affected so govt provides
              subsidy to those in need. recently govt announced subsidy of
              inflation bonus followed by usinons which is providing between $100
              to $1000. This includes all singapore citizens and PR. Others not
              included.  though the govt increased the GST to 7% they are
              providing some incentive to all singaproeans to survive.  The
              govt has embarked on foreign investment  to boost the
              Singapore Economy so the the Deficit is prevalent  everyone is
              affected by the GST rise bowever it is anticipated over the past
              5yrs.  In fact in teh next 10 yrs the economy is expected to
              grow  and also the cost of living.  No doubt singapore
              has become more expensive the govt has taken measures to protect
              its citizens. Nobody is neglected.  the singapore govt is

              <p>This kind of pro-PAP reply is very much more welcomed than those by DeerHunter and Gazelle. Both of their brainless replies (usually with more brainless insults included) merely serves to turn neutral parties away from the incumbent.</p>
              <p>Being objective, I have to agree that there are quite a number of things that the government has done right. However, there are also a number of unpopular things that the government has done which did not seem to solve the underlying problem. That's not quite all, what's worse is that the incumbent seems to persist in the 'wrong' solution at times.</p>
              <p>The best example is the implementation of the ERP. At the very start, I was very impressed by it, having replaced the 'sticker/coupon' that one has to stick on their car before entering the CBD last time. It was touted as a solution to traffic congestion.</p>
              <p>Yet what do we see now? Traffic congestion remains; imagine driving through CTE at a slow speed and still having to pay ERP, which supposedly should reduce the amount of congestion.</p>
              <p>So what's the solution? Increase ERP charges and increase the number of gantries, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">to the extent of placing gantries in <strong>residential areas</strong></span>. This has been done a number of times. If it didn't work well enough, increase the charges again, or so it seems from what has been done by LTA.</p>
              <p>In addition, I can't imagine how placing a gantry at PIE Kallang Bahru would help when there isn't even much traffic in that road; a gantry there serves to totally remove the alternative route that motorists have if they want to exit (from PIE) to go to ICA building. Sure, one can say that there are time periods in which the gantries are not in operation. Life in Singapore is already filled with enough mental loads, why put on additional mental work to go and find out the different timings in which ERP gantries are in operation? This affects the lives of many Singaporeans, yet the reason why the ERP gantries are located at locations like Kallang Bahru are not even sufficiently provided; no statistics, no reasonings, no survey results before and after ERP implementation being provided to the public.</p>
              <p>The way LTA is handling events is already putting doubts on the abilities of Transport minister Raymond Lim. 'ERP help Singaporeans own more cars',  a statement true by statistics, true by meaning (of the word own, not use), but totally unthinkable and tactless for a minister. Politics is for the people; no matter how successful or good a policy is, you first have to ensure that the people are at peace with your policies and statements. If that is not done well, you can never be a good and popular politician.</p>

              <p>Dear Hunter,</p>
              <p>Before you dismiss any views or opinions posted, please provide your logic and rationale with facts and substance. Dismissing any views and opinions in any posts without any thinking process rationale or logic is part of ignorance reflecting lack of civility.</p>
              <p>Which part of my post or posts are suggesting that I am a paid minister or MP or civil servant holding duties or responsibility to people for which I owe them that duty to demonstrate my personal morality.</p>
              <p>Must CSJ have the morality or pass certain morality test before he questions about the immorality of hoarding public donations in NKF. If ministers or government refuse to instruct their Health Regulatory Authority to check on such wrongful practices, who should be morally upright to do a better job.</p>
              <p>Next you mentioned evidences. Yes we do have the rules of evidences in court and such rules are being followed by citizens. However are such rules of evidences all that meet the eyes. For every piece of wrongful conduct or criminal act, there are hundreds of principles or precedence. Is it enough merely to follow those rules of evidence that suit the party in power to do so as happened in civil libel.</p>
              <p>Obviously the rules of evidences cannot be justly or equitably followed in civil libel. If they are being followed, why was CSJ not allowed the defence of his publication in the public interest. Public interest demands that ministers of government have the duty to disclose honestly with integrity the full facts surrounding NKF hoarding of donations to form 30 years reserve. Ministers have the public duty to tell parliament the truths surrounding the patient subsidy. If these figures were subsequently found to be inaccurate or wrong and CSJ published the article criticising government for causing problems should he not be given the benefit of the doubt as acting in the interest of public by raising relevant queries of ministers' failure to disclose the truths in these instances.</p>
              <p>So rules of evidences were at best partially applied to the benefit only of the government in civil libel. This is wrongful and immoral conduct and should be corrected as soon as possible if we are to evolve into a more open and inclusive society. It is no use for the PM to announce in his inaugural speech in 2004 that he would be building a open and inclusive society when in practice he is going all out to fix the opposition in this manner as he is doing to CSJ and his sister.</p>
              <p>Is the government moral or am I sitting on my own moral high horse when actually I am paid millions but failing to discharge my citizen duty to check on wrong doings of this nature.</p>
              <p>Get your sense of priority right.</p>

              <p>Insinuations by whistle blowers about golden taps and hoarding of public donation monies and over-stating of patient subsidy have all turned out to be factual malpractices as seen in subsequent court case between SPH and NKF. Why didn't the ministers in charge instruct the Health Regulatory Authority to do their jobs and make accurate disclosures of such figures to parliaments in answering to concern raised.</p>
              <p>So please do not insinuate that people are always questioning government mischievously. It is more important for the government go after their own ministers or civil servants who have failed to solve problems pointed out in public concern even without facts if there is a public concern.</p>
              <p>This kind of government is too complacent as realized by MM Lee in recent farcical escape from high security terrorist prison perhaps. Citizens are not liars just because they could not take the complacent ministers or government to task all the way as done in SPH versus NKF which finally spilled the wrongfulness which took many years to put right.</p>
              <p>Don't you think whistle blowers may lack the facts or insider informations but their insinuations utttered may not be insinuations at all but root of evil if not stamped out effectively by hardworking and morally upright governing.</p>
              <p>Many anti-progress and anti-people policies of the past have been posted in this forum. These are real problems which need to be solved. NKF and Mas Selamat are just the tip of the iceberg. The ERP and HDB profiteering problems are big concern of citizens. Other problems are careless investment projects like Shin Corp or UBS which should be addressed at fundamental policy level.</p>
              <p>There should be open and accountable government with more avenues provided  for people to question and check on similar wrongfulness or malpractices in government which may stay hidden for years if not addressed.</p>
              <p>Active citizens and whistle blowers are not anti-progress or anti-government. Let the government shows that it has the high moral ground than pragmatism to solve such problems. Until then only active citizens not the MPs or Ministers can solve the peoblems as MPs and Ministers have now become partitioned to the government and not serving the people as they should be.</p>
              <p>If these active citizens do not care then what will happen? Will ministers willingly open their books and expose wrongfulness or malpractices as seen in Mas Selamat or NKF.</p>
              <p>Get your priority right if you want to have reasonable discussions in this forum.</p>
              <p>Instead of regarding citizens suspiciously as causing problems, government should change its mindset and get them to check on regulatory authority who has often failed to do their job.</p>
              <p>Why not expose wrongfulness and malpractices instead of creating more complacency by protecting all these culprits and cover up real issues and problems.</p>
              <p>If you understand what I am saying in the foregoing then critics here are not insinuating when they are expressing certain concerns which actually may reflect serious deep-rooted problems unsolved due to lack of accountability of government.</p>

              <p>Dear Hunter,</p>
              <p>Before you dismiss any views or opinions posted, please provide your logic and rationale with facts and substance. Dismissing any views and opinions in any posts without any thinking process rationale or logic is part of ignorance reflecting lack of civility.</p>
              <p>Which part of my post or posts are suggesting that I am a paid minister or MP or civil servant holding duties or responsibility to people for which I owe them that duty to demonstrate my personal morality.</p>
              <p>Must CSJ have the morality or pass certain morality test before he questions about the immorality of hoarding public donations in NKF. If ministers or government refuse to instruct their Health Regulatory Authority to check on such wrongful practices, who should be morally upright to do a better job.</p>
              <p>Next you mentioned evidences. Yes we do have the rules of evidences in court and such rules are being followed by citizens. However are such rules of evidences all that meet the eyes. For every piece of wrongful conduct or criminal act, there are hundreds of principles or precedence. Is it enough merely to follow those rules of evidence that suit the party in power to do so as happened in civil libel.</p>
              <p>Obviously the rules of evidences cannot be justly or equitably followed in civil libel. If they are being followed, why was CSJ not allowed the defence of his publication in the public interest. Public interest demands that ministers of government have the duty to disclose honestly with integrity the full facts surrounding NKF hoarding of donations to form 30 years reserve. Ministers have the public duty to tell parliament the truths surrounding the patient subsidy. If these figures were subsequently found to be inaccurate or wrong and CSJ published the article criticising government for causing problems should he not be given the benefit of the doubt as acting in the interest of public by raising relevant queries of ministers' failure to disclose the truths in these instances.</p>
              <p>So rules of evidences were at best partially applied to the benefit only of the government in civil libel. This is wrongful and immoral conduct and should be corrected as soon as possible if we are to evolve into a more open and inclusive society. It is no use for the PM to announce in his inaugural speech in 2004 that he would be building a open and inclusive society when in practice he is going all out to fix the opposition in this manner as he is doing to CSJ and his sister.</p>
              <p>Is the government moral or am I sitting on my own moral high horse when actually I am paid millions but failing to discharge my citizen duty to check on wrong doings of this nature.</p>
              <p>Get your sense of priority right.</p>

I would have suggested you as a monkey in the zoo based on your brain material (or the lack of it) but there are no real monkeys that hold business positions or in finance, thus i have to use a regular company instead.

              <p>If you are less than satisfied with the NFK findings and justice served on the perpetrators in NKF fiasco, then you can always approach your MP to discuss it out in Parliament, if it warrants it. Do not waste Parliament's time, for there are more current and critical issues that needs to be debated there for the rest of our citizens than to satisfy your ignorance.</p>

              <p>Hold on a minute!. CSJ's article did not mentioned anything about 'patient subsidy' as you allege. Why are you adding this? What are you doing? This was the only main thesis:-<span style="font-size: x-small;">It is impossible not to notice the striking resemblance between how the NKF operated and how the PAP runs Singapore"</span></p>

              <p>Why are you so paranoid on pinning down CSJ who is merely fighting for justice and equity for all the apathetic citizens and your own future? You should thank him for his courage and determination to serve like JBJ the public interest. These are truly the heros not the million-dollar ministers or original founders who have taken all the credits and doing nothing much to serve the majority of citizens who are losing their retirements and struggling for survival with all the fees and tax increases as Mah is trying to do now.</p>
              <p>CSJ is not going to take over PM job so fast so stop using all the propagandas to make it look as if he is going to take over. So if he is not going to be the next PM, let us give him leeway to serve the citizens in providing some checks and balances to overzealous taxing and hoarding of monies from the citizens.</p>
              <p>I do not understand why are you worried about his character or mannerism. Do you have a good heart or good moral yourself?</p>
              <p>You mean MM Lee was so perfect you would say that after his passing, future judges will not overrule his utterances in defamation suits against politicians. (Just look at how Mahathir is being exposed)</p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Why are you so paranoid on pinning down CSJ who is merely fighting for justice and equity for all the apathetic citizens and your own future? You should thank him for his courage and determination to serve like JBJ the public interest. These are truly the heros</span></p>
              <p>Hang on! thank him for what?! Courage to be stupid and slander innocent men? Are you out of your mind?!!! Need i thank the drug peddlers too, they certainly did much more than him,  for they give temporary relief to drug abusers, courageously in the face of heavy sentences?!!!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> <span style="color: #ff0000;">not the million-dollar ministers or original founders who have taken all the credits and doing nothing much to serve the majority of citizens</span></p>
              <p>Waittaminute! Doing nothing much? Are we still living in kampongs, mud track roads, old and decrepit schools, non-air con buses spewing fumes as it revs up, walk for miles to get to work, $300/mth salaries, etc?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">who are losing their retirements and struggling for survival with all the fees and tax increases as Mah is trying to do now.</span></p>
              <p>Who should take the blame for increases? Our govt? Do we own any resources? Such faults lies not with the govt, and espacially singapore, who needs to import its goods as we have no resources other than our own.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">CSJ is not going to take over PM job so fast so stop using all the propagandas to make it look as if he is going to take over. So if he is not going to be the next PM, let us give him leeway to serve the citizens in providing some checks and balances to overzealous taxing and hoarding of monies from the citizens.</span></p>
              <p>Balance and checks, yes. But not through slanderings and casting aspersions without a shred of evidence. It will only gridlock our parliamentary system, and waste time/resources when it could have been use to further the welfare of our citizens!</p>
              <p>No propagandas from anyone of us, please. He does it all by himself. Can't blame anyone else for his stupidity he shows to everyone.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">I do not understand why are you worried about his character or mannerism.</span></p>
              <p>Of course i have to be worried about his character. For goodness sake! CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE!! He is preaching anarchy! And for what other purpose but to elevate himself to power?! He can get away or flee to overseas, but ordinary citizens who believe will be the ones to suffer! Hell if i am going to watch my fellow citizens suffer because of his political ambitions through the crooked way!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Do you have a good heart or good moral yourself?</span></p>
              <p>No. I don't have a good heart. I am not perfect. But i am without political ambition. I don't seek to rule over others. CSJ does, and attempts to achieve it by crooked means of breaking our society's laws.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">You mean MM Lee was so perfect you would say that after his passing, future judges will not overrule his utterances in defamation suits against politicians. (Just look at how Mahathir is being exposed)</span></p>
              <p>The future made up of rational persons will be the judge of that. I have my own eyes to see the evidence of him and his capable team's hardwork to elevate the lives of us all, in the past, and espacially in these trying times of which our country has no control, and faith of their capability to ensure our next generation will not go into poverty with the US$300 billion in reserves they and us worked hard to get and manage. I can't say the same for CSJ, other than he would make a good comedian if he wasn't so evil to slander against innocent men to gain power.</p>

              <p>If we go by the rule of laws, laws must be fair and just with rules of evidences applied without such biases. Answer to the most important and crucial point in the whole issue - are the rules of evidence such as right of accused to fair comments and public interests applied by the judge in this latest defamation suit?</p>
              <p>Will NKF wrongdoings as unearthed in the SPH/NKF not something which should have been prevented by the respective Health Regulatory Authority in the first place.</p>
              <p>If the Minister-in-charge has taken action to stop such wrongful practices would CSJ be criticizing the government in the way he has published this case as caused by or attributable to the government.</p>
              <p>Political leaders should be more responsible for mistakes or errors caused by NKF including the wrongful hoarding of public donations and misuse of donations funds for golden taps and awards of contracts to cronies?</p>
              <p>If political leaders simply push aside such problems and sue CSJ out of context for slandering over some other less salient points then they do not have the standing of moral or upright political leaders?</p>
              <p>If you apply slandering in such a biased manner denying CSJ of his right of defence on fair comments and public interest what slandering are you talking about?</p>
              <p>So do not pretend that our rule of evidence or law of libel is so right or fair. Just look at what has happened to his values and judgments after Mahathir left office. Can he say his decisions over many prosecutions of his opponents are right or good for the country as you are trying to make out in the case of MM vs CSJ case just heard in court.</p>
              <p>The juries are still out as far as Singaporeans are concerned. Devan Nair won the case easily against MM in Canada court and this clearly showed that our courts are not as fair and just in political defamation suits against political oppositions back home.</p>
              <p>So what slandering you are talking about when you use the term. Is it in the sense of Canada or kangaroo court.</p>
              <p>Do not try to appear so right or righteous if you have this kind of meaning of slandering.</p>
              <p>For now citizens can judge for themselves. Conduct a poll and see if they will call such persecutions is for slandering rule of law or are just dirty rags.</p>

              <p><br>Don't you make the wrong comparison, salary in UK is also alot higher and there are lots of welfare there. Australia also has high taxes and I did a comparison before. IN Singapore though there are no high taxes but higher charges for electricity tariffs, GST, COE, ERP, property tax, etc. Also you get zero welfare. </p>

              <p>While the government throws away our hard earned money into frivolous acquisition of over-priced companies overseas. The commoners are left with having to pay the price with high levels of inflation, taxes, fees, charges and fines.<br><br>Ever wonder why our wages are so depressed, while citizens from other equivalent GDP per capita economies (e.g. Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, etc) can better afford holidays overseas. Their average wages are at least 3-5 times of Singaporeans <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.jobaroo.com/working-livingandworking.html">(e.g. waiters and retail assistant makes AUD 15 to AUD 25 per hour)</a>. Singaporeans can only contend with 3rd world standard of living in the future, given the government's policy on letting in more 3rd world workers to push down wages.<br><br>The explanation for low wages given by P4P was global competition, seems like competition only applies to Singapore ONLY. But not to countries such as Australia or New Zealand.<br><br>P4P lackeys here complain that some of these countries like Australia, New Zealand, etc have high tax structure. But given their wages, they still make more than the average Singaporeans and could afford more despite their high tax structure. Notwithstanding that they do not need to pay for healthcare and basic education.<br><br>***This comparison is based only on the after tax spending power of low wage earners of both countries. I do not think that we need to compare the after tax spending power of high income earners, because they are still extremely well off after taxes.***<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Singapore:</strong></span><br><br>Income per year: SG$12,000<br>Income Taxes: 0%<br>GST: 7%<br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Spending Power After GST: SG$11,160 [SG$12,000 x 93%]</strong></span><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Australia:</strong></span><br>(waiter or retail staff based on 3 times earnings of Singaporean only, not 5 times which is the higher bound)<br><br>Income per year: AU$36,000<br>Income Taxes: up to AU$6,000 = <span style="text-decoration: underline;">AU$0</span>; AU$6,001 to AU$25,000 = <span style="text-decoration: underline;">AU$2,850</span>; AU$25,001 to AU$36,000 = <span style="text-decoration: underline;">AU$3,300</span><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.ato.gov.au/individuals/content.asp?doc=/content/12333.htm&amp;mnu=5464&amp;mfp=001/002">Australia Personal Tax Rates</a><br>Total Income Taxes: AU$6,150 [AU$ 0 + AU$ 2,850 + AU$ 3,300]<br>Income after Income Taxes: AU$29,850<br>GST: 10%<br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Spending Power After GST: AU$26,865 [AU$29,850 x 90%]</strong></span><br><br>An average waiter in Australia will have a spending power of AU$26,865, while a Singaporeans waiter will have only SG$11,160.
