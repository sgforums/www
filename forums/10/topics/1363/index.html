            <div class='col-md body'>Joe Black, I went to visit the guy who bought the RSAF stash of Hunters last year in Brisbane. He had 2 Hunters, a single and a 2-seat with the sharkmouth, in restoration in his hangar. Great to see them again, I sure miss the distinctive sound of their engines. The local scene is poorer by their absence...<br><br>But its a sad state of affairs in NZ, where the local warbird fraternity has more potential for securing air supremacy over NZ than the RNZAF.<br><br>Well, at least the tre-hugging bitch is happy.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Viper52, lucky you. You must have done some serious travelling around Aussieland. I haven't been to Brisbane. Perhaps now I have 1 more reason to go there....<br><br>Well, in the West, the closest thing I have seen were WWII/WWI platforms. We have got a Spitfire in the Air Force Museum. I think that is also a collector down South (WA) that collects some interesting aircrafts. I have yet seen a jet.<br><br>As for Ms Clarke, I have no respect for her to run a country defence capability down. Wanting peace in your land is not to disarm yourself and play nice, hoping that no one will play rough with you.  Well, perhaps she is just so smart knowing that the<br>"Big brother" Aussie will always come to their rescue....<br><br>Enough said about the pathetic left-wing labour party of hers. I hope she loses this election this time... Have absolutely no sympathy for her...<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hehe, I still haven't travel enough IMO, this is gonna be my final year in Oz, I hope to get a few more places under my belt this year, Uluru/Alice Springs and the Australian War Memorial in Canberra spring to mind....hehe<br><br>BTW a tip off saw me down at Changi to watch the French AF contingent arrive for AA2002. A Mirage 2000, CF-135FR and a Rafale. At least someone is interested enough to send a flying aircraft and not some plywood model.</div>

Coupled with the cost of traveling to WA via the flying rat airlines aka Qantas which I detest, incidentally, I think I'll stick with the East Coast of Down Under    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Yes, it is a pity if the Koreans select the F-15K due to political pressure. Their technical evaluation, according to March AFM puts Rafale first, followed by F-15K and Typhoon respectively.</div>
