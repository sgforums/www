              <p>CSJ's predicament definitely isn't something people should laugh at.</p>

              <p><br>Didn't you hear the beginning of the recording?</p>
              <p>LKY talked about CSJ's bankruptcy, how CSJ barred himself from politics because of bankruptcy. CSJ elaborated to LKY about his tactics of bankrupting oppositions, impressing on him that he has no semblance of principles and morality because he (LKY) does not know the tactics he uses are underhand.</p>
              <p>If you follow CSJ speech through the end, it is hardly the demeanour of a person begging for mercy. There is alot of defiance in his voice, if you hear the first recording to the fifth, hardly the demeanour of a person begging for mercy like some sycophants and propagandist here would claim.</p>

              <p><br>Perhaps my English is bad. But the issue here isn't about English, it's about facts of the case.</p>
              <p>I based my discussion on the facts, not on conjectures like you (I think he was begging for mercy when he said that). But when I asked you whereabout did he unequivocally beg for mercy, you couldn't provide anything. It's all based on your subjective interpretation, in other words guessing. Another fact not to be overlooked, throughout his five recordings, he was defiant thoughout. None of the speculation by your claiming that he was sombre and apologetic as if asking for mercy.</p>
              <p>You mean a person cannot elaborate his case to show how vile a dictator could be? If I explain my case showing my predicament to a foe, does not mean I am asking for mercy, perhaps to show him how wicked and vile he is.</p>
              <p>I guess the story with you is not a simple case of lack of understanding of the English language, your case is more profound and pervasive.</p>

              <p><br>Firstly LKY and GCT are not normal people like you and me. If you strongly believe in your opinion that someone was a dictator and tyrant, would you grant him a degree of courtesy. Would you give respect and courtesy to Hitler or our Japanese tormentors during WW2?</p>
              <p>Your point about him insulting and name calling is not exactly one sided. Have you not seen LKY call James Gomez a liar and the other names he calls his other political opponents. Why not exact the same standard to your idol, instead of taking a one sided LKY always right view.</p>
              <p>If you had heard all the recording, if you have the mental rigour, you would find that,</p>
              <p>1) his demeanour from recording 1 to recording 5 was not that of someone asking for mercy or forgiveness.</p>
              <p>2) if you had heard the beginning of the recording where LKY sniggered, you will also have noticed that the discussion about bankruptcy came about when LKY said he silenced himself (CSJ) politically by being bankrupt. He then proceeded to show the court how wicked LKY was by elaborating the consequence of his bankruptcy.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If he was indeed apologetic and asking for mercy, his voice from either beginning or end would have been submissive, but no such submissive attitude happened.</p>
              <p>After you lost your case about CSJ asking for mercy from LKY, you are side stepping to asking for sympathy from the public. What sympathy could the public accord him? He was made bankrupt by LKY and his children are affected. What manner of sympathy does he want the public to accord him?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You are not blunt, just subjective in your interpretations.</p>

              <p>Some feebled minded individuals are extremely susceptible to brainwashing by P4P propaganda, if someone controls the newspaper you read, the news on tv you watch and the kind of programmes you watch, that person can brainwash you into believing anything.</p>
              <p>Media is an extremely powerful tool.</p>
              <p>If they put on the news that a man actually walked on Mars, I wonder how many would believed it.</p>
              <p>To prevent ourselves from being brainwashed by government propaganda, we have to be mindful of the news that's being fed to us. Always be objective in your analysis, based your opinions on only the facts of the case and not on guesses.</p>

              <p>Shotgun,</p>
              <p>Do you believe that our media (newspaper &amp; TV) are free from P4P propaganda?</p>
              <p>It would seem that you have been affected by the P4P propaganda, because you are prejudicial to CSJ even before hearing the recording from part 1 to 5. You were emotional about him rather than looking at the facts and providing a rational response. You based your analysis on guessing what his intentions were, rather than basing it on the facts in the recordings.</p>
              <p>You are only a sad victim of political propaganda.</p>

              <p><br> If you had listened to the recording objectively, the snigger came
              directly after CSJ mentioned his children. Not much before and not

              not justify humour. Moreover like I said, a snigger is not humour,
              it's more like a mock in a disrespectful way. Kind of like I had

              <p>Before we judge, i would like to remind ALL here of certain facts.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1. A law had been broken over this alleged recording. Transcripts are allowed and must be obtained from the court, to help in a trial for lawyers on both sides, but it is illegal to broadcast it in public, without authorisation or permission, if it would even be possible.</p>
              <p>The case with CSJ and the Lees no doubt is an open court, with public audiences and media present, but privacy must be respected and as such, private recordings or video-recordings are not allowed, save those by the court for its use to judge or review a case.</p>
              <p>That this recording had been made public, - the law had been brokened.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. The authorities are now investigating the case of this recording, as who were the one/ones who made such recordings and broke the law, or even using these disputed recordings to judge or to push their own agendas.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3. Now that the alleged recording had been made public, can or dare anyone vouch for its authenticity? With easy software, Osama can be made to say he is a Jew and Bush admit he is a closet gay. Was the alleged snigger original or was it edited in? Had anyone of you here thought about its authenticity?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thus, it behooves everyone to be careful when dealing with court's evidences illegally made public, more so from a person of dubious character known as the TS here.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Let it be known that now you are aware. Irregardless if you want to turn a deaf ear to it, you are fully responsible for your own actions and do not hope to pass the buck to someone else. You are dealing with illegal material, worse still, it concerns our head of State. </p>

              <p>Aren't you digging for lame reasons to defend him? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>For your second lame attempt to absolve him, if you hear the recording, it's hardly irrelevant, as he was just elaborating his plight to LKY showing the courts how evil he was.</p>
              <p>Thinking of old jokes, when CSJ was telling him his plight? Does the old man have an ounce of compassion in him? Or you telling us that he has a warped sense of humour when a case of importance is ongoing. It's like going to the International Courts of Justice, during the presentaion of Malaysian's case about the claim to Pedra Branca, you snigger at them. How insolent do you think that is?</p>
              <p>Like you said, since we are not him, we should not try to think what he was thinking. We should just look at the sequence of events that occured impartially that led him to snigger, which was when CSJ mentioned him being a bankrupt and having the responsibility to take care of his 3 children. Essentially a snigger is different from a laugh, if you had the distinction to be impartial, a snigger is a mocking at your foe in an extremely disrespectful way. Perhaps he can be respectful, because he has the utmost rights in the courts.</p>
              <p>All I ask is that all the P4P supporters stop idolising him, look at the facts of the case and not be swayed by the strong feelings of admiration you have for the old man.</p>

              <p>Before we judge, i would like to remind ALL here of certain facts.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1. A law had been broken over this alleged recording. Transcripts are allowed and must be obtained from the court, to help in a trial for lawyers on both sides, but it is illegal to broadcast it in public, without authorisation or permission, if it would even be possible.</p>
              <p>The case with CSJ and the Lees no doubt is an open court, with public audiences and media present, but privacy must be respected and as such, private recordings or video-recordings are not allowed, save those by the court for its use to judge or review a case.</p>
              <p>That this recording had been made public, - the law had been brokened.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. The authorities are now investigating the case of this recording, as who were the one/ones who made such recordings and broke the law, or even using these disputed recordings to judge or to push their own agendas.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3. Now that the alleged recording had been made public, can or dare anyone vouch for its authenticity? With easy software, Osama can be made to say he is a Jew and Bush admit he is a closet gay. Was the alleged snigger original or was it edited in? Had anyone of you here thought about its authenticity?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thus, it behooves everyone to be careful when dealing with court's evidences illegally made public, more so from a person of dubious character known as the TS here.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Let it be known that now you are aware. Irregardless if you want to turn a deaf ear to it, you are fully responsible for your own actions and do not hope to pass the buck to someone else. You are dealing with illegal material, worse still, it concerns our head of State. </p>

              <p><br>1) Which law is that? Maybe you can point out the particular act? Or is this the case where something incriminating that has put LKY in a very bad light leaked out and the police are digging through the acts to find ways and means to incriminate the Chees again.</p>
              <p>2) First of all, if was just a normal court case, there is nothing to be alarmed about, unless something abnormal happened that would put certain litigants in a very bad light. Then that particular litigant would feel that something has to be done to restrict the recordings to prevent the public from finding out the truth.</p>
              <p>3) If it was fake, then LKY can sue again for defamation, but if he doesn't then the tape would be authentic and truthful.</p>

              <p>no..this is not dynastic China..this is dynastic sg. where have u been for the past 40+ years??</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>if CSJ is bankrupt, and there is a donation drive..i will not donate to him..but to his children. hes bankrupt, but he can still find a job. apply for welfare and such using his right as a sg citizen.</p>

              <p><br>Frankly I am neutral towards CSJ, I neither support him or against him.</p>
              <p>But his courage to stand up against an authoritarian is indeed admirable, though they are sometimes in extremes.</p>
              <p>Like most misinformed said, he has selfish intentions and he is doing all this for his own benefits. What benefits has he derived? Being thrown in jail? Being made a bankrupt? If it was anybody else, wouldn't it have been more beneficial to migrate to another country as a political immigrant and start anew for his family. What's his reason for staying? Because he likes to be imprisoned?</p>

              <p>If it was me, I would have long migrated to Australia or US as a political asylum seeker. It would have been more beneficial for me and my family. Why stay in Singapore to continue to be persecuted by a distorted system?</p>
