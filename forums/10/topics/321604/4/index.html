              <p>Kinda ironic, if that happens and he makes political comments about Singapore, he will be discredited by LKY saying that he is not a Singapore citizen and should not participate in Singapore politics. But when he is Singapore citizen participating in opposition politics, he was persecuted to the extremes. A Catch-22 scenario, every which way but lose.</p>

              <p><br>Yes it would have been easier to just walk away to think about his self interest if one was selfish. Why didn't he just walk away? I would have emigrated, walking away, staying in Singapore would mean he is still a bankrupt, it's not a clean slate.</p>
              <p>I think you have misunderstood, he didn't claim that LKY sniggered, it was me that heard CSJ's 5 recordings and the snigger at the mention of his plight. Throughout some parts of the recording, there wasn't even any chance for CSJ to pose any question. He would be struck down by the Judge and Plaintiff's lawyer before he even got to half of his question.</p>
              <p>In all fairness, if you are a judge presiding in a civil case, can you strike off the defendant without the plaintiff raising an objection? I could have sworn in some of the questioning, before the question was even posed, the presiding judge struck him down even without the prosecution raising an objection. </p>

              <p>Lets get tis straight... the case is about him slandering LKY and instead of defending himself by claiming he did not slander, he tell people how evil LKY is. And u say tat is relevant ? </p>
              <p>I think the joke is, his statement had confessed he did slander LKY, and he did it for personal reason. (Because he is an evil person and his kids r having a tough time because of it)</p>
