              <p>I am not sure whether LKY gave a snickering laugh to CSJ during questioning, CSJ was telling LKY that he (CSJ) has 3 kids and the old man gave him a snickering laugh.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>CSJ: You don't know what it means to be a bankrupt, I have 3 young children to take care of.</p>

I sometimes see it as a sign of brushing off his nervousness or tension, actually. Also to a certain extent, I think its because he is very old and senior now, sometimes old people are like that, more easy-going and laugh on seemingly trivial things.</p>
              <p>I think u know what I mean.</p>
              <p>But what I am saying is not meant to 'softbrush' LKY image. LKY is still a type A manager, very blunt and direct. His type is like the Simon judge in American Idol, very similar. So I am not contesting the general idea that LKY is an 'authoritarian', I would agree with this description fully, but Im just saying on this particular one, I think u misunderstood/ read too much into it.</p>

              <p>As long as we are human beings we are not perfect. We sin and make mistakes. The only way for human beings to behave is to serve his fellow men and repent for his sins and pray to God for forgiveness.</p>
              <p>If someone calls another a liar and not knowing that he is himself a human being and liable to sins and mistakes himself, he cannot go very far with fellow human beings nor with God.</p>
              <p>So it is repugnant to hear someone snigger at the lower intellect or social status of another even if he is rich or higher in social status. Such a person who ever "kou yen kan len tee" will meet his downfall.</p>

              <p>The snigger did not come immediately after bankrupt, if you listen to the tape, there was a long delay between bankrupt and 3 children to take care of.</p>
              <p>The snigger came right after CSJ mentioned he has 3 children to take care of. Perhaps LKY finds a dastardly amusement that a bankrupt person still has to take care of his 3 children. Unless you are telling me that LKY is retarded, so much so that his response was delayed to that of a retard.</p>

              <p><br>So you are telling us that it's his personality to snigger at the plight of a bankrupt man facing the the fatherly responsibility of taking care of his children?</p>
              <p>Personality or mannerism, you have to based his actions on the stimulus. The stimulus was CSJ stated that he was a bankrupt facing the responsibility of looking after his 3 children. Do you find the slightest humour in that? Only a social deviant devoid of integrity would find that amusing.</p>
              <p>It wasn't even a question that CSJ posed to LKY, he was making a statement. How could LKY feel tensed? LKY with his power and standing in the government feel tensed? You have to be kidding me. Even the judge has to play second fiddle to him. It's more like you trying to find the slightest reason to dispel the belief that he is indeed an extremely wicked old man. Wickedness seemed to have matured in him like an aged mellowed wine.</p>
              <p>I am not offended if he sniggered at CSJ, but sniggering at the plight of young innocent children being taken care of by their bankrupt daddy. That's beyond my principles as a member of society.</p>
