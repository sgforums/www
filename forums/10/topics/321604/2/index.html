              <p>Getting sensitive, aren't we?<br><br>LKY might not have been laughing at the kids; he was perhaps laughing at CSJ playing the pity card after dragging himself and his family into that situation through his own wilfulness.</p>

              <p><br>Sensitive? No, not really. It's just moral standards which we abide by in ourselves to discern what is evil and good, and to voice out our views when we find that injustice or wickedness has transpired. Sniggering at CSJ is alright, but sniggering at the plight of CSJ's children is declasse and evil.</p>
              <p>So you find that CSJ through his wilfulness, dragging himself and his family into that situation funny?</p>
              <p>Personally I don't find it funny or amusing.</p>
              <p>Perhaps you have the same "humour" like LKY.</p>
              <p>It's no laughing matter if someone through his own wilfulness, while speeding in his car, lands himself, his wife and his young children in permanent physical disability.</p>
              <p>Would you find a similar case like this funny too?</p>
              <p>To each his own, you might have an extremely warped sense of humour like LKY.</p>
              <p>The gravity and severity of CSJ's childrens plight does not warrant humour in any perspective, save the devil.</p>

              <p>Perhaps you have the same wickedness as him in your mentality.</p>
              <p>When CSJ was relating the case about him being a bankrupt and the responsibility of fatherhood. You interpret it as an act to gain sympathy from LKY? Do you think that LKY would give sympathy to his political opponents?</p>
              <p>I wouldn't say that CSJ was all about democracy, perhaps he has a personal vendetta against the Lees after being victimised by them. That I wouldn't know, because I don't read mind like you.</p>
              <p>Why has CSJ not backed down then so that he could provide for his children? Aren't you contradicting yourself by first hinting that he is not so noble and he has selfish objectives, then stick a foot in your mouth by saying that if he was selfish he should back down and go somewhere, to which he hasn't. So is he noble or selfish?</p>
              <p>If it was me behaving in a selfish way, I perhaps would have taken the easy way out, moved to another country to satisfy my family and my self interest, rather than stay in Singapore to be victimised by LKY. Maybe he has a sense of righteousness in him afterall.</p>

              <p>Man walks on the street, trips on a banana peel, lands on his head, bleeds to death. You find it amusing? It might seem funny initially, but the final predicament does not justify any humour, just as CSJ need to look after his children despite his financial distress. A snicker isn't even humour in it's most misunderstood definition, a snicker is to mock at someone in an extremely disrespectful way. Something totally unbecoming of a great leader.</p>

              <p><br>If you had listened to the recording objectively, the snigger came directly after CSJ mentioned his children. Not much before and not much after. It's like me slapping you and you crying out in pain 10 seconds later. Look at it objectively, when did the snigger occured?</p>
              <p>Like I said, there isn't a perfect analogy to follow this perfectly. But the main idea is still, CSJ final predicament does not justify humour. Moreover like I said, a snigger is not humour, it's more like a mock in a disrespectful way. Kind of like I had the upper hand, you went against me, now you suffer the consequences.</p>
              <p>Same can be said about you, your blind exaltation of LKY is extremely admirable, much like the devotion of my pet dogs to me.</p>

              <p><br>If your English is that bad, maybe you should re-think about posting here.</p>
              <p>In SIMPLE english, don't bring up your bankrupt and 3 poor children unless you're ready to throw in the towel and BEG for a way out.</p>
              <p>If you're not surrendering, talk so much about your poor children for what?</p>
              <p>So, if CSJ surrendered and ASKED to be given a way out for his family, and LKY laughed, I would join in to say that LKY has a very bad sense humor as well!</p>

              <p>I'm laughing because the way I see it, some twit called me out
              into the ring.  Throws weak punches at me, and I give him a
              good thumping.</p>
              <p>In the middle of the match, he asks' me to consider his poor
              family, but doesn't surrender.  Most of you who think that LKY
              is being heartless probably has never gotten into a fight
              before.</p>
              <p>You either ask for mercy after you surrender, or you carry on
              fighting without regards of how bad you get beaten up.</p>

              <p>A bankrupt is politically powerless.  He cannot garner influence or support from the people who can really make a difference.</p>
              <p>Politics is about power, and power is about distribution of wealth.  No wealth, no power.</p>
              <p>Knowing that LKY is a hard man, he repeatedly charge himself at him, and ended up bankrupt.  I've seen for myself how tactless he can be when dealing with people in power. "Eh, Goh! Come Here! I Want to talk to you!" </p>
