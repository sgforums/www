            <div class='col-md body'>Nov 12, 2004<br>They come for money but stay for the life<br>By Bryan Lee<br><br>ENGINEER Raghavan Surianarayanan's salary shot up by 10 times when he left Chennai to take up a job in Singapore.<br><br>Married with one child and another on the way, he was earning about $400 a month after seven years in his first job, in an Indian engineering consultancy.<br>The prospect of better pay made him consider working abroad, then in 1993 he spotted a newspaper advertisement for a job in Singapore, and applied.<br>'The cost of living may be lower in India, but the savings potential was good in Singapore,' he said.<br><br>He got the job as a service engineer in a marine engineering company here. Despite his wife being pregnant with their second child, he took up the offer and moved. His family joined him a year later.<br><br>Now, 11 years on, Singapore is home. At 41, he is a project manager in Japanese industrial automation giant Yokogawa Electric.<br><br>His company, which has an engineering force of about 400 now, announced a huge expansion earlier this year, with plans to add 2,000 engineers over the next six years in the fields of software, chemicals and electronics.<br><br>It expects to pay at least US$100 million (S$166 million) for the new talent needed to establish its first software development centre outside Japan and strengthen its team of consultants for industrial automation projects worldwide.<br><br>Like other companies recruiting for the expanding manufacturing and research and development (R&amp;D) sectors, Yokogawa will employ Singaporeans.<br>But it will also look for talent from India, China and the West. In R&amp;D, bringing together diverse talent is highly valued.<br><br>Since Mr Surianarayanan's arrival, many more foreigners have come - some to take up jobs like he did, others to study first and then work.<br><br>Mr George Cui, 33, from Dalian in China, and Miss Deepthi Cannot distribute vertically Prabhakar, 22, from Bangalore in India, <span style="color: red;"><strong>made their way here on Singapore government scholarships and education grants.</strong></span>Mr Cui did his master's degree at the National University of Singapore and now heads a division of more than 40 staff at Yokogawa.<br><br>'I wanted to get the best education before going to work. While I would have been able to do my master's in China, I wanted to try something different, to go to a different country.<br><br>'Singapore has a good environment to associate and communicate with people of different cultures,' he said.<br><br>Miss Deepthi graduated with a bachelor's degree from Nanyang Technological University last year and now helps to design mobile phone software for Motorola's R&amp;D centre.<br><br>She left home in 1999. 'People where I come from have the notion that once you get to Singapore, it is easier to get to other developed countries. There are many multinational companies in Singapore, so there are many good career opportunities here.'<br><br>Indeed, from operating assembly lines which merely needed lots of cheap unskilled workers, companies are now engaged in much higher-level activities, such as R&amp;D and project consulting, as well as regional or even global headquarter functions.<br><br>'There is a shift towards high value manufacturing. This creates jobs at all levels: from researchers and engineering professionals to production workers,' says Economic Development Board resource development division director Lee Ying Adams.<br><br>But what is also clear, says Mrs Adams, is the growing skills profile of the workforce. Whereas in 1994 just 46 per cent of manufacturing jobs required minimal Institute of Technical Education qualifications, that proportion swelled to 76 per cent last year.<br><br>Dr Tony Lee, who heads Yokogawa's operations here and in the region, said: 'Singapore's manufacturing sector has been moving up the value chain. Naturally, the need for engineers has grown.'<br><br>While he would like to employ Singaporeans as far as possible, he said there just is not enough local talent with the right skills and experience.<br>Motorola Singapore president Jeffery Tan said: 'Singapore's tight labour market in the higher-end of the spectrum of engineering skills creates opportunity for foreigners with relevant expertise.'<br><br>About 40 per cent of Motorola's 700-strong engineering team is made up of non-Singaporeans.<br><br>Beyond just making the numbers, companies say workplace diversity is another reason for recruiting abroad.<br><br>This, they say, is good for innovation and is a natural result of the increasingly regional and global perspective of manufacturers in Singapore.<br><br>Indeed, for Taiwan-based MediaTek, the world's No. 6 chip designer, the decision to set up a $50 million R&amp;D centre here was spurred in part by Singapore's 'good living environment', said chairman Tsai Ming Kai in September.<br><br>The Republic's cosmopolitan setting, he said, would help the firm recruit from the best talent in the world.<br><br>Its Ayer Rajah facility, set up in June, will focus on developing chips for wireless communication and digital consumer products, and needs 300 engineers. Aside from Singaporeans, it expects to bring in talent from China, India, Europe and the United States.<br><br>Also announcing plans to recruit highly-skilled staff in a big way this year was Dutch electronics giant Philips, which announced in August that it needed 200 more people for its product development centre in Toa Payoh.<br><br>It wanted product managers, design engineers and software engineers with at least four years' experience, and was prepared to pay between $4,000 and $10,000 a month.<br><br>While many will come for the jobs and the attraction of living and working away from home, some end up staying long enough to become permanent residents or even citizens.<br><br>Mr Surianarayanan, who became a citizen last year, counts the reasons why: good government, well-run public institutions, racial harmony and a generally clean and safe living environment.<br><br>He left home for a better-paying job, but found professional satisfaction and a good place to raise his daughters, aged 11 and 13, as well.<br>They are benefiting from the good education system here and are being exposed to people from other cultures.<br><br>China-born Mr Cui, who recently rejected an offer of a well-paying job in Shanghai, became a Singaporean citizen last year.<br><br>Married with a four-year-old son, he said: 'This is a place where I can have more exposure and develop my career.<br><br>'But money is not the only issue. We have a good life in Singapore.'<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Kao! I can understand if doors were opened for FTs with expertise that Singaporeans do not have or to cover manpower shortages, but to go to the extent of giving government scholarships??? Singa_poor_reans too rich to accept scholoarships, not enough talent or are 3rd class citizens cannot fill the places meh?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Nov 12, 2004<br>Tougher rules may cull half of today's financial advisers<br>Up to 6,000 may be cast out in 5 years as standards grow more rigorous<br>By Grace Ng<br><br>THE number of financial advisers (FAs) here may halve over the next five years, as increasingly exacting standards and stricter regulations weed out 4,000 to 6,000 who do not make the cut.<br><br>This prediction was made by the chairman of homegrown IPP Financial Advisers, Mr Wee Tiong Howe, during a recent financial conference here, at which he addressed a panel discussion on the topic, Reshuffling The Industry: What Entails The Making Of Major Players Beyond 2004?<br><br>Not mincing words, he declared: 'In 1998, there were about 20,000 FAs. This has plummeted to 12,000, of which about 40 to 50 per cent are not competent enough to make a living in this profession.'<br><br>He added that with the increasingly high standards being imposed on FAs, only those who qualify 'will survive in the next five years'.<br><br>He was referring to the more stringent academic qualifications required of licensed FAs, and the examinations they must pass, under the Financial Advisers Act (FAA).<br><br>As well, independent FA firms are increasingly asking for an array of professional degrees when they recruit, preferring candidates who are Certified Financial Planners (CFPs) and Chartered Financial Consultants (ChFCs).<br><br>A check with some local insurance companies and independent FAs showed that while they did not expect a dramatic change in the number of FAs at their own firms, they largely agreed with Mr Wee on the changes taking place.<br>The trend to consolidate has been under way for some time and is now picking up pace, forcing the FAs left on the playing field to adhere to higher standards, they said.<br><br>The chief executive and director of AXA Financial Services Singapore, Mr Gary Harvey, said 'professionalism will be the first natural selection process, as clients become more sophisticated and margins are squeezed with more competition'.<br><br>The managing director of UOB Life Assurance, Mr Raymond Kwok - who also heads the Life Insurance Association - said 'a shakeout in the industry is likely', especially with the tightening of regulations governing FAs in recent years, such as the FAA, which came into effect two years ago.<br><br>NTUC Income chief executive Tan Kin Lian said 200 insurance advisers have left the company in the past nine months because they were unable to meet stipulated requirements in terms of training - 30 hours - and sales quotas.<br>He expects the company to maintain its current number of 2,500 FAs over the next few years. He said: 'We expect at least 50 per cent of our advisers to be working full time by 2005, and their competency and productivity will improve.<br>'We also aim to achieve a 15 per cent market share within the next five years, and possibly reach 20 per cent.'<br><br>Mr Aaron Koh, the chief operating officer of independent FA firm Providend, said he expects this accelerating industry consolidation to favour the independent model of financial advice.<br><br>This model will come into play as customers increasingly demand impartial financial advice - from advisers who are not burdened by conflicts of interest that might arise when they receive fees and sales for pushing their own firm's products.<br><br>'Consumers will demand unbundling of insurance and investment products to achieve maximum flexibility and transparency, and will prefer to pay an adviser on a retainer basis rather than upfront product commissions,' predicted Mr Koh.<br></div>
