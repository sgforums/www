              Very often whenever we air criticisms about cronyism and legalistic use of power by our ministers to take monies from taxpayers immorality through their political power, we are countered by many allegations that our leaders in other countries are taking monies under the table or receiving kick-backs without proofs of such allegations.
              
              Of course there is a need to understand that no one is perfect and everyone will have some skeletons in the cupboard. It is also necessary to recognize that as long as leaders award a project to companies known or acquainted to them with accountability and transparency and for national good there is no need to go overboard in questioning any one particular government or leader.
              
              No country is perfect and premier Wen whom we respect for servant-leadership is also not perfect and he will be subjected to scrutiny by his own people.
              
              However our leaders often use propaganda of covert corruption below the table in other countries to defend their own legalistic tweaking of laws to do things for their own glories and for their own taking of monies by claiming to be corruption-free and continue with their hypocrisy tweaking and taking.
              
              Which is worse kind of corruption - covert corruption or legalistic tweaking and taking of public monies without morality through hypocrisy and power.
              
              Until we solve this problem in principle, our leaders will only continue to use their power of number in parliament to pass all laws to get what they want so as to look legal but actually what they did was immoral and wrong with no one able to stop them from taking monies for themselves now.
              
              Let us examine the system and not fall into any propaganda trap previously laid down for us citizens - by accusing leaders of other countries for awards of tenders to their cronies while they are taking their monies for themselves immorality by legalistic tweaking of power.
              
              So we should not just believe in propaganda-type of allegations against other countries we praise or hold up as good leaders e.g. postings of some forumers that Premier Wen is also guilty of nepotism or covert kick-back too fast just because of such past propaganda by our newspapers against good leaders we are admiring to carry on their own legal tweaking or taking of monies through power.
              
              The fact is with this sort of propaganda against other countries our leaders continue to try to justify their legal tweaking and taking for their own benefit. 
              
              This is the systemic problem and hypocrisy affecting our people which we should look at and address not by pointing out that other leaders or countries are worse with stereotyped allegations against them to avoid our systemic legal tweaking and hypocrisy to persist in wrong and immoral governing.
              
              When Wen and Hu are running a big country on a tight schedule we can expect them to encounter jealousy from many gangs within against their award of contracts to companies they are acquainted with or encouraging to grow as part of nationalism or national assets or part of the larger economic plan for the country in order to succeed in overall plan.
              
              If Wen is not awarding contracts to his cronies for his own benefits but for the nation's benefits then there is nothing to worry about. Let the jealous people accuse them and rumour fall flat without suing every one of their last possessions.
              
              It is necessary to differentiate between covert corruption in other countries and legalistic tweaking of laws and power to get what are immoral by our leaders as seen in taking of taxpayers' monies by immoral and wrongful comparisons and all the immorality as found in Shin Corp and NKF.
