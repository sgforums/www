In order to provide affordable housing to Singaporean families, new HDB flats are priced below their equivalent market values. In this way, new flat buyers can enjoy a substantial subsidy. This point has been explained in Parliament and reported in the media on many occasions.<br><br>As resale prices move up, so do new flat prices. Similarly, when resale prices move down, as happened during the property market downturn in recent years, the prices of new HDB flats were also reduced significantly.<br><br>By selling new flats with a market subsidy, HDB has been unable to recover the development cost of new flats. HDB has incurred an average deficit of $457 million a year in its home ownership programme in the last five years. These figures are reported in HDBÂ’s audited financial statements, which are available to the public.<br><br>HDB periodically reviews its building programme, and makes adjustments to respond to and anticipate changing market conditions. With the increased demand for new HDB flats, HDB is gradually stepping up its building programme to ensure a steady flow of public housing supply to meet the needs of present and future generations of Singaporean families.<br><br>Kee Lay Cheng (Ms)<br>Deputy Director (Marketing &amp; Projects)<br>For Director (Estate Administration &amp; Property)<br>Housing &amp; Development Board</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>if its cheaper than what you would pay for a resale flat..then its a subsidy. It's never based on cost of flat. The price of the flat would be somewhere 5-6 times salary. This is old news, came out in a paper more than a decade ago.

However to my mind, this accounts only reflect the interest incomes when are extra profits made over the land and construction. If we add this extra interest income HDB has made even more profits than disclosed.<br><br>The HDB account does not include the land sale profits made from lands by SLA which are taken into the consolidated account acquired under the Land Acquisition Act with taxpayers' monies amounting to S$20 billions for the period 1900-2000 alone.<br><br>Effectively lands are at zero value since lands were paid by taxpayers. So when HDB flats are built on these acquired lands government should be selling HDB flats to the taxpaying citizens at cost of construction. If it sells so much as above construction cost government will be making a profit.<br><br>If government sells the HDB flats at market value or close to market value with a discount it will be making profit one more time on the land. That is my case that government has been profiteering and making double land from its citizens and HDB and minister Mah are telling lies when they say government is subsidizing the public housing.<br><br></div>
