From the government point of view, they would want to extract the maximum "fair" value from the land sales to HDB.

As long as HDB price it below resale price, that  is subsidy.<br><br>Everybody would want to buy cheap and sell high, but that sort of "free lunch"  or windfall is not going to happen.</div>
