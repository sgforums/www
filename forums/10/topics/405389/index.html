              <p>just like in the US, there's no democracy either...</p>

              <p>the "leaders" are there to serve the people.. as long as the people know and remember that, and take the "leaders" to task about it, the country will be well..</p>
              <p>most politicians will do their utmost to make their people ignorant about it...</p>
              <p>don't let them and the people, if they are responsible enough to do their own part, all will be fine...</p>
              <p>this is the question i will ask of the people.. are you able to take on the responsibility of democracy?</p>

              <p>Exactly. "Democracy" seems to be just a label these days, just like how manufacturers find it better for business if they had words like "organic" or "natural" placed on their products.</p>
              <p>Has anyone read "Freedom for Sale"?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Review from <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2009/sep/13/freedom-for-sale-john-kampfner">The Guardian</a>:</p>
              <p><em>But now, much assisted by John Kampfner's acidulous essays in 
              autocratic reality, we can all wake up. Kampfner, political journalist 
              turned human rights campaigner, isn't dealing here with the shambles of 
              Afghanistan. His more amorphous target is the anaesthetised freedom of 
              the city state of his birth, <a title="More from 
              guardian.co.uk on Singapore" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/singapore">Singapore</a>, and the insidious spread of 
              Lee Kuan Yew's model democracy – not just to Malaysia, but on to Beijing
               and beyond.</em></p>
              <p><em>Can you have economic success without political 
              freedom? The Bush and Blair camps would probably answer no, with a windy
               rhetorical flourish. Capitalism depends on the market and the market 
              depends on human beings (aka consumers) exercising free choice. But 
              Singapore has slyly inserted another level of choice. It has made what 
              Kampfner calls "a pact" with its citizenry. You can accrete wealth and 
              trappings, eat good food, live in fine houses and enjoy a "good" life: 
              just don't rock our boat.</em></p>
              <p><em>It's a covert deal intended to keep 
              everyone happy. It offers those who've made it the ability to keep it. 
              It gives new generations of loyal citizens the prospect that they, too, 
              can grow rich and contented. The price – a certain quiescence – doesn't 
              seem so high by the side of a swimming pool. What alternative is there? 
              Utter a word out of place and you'll be sued, banned or taxed out of 
              existence. Play the game and the world smiles with you. Free choice can 
              mean choosing not to get involved.</em></p>
              <p><em>There's one further factor that
               Kampfner shrewdly pops into this pot: simple fear, as in terror of 
              chaos. Lee Kuan Yew, like his disciples in Kuala Lumpur, trades on fear 
              of communal violence. Beijing has centuries of civil war and imploding 
              dynasties to shiver the timbers of its fledgling tycoons. Vladimir 
              Putin, offering order against the drunken debacles of the Yeltsin era, 
              adds Moscow to the list. And so, from India to Berlusconi's Italy, to 
              Brown's phone-tapping Britain, we see true freedoms under attack, 
              fading, dying.</em></p>

              <p>Exactly. "Democracy" seems to be just a label these days, just like how manufacturers find it better for business if they had words like "organic" or "natural" placed on their products.</p>
              <p>Has anyone read "Freedom for Sale"?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Review from <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2009/sep/13/freedom-for-sale-john-kampfner">The Guardian</a>:</p>
              <p><em>But now, much assisted by John Kampfner's acidulous essays in autocratic reality, we can all wake up. Kampfner, political journalist turned human rights campaigner, isn't dealing here with the shambles of Afghanistan. His more amorphous target is the anaesthetised freedom of the city state of his birth, <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Singapore" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/singapore">Singapore</a>, and the insidious spread of Lee Kuan Yew's model democracy – not just to Malaysia, but on to Beijing and beyond.</em></p>
              <p><em>Can you have economic success without political freedom? The Bush and Blair camps would probably answer no, with a windy rhetorical flourish. Capitalism depends on the market and the market depends on human beings (aka consumers) exercising free choice. But Singapore has slyly inserted another level of choice. It has made what Kampfner calls "a pact" with its citizenry. You can accrete wealth and trappings, eat good food, live in fine houses and enjoy a "good" life: just don't rock our boat.</em></p>
              <p><em>It's a covert deal intended to keep everyone happy. It offers those who've made it the ability to keep it. It gives new generations of loyal citizens the prospect that they, too, can grow rich and contented. The price – a certain quiescence – doesn't seem so high by the side of a swimming pool. What alternative is there? Utter a word out of place and you'll be sued, banned or taxed out of existence. Play the game and the world smiles with you. Free choice can mean choosing not to get involved.</em></p>
              <p><em>There's one further factor that Kampfner shrewdly pops into this pot: simple fear, as in terror of chaos. Lee Kuan Yew, like his disciples in Kuala Lumpur, trades on fear of communal violence. Beijing has centuries of civil war and imploding dynasties to shiver the timbers of its fledgling tycoons. Vladimir Putin, offering order against the drunken debacles of the Yeltsin era, adds Moscow to the list. And so, from India to Berlusconi's Italy, to Brown's phone-tapping Britain, we see true freedoms under attack, fading, dying.</em></p>

              <p><br>Even every person has his or her own way of democracy in life, if you choose to follow one's way of writing and agree up on it so as to embrace and follow it, so be it. But there are some who seek their own democracy, what they really wanted and take other comment as advices rather than being followers. Singapore democracy breed followers, many just go thru the motion, some dun even know what system we are in, and some just dun bother about it. How does these come about, very simple, Govt just make everyone stressed out and  busy making money, and most will forget about politics which will remain status quo. In here, i am not saying govt is conning people, i would rather said, good and skill way of governing</p>
