            <div class='col-md body'><br><br>To Editors, The Straits Times, Today<br><br>(Guess Yong Pung How or Dr. Tony Tan will never allow such letters to be published because they are too afraid of PM Lee's instruction to the press not to engage in crusading journalism)<br><br>Dear Editor,<br><br>There seems to be increasingly frequent incidents where private citizens were blatantly assaulted by another but the police merely concluded the whole episode by saying that such incidents were of private nature and it is up to the victims to seek his own recourse like commencing his own private summons against the perpetrators.<br><br>Is the police aware in such an encounter, there may be more than meet the eyes with perpetrators likely to take advantage of such a hands-off approach to increase their aggressions everywhere?<br><br>From reported cases it is clear that the police has been able to rely on Â“seizableÂ” or Â“non-seizableÂ”; categorisation of offences in order to deny responsibilities for more in-depth investigation and prevention of crimes of any kind against persons of more private or civil nature by telling the victim to commence his own private civil suits.<br><br>Yet citizens need the police to use its special power to intervene where such private trespass against persons are more serious in nature like openly blatant assault. Without such intervention, there will be a tendency for citizens to take laws into their own hands to settle private feuds. So will the police understand such a intricate balance of relationship and factors in seeking to deny responsibilities for commissions of offences against the person.<br><br>If we allow the police to adopt this lower standard of policing then almost every case of assault no matter how unprovoked will become private suits just because the police may then take short cut to avoid their duties and responsibilities.<br><br>There seems to be a tendency to rely on legalistic wrangling of laws and regulations to pass relevant duties to citizens. For example, the police has passed amendments to Immigration Act or regulations using the terrorisms or illegal immigration as an excuse to make landladies and landlords liable to be jailed for illegal harbouring of illegal when clearly such are the duties of the police and not the citizens who at best could only exercise caution. The police who allowed criminal like Took Leng How to escape immigration control is not even reprimanded.<br><br>Police has also passed many duties now to the Management Corporations of private estates by relying entirely on private security agencies to do policing. It has been resorting to canceling licences of security agencies for breach of standards whereas when their own policemen do not even bother to patrol the surrounding more diligently, there is no penalty or acceptance of responsibilities.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Why must we put the responsibility on the SMRT staff to help in such cases? Can't we as fellow passengers and citizens also chip in?<br><br>Yes, the SMRT staff has the responsibility to help the injured passenger, which I believe they did to the best of their limited abilities. However, the call for them to take down the particulars of the errant passenger is really not practical. Firstly, they cannot possibly take down the particulars of every passenger who knocked into another, an incident which must occur several hundred times a day. Secondly, they have no legal right to do so (to the best of my knowledge), and the passenger can simply refuse to give his particulars, in which case the SMRT would have no legal recourse.</div>
