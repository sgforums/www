However, there are some Asians who too, can speak Greek. Come on, LANGUAGE is always tied to RACE. Unless words like translator, teacher, or any posts under the linguistic profession are used, stipulating a certain language only indicates preferences of RACE.<br><br>It is not impossible to deter employers from being discrimnatory, our Multi Million Dollar government can surely dish out some dictatorial rules or regulations to do so. It's not difficult for such high salaried men and women to do.. just dictate.<br><br>The problem with people here in Singapore, is that we grumble and rant about how our government is so dictatorial but yet, do things in such ways that leaves them, our gov., no choice but to BE dictatorial. Otherwise people  don't buck up...<br><br></div></blockquote>The example on its own may seem odd, but the logic doesn't sound remotely discriminatory if you get my drift. I mean, "mandarin speaking only need apply" and "chinese only need apply" have two totally different connotations. That is pure logic - just like why certain jobs in Singapore specifically demand its applicants to possess a good command of English despite that being the lingua franca in this country. You can't assume anyone remotely associated with an ethnicity that speaks a particular language would naturally be versed in one (for instance, not all ethnic chinese can speak decent mandarin and those who fall under this category wouldn't be qualified for jobs that are "mandarin speaking only need apply" either).<br><br>The point about legislation is no known legislation has been proven to work to effectively deter employment discrimination. Through "affirmative action" to promote equal opportunity employment, the US has effectively legally outlawed any discrimination at the workplace on the basis of gender and race. While that seems theoretically fair, there's nothing in the book that can deter an employer from firing you (if you're hired) or denying you an employment opportunity on the basis that your merits are not up to scratch (which could effectively be a smokescreen to mask the true reasons behind his/her discrimination).</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by ShutterBug:<br><strong>[b]Not fair form to ask these questions?<br>Lee U-Wen<br>u-wen@mediacorp.com.sg </strong><br><br>THE next time you pick up a job application form, it could look different.<br>.<br>Certain fields Â— such as those asking for your gender, religion or marital status, even the space where you attach your photograph Â— could be absent.<br>.<br>As part of a national push to fight discrimination at the workplace, a new set of guidelines for fair employment practices will be launched tomorrow. These are expected to address, among other things, some of the biggest bugbears among job-seekers here Â— the interview questions and application forms.<br>.<br>Giving Today a foretaste of what might be announced, Madam Halimah Yacob, co-chairperson of the one-year-old Tripartite Alliance for Fair Employment Practices, said existing guidelines were not so "specific" about what the forms could or could not ask.<br>.<br>"Now we are saying that questions such as religion, gender, marital status Â— even photographs Â— unless absolutely necessary should be cut out," said the assistant secretary-general of the NTUC.<br>.<br>The eight-member panel's aim was to update and replace the Code of Responsible Employment Practices issued about five years ago.<br>.<br>Said Mdm Halimah: "We had a lengthy discussion about making the guidelines for the forms law. But we looked at other countries which ran into difficulties with this. We decided that if the company still chooses not to hire you for whatever reason, it is difficult for any law to catch it. Discrimination is hard to prove."<br>.<br>With the job market heating up, and a record 176,000 jobs created last year, combating workplace discrimination is ever more vital. Each year, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) receives an average of 70 related complaints.<br>.<br>Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, at the May Day Rally yesterday, said Malays and Indians had told him it was harder for them to get jobs.<br>.<br>He urged employers to be fair and objective, and base hiring decisions on merit alone. "For example, they should not demand that candidates speak or write Chinese in jobs where this is not necessary," he said.<br>.<br>Then there are the complaints from pregnant workers and job-hunters. Last year, the MOM attended to 71 cases of working mothers-to-be who complained about unfair dismissal.<br>.<br>At the interview stage, the new guidelines will advise employers on the 'dos' and 'don'ts' of asking questions.<br>.<br>"Let's not ask inappropriate questions, such as when are you going to have children or getting married," said Mdm Halimah, adding that initiatives such as the baby bonus and longer maternity leave were "pointless" if women risk losing their jobs when they choose to have children.<br>.<br>But Singapore Human Resources Institute president Ho Geok Choo noted that there were "exceptions" where employers had to know certain personal details.<br>.<br>For example: If a job requires a civil engineer to be posted to a remote area. "Practicality is going to tell you that it's going to be tough for a female," said Ms Ho. "As long as the employer can justify the reasons, a job-seeker who did not make the cut is less likely to feel discriminated against."<br>.<br>A group Ms Ho was "very concerned" about: Executives, who do not enjoy much recourse via the unions or the Manpower Ministry.<br>.<br>Calling for a code of conduct for the way such workers are dealt with in the event they are let go of, Ms Ho said: "I have been advocating that the MOM extends its scope of regulation to cover managers and above.<br>.<br>"They can be victims of higher politics. Sometimes, it's a new leader that comes into the company ... Increasingly, we have been hearing of foreigners who bring their own team, and they just get rid of the old team."<br>.<br>Singapore Business Federation council member Lawrence Leow said bosses' welfare must not be forgotten, too.<br>.<br>"The Employment Act largely protects workers. But fair employment must go both ways. We must spare a thought for employers too, who have to deal with difficult workers, such as those who try to cheat them with false education certificates," he said.<br>.<br>Other initiatives in the pipeline include the establishment of a new centre for fair employment, to collect public feedback and advise workers and employers keen to adopt such practices.<br>.<br>The tripartite alliance's Pledge of Fair Employment Practices Â— a movement launched in September last year Â— has 419 companies on board to date, with the target being to reach 500 by June. Ministries, statutory boards and Government agencies signed the pledge last month.<br>[/b]</blockquote>Just because it is not a perfect environment does not mean that we should encourage or allow discrimination to take roots, and assume that it is Okay to practice selective discrimination.<br><br>My wife is a minority in Singapore, and I am a chinese. And I know what kind of discrimination she gets when she apply for jobs she likes or in her field of expertise.  <strong>If any position that publish  "Speaking chinese need apply" in the Strait Time is just rediculous. Because that job ads should be in the chinese news paper</strong>.  That is an outright cherry picking.<br><br>In todays work environment,  what percentage do we converse in English vs dialect. E-mail, Reports, telephone, Sales order.  Especially if you work in MNC or deal with oversea vendors or customers.<br><br>The point is that Singaporean of all races should not feel that they are excluded by the limitation of language after all. We all learn - English.... no matter how broken the english one should be able to communicate the message across. even my parent who is first generation immigrant make the effort to speak broken english to my wife.<br><br>think where you want your next generation to live in?  Business owner have their right to hire, but it is to their disadvantage if they exclude minority they lost their minority market share in the process not because they are unable to communicate but because they closed their mind.<br><br>Nobody like to be tag as being discriminatory similarly nobody like to be discriminated. But it is happening in the work place.<br></div>

However, IF I am in China, I can understand if I was replied to in Mandarin. But this is Singapore, and our official working language is English. WHY must people insists on speaking Mandarin? Are there special rewards for doing so? Or is it personal convenience in providing service or doing one's job in his or her perfered language?

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by walesa:</div><div class="quote_body">The example on its own may seem odd, but the logic doesn't sound remotely discriminatory if you get my drift. I mean, "mandarin speaking only need apply" and "chinese only need apply" have two totally different connotations. That is pure logic - just like why certain jobs in Singapore specifically demand its applicants to possess a good command of English despite that being the lingua franca in this country. You can't assume anyone remotely associated with an ethnicity that speaks a particular language would naturally be versed in one (for instance, not all ethnic chinese can speak decent mandarin and those who fall under this category wouldn't be qualified for jobs that are "mandarin speaking only need apply" either).<br><br>The point about legislation is no known legislation has been proven to work to effectively deter employment discrimination. Through "affirmative action" to promote equal opportunity employment, the US has effectively legally outlawed any discrimination at the workplace on the basis of gender and race. While that seems theoretically fair, there's nothing in the book that can deter an employer from firing you (if you're hired) or denying you an employment opportunity on the basis that your merits are not up to scratch (which could effectively be a smokescreen to mask the true reasons behind his/her discrimination).</div></blockquote><strong>New guidelines on fair employment by TAFEP<br>By Ashraf Safdar, Channel NewsAsia | Posted: 03 May 2007 1952 hrs </strong><br><br>New guidelines on fair employment by TAFEP<br><br>SINGAPORE: Advertisements like <strong>"only females may apply"</strong> or <strong>"Indian workers wanted"</strong> may soon be a thing of the past.<br><br>A tripartite body representing government, management and workers has issued a series of guidelines to reduce discrimination in the workplace.<br><br>About 70 people complained of workplace discrimination last year.<br><br>Though the number has been relatively stable over the past three years, the Tripartite Alliance for Fair Employment Practices (TAFEP) is not sitting still.<br><br>"What we hope to see is a change in values, norms, mindsets... that people are being employed, people are being promoted, sent for value skills, training, upgrading, solely on the basis of merit, and not any other consideration," says Halimah Yacob, Co-Chair, TAFEP.<br><br>And so, Madam Halimah and her team have published a series of guidelines on fair employment practices.<br><br>For instance, criteria for employment should be specific to job requirements.<br><br>Things not relevant - like skin colour, sexual orientation, marital status and age - should be excluded.<br><br>"Some of them say that they do find it difficult to get a job because of their age, gender, discrimination or something.

            <div class='col-md body'>Fair defence, before axe falls<br>Lee U-Wen<br>u-wen@mediacorp.com.sg<br><br>YOU'RE fired. Words every employee dreads to hear Â— but now a set of new guidelines aim to ensure that if a worker has to be given the axe, it will at least be done in a fair and responsible manner.<br>.<br>Recommendations on how to conduct dismissals and retrenchments were announced yesterday, as part of the Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices.<br>.<br>Among the suggestions: Companies should keep detailed records of all their staff's performance and conduct, and use these to justify their decision to dismiss an employee.<br>.<br>The affected worker, too, should have the chance to defend himself, with the final verdict assessed by an impartial and independent panel Â— comprising, for example, staff from the company's HR department.<br>.<br>If such measures are taken up by Singapore employers Â— more than 420 of which, including the civil service, have signed the Pledge of Fair Employment Practices Â— it would spell good news for groups such as mature workers and would-be mums, who have complained of being unfairly dismissed on unsubstantiated claims of poor performance.<br>.<br>As part of the fight against discrimination at the workplace, a 13-page booklet has been produced by the Tripartite Alliance for Fair Employment. The guidelines replace the five-year-old Code of Responsible Employment Practices, and introduce vital new elements.<br>.<br>Among them, as this newspaper first reported on Wednesday, is the call for employers to look at how job application forms are structured. The alliance says they should refrain from asking for information such as age, race, gender, religion and marital status, all of which it deems "irrelevant" in determining whether the applicant is suitable for the job.<br>.<br>There is also a section on remuneration, where the onus is placed on employers to ensure wages paid match the value of the job. Age, religion or family status should not affect how a worker is rewarded for work done.<br>.<br>Co-chairperson Bob Tan said the alliance had briefly discussed the pros and cons of having a minimum wage. The consensus was that it did not truly help, he said. "In fact, the minimum could end up being the maximum (that employers would pay). Also if you have to employ people at a fixed rate that is high, your business may not be sustainable," he told Today.<br>.<br>Also new is a guide on how employees' grievances should be handled Â— companies are advised to set up proper channels.<br>.<br>Co-chair Madam HalimahYacob hoped the guidelines would help reduce the average of 70 discrimination-related complaints received each year by the Ministry of Manpower. But some recruiters warned that, without legislation, it would be unrealistic to expect companies to comply.<br>.<br>"It's a milestone for labour laws in Singapore, and it's timely, given our ageing population and a tight labour market. But whether or not employers are going to treat the guidelines like a bible is up in the air. Let's hope that a small percentage, at least, will seriously practise these suggestions," said Mr Paul Heng, managing director of Next Career Consulting.<br>.<br>The alliance hopes to see more recourse given, in particular, to pregnant workers who lose their jobs unfairly. Mdm Halimah wondered if there was "a correlation" in the increased number of complaints she has observed since maternity leave was extended from two to three months.<br>.<br>Mums-to-be such as planning director Delphinia Tam-Lower, 31, said: "Now it's a lot clearer as to how pregnant job-seekers should be evaluated. It will impart confidence and hope to those who have been shunned before."<br>.<br>Meanwhile, the new tripartite centre for fair employment is likely to open its doors by the year's end. Both employers and workers can attend training courses, and seek advice on discrimination-related issues.<br>.<br>Plans are underway to hire staff, who will also be sent to companies Â— starting with those that have signed the pledge Â— to conduct surveys and educate them on the guidelines. The new tripartite guidelines are at www.mom.gov.sg.<br>Lee U-Wen<br>u-wen@mediacorp.com.sg<br></div>
