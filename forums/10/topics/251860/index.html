            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Not fair form to ask these questions?<br>Lee U-Wen<br>u-wen@mediacorp.com.sg </strong><br><br>THE next time you pick up a job application form, it could look different.<br>.<br>Certain fields Â— such as those asking for your gender, religion or marital status, even the space where you attach your photograph Â— could be absent.<br>.<br>As part of a national push to fight discrimination at the workplace, a new set of guidelines for fair employment practices will be launched tomorrow. These are expected to address, among other things, some of the biggest bugbears among job-seekers here Â— the interview questions and application forms.<br>.<br>Giving Today a foretaste of what might be announced, Madam Halimah Yacob, co-chairperson of the one-year-old Tripartite Alliance for Fair Employment Practices, said existing guidelines were not so "specific" about what the forms could or could not ask.<br>.<br>"Now we are saying that questions such as religion, gender, marital status Â— even photographs Â— unless absolutely necessary should be cut out," said the assistant secretary-general of the NTUC.<br>.<br>The eight-member panel's aim was to update and replace the Code of Responsible Employment Practices issued about five years ago.<br>.<br>Said Mdm Halimah: "We had a lengthy discussion about making the guidelines for the forms law. But we looked at other countries which ran into difficulties with this. We decided that if the company still chooses not to hire you for whatever reason, it is difficult for any law to catch it. Discrimination is hard to prove."<br>.<br>With the job market heating up, and a record 176,000 jobs created last year, combating workplace discrimination is ever more vital. Each year, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) receives an average of 70 related complaints.<br>.<br>Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, at the May Day Rally yesterday, said Malays and Indians had told him it was harder for them to get jobs.<br>.<br>He urged employers to be fair and objective, and base hiring decisions on merit alone. "For example, they should not demand that candidates speak or write Chinese in jobs where this is not necessary," he said.<br>.<br>Then there are the complaints from pregnant workers and job-hunters. Last year, the MOM attended to 71 cases of working mothers-to-be who complained about unfair dismissal.<br>.<br>At the interview stage, the new guidelines will advise employers on the 'dos' and 'don'ts' of asking questions.<br>.<br>"Let's not ask inappropriate questions, such as when are you going to have children or getting married," said Mdm Halimah, adding that initiatives such as the baby bonus and longer maternity leave were "pointless" if women risk losing their jobs when they choose to have children.<br>.<br>But Singapore Human Resources Institute president Ho Geok Choo noted that there were "exceptions" where employers had to know certain personal details.<br>.<br>For example: If a job requires a civil engineer to be posted to a remote area. "Practicality is going to tell you that it's going to be tough for a female," said Ms Ho. "As long as the employer can justify the reasons, a job-seeker who did not make the cut is less likely to feel discriminated against."<br>.<br>A group Ms Ho was "very concerned" about: Executives, who do not enjoy much recourse via the unions or the Manpower Ministry.<br>.<br>Calling for a code of conduct for the way such workers are dealt with in the event they are let go of, Ms Ho said: "I have been advocating that the MOM extends its scope of regulation to cover managers and above.<br>.<br>"They can be victims of higher politics. Sometimes, it's a new leader that comes into the company ... Increasingly, we have been hearing of foreigners who bring their own team, and they just get rid of the old team."<br>.<br>Singapore Business Federation council member Lawrence Leow said bosses' welfare must not be forgotten, too.<br>.<br>"The Employment Act largely protects workers. But fair employment must go both ways. We must spare a thought for employers too, who have to deal with difficult workers, such as those who try to cheat them with false education certificates," he said.<br>.<br>Other initiatives in the pipeline include the establishment of a new centre for fair employment, to collect public feedback and advise workers and employers keen to adopt such practices.<br>.<br>The tripartite alliance's Pledge of Fair Employment Practices Â— a movement launched in September last year Â— has 419 companies on board to date, with the target being to reach 500 by June. Ministries, statutory boards and Government agencies signed the pledge last month.<br></div>

Why should "mandarin speaking only need apply" be discriminatory by nature?
