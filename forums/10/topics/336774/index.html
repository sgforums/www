              <p>Monday, 10 November 2008</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><img src="http://www.yoursdp.org/images/stories/posters_and_logos/courts.jpg" border="1" alt="" width="160" align="right"><em>Singapore Democrats</em><br> <br> In court last Friday, Dr Chee Soon Juan queried police witness, Station
              Inspector Yeo Kok Leong, on why he took so long to reply to Dr Chee's
              application for a permit for a protest on 15 Mar 08.<br> <br> Mr Yeo,
              OC of the Compliance Management Unit at the Police Central Division,
              was under cross-examination in the on-going trial of the <em>Tak Boleh Tahan</em> (TBT) protesters. He is in charge of processing applications for permits for assemblies and processions.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><br> Dr Chee had made an online
              application on 28 Dec 07. SI Yeo did not reply until 25 Jan 08 – 28
              days later. The unit had stated in its acknowledgment slip that “The
              normal processing time for an application is <strong>7 working days</strong>.” (emphasis theirs)<br> <br> “Was my application a normal one?” Dr Chee asked.<br> <br> “This is confidential,” SI Yeo replied.<br> <br> “Are you running a police department or the mafia? A simple question of
              whether my application is a normal one or not is shrouded in such
              secrecy,” Dr Chee said.<br> <br> (Earlier, the SDP secretary-general
              had noticed that the police printout of his computerised application
              form, which the prosecution submitted as evidence, included his date of
              birth. But Dr Chee had not entered this piece of data as the online
              application did not ask for an applicant's birthdate.<br> <br> “How did
              my date of birth get onto your computer printout when I did not give
              the information?” the SDP secretary-general enquired.<br> <br> “This is confidential,” the witness replied.)<br> <br> Judge Chia Wee Kiat stepped in and wanted to know the relevance of Dr Chee's question.<br> <br> “When my application takes such an abnormally long time to process,
              surely you must be interested in knowing if it was treated normally,
              especially since I am part of the political opposition” Dr Chee
              answered.<br> <br> Dr Chee explained further that he intended to show
              that the police had acted in bad faith and deliberately delayed
              replying so that there would be no time for him to appeal the decision
              and, if the appeal fails, take up a judicial review. <br> <br> "The question of <em>mala fide</em> (dishonest intent) on the part of the police must surely be relevant,”
              Dr Chee explained. “The word 'fixed' comes to mind. Are we going to be
              convicted based on the machinations of the police?”<br> <br> The Judge was unmoved and disallowed the question.<br> <br> Dr Chee added: “Your Honour, with your ruling you are in fact
              encouraging the police to abuse their powers. In future instead of
              taking one week to reply as they stipulate why not take four weeks,
              eight weeks to process an application or, worse, reject the application
              just the day before the event?”<br> <br> Lawyer and co-defendant Mr
              Chia Ti Lik pointed out that the DPP seemed to be very protective of
              the witness. Mr Chia explained that he would normally allow his
              opponent some leeway to establish his intent through the questions.<br> <br> “By the DPP's protectiveness it almost seems as if there is intentional
              effort to help the police cover up the things they did and not let the
              public see the truth.” Mr Chia explained. “I urge you to allow the
              question because if the prosecution has nothing to hide, the subject
              will amount to nothing.”<br> <br> The defendants stood up to register
              their unhappiness over Judge Wee's decision not to allow the defence to
              determine if there was political discrimination on the part of the
              police when it rejected the application and then dragged their feet in
              replying to Dr Chee.<br><br>The protesters have consistently argued
              that while the police allow political activities by the ruling party
              and its supporters, it denies such permission to the opposition. Such
              inequality before the law is forbidden by the Constitution. And yet
              judges, in this and past trials, will not allow defendants to show how
              the police and the Executive have been abusing their powers and
              politically discriminated against the opposition.<br><br>The hearing
              was scheduled from 23 Oct - 7 Nov. The next earliest date for its
              continuation will be 26 Feb 09 because some of the defendants have
              other trials in the coming weeks.</p>
