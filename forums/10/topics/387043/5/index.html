              <p>i think you overly exagerate the impact of western influence....my chinese ex boss has 2 mistress from China one live in N.Y. the other live in L.A. and an apartment in Ching Toa and many more following the same path.</p>
              <p>It is in human nature to excerise the right to pursue material gain and wealth. Individualism or self center is just part of securing and acqusition on material gain....or else will be a monk.    </p>

              <p>Lust and pruriency is part of human sinful nature, chinese are no less human than any others. some chinese men having more than one wife does not justify pologamy. Traditional asian societies are not condoning it, the 2nd wives are not proud of being mistresses. But when Tiger Wood was reported to have cheated his wife, more and more women came out and proudly announced " I also slept with him". That is the difference.</p>
              <p>It is the right of human being to pursue materials gain, and even monks have that rights! With traditional moral value and religious value flushed down the drain by the communists, to pursue material gains and wealth has become the main driving force for the people in china, legally or illegally, morally or immorally. It goes beyond the questions of right, there is no right to immorality, and illegality.</p>
              <p>Asian values call for society before family, family before self. While I do not necessarily subscribe to "society before family", I firmly believe in working for my family.  Western influence may be too sweeping a term, and probably should not include european, but definitely american, and the impact is beyond doubt.</p>

              <p>If I were still the same old Singaporean, I would not be here. I was trained to think in multiple perspectives after intense competition with PRCs, Indians, Indonesians, Mauritians in the university.</p>
              <p>That said, I still retain a significant portion of the Singapore educational characteristics, ie. being systematic. I am probably suited for my job, coz it requires systematic cum creative thinking for success.</p>
              <p>That said, I do not say that our education is a failure. However, I tend to think that creativity is also a fundamental soft skill, which is sorely lacking in our education system.</p>

              <p>Recalled i once said the early childhood development between Asian vs American. Are taught differently. In pre school you are taught how to hold a Pen correctly, how to held chopstick correctly. In American it is to allow kids to expand their creativities. So they throw crayon at the kids let them hold anyway they want but DRAW. The downside is sometime as adult they don't necessary have the right skill.</p>

              <p>Singapore MNCs retrench workers in order to cut costs, EVEN IF they still have positive results.</p>
              <p>"It's better to retrench now when there is profit, than to retrench later when the company is making losses" - Lee Hsien Loong</p>
              <p>And what is your explanation to that? I would really like to hear how you defend Singapore MNCs and see if you have double standards or not.</p>
              <p>In addition, are you so sure that American MNCs are all bad and nothing good? AT least the ones I was in, emphasized a lot on human rights and ensuring people do not overtime without getting off-in-lieus. In our local firms, people are made to slave for them without any benefits.</p>
              <p>I quote a clause in a contract that I knew about from a certain supermarket chain that is affliated to the govt:</p>
              <p>"There will be times when you have to work extra hours, during weekends, or public holidays. You will not be entitled to any replacement off or be able to claim overtime pay, should the above be required"</p>
              <p>In addition, American MNCs pay much better than Singapore MNCs. As such, I prefer working in them, coz I can deliver</p>
              <p>Finally, in USA here, there are many companies that still offer pension schemes, not like Singapore.</p>
              <p>And, you claimed that USA companies retrench and move jobs to China. In Singapore, we easily import many PRCs here to compete with the locals for jobs. Now, is there much difference between the two?</p>
              <p>It's time to walk out of Singapore and learn more of the world, than to just read newspaper reports that focuses only on the negative and the dramatic.</p>

              <p>My richer friends either live in the prime district, or in the areas of river valley, and some even Pasir Panjang, which is becoming expensive due to the IR. East is hardly ever considered for the rich.</p>
              <p>HDB prices at Queenstown or Tiong Bahru are amongst the most expensive. They are also in the West.</p>
              <p>West Coast property prices are comparable to Bedok.</p>
              <p>Joo Chiat is close to Geylang. Property prices there are mostly suppressed due to the location. Changi is hardly ever considered for the rich. I really doubt you know the market well, angel7030</p>

              <p>Singapore MNCs retrench workers in order to cut costs, EVEN IF they still have positive results.</p>
              <p>"It's better to retrench now when there is profit, than to retrench later when the company is making losses" - Lee Hsien Loong</p>
              <p>And what is your explanation to that? I would really like to hear how you defend Singapore MNCs and see if you have double standards or not.</p>
              <p>In addition, are you so sure that American MNCs are all bad and nothing good? AT least the ones I was in, emphasized a lot on human rights and ensuring people do not overtime without getting off-in-lieus. In our local firms, people are made to slave for them without any benefits.</p>
              <p>I quote a clause in a contract that I knew about from a certain supermarket chain that is affliated to the govt:</p>
              <p>"There will be times when you have to work extra hours, during weekends, or public holidays. You will not be entitled to any replacement off or be able to claim overtime pay, should the above be required"</p>
              <p>In addition, American MNCs pay much better than Singapore MNCs. As such, I prefer working in them, coz I can deliver</p>
              <p>Finally, in USA here, there are many companies that still offer pension schemes, not like Singapore.</p>
              <p>And, you claimed that USA companies retrench and move jobs to China. In Singapore, we easily import many PRCs here to compete with the locals for jobs. Now, is there much difference between the two?</p>
              <p>It's time to walk out of Singapore and learn more of the world, than to just read newspaper reports that focuses only on the negative and the dramatic.</p>

              <p>Who is defending Singapore MNC? which companies were LHL refering to? which MNCs in Singapore are retrenching?   </p>
              <p>For your information, there are companies from all over the world in Singapore, and they practice policies of their home companies, and only abide by the laws of singapore.</p>
              <p>Secondly, there is a difference between retrenchment DUE to redundancy and retrenchment TO reduce cost. There is a difference between reducing cost to survive and reducing cost to increase profits.</p>
              <p>Thirdly, there is a difference between retrenching those who are WORKING with the company to save cost and employing cheaper NEW staff to keep cost down.</p>

              <p>Interesting, your feigned ignorance about Singapore MNC retrenching means you aren't reading the newspaper. I will give you the benefit of the doubt, since it seems you are pretty ignorant. Also, it shows you don't even understand what I mean when I say Singapore MNCs, NOT MNCs with a presence in Singapore (You cannot even differentiate the 2)</p>
              <p>I can also see you are very biased towards USA, and told Aparahoe to see more of the world, as if he has not seen more than you do. Your biasness imply that you don't see much, and only derive your conclusions from 3rd party views, reports, etc.</p>
              <p>In 2003, PSA retrenched 10% of its workforce. Lee Hsien Loong made a comment that "it's better to retrench in good times than in bad times". This was one of the most infamous statements he ever made. It opened the way for companies to have the option to retrench people in Singapore, even if they are still making money.</p>
              <p>It's way different from USA, when companies are making losses, that they have to retrench.</p>
              <p>You said there is a difference to retrench due to redundancy and retrench due to cutting costs. PSA was no different from the companies in USA, retrenching to cut costs. The DIFFERENCE is, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>PSA did it even when it was making huge profits</strong></span></span>, UNLIKE companies in USA that are making losses.</p>
              <p>Did I link my views to the PAP? I merely am quoting a factual report about PSA. I would like you to retract your needless accusation and offensive remark. If you don't, it's also fine, it says much about your total lack of graciousness to acknowledge your mistake</p>

              <p>You brought in a point here, it's termed as "passion".</p>
              <p>How many of us can claim to be working because of our passion for our work, and not because we need a job to feed us? One of my ex-bosses said, "You do not pursue happiness directly, but pursue things that will bring about happiness indirectly". It's similar for $$$ I guess. Too many juniors in my days in university told me that they came to my faculty coz they want to earn lots of $$$. And because of that, they get into the wrong thing (and hence not their interest), and I see many of them not making it.</p>
              <p>In Singapore, we are a very pragmatic society, that we don't truly pursue our interests, but rather pursue targets that will most definitely be a job that can feed us. Not that it is wrong, and for the majority of it, I guess it is a more stable path. It is also not encouraged in our system. From young, we attend the same set of education, shut up during class when we were much younger, and our job in class was to listen to the teacher</p>
              <p>Over here, seems like kids are encouraged to speak up, take initiatives way early in life. This can consequently lead to them to start thinking early in life, and hence, start exploring their own interests (and not their parents, or the system's interests) much earlier than us.</p>

              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">In America, a family is made up of husband, wife, and children up to age of 18. In Asia, a son may be 50 yrs old, he is still the son to his parents and part of the family. With these different definitions come the differences in responsibilities to one another. How the parents teach their children, or how much time they put in depends on what they view as importance for their children, but what the children grow up to be largely depends on the children, you can blame the school, the teachers,…..</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">It is rightly pointed out that fundamentals are needed before we talk about creativity. We need to know what are in the box before we can think out of the box. Of course, how much fundamentals are needed is debatable. Hold a pen correctly so you will feel less tired in writing, hold the chopstick properly to ensure you don’t drop the food on the table, these are fundamentals.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">But there is more to that. you should know what is table manner, when you use chopstick or even fork and spoon. Use your hand to pick up your hamburger, and take bite with your mouth opened as big as possible, hehehe….lick your finger after that, no wonder the European question the american culture.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Take your example, it doesn’t matter how you hold the chalk as long as you know how to DRAW. American emphasis is on result, not the way to achieve. American MNCs retrench thousands of workers in order to achieve results, switch to production in china leaving thousands of contract workers in Indonesia jobless to reduce product cost, and to pay fat bonuses to the CEO…there are other values, such as ethic, morality besides creativity and independence.</span></span></p>

              <p>I would like to draw a few pointers. </p>
              <p>P -1</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0in; margin: 0in -0.7pt 0pt 0in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Isn’t it not true that Sun Yet Seng had import in modern value that brought a breath of fresh air to the <strong>Patriarch</strong> feudal Chinese monarchist society? <span> </span>He had to lead a revolution to get recognition. Isn’t it not true that in order find new ground you have to break from known fundamental…..</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0in; margin: 0in -0.7pt 0pt 0in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0in; margin: 0in -0.7pt 0pt 0in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Although Singapore is not a feudal society but one could not help by observing the parallel of Patriarch Politics in Singapore society and the expectation of its citizens; while overseas observers has long called Singapore a Lee Dynasty for years. Aren't we all so tired of being Told by some minister? </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0in; margin: 0in -0.7pt 0pt 0in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span> </span><span> </span></span></p>
              <p>P - 2</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0in; margin: 0in -0.7pt 0pt 0in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">What happen is that kids that grew up in America developed individual opinions much younger than kids grow up in Asia. As such by age 13<sup>th</sup> – 14<sup>th</sup> , Parents could no longer exercise authoritarian right on the children as if you were in Singapore. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0in; margin: 0in -0.7pt 0pt 0in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0in; margin: 0in -0.7pt 0pt 0in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Parenting in the US requires much higher parenting skills sets and responsibilities as compared to Singapore that depend on public social system. I think parenting skills has been largely ignored in Singapore as both parents work and maid was employed. (Sorry different Tangent off topics)</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0in; margin: 0in -0.7pt 0pt 0in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0in; margin: 0in -0.7pt 0pt 0in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">But more importantly relationship between Parents and children took a more “Adulthood” relationship there is less interfering of adult lifestyle. The honoring of parents is shown thru how they lead one’s life. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0in; margin: 0in -0.7pt 0pt 0in;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0in; margin: 0in -0.7pt 0pt 0in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">P -3</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0in; margin: 0in -0.7pt 0pt 0in;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0in; margin: 0in -0.7pt 0pt 0in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">I think it is socially wrong to assume because of the independent nature of the society. Kids do not hold family relationship after 18yrs of age. As you would already know either in Thanks Giving and Christmas is a busy travelling period in the US because they returned home to be with their family. It is the same as CNY. <span> </span>(You have to take reference between the sizes of SG vs. US. Is not only some MRT Station away)</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0in; margin: 0in -0.7pt 0pt 0in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0in; margin: 0in -0.7pt 0pt 0in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Plus it is hard to simplify American cultured because of the diverse ethnicity from immigrant throughout the world as such the single most common Day to mark family, and appreciation is Thanks Giving Day. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0in; margin: 0in -0.7pt 0pt 0in;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0in; margin: 0in -0.7pt 0pt 0in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">(And of course <span> </span>my Chinese co-worker called it Turkey Festival in Cantonese) everyone that move here has a variety in the depth of comprehending the merit of this society. what is important is not what it should "represent" but how one use it to better their lives. So Family A is always different from "B" . </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0in; margin: 0in -0.7pt 0pt 0in;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0in; margin: 0in -0.7pt 0pt 0in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">That is why there are so many version of what America should be.....ha ha ha.</span></p>
