              <p>Corporate satisfy Shareholders with return in investment, Govt satisfy its Citizens, provide job for them and give opportunity for them, to get educated,  to get prosperous, and to get healthier, peace and harmony.</p>
              <p>If shareholders find that the CEO is not worth the job, they can alway get rid of him/her with a certain compensation. If citizens find that govt is not suitable to rule the country, they can alway vote them out. Fair?</p>
              <p>Good paid Ministers of Singapore is not a new issue, it had been around since the 90s, but majority peoples of Singapore still vote them. This alone gives them the mandate that they are worth that much. Question?</p>
              <p>Lost in investment is not only the govt alone, most investors lost in the last year financial crisis including my daddy, it is not some thing that the govt lost and others win, it is a global lost, and these billions lost were gain taken from the early years, just like we gain 200 billions and now lost 100 billions, what is the big deal? We are still in blue, we still can pour billions into the market to stimulate the economy, just ask yourself, is their lost which is still a gain if you audit a 10 years consolidating account, led you to sleep in the street with no food??? or that everything come to a standstill, and that sing dollars you are holding is less valuable than Baht, Ringgit or USA dollars??? Think hor.</p>
              <p>Throughout the decades of PAP rules, we had gone thru so many crisis, and everytime, we come up fast and furious, i have no doubt that PAP has  master the skill of handling crisis management, and most singaporeans like me, are not blind to it,<br>not to say that there is no capable oppositions (which I dun think there is), if the govt is changed, another crisis is to hit Singapore, which will happen, i have doubt that they can handle it. </p>

              <p>I certainly don't disagree, i have several Chinese friends myself. Perhaps i am too much of an arse or too much of an anti social jerk but having thousands of Chinese friends seems to me to be a little difficult to get a detailed picture.</p>
              <p>However, i see the problems in China as a neccessary step rather than a chronic problem. I'm sure we can both agree that the workers' and humans right record for America for the 1st half of the last century wasn't exactly astounding either.</p>

              <p>Better coffee, better ice cream, may not have as much peace but much more freedom, harmony, jobs, education, and can go for MORE tours (coz country's bigger), nice shopping centres, not too bad transportation system, good financial sectors (Australia banks are doing MUCH better than Singapore banks, and offer fixed deposits of up to 6% or more p.a), lottery, quality goods, more high tech than Singapore, lots of options for nightlife (not just that few in Singapore), can make money, plenty of opportunities... etc etc</p>
              <p>Other countries also do not import foreign labour like water, protect the locals in the middle job market segment, cost of living lower than Singapore, create jobs of higher value so that there are more opportunities to move up rather than retrain and retrain and retrain, and do not tell you you are stupid when you are past 40</p>
              <p>If I ask any forumer here on why you are making such a big fuss out of mundane stuff, they will probably just laugh at you, coz you are just like our govt, doing selective comparisons, and not facing the truth of the root of the problems.</p>
