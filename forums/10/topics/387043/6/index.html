              <p>You brought in a point here, it's termed as "passion".</p>
              <p>How many of us can claim to be working because of our passion for our work, and not because we need a job to feed us? One of my ex-bosses said, "You do not pursue happiness directly, but pursue things that will bring about happiness indirectly". It's similar for $$$ I guess. Too many juniors in my days in university told me that they came to my faculty coz they want to earn lots of $$$. And because of that, they get into the wrong thing (and hence not their interest), and I see many of them not making it.</p>
              <p>In Singapore, we are a very pragmatic society, that we don't truly pursue our interests, but rather pursue targets that will most definitely be a job that can feed us. Not that it is wrong, and for the majority of it, I guess it is a more stable path. It is also not encouraged in our system. From young, we attend the same set of education, shut up during class when we were much younger, and our job in class was to listen to the teacher</p>
              <p>Over here, seems like kids are encouraged to speak up, take initiatives way early in life. This can consequently lead to them to start thinking early in life, and hence, start exploring their own interests (and not their parents, or the system's interests) much earlier than us.</p>

              <p>There was this friend of mine who went to a Meet-the-People session and raised an issue that he was facing.</p>
              <p>The MP responded by asking him "So what do you think is a good solution for your problem? I can write in to the govt if you know a solution"</p>
              <p>My friend was so pissed that he lambasted the MP at the session. "Why are you asking me for a solution? You guys are paid so much, and you don't even have a solution, and ask me how to solve my own problem? Then why do we need you guys for?"</p>
              <p>I really agree. Why do we pay them so much, when they cannot even give any solution?</p>
              <p>The issue is simple. My analogy of a 6-star hotel (our leaders' pay) demands 6 star service, so don't expect Singaporeans to think on their own and depend more on themselves, since these jokers are taking so much $$$</p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Although Singapore is not a feudal
                      society but one could not help by observing the parallel of
                      Patriarch Politics in Singapore society and the expectation of its
                      citizens; while overseas observers has long called Singapore a Lee
                      Dynasty for years. Aren't we all so tired of being Told by some
                      minister?</span></p>

              <p>P - 2</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">What happen is that kids that grew
                      up in America developed individual opinions much younger than kids
                      grow up in Asia. As such by age 13<sup>th</sup> – 14<sup>th</sup> ,
                      Parents could no longer exercise authoritarian right on the
                      children as if you were in Singapore.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Parenting in the US requires much
                      higher parenting skills sets and responsibilities as compared to
                      Singapore that depend on public social system. I think parenting
                      skills has been largely ignored in Singapore as both parents work
                      and maid was employed. (Sorry different Tangent off
                      topics)</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">But more importantly relationship
                      between Parents and children took a more “Adulthood” relationship
                      there is less interfering of adult lifestyle. The honoring of
                      parents is shown thru how they lead one’s life.</span></p>

                      -3</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">I
                      think it is socially wrong to assume because of the independent
                      nature of the society. Kids do not hold family relationship after
                      18yrs of age. As you would already know either in Thanks Giving and
                      Christmas is a busy travelling period in the US because they
                      returned home to be with their family. It is the same as CNY.

              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Plus it is hard to simplify
                      American cultured because of the diverse ethnicity from immigrant
                      throughout the world as such the single most common Day to mark
                      family, and appreciation is Thanks Giving Day.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">(And of course <span> </span>my Chinese co-worker called it Turkey Festival in
                      Cantonese) everyone that move here has a variety in the
                      depth of comprehending the merit of this society. what is important
                      is not what it should "represent" but how one use it to better
                      their lives. So Family A is always different from "B" .</span></p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>USA strength lies in its diversity. A person like sgdiehard, who relies on 3rd party doomsayers, will never be able to comprehend that, but will continue to delude himself that he is in the best place in the world.</p>
              <p>My boss was saying that somehow it seems that people who come to USA tend to get Americanized to some extent easily, and able to assimilate into the society relatively easily as compared to other societies (Try Japan, Korea, or Europe for eg)</p>
              <p>I think my wife made a very valid observation, when she said that USA is so diverse, attracting talents from all parts of the world, and each talent brings his or her culture to USA. USA then becomes a total mix of cultures, thus resulting in people getting Americanized in a relatively easier way. The American culture is a rojak mix of cultures from all over the world</p>
              <p>Some people over in the other side of the globe can argue until the cows come home, that USA will not be a superpower in the future, but the future lies in China. I firmly believe that there will come a time when USA and China will share the superpower status, but China will never become the sole superpower.</p>
              <p>The success of China lie in the Chinese race, which is known to be extremely intelligent. The success of USA lie in its diversity. One of my fave philosophies is "Within Chaos lies Order and within Order lies Chaos". China is as much Order as USA is Chaos on the with-out, and vice versa with-in.</p>

In a nutshell, it is to provide a peaceful decent life for its people. Societies used to have kings as their leaders, then government. If kings had done their job well, there would not have been any need for collective governance. Nobody wanted any change during the Kangxi rule, when China was power and prosperous. But in the late 18<sup>th</sup> century, Chinese monarchy was rotten to the root, even totally powerless to protect its people from the drug peddling nation. The need to change was imminent. What Sun was looking for in the new government? To provide peaceful and decent life for the people of China. This fundamental doesn’t not change.

The difference between the east and the west is how they are allowed to express and exercise their individual opinion.</span></span></p>

Adults don’t always exercise authoritarian rights.</span></span></p>

Many Singaporean parents leave parenting to schools, maids, and grandparents, and hold the government responsible even if they have no babies. </span></span></p>

The strength of bond and love is not demonstrated in a once a year gathering, or how much money or gift given out (Singaporean parents, or urban parents are more likely guilty of this).</span></span></p>
