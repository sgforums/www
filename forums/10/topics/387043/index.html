              <p><strong>By Cai Haoxiang</strong></p>
                              <p>WANT to work successfully in China? Bring with you skills the Chinese do not have, said Mr Lee Kuan Yew last night.</p>
                              <p>These can be an intimate knowledge of and links with parts of the world that matter to China, such as South-east Asia and Western countries like America, he said.</p>
                              <p>Minister Mentor Lee was responding to a question from Nanyang Technological University undergraduate Lin Wei Qi, who interned in Shanghai for six months last year and was interested to work in China again after graduating next year.</p>
                              <p>She asked: 'Other than bilingual and bicultural skills, what else do I need?'</p>
                              <p>Mr Lee replied in Mandarin that skills in language and culture would not be sufficient. For example, there is little point having Chinese-language abilities as good as those of the Chinese nationals when there is no shortage of people there with mastery in the language.</p>
                              <p>As an example of the value that Singaporeans can bring to China, he noted that at least 30 per cent of Singaporeans have had exposure to Western countries, while only 0.01 per cent of the Chinese have.</p>
                              <p>'They don't have your background. You bring something of value.'</p>
                              <p>Responding later to another question on whether Singapore should aim to develop an environment that is 'more Chinese' than today's in order to stay relevant to China, Mr Lee argued that one advantage that Singapore has over China is precisely that it is English-speaking.</p>
                              <p>This has enabled it to understand the world, making it a useful intermediary between China and the West.</p>
                              <p>For example, when former German chancellor Helmut Kohl wanted to know more about China, he would often talk to Mr Lee.</p>
                              <p>'Singapore has got to where it is by emphasising English,' he said.</p>
                              <p>While China's political leaders can speak to American leaders, they cannot do so on a more intimate basis, he said.</p>
                              <p>In any case, Mr Lee added, Singapore cannot be like China since its ethnic composition and geographical location are different from China's.</p>
                              <p>Singapore's biggest trading partners are Malaysia and the United States, he noted. China trade accounts for only a fifth of its Gross Domestic Product.</p>
                              <p>'Singapore cannot be a China. For one thing, we are in the tropics, surrounded by South-east Asia,' he said.</p>
                              <p>Earlier, asking his audience to bear with him while he switched from speaking in English to speaking in Mandarin, Mr Lee said that if his command of English was an A, his command of Chinese merited at best a C or D.</p>

[China Daily]<br><br>Construction companies and local authorities have come under fire after a big rupture was spotted in a main bridge that runs across one of Shanghai's waterways on Monday, barely two weeks after similar damage was found in a bridge in Jiangsu province.<br><br>Large chunks of concrete have fallen off one of the piers of the Henan Road Bridge, one of the busiest across the Suzhou Creek, opening up a crack about 4 m in length.<br><br>The bridge was renovated less than a year ago.<br><br>What provoked the city's residents further was the fact that authorities tried to fill up the crevice with construction rubble, including plastic foam and leather bags.<br><br>Workers were spotted repairing the bridge yesterday, even as all efforts to get a comment from Shanghai Foundation Engineering Co Ltd, the company that built the bridge, failed.<br><br>The Shanghai Urban Construction and Communications Committee, which oversees the city's construction quality, said that the structure of the bridge is safe and there are no potential safety hazards.<br><br>Traffic flow on the bridge has not yet been affected by the damage.<br><br>The committee said the crack was caused by the "subsidence of the earth-retaining wall" and only the surface decoration of the bridge required repairs.<br><br>But the assurance failed to appease local residents and construction experts, who pointed out that quality was being overlooked in China's race to construct, and there needs to be more supervision from the local authorities.<br><br>"It's against reason to use construction rubble for fillers within the pier if it is supposed to bear the load of the bridge," said Zeng Minggen, deputy director of the Department of Bridge Engineering at Tongji University.<br><br>Related readings:<br>Waste used to fill crack in bridge Crack could keep Bay Bridge closed 1 more workday<br>Waste used to fill crack in bridge Bridge collapse kills six, injures 12<br>Waste used to fill crack in bridge Govt: Overloading caused Tianjin bridge to collapse<br>Waste used to fill crack in bridge NE China's bridge collapse leaves one dead<br><br>"I think the construction company must have failed to do what the project design required in order to either meet the deadline or cut costs."<br><br>He added quality was an issue with many construction projects in China, as they are "usually rushed ahead to meet both deadlines and budgets".<br><br>"The problem lies not only with the construction companies, but also with the design and supervision parties who fail to do their part. Authorities need to strengthen regulations," he said.<br><br>The Xinmin Evening website cited a nearby resident as saying that the rift on the Henan Road Bridge had been discovered nearly half a year ago and that he is concerned about his safety every time he goes past it.<br><br>"What I couldn't understand is why a bridge renovated only less than a year ago would develop cracks," he said.<br><br>Earlier this month, a bridge in Nanjing, Jiangsu province, developed numerous cracks, which authorities later pasted with glue, raising many eyebrows. <br><br><br>Good Luck. <br><br><a href="http://forums.hardwarezone.com.sg/sh...oto=nextoldest"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #22229c;">http://forums.hardwarezone.com.sg/sh...oto=nextoldest</span></span></a></div>

              "While China's political leaders can speak to American leaders, they cannot do so on a more intimate basis, he said."
                  
                  I believe he meant the Chinese in china are politically more conservative than us, they prefer missionary positions while Ang Mohs prefer the other hole.
                  
                  Hence Singaporeans who are used to this can bring value to china by offering the other whole on China's behalf.

Whatever happen in the past, it cultivate what it is today, and if today we are still cultivating ourselves from the past to reach a future, I think we are doomed.

              <p>Tech-wise, so what if they can pirate a version of the iphone? Monkeys see monkeys do, is much easier than understanding the basis of a subject and being able to apply.</p>

              <p>Don't look down on our fellow countrymen, just for the sake of objecting to LKY's comments. I personally believe in our own people, otherwise, we would not be consistently ranked as one of the most productive workforce in the world.</p>

              <p><br>Hello, the main thing the chinese cannot cope with us is Corruption, Chinese for centuries fall from dynasty to dynasty because of Corruption and brutal ruling, by right, China has one of the longest history with dynasty after dynasty, kingdom after kingdom, it should be a world leader before even american or europe come around.</p>
              <p>Tech wise, in 10 years, we will not match them, trade and economy wise, we also cannot match them in term size and resources. The only thing left that we can win them, is Trust. That is why we are one of the best financial service sector in the world. Europe and american investing in China do not want Chinese accountants, they want, Singaporean or Hongkong accountants. Because Chinese accountants tend to massage the figure for their own good.</p>
              <p>In China, business is not run by trust, which most western or even asian get cheated, it is base on relationship, you need to build that relationship, that is why so many chinese students who are future business people in China are studying here so that our youngs can get to build relationship with them first, same goes to our youngs going to china for intern training. As such, when they grew up, the relationship and bonds is there.</p>
              <p>When Comfort started operation it fleet of taxis in China, shanghai, chinese drivers came in from all over provinces, trained and get licensed, rented the taxi to ply for their trade, just like our Singaporean taxi Uncle did, take a taxis lesson, rent out a taxi and do their business. But by the third day of operation, 50 taxis need not come back.....so much for the trust ya.</p>
