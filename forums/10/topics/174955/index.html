I'm skeptical. Wake up everybody. Is it me or does anyone find it curious, why there are so many coincidential in US politics ?  The expected villians always crop up when polls are waning or policies needs aproval.<br><br>Always needs a Bogey man. It's the same with Australlia and British. Coincidence.... when Tony Bliar fails to pass the patriot act version bill, the Queen gets a questionable threat. when Australia wants get involve with security with Indonesia.. the Bali blast.<br><br>I don't believe in too much coincidence - especially when the timings are concern. There are just too coincidential. Regarding the latest Bali blast, remember the video footage from a tourist. Well, I'm a tourist too, and when I saw it, I told myself - what the hell is he filming - walking into a restuarant filming floors and tables and kept on&amp;off trailing a man walking - then that blast. Almost delibrate.... I know I know... it's a sad and cruel to say this , since people had died, but that's how I felt when I saw it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>An interesting article</strong><br><br>Cheryl Seal<br>BIN LADEN TAPE PROBABLY FAKE<br>Fri Jan 20, 2006 11:27<br>64.12.116.133<br><br>Bin Laden Tape Probably Faked by CIA<br><br>Back in 2002, the Bush administration was chagrined when the world's foremost voice identification experts, a group in Swizterland called IDIAP analyzed several Bin Laden tapes and concluded that a "CIA-verified" bin Laden tape was NOT Bin Laden, but someone whose voice patterns resembled the terrorist's. Now again we have a Bin Laden tape that arrives just when Bush needs a "terrorist diversion." And once again, we have only the CIA "experts" verifying the authenticity. So why since 2002 hasn't the IDIAP been called in to verify these always conveniently timed tapes? And why is no CIA expert ever actually named?<br><br>And as further evidence of how closely the US media is colluding with Bush, journalists who once queried the institute for their opinion on the authenticity of bin Laden tapes are no longer doing so.<br><br>IDIAP website<br>report on faked 2002 tape:<br><a href="http://www.swissinfo.org/sen/swissinfo.html?siteSect=2251&amp;sid=1485474" rel="nofollow">http://www.swissinfo.org/sen/swissinfo.html?siteSect=2251&amp;sid=1485474</a><br><br>Duke University Bin Laden expert Bruce Lawrence, who is the head of Duke's religious department, also thinks the tape was faked.<br><br>ABC Eyewitness News in Raleigh Durham, NC reports:<br><br>"A Duke professor says he is doubtful about Thursday's audiotape from Osama bin Laden.Bruce Lawrence has just published "Messages to the World: The Statements of Osama Bin Laden," a book translating bin Laden's writing. He is skeptical of Thursday's message.<br><br>"It was like a voice from the grave," Lawrence said.<br><br>"He thinks bin Laden is dead and has doubts about the tape. Lawrence recently analyzed more than 20 complete speeches and interviews of the al Qaida leader for his book. He says the new message is missing several key elements.<br><br>""There's nothing in this from the Koran. He's, by his own standards, a faithful Muslim,<br>" Lawrence said. "He quotes scripture in defense of his actions. There's no quotation from the Koran in the excerpts we got, no reference to specific events, no reference to past atrocities."<br><br>"While the CIA confirms the voice on the tape is bin Laden's, Lawrence questions when it was recorded. He says the timing of its release could be to divert attention from last week's U.S. air strike in Pakistan. The strike targeted bin Laden's deputy, Ayman al-Zawahri, and killed four leading al Qaeda figures along with civilians.<br><br>"Lawrence believes faulty Pakistani intelligence led to the strike and the civilian deaths, and the tape was leaked by Pakistani authorities to divert attention from their mistake.<br><br>""It led to a failed military operation where America got blamed, but they people who are really to blame are the ones who provided the intelligence," Lawrence said. "I think this is an effort to say were not going look at this terrible incident that happened."<br><br>"Another element that Lawrence takes issue with in bin Laden?s latest message is it's length - - only 10 minutes. Previously, the shortest was 18 minutes.

            <div class='col-md body'>Previous to the 2004 election, Bin Laden surfaced on a video on the eve of the two year anniversary of 911. Once again impeccable timing to deliver a video, given that he was reported to be hiding in the mountains of Pakistan.<br><br>However, the video was quickly recognized by experts as simply a re-hash of old material cobbled together quickly and so amateurish that it could not have fooled anyone.<br><br>Previous to the beginning of the Iraq war, Bin Laden appeared in February 2003 on an audio tape that was touted as proof positive of Al Qaeda links with Saddam Hussein.<br><br>In another amazing timing coincidence, the tape came barely a week after Colin powell's attempts to link Al Qaeda and Saddam in his botched presentation of lies and exaggerations before the UN Security Council.<br><br>In an even more bizarre twist, just hours before the tape was found and aired by AlJazeera, Colin Powell announced in the US Senate that a Â“Bin Laden tape is coming proving IraqÂ’s links with Al-Qaeda.Â”<br><br>How does Colin Powell know what AlJazeera are going to broadcast before they do?<br><br>The tape voiced support for Iraq, but did not prove any link between al-Qaeda and the Iraqi leadership. It was described as dubious at best and at worst as an outright fake.<br><br>Previous to this tape a poor quality release in November 2002, deemed to be completely authentic by US Experts, was determined to be a total fake by the Dalle Molle Institute for Perceptual Artificial Intelligence in Switzerland.<br><br>This time Bin Laden was said to be admitting to recent small scale terror attacks. Yet the voice on the tape was different to around twenty previous recordings of Bin Laden.<br><br>And of course, then there is the all time classic Bin Laden video, the number one hit from december 2001. The one we like to call the "Fat nosed" Bin Laden video.<br><br><img src="http://www.prisonplanet.com/Pictures/jan06/200106fatnose.jpg"><br>This one was magically found in a house in Jalalabad after anti-Taliban forces moved in. It featured a fat Osama laughing and joking about how he'd carried out 9/11. The video was also mistranslated in order to manipulate viewer opinion and featured "Bin Laden" praising two of the hijackers, only he got their names wrong.<br><br>This Osama also uses the wrong hand to write with and wears gold rings, a practice totally in opposition to the Muslim faith.<br><br>Despite the fact that the man in the video looks nothing like Bin Laden, the CIA stood by the video whilst many have declared it an outright fake.<br><br>And so we come back to this week's tape, Osama's "latest release". Already experts are coming forward to suggest that yet again this is a fake that has been put out at a very convenient time to divert attention away from important events.<br><br>Professor Bruce Lawrence has described the tape as "like a voice from the grave".<br><br>He thinks bin Laden is dead and has doubts about the tape. Lawrence recently analyzed more than 20 complete speeches and interviews of the al Qaida leader for his book. He says the new message is missing several key elements.<br><br>We have previously highlighted the evidence to suggest that Bin Laden is dead. More and more experts are now coming forward with the same opinion. Every time a new tape is released it seems to become shorter and more vague as if whoever is making them is running out of material to work with .<br><br>If it is conceivable that there is one group of fundamentalist individuals who wish to change the way we live because "they hate our freedom", then it is equally as conceivable that there is another group of richer, more sophisticated fundamentalists that wish to do the same thing themselves and will use the first group as a cover for what they do.<br><br>They have groomed Bin Laden for their own ends and will continue to use his image (whether he is dead or not) until they no longer have a cause to, this is simply another example of his usefulness in the fake war on terror.<br><br></div>
