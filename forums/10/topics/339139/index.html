              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Benjamin Cheah / Andrew Loh</span></strong></p>
              <p><img class="alignleft" style="border: 3px solid black; margin: 13px; float: left;" src="http://i140.photobucket.com/albums/r19/theonlinecitizen/Pictures%20Posted%20on%20TOC/Government/Town%20Councils/tcs220.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="170"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Each
              town council has the duty to explain to its residents how it invests
              its funds, what is its philosophy, what are the risks it takes.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">- Mr. Mah Bow Tan, Minister for National Development.<a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/Breaking%2BNews/Singapore/Story/STIStory_305797.html">(Straits Times)</a> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Mr Mah added:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span class="apple-style-span"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: black;">And demonstrate that it has made those decisions in a manner which is fair, reasonable and which residents would agree with.</span></strong></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span class="apple-style-span"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Senior
              Minister of State for National Development, Grace Fu, made similar
              remarks when she was asked about town councils’ investments:</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span class="apple-style-span"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">We should ask the town councils and it is something the residents should pose to their respective town councils. <a href="http://www.todayonline.com/articles/287786.asp">(Today)</a></span></strong></span><span class="apple-style-span"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: #555555;"> </span></span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong></strong></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">The Online Citizen (TOC) decided to put the ministers’ words to the test.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">On November 25<sup>th</sup>, TOC urged readers to write in to the town councils’ chairpersons, using a <a href="http://theonlinecitizen.com/2008/11/accounting-for-town-councils-investments-do-your-part/">template letter</a>,
              to enquire about the town councils’ investments. It has been a week
              since and twenty-two such letters have been sent out via e-mail to 13
              of the 14 PAP town councils. (No letter was sent to East Coast GRC town
              council.)</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Of these,  a grand total of three replies were received (as at 2300 hours, Monday, Dec 1).</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Below,
              quoted in full, are the replies we have received thus far. The first is
              from Mdm Cynthia Phua, Member of Parliament for Aljunied Group
              Representative Constituency. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Thank you for your interest on Aljunied Town Council.<span> </span>I have noted that you are a private estate resident. The </span></strong><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Aljunied</span></strong><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"> </span></strong><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Town</span></strong><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"> Council manages only HDB estates. We noted that the questions that you
              are asking are similar questions circulated to all the Town Councils.
              You may wish to access to [sic] www.Aljuniedgrc.sg for some of the
              information. </span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">The second is from Mr. Inderjit Singh from Ang Mo Kio GRC, quoted here ad verbatim:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">We have full transparency of all town council<em> </em>accounts. We publish and annual report which is submitted to parliament and is easily available for public<em> </em>to
              see. Also, we put up details on our TC notice boards. All the other
              questions can be easily answered by looking at he town council act<em> </em>which show who are qualified and who is responsible for managing things. </span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">I am sure you will get all the answers you need from the above.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">The third reply is from the Public Relations Officer of Hong Kah GRC:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">We
              have redirected your query to the attention of our Finance Department.
              They will look into your query and give you a reply as soon as possible.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">The
              first reply is disingenuous; it answers nothing. The second is
              remarkably incomplete. The third well, is “re-directed” to the finance
              department.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">Mr.
              Singh says that the Town Council’s accounts are fully transparent, and
              the annual reports are available for all to see. But TOC cannot even
              find the words ‘Lehman Brothers’ in these reports. Of the Town Councils
              Act, the only useful titbit was that Town Councils may invest their
              funds “in accordance with the standard investment power of statutory
              bodies”. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">Mr.
              Mah has charged the Town Councils with a duty to explain how they have
              invested their funds. The two replies from the MPs, mentioned above,
              are not explanations; they are, instead, excuses for excuses in lieu of
              answers.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">But at least Aljunied, Ang Mo Kio and Hong Kah town councils have replied to the queries. What about the other town councils?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">One
              of those who wrote to question his town council had been doing so since
              29 October. It was only after four weeks, four emails (including three
              reminders to the town council) that he received a reply. And what was
              the reply?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-left: 0.5in; text-align: left;"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">The
              Town Council has uploaded our latest Annual Report, a copy of our reply
              to the forum page as well as FAQs on the Town Council Investments on
              our website…</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">The
              letter writer was so furious that he wrote back, “This is, by any
              standards, a very low level of service response. I have yet to require
              any other form of assistance from the Town Council, but if this is a
              gauge,” he said, “then I dread the time when I would need to rely on
              your services.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align: left;"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">Right to answers</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">Elected
              representatives are answerable to their constituents. Elections are not
              meant for people to choose their own dictators or for their elected
              representatives to behave like one. We have chosen our Members of
              Parliament, and as they are not answering our queries about such an
              important matter in which millions of tax-payers’ dollars are at stake,
              they have shown that they are not doing the jobs we have chosen them to
              do, even though they have signalled their willingness to do so by
              joining a political party and running for elections. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">It
              is our right to expect, and demand, answers from the people we have
              chosen to lead our communities and represent our interests. It is
              nothing less than their duty.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">But so far, our MPs have not done their jobs.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align: left;"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">The next step</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">The
              continued non-answer replies from both the co-ordinating chairman of
              the 14 PAP town councils and from the PAP MPs themselves are making a
              mockery of our two ministers who, effectively, have openly and publicly
              called for the town councils to explain to residents their investments.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">So
              far, reporters, residents and netizens have asked Dr Teo Ho Pin,
              co-ordinating chairman of the PAP town councils, and the PAP MPs to
              account for their investments’ losses or profits.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">None have provided any meaningful or substantive answers.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">Even <a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/ST%2BForum/Story/STIStory_308738.html">Straits Times forum letter-writers</a> are not fooled by Dr Teo’s beat-about-the-bush antics. </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-left: 0.5in; text-align: left;"><span class="apple-style-span"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: black;">…
              no mention was made of how town councils intend to make good on the
              loss and avoid repeating this anomaly. If it cannot be recovered, do we
              write off the millions as extraordinary expenses like a business
              concern? Whether town councils are to be treated as non-profit or
              business entities, Dr Teo should be more open with HDB home owners who,
              as stakeholders of estate funds, have the right to know.</span></strong></span><strong></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">It
              seems that even ministers’ words mean nothing to PAP MPs, and
              ministers’ public statements are not taken seriously. In the end, our
              ministers are made to look like fools – by their own MPs.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">Please
              continue to e-mail your TCs and demand answers. Please cc a copy of any
              and all replies to us, to enable us to keep track of responses.
              Singaporeans deserve accountability from our constituency managers –
              and not be brushed aside.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">And
              Members of Parliament should be more forthcoming in being transparent
              and accountable to those who voted them into Parliament. This is the
              very same thing which Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong urged residents in
              Hougang to do with the Hougang Town Council run by the Workers’ Party
              MP, Mr Low Thia Kiang:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-left: 0.5in; text-align: left;"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">In Hougang, let us keep Mr Low Thia Khiang on his toes.  He is responsible for running the </span></strong><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">Hougang</span></strong><strong></strong><strong> </strong><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">Town</span></strong><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000;"> council. But unlike Parliament, town councils do not have open meetings
              where members from other political parties can question their
              performance. So, in Hougang, you have to be creative to be an effective
              opposition. Amongst the things you can do, I suggest you study the
              annual accounts of the town council to ensure that the funds are
              properly used. </span></strong><strong></strong><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000;"> </span></strong><a href="http://app.sprinter.gov.sg/data/pr/20080726989.htm"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">(Sprinter)</span></a><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000;"> </span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">Why then are SM Goh’s own party colleagues keeping mum about their town councils’ investments?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align: left;"><em><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">In the next article, TOC does what the Town Councils have advised - <span> </span>to take a look at their annual reports. </span></em></p>
