              <p>Sorry guys, i wasnt clear enough, my point was that the oil prices will continue to skyrocket and a small drop in price is like a small and short lived change. On a graph, you will see the oil prices keep going up like a diagonal line that zig zags its way but mostly upward, and we cant afford to expect sbs or smrt to change the fares everytime the zig zag faces downward for a short period of time. Cmon... if you hate PAP, you should at least consider practicality and mathematical significances of the issue.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>On the other hand, yes i do agree that public transport is too expensive and should be reduced to a "no frills" kind of system. do we really need those fancy pants extra services? I'd rather take non-aircon bus and change bus at a non-aircon crappy garbage filled interchange with rude and inconsiderate bus drivers in exchange for cheaper fares.</p>
              <p>i think the next election, pap will again dominate, not only because of their undemocratic techniques but also because we singaporeans (me included) are too stupid and tend to fall for their traps. wait and see, when they give ang bao again, they will increase your public transport fares and gst again. No point whining when you still vote them.</p>

              <p>SBS increase public transport fares,</p>
              <p>profit from SBS goes to temasek holdings or GIC,</p>
              <p>then profit from temasek holdings or GIC goes to govt?</p>
