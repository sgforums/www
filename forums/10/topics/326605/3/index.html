              <p>Why has inflation increased so much during this 1-2 years?</p>
              <p>1) GST increases last year</p>
              <p>2) Influx of immigrants due to government's policy of increasing population to 6 million.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There are other reasons for the increases, but the first 2 reasons are more directly related to the government's 7.5% inflation rate.</p>
              <p>Other reasons</p>
              <p>3) Increases in fuel cost</p>
              <p>4) Price increases in food commodity</p>
              <p>5) Maintaining a dirty float</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When inflation goes up, almost everything goes up, so most of us here would rather they maintain inflation at 1% to 2%.</p>
              <p>Nobody has been that illogical as cited by you, it's just that during these 1-2 years prices have gone up tremendously as a result of the government's policies. I don't recall folks complaining so much before the 2004 general elections.

              <p>Increasing transport fares by 3% is taking place this year as compared to 1<span style="color: #ff6600;">% to 2% increase last year</span> in the midst of high inflation.   This is the sort of "kind and considerate" govt we have.    Come on, there is an increase in the number of people taking public transport, the public transport companies are gaining because of this increase.   There is definitely no good reason to increase fares during this high inflation.    Can you help solve this by requesting the govt not to increase fares?</p>

              <p>Don't exaggerate, not everyone blame the Pay and Pay for

              <p>Increasing transport fares by 3% is taking place this year as
              compared to 1<span style="color: #ff6600;">% to 2% increase last
              year</span> in the midst of high inflation.   This
              is the sort of "kind and considerate" govt we have.   
              Come on, there is an increase in the number of people taking public
              transport, the public transport companies are gaining because of
              this increase.   There is definitely no good
              reason to increase fares during this high
              inflation.    Can you help solve this by requesting
              the govt not to increase fares?</p>

              <p>Actually you know what people. Its ok to complain. I would be a hypocrite if I said that I dun complain about the rising prices, I am afterall just a consumer.

              <p>For eg, lhl said increasing GST by 2% to help the poor, but till now we know nothing has been done about it.    This is  fact and not accusation to blame the gahmen.   </p>
