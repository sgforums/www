              <div class="post-body entry-content" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.75em; margin-left: 0px; line-height: 1.3em;">Ladies and Gentlemen,<br><br>Lee Kuan Yew's state controlled Singapore newspaper the Straits Times of Jan 21, 2011, which will print any garbage he wants anytime he wants, since he owns it afterall, reports him having confessed that his PAP government, the same one that has strutted around like a prize rooster in his personal island for the last 52 years will not last after all! It is the story titled "Will PAP last?".<br><br>I reckon the 89 year octogenarian, with one foot firmly in the grave, realises after all that going around bankrupting his opponents, jailing them for 26 years and defaming anyone and everyone he dislikes is not the way to go. <br><br>Perhaps he finally realizes that going about abusing the law as a political tool with the collaboration of corrupt judges such as Belinda Ang Saw Ean was a mistake. Perhaps he also finally realises that even Singaporeans have what we call a head on their shoulders and a thing called a brain within it, which can at times advice it's owner that being bullied is unacceptable. We never know what has gone through that same head of the octogenarian in this confession. <br><br>He is reported to have said "There will come a time when eventually the public will say, look, let's try the other side, either because the PAP has declined in quality or the opposition has put up a team which is equal to the PAP and they say, lets try the other side. That day will come". Let me tell you that Lee Kuan Yew is being rather dishonest here. We all know that he will never let Singaporeans decide anything and he will never let the people have the choice of choosing a government, for he is a man who does not believe in democracy nor respect for his people whom he has repeatedly called "digits". Digits are idiots, and that is what he thinks you Singaporeans are. <br><br>He will continue to manipulate the elections, as he has always done, and if necessary rig the votes to ensure his son continues in power after him. But unfortunately for him, and I think he knows it too, such dirty tricks cannot forever ensure PAP's power. The PAP will not be overthrown by the ballot box, it will be overthrown by another Tunisian uprising. <br><br>The reason why the PAP will fall, as with all the other tyrants who were overthrown is the people's distrust and hatred of the government, while the government on it's part rules not with the support of it's people but through their fear of them. This has been the case with the Soviet Union, with all the Eastern European Soviet bloc countries, and now we see it with Tunisia. <br><br>As the Tunisian people hated their government, the Singaporeans hate theirs. As the Tunisian judiciary was corrupt, so is the Singaporean judiciary. As the politically connected in Tunisia prospered through government contracts, so do those in Singapore connected to the PAP. As the Tunisians hated the corruption of their leaders, so does Lee Kuan Yew and his family when they pay themselves $3.7 million each and much more secretly. As in Tunisia when the rich drove around in million dollar cars while the poor starved, so does Lee Kuan Yew and his friends in power while the poorer Singaporeans almost starve. <br><br>The average Singaporean is so stressed up that he is unable to marry anyone, nor to have children and given the choice are packing up and leaving permanently for the West. There is no social welfare and if you fall into dire straits, Lee Kuan Yew tells you that it is your own fault. Many in desperation take their own lives by jumping on to trains and jumping off high rise apartments. <br><br>I am not sure that Belinda Ang Saw Ean may have seen the writing on the wall and is packing off to China or somewhere else that will take her but we will not be surprised if she did, especially since the octogenarian himself has now publicly admitted the impending demise of his government which nourises women like her. <br><br>Ladies and gentlemen, you can if you want expedite the coming of the change which we all know will happen sooner or later by taking to the streets now. Hold up banners and buntings reading boldly across "We want another Tunisia".<br><br><em>Gopalan Nair</em></div>
