So it is very unlikely that Singaporeans are willing do donate no matter what kind of dangerous stun they do.<br>Only two possibilities:<br><br>1)the digits shown up there is faked. I myself personally is a programmer, i can easily faked the jumping digits up there. Those who study engineering or Electronics and do this very simply.<br>2)Only those gullible FTs go and donate...<br><br>Everyone still remembered that TT Durai TT-ed your money to Dubai, after crying mother father in front of your TV screen, making you foolishly donate.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Sad-looking faces of all the actors/actress right behind the host</strong></span><br>First thing i want to ask u guys:<br>WHY ARE ALL THE ACTORS/ACTRESS STANDING BEHIND THE HOST? instead of resting at the backstage...?<br>Most probable answer: They should be asked by the director to stand behind the host.<br><br>Second Question:<br>These actors/actress showed a sulky SAD face at the background, behind the host.<br>One thing to remember is: When an actor cries, u will never know he is crying for real or not? When an actor laughs, u'll never know if he is really happy.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Camera showing audiences picking up handphone to call</strong></span><br>When the host strongly urged everyone to make a phone call, the VERY NEXT MOMENT, the cameras was tuned to several audiences making a phonecall on their handphone.<br><br>I personnally have attended numerous seminars, public talks, speeches, etc etc... As everyone knows, Singaporeans are usually shy audiences. When asked about a question like "How many of u have invested in XYZ Stocks market before?" Very few people raised their hands although i am confident that there must be a lot more people...<br><br>Here in Renci charity, the very next moment spontaneously, BOTH THE CAMERAMAN SHOOTING AT THE AUDIENCE, and the SPONTANEOUS AUDIENCE HIMSELF was dialing, isn't it too obvious that the whole show was pre-planned?<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Gurmit using force tactic to demand phonecalls</strong></span><br>Gurmit Singh was like scolding and demanding, like an extortion manner, and he says that "I WANT ALL OF YOU TO PICK UP YOUR PHONE AND CALL AS MANY TIMES AS U CAN.....". Isn't this too image spoiling?<br><br>There is a possibility that the safety rope helped pull the monk up, rather than the monk using his own strength to pull up...<br>Well, for this, i may be right, may be wrong, i do not have evidences.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>LAST BUT NOT LEAST...</strong></span><br><br>1)Monks dun live in condo, drive BMW, monks only live in temple...<br>2)THe NKF story is still fresh in everyone's mind, it is not possible that Singaporeans still foolishly donate, unless i m wrong, Singaporeans are still sillyporeans, even after fooled for 40years since independence...<br></div>

Unless you have concrete proof, i think it is relatively pointless, immature and foolish to make such remarks...
