Get some prove and facts here if it is true.<br><br>After the the NKF issues, there were few reports and interviews about Ren Ci CEO and his pay, cars, etc..... as what was reported, his salary is not paid by Ren Ci Hospital, but from the temples which he is in charge and the amount, can't remember how much, is less than 5 figure.  As for the car, not sure, but certainly, he is not only in charge of temples in SG, also some in MY, HK too...<br><br>Well, I have seen monks driving cars in SG so regularly. So not alarming to see him having one, but if really any truth about him as claimed, it won't be long that it might be out open for everyone to know.

Especially when you have safety equipement and rope on your body, it have to juggle with it not forgetting there is only one way up for your hand., which is up.
