So how long would these $28m last? 2-3 years maybe. 10 years or forever? Certainly not. Given that no one can predict when the next economic downturn will occur, isnt it prudent that they have some buffer to cover their yearly ward expenditure of $10m?<br><br>2) By saying '<span style="text-decoration: underline;">they charged S$80 per Doc care for 4 rooms HDB flat</span>', i hope you are not generalizing it to the 1/2/3 rooms flats.

I certainly dont claim that i do.<br><br>3) You can go on rattling and comparing about how similar Renci is to old NKF, but the fact is that they are two totally different entities.<br><br>4) Lastly, have you actually been to Renci to see how they operate or how they are going to manage their reserves?
