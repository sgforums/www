But i can believe tat, those artiste expression is fake. As they think tat, by showing this kind of face, more calls will cum in. But it is ridiculous lor... Now the economic is so bad still ask ppl to call.<br><br>3. How you feel about the gurmit singh? I feel he is too harsh for his tone of talking. He sounds like reprimanding ppl like tis leh. Abit too harsh. Dun u think so?<br><br>4. The monk also shouldn't take up the challenge in the first place. As, he is quite old and the strength is not enough but yet he give himself 10 mins to finish it is it? It is ridiculous for mediacorp to give him this challenge.</div>
