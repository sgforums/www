            <div class='col-md body'>What exactly is terrorism and who are today's terrorists?<br>According to the CIA: a terrorist is an individual or part of an organisation which uses threat or violence, to shock,stun, or intimidate a target group wider than the immediate victims.<br><br>Well, looks like both the Middle East and US fall into this category then.<br><br>According to George Bush Snr in 1986, terrorism's purpose is to intimidate or coerce a government, individuals, or groups, or to modify their behaviour and politics.<br><br>Again, both the Middle East and US can be categorised as terrorists. This is even before the US has started its attacks, because it has intimidated the Arabs already.<br><br>I find it disturbing that South-East Asia is a haven for terrorist or terrorist wannabes.For example, the Abu Sayaaf movement is said to have extremely strong ties with the Afghan network. There are members in the Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia and parts of Thailand. Thus, it can be seen that politically unstable countries are breeding grounds for future terrorists.Even Thailand, a predominantly Buddhist country, has succumbed to the infiltration of Muslim fanatics.The only way we can avoid this kind of infiltration is to tolerate and (hopefully) appreciate all races and religions.<br><br>------------------<br>'Tis better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all. -- Alfred Lord Tennyson</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think the main difference is that terrorists fight and threaten for their faith and belief, but for no other reason, and this is quite ridiculous.<br><br>On the other hand, the US coerce others so that it can gain advantage in military, economically and politically. They haf a motive in mind and will benefit a lot from wat they do. Furthermore, they maintain the world peace by keeping arms control on other countries. They threaten and coerce if they think the other countries do not listen or are threatening the world peace.<br><br>Does that answer ur question a bit?<br>I did a project on terrorism last yr, think stil haf what I typed out for cyber-terrorism, which is wat i did for my grp.
