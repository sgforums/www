            <div class='col-md body'>Actually the news from Sg was first reported that it would not need to renew the contract that would expire next year, 2011.  The reason was Sg has enough water.  This is all politics, lah.   We do not want to buy, they do not want to sell.   Anyway, the raw water from JB is the cheapest source and if politics can  be put aside, both sides will gain.   But you know, politicians are hard headed so the problem will not go away.   However, the ordinary people on both sides do have problem, lah.  They still visits each other country.</div>

                  litre in our tap water. This is well within the WHO's prescribed
                  safety level," he said.<br> <br> Some 40 countries, including the US, Australia, New Zealand and
                  Ireland have water fluoridation schemes in place.<br> <br> Singapore's Fluoride Review Committee meets regularly to review the
                  appropriate and safe concentration level of fluoride in drinking
                  water.<br> <br> Mr Khaw said their conclusion was that dental fluorosis is not
                  prevalent in Singapore, and is only of minor aesthetic
                  concern.<br> <br> Dental fluorosis is a health condition caused by a child receiving
                  too much fluoride during tooth development.<br> <br> In its mild form, it appears as tiny white streaks or specks that
                  are often unnoticeable.<br> <br> In its severe form, it is characterized by black and brown stains,
                  as well as cracking and pitting of the teeth.<br> <br> - CNA/jy</span></span></p>
