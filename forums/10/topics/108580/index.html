            <div class='col-md body'>The Straits Times Â– 21 Dec 04<br><br>Causeway was built to Â“boost Singapore at JohorÂ’s expenseÂ”<br><br>Â“<strong>Singapore developed into a business and port hub because the Causeway was built by British colonists who wanted to curb the potential growth of southern Johor, the Menteri Besar of Johor has said</strong>.Â”<br><br>If it is true, then the government must really study hard into the proposal put forth by Malaysia in the replacement of the Causeway by a straight bridge.  Do we allow most ship to bypass Singapore using the "whatsitsname"; johor port?<br><br><strong>If the Causeway is replaced by a bridge, Singapore Ports have to fight for the survival by better service and lower costs to retain the existing shipping lines and attract new lines.</strong><br><br>The move by MPA to lower the tariff is in the right direction, albeit in a very small step.<br><br>Bigger steps should be taken by the Government.  The overall cost of doing business in Singapore should come down and come down fast.<br><br>Lucky for Singapore that even if the Causeway is to be replaced by a bridge, the hazard and travelling time through the channel will be much bigger and longer than coming to Singapore Ports.<br><br>With the more efficient service provided by PSA over time (new port development, new equipment, new management with new thinking), the balance should tip in favour to Singapore.<br><br>Hope the government can help in reducing costs as well as help in infrastructure support to PSA and the survival of Singapore.<br><br></div>

Did the Brits really thought Singapore, a small island, would develop into a separate nation from the Malay peninsular? And why should they favor Singapore? At that time, the best way was to dump soil and built the causeway. Abdul Gani is picking up the shits Mahathir left behind. With the piling from the abandoned seafront city along the west coast of JB sticking out like sore thumbs, now with a big land cleared for nothing, Abdul is having problem answering his people.<br><br>Now lau Goh told pak Lah after 2011 we will not renew the water agreement and after 2065 we will be truly self sufficient in water, and with Changi air base operational the need to fly over johore is no longer a matter, what other cards does Abdul have to play? Cannot blame Singapore liao so blame the British lah. After all, the Brits responsible for the causeway died long time ago.<br>A bridge replacing the causeway will only benefit the some people in Malaysia who got the contract to build the bridge. Singaporean will have to pay money for nothing, the Malaysian traveling by bus will have to take a long, long walk just to reach Singapore.<br><br>Port business will be least affected by the new bridge. Stupid are those who took Adbul Gani seriously.<br></div>

Before PTP, no one in the government ever once mentioned there was any high cost problems.<br><br>When big carriers stopped calling at PSA ports, in 2002 and incomes of PSA started dropping, then and only then had PSA or ministers realized there was a high cost problem. Yeo Ning Hong first arrogantly refered to Singaore's PSA fees and charges as competitive on service and not on costs to justify its past "don't bother" attitude about high costs.<br><br>Next, HDB had been very smug all the years about its housing program - to build more flats more designed flats etc. No botheration about public moneis or high costs.<br><br>Then Journalist Lee Han Shih (of Lee foundation) who needed not to depend on journalism for a living wrote a long report in the Straits Times about HDB losing millions and in the red and its staff 2,000 being a drain on public monies. Up to then, none of the ministers who were supposed to be scholars to help Singaporeans to be competitive never mentioned such high cost problems with HDB.<br><br>Again, it was the same with SIA. It was only after frightening SIA's losses hitting headlines due to budget airlines' lower prices that there would be an admission of high cost problem by ministers or MM Lee. Actions were taken on pilots instead of government high cost policies.<br><br>So far so good. Economy recovered due to external market's recovery. Credits were given to ministers and government policies became important again one by one and big bonuses paid. Radio 958 listeners were so pissed off with the 2.3/4 months' bonus that they practically condemned all the government for self-rewarding.<br><br>Singaporeans once again would be lectured as if they are the ones to improve to make Singapore competitive but not the slowness of ministers in recognizing or reacting to high costs affecting all the government departments.<br><br>Must there be one minister for one issue within PMO? Must there be double staffing for HDB and Town councils, PA and CDCs.<br><br>Prices and fees would be allowed to go up no further actions to follow up addressing the PSA- HDB- or SIA- type high costs- hidden but unreported.<br><br>I would admire any civil servant or minister for his or her gut to dare to write like Lee Han Shih to his department to reduce over-staffing and over-promotions or for abolitions of so many committees to excuse primary officers like permanent secretaries paid hundreds of thousands' salary to solve them.<br><br>Savings on unnecessary costs can then be passed back to people's medical and retirement piggie banks to help in retirements. Foreigners like PTP, Mahathir or budget airline chiefs are actually doing Singaporeans a favour because none of the civil servants or ministers would have the gut to bring up to MM, SM or PM.<br><br>For a start, let's hear if PA/CDC/Town council would do their jobs like the private sector or MNCs - cut back on double staff to handle the same problems as HDB has found out after huge losses. Ngiam Tong Dow senior civil servant now after retiring realizes that he cannot make monies for HDB Corp to pay for civil servants once privatized. That means all government departments may be spending excessively as witness by such HDB losses.<br><br>Estates are deteriorating anyway. All must ask their MP what benefits have Town council/CDC/PA and all the mayors (additional promotions) brought. They should do more with less - the new formula for success. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

Initially also thought so PTP are good.<br><br>Maersk bought some 30% of PTP that why they stop at that port. Reason..... in this case every ship they stop there saves 30%.<br><br>If the bridge is not mean for big big ship what is the purpose to build it? Why waste so much $$$ for some small boat to crossover? And i guess that will be only a ship passing at the bridge at a time.<br>I have driven from Taman Perling to the opposite of Tuas and it took 20 minutes of distance. And i also stuck before on the 2nd bridge for 1 hours after paying 4 times the cost of causeway. Another 20 minutes are need to travel from JB donwtown to Taman Perling. Is it worth? spend so many times, so many petrol and still stuck in the Jam(only 2 lane each side with few custom booth).<br><br>PTP is belong to a Arab merchant who got lots of project from m'sia government.<br>Is it justtificable to make him richer with the cost of both spore and malaysian government $$$ and also burden the citizen?<br>He susgested the idea, so i think PTP shall pay and bear the cost right?<br><br>The fees shall be same at RM2.4 and S$1.2 with the excess paid by that PTP for each motorist travel in and out. I would assume the new cost will be some 4 to 5 times higher as the second link which was build years back is already so expensive and almost 3x the toll charges.<br><br>What about pollution, oil spill?<br><br>Are any of the CENTRAL and FEDERAL ppl think of that? Economics are already not doing good yet they wanna burden the ppl. Do they think of their poor Johorean where hundred of thousand of ppl travel in and out everyday. The causeway is the median to their rice bowl. And thousand of sporean who were dispatch to work in Johor for those factory and offices?<br><br>It will be great if any of the both side minister travel at those working hours like 5am to 9am and 5pm to 8pm. Let them stuck in the traffics of motorcycles, busses, walking ppl, lorries, cars and also custom. The amount of traffics is tremendious and dismantling the cause is fatal. Let them know the ppl hardship.<br><br>There was a time where was a suggestion to build a open up type bridge. What will the jams be like if bridge was open-up for the ship to went pass?<br>From JB custom to Pelangi? or from Spore custom to few klilometres(over Kranji racecourse) of BKE.</div>
