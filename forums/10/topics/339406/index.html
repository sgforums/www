              <p>I have a video of PM Lee sitting down at a dining table, eating mee siam with hum. He was overheard saying "delicious!" and "all your hums are belong to me." Halfway through his meal, he was joined by SM Goh, and after flipping through the menu, he ordered a mee rebus with hum and orange juice. While waiting for his meal to arrive, MM Lee came. MM Lee ordered a mee soto with hum and green tea. Surprisingly, both the food they ordered came at the same time. They ate a few mouthfuls, and President Nathan came. He said "mee goreng with hum, and a glass of water." While President was waiting for his food, MM Lee looked at his food and said, with tears dwelling in his eyes, "all my life, my entire life, I have worked so hard for these hums." President Nathan's food came, and he looked quite happy. SM Goh looked at all of the food, took a deep breath, and said, "I have the biggest hums." PM and MM Lee glared at him, while President Nathan tucked into his meal happily. When President Nathan was halfway eating his food, he stood up, still with food in his mouth, and started singing "thats the way a ha a ha I like it a ha a ha, thats the way a ha a ha I like it a ha a ha..." He was singing and dancing, and PM Lee told him to "stop it" while MM Lee told him to "shut up." President Nathan showed a black face but they didnt bother, because his face was always black.</p>

              <p>I cannot show the video because it would destory Singapore as all PAP supporters would rush to eat hums, leaving opposition supporters with no hums to eat. My char kway teow would have zero hums too.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/sad.png" alt="sad.png"></p>
