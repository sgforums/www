Not only that, without knowing the story, they jump to the conclusion that the S'porean who got manhandled by the Indonesian officer is to blame.

This is against common law as we understand it.</blockquote>yeah... common law... in a perfect world. this is forever a point that is open to interpretation... they are allowed to "restrain" u if (a) u resist arrest and/or (b) your behavior poses a danger to yourself and others. "restrain" is a very loosely interpreted term... lets not forget: in such situations, its their word against yours. it even happens in singapore! u seem to be living in a dream world.<br><br><blockquote>The comments by CX and Viper 52 are just typical of the ugly S'poreans whom they are criticizing.  They should not at themselves and do some soul searching.  </blockquote>i'm being ugly by urging restraint and seeking both sides of the story before passing judgement?<br><br>i'm being ugly by proposing that we should try our best to avoid conflict while overseas because we are guests in other people's country?<br><br>u're being politically correct by being belligerent, legalistic and unrealistic in your intepretation of the law?<br><br><blockquote>I hope they don't get into the same problem when they visit Indonesia and for that matter any country.</blockquote>i travel often. i take care of myself by not being an asshole, facilitating the immigration officer's work by ensuring that my documents are in order and by not flouting and obvious laws.<br><br>corruption exists. they seek bribes sometimes but what they want is $$$, not trouble. if u wanna be an arsehole about it, of course they'll hoot you!<br><br><blockquote>They may be following the laws of that country but sometimes some officers may just take on them because they carry S'pore passport.<br>It will be iteresting to know how they feel at that particular moment.<br>HaHa.
