If found true, the government should send a protest note to the Indonesian government and demand the immigration officer concerned to be reprimanded.<br>We must protect our citizens from being bullied by any quarters.<br>Perhaps, we ought to form an NGO to take care of such things as sometimes the government seems to be lacklustre in this micro issue.</div>

THen when we leaving Jakarta for Singapore, the Indonesian immigration guy told us to go to his office cos he wanted to speak to us about our passport visas or something. THen we went to his office with him, and then there was 1 buffy security guard there, very intimidating. Then the immigration guy said there was a problem with our visa and we cant return to Indonesia or something, this whole thing in his office took like 1 hour or something, immigration guy told my mum she had to pay him like $150 to clear the matter up. My mum was angry and argue with him lor, i also got restless and play with the chair (go round and round; 1 HOUR LEHhhhh). THen the immigration guy said i was nottie and he would hit me. MY mum got so furious she scolded him and said she was not paying, she would complain and that she did not need to pay cos we did not intend to return to Jakarta anyway. Then in the end, the immigration guy said to my mum something like "Gimme rupia buy coffee lar".

Yet here some of us are advocating doing the same to Indonesia. A little double standards here aren't we?<br><br>No doubt the Indonesian law enforcement and justice system is rubbish, but then the fact of the matter remains that each sovereign nation has their own laws and we should respect that just like we want other countries to respect ours.

Again, is that very hard for you to understand?<br><br><strong>Next time when you kena the same thing, don't expect us to come to your rescue.</strong><br><br>I don't. Unlike you I think I can look after myself and don't need momma to come to my rescue just because I get into a little trouble abroad. Send me a representative to make sure that my rights are looked after, by all means, but don't go hysterical and ruin the ties between 2 countries on my account like you are suggesting for this chap.<br><br><strong>This is nationhood,without which we are very insecured.</strong><br><br>So how secure does our government and million-dollar ministers make those Singaporeans whose rice bowl have been shattered by their Foriegn-Labour-Disguised-As-Foreign-Talents scheme?<br><br>You need not answer all my questions, just answer me this; How would you feel about Western countries kicking up a fuss and condemning Singapore for executing their nationals who smuggle drugs into Singapore? If you're angry at these countries, then why are you advocating we do the same to other countries? Why the double standard?<br><br>Do not do unto others what you do not want to done unto you.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>&amp; dn't expect to find a little "Singapore" in other countries!! Believe that there are other places further than Sentosa or Woodlands that runs differently. Dn't think as narrow as a one way lane at Bugis with added parked cars. I agree.. if youre on business, vacation or both... avoid confrontations with the authorities &amp; dn't behave as if u own the place.

            <div class='col-md body'>DiSjUstheStArt, well said.<br><br>I have seen quite a few ugly Singaporeans during overseas trips, always comparing what they see in foreign countries to what their experience is like in Singapore.<br><br>Amazing that they cannot accept conditions as they are in the foreign countries, and continuously make critical comparisons that belittle the host countries (even if spoken privately).<br><br>The other UGLY Singaporeans that I have met are some of those who hold cheap membership across the border in Batam, Johor and further up the Peninsula Malaysia.<br><br>These cheap Singaporeans, who cannot afford the high membership entry fees of the Country Clubs in Singapore, seems to act like "Royalty" with their almighty Singapore Dollar.<br><br>At the Club Houses across the border, they can be seen banging on the table, or clap their hand in sharp commanding way, to call the attention of the service staff, instead of waiting for service; or they will shout across the room to embarass the staff for slow service. The Singaporean can publicly scold the service staff for the most minor of reason, with themselves seated and the staff standing with hands behind the back - as if their membership entitle them to do so.<br><br>Little wonder that the image of Singapore and Singaporeans are held in poor view when tarnished by a few spoilt and cheapy Singaporean brats, who think that they are Citizens of a First World Country but still keeping their Third World behavior.<br><br></div>
