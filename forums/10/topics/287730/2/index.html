            <div class='col-md body'>Gay debate takes ugly turn<br><br>But a few black sheep in cyberspace do not mean SÂ’poreans canÂ’t hold a mature dialogue: Analysts<br><br>ANSLEY NG<br>ansley@mediacorp.com.sg<br><br>THE Parliamentary debate on the law against<br>gay sex will be remembered for its fiery,<br>heart-felt spirit. But outside the House, passions<br>Â— among both supporters and opponents<br>of Section 377A Â— have, at times, degenerated<br>into spite.<br><br>There were threatening, expletive-laced<br>emails. One parliamentarian had his sexuality<br>questioned. Another academic was flamed in<br>blogs and had her phone number circulated.<br><br>And the employer of one gay professional<br>was questioned about their hiring him.<br><br>The ugly turn of events, some may say,<br>is only to be expected given the emotional<br>nature of the subject matter Â— one that Prime<br>Minister Lee Hsien Loong had warned on<br>Tuesday could polarise society.<br><br>But a bigger question being asked is:<br>What do such instances say of SingaporeansÂ’<br>ability to debate issues maturely, and<br>without hostility?<br><br>In Parliament on Monday, Nominated MP<br>Thio Li-ann recounted how a colleague received<br>threatening emails following the publication<br>of an article in The Straits Times in May,<br>after reforms to the Penal Code were mooted.<br>Assistant Professor Yvonne Lee had<br>commented that it was wrong to decriminalise<br>homosexual acts. For a month after,<br>people, including young lawyers and students,<br>wrote to the dean criticising her.<br><br>Her photo was posted on blogs and her<br>phone number circulated. She received<br>emails Â— Â“80 per cent of them abusiveÂ” Â— asking<br>if she was a Â“fundamentalistÂ” who would<br>discriminate against homosexual students.<br><br>Â“It was a professional attack, intimidation<br>and harassment,Â” Asst Prof Lee told TODAY.<br>Professor Thio herself was Â“shell-shockedÂ”<br>and made a police report after receiving an<br>abusive email in August from an unnamed<br>stranger who threatened to defile her grave<br>on the day Section 377A was repealed.<br><br>Â“If it was just a rude letter, IÂ’d let it<br>slip. But this really overstepped things,Â” the<br>law lecturer told TODAY.<br><br>In the opposing camp, fellow NMP Siew<br>Kum Hong, who presented a public petition<br>to scrap the law against gay sex, had his<br>sexuality questioned.<br><br>Â“When you are a public figure taking a position<br>on a public issue, you have to accept that<br>some people will not be mature enough to refrain<br>from such things,Â” said Mr Siew, a lawyer.<br><br>Â“It bothers me but I just got past it and carried<br>on. I donÂ’t want to dignify their comments.Â”<br><br>The organisers of the Repeal377A.com<br>campaign Â— who, in a statement yesterday,<br>said they were Â“deeply disappointedÂ” by the<br>decision to keep the law Â— told TODAY that<br>hate messages were posted on their website.<br><br>Â“ThatÂ’s what the gay community experiences<br>as part of their lives Â— derogatory<br>slurs,Â” a spokesman said.<br><br>Indeed, one employee at a large government-<br>linked company learnt, a few months<br>ago, that an anonymous letter had been sent<br>to senior management, asking why they employed<br>a gay person.<br><br>Â“I was really shocked. IÂ’m not a closet<br>gay but I donÂ’t show off my sexuality at work.<br>IÂ’m there to work, not advocate gay rights;<br>IÂ’m a professional. Honestly, I felt very violated,Â”<br>he said.<br><br>To him, the incident suggests there is Â“a<br>lot of fearÂ” that legalising consensual gay sex<br>would cause societal disintegration. Â“When<br>there is fear, it can lead to viciousness.Â”<br>MP for Tanjong Pagar GRC Baey Yam<br>Keng, however, said that while some were not<br>pleased at his speaking up for homosexuals,<br>no one had been outright abusive so far.<br><br>One email sender vowed not to vote for<br>him in the next election. Another asked if he<br>was Â“naive or blindÂ”.<br><br>Said Mr Baey: Â“For these kind of<br>emotional issues, there will be skewed<br>positions taken. But itÂ’s healthy to<br>have these two opposing views Â— albeit<br>some being extreme about it Â—<br>rather than not talk about the issue.Â”<br><br>He feels such debates raise awareness<br>among the uninformed, which<br>leads to a more robust discussion.<br><br>But Prof Thio asked: Â“Can we<br>promise ourselves that we will not<br>resort to deception or shouting at<br>each other, but focus on facts and<br>issue? Even if we disagreed, can we<br>disagree in a civil fashion?Â”<br><br>On Monday, TODAY reported how<br>Senior Minister of State Dr Balaji<br>Sadasivan had called for tolerance of<br>differences.<br><br>The challenge, he had warned,<br>was in preventing diversity from descending<br>into Â“divisive antagonismÂ”,<br>as it has in the United States.<br><br>Such polarisation was unlikely to<br>happen in Singapore, said Dr Terence<br>Chong, a fellow at the Institute<br>of South-east Asian Studies.<br><br>Citizens by and large have shown<br>that they are capable of civil and<br>passionate debate Â— both in and outside<br>of Parliament Â— despite the actions<br>of a few anonymous Â“black<br>sheepÂ” in cyberspace, he noted.<br><br>Â“The overall tone of the debate<br>has been civil. It would be naÃ¯ve<br>for anyone to want passionate debate<br>without any name-calling at<br>all. And it would be very unfair to<br>point to a small group of people<br>who send hate mail and say we are<br>not capable of a mature debate,Â”<br>said Dr Chong.</div>
