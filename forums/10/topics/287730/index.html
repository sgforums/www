            <div class='col-md body'><strong>My Secret Self</strong> (taken from 60 Minutes)<br>Sunday, September 23, 2007<br>Reporter: Barbara Walters<br>Producers: Alan B. Goldberg, Joneil Adriano<br><br>Physically, it's obvious what we are from the moment we're born.<br><br>We're either a boy or a girl. And for the vast majority of us, that's the way it stays.<br><br>But for some children, toddlers even, it's not so simple. They insist they were born with the wrong bodies. Little boys, absolutely convinced they should be girls.<br><br>Little girls, who wouldn't wear a frilly party frock if you paid them.<br><br>They've been diagnosed with GID Â— Gender Identity Disorder Â— and on Sunday night some of them and their parents tell their touching stories to Barbara Walters.<br><br>But you have to ask, how can children so young really know who they are?<br><br>Transcript<br><br>BARBARA WALTERS: On the surface, Scott and Renee Jennings and their four children are a typical family. They could be your neighbours. Their youngest, Jazz, is a six-year-old who has been living with a secret until now. Your child was born a boy and now you call him a girl? Yes?<br><br>RENEE JENNINGS: Yes. RENEE JENNINGS: The day she came up to me Â— and I'll never forget it, Barbara Â— she said, "Mummy, when is the good fairy going to come with her magic wand and change my genitalia?"<br><br>BARBARA WALTERS: How old was Jazz then?<br><br>RENEE JENNINGS: Two.<br><br>BARBARA WALTERS: What did you feel?<br><br>RENEE JENNINGS: Just numb, frozen.<br><br>BARBARA WALTERS: They wanted to believe it would pass but Jazz kept gravitating to girl things. When Renee opened this manual used by mental health experts she was shocked. Under 'Gender Identity Disorder', Jazz met all four criteria for a diagnosis, including fantasising about being the opposite sex. He was only three. To confirm the diagnosis, the Jennings brought Jazz to Dr Marilyn Volker, a therapist who specialises in sex and gender issues. How did you know that she was a transgender child?<br><br>DR MARILYN VOLKER: When we began to talk and I used, whoops, the pronoun "he" I was corrected, "I'm a girl. I'm 'she'."<br><br>BARBARA WALTERS: Then Dr Volker brought out anatomically correct male and female dolls.<br><br>DR VOLKER: I ask, "And which are you like? Which is like your body?" Jazz looks and she says, "This is me now. This is what I want".<br><br>BARBARA WALTERS: Jazz's bedroom is filled with the girly things Â— dresses, dolls, and especially mermaids.<br><br>RENEE JENNINGS: All of the male to female younger transgender children are obsessed with mermaids. There is nothing below the waist but a tail and how appealing is that for someone who doesn't like what is down there?<br><br>BARBARA WALTERS: Why do you like mermaids?<br><br>JAZZ JENNINGS: Because they are different than us.<br><br>BARBARA WALTERS: No one knows why children like Jazz are transgender; there are only theories. Some scientists suggest that a hormone imbalance in their mother's womb gives these children's brains the wrong gender imprint. After the diagnosis, the Jennings then made the most difficult decision of their lives Â— to let their son become their daughter. On his fifth birthday, Jazz wore a one-piece bathing suit. "He" was now a "she", and an innocent pool party became a coming out.<br><br>SCOTT JENNINGS: That was the first time in front of everybody she, along with our consent, announced to the world that she was a girl.<br><br>BARBARA WALTERS: And the bathing suit did not show a bulge?<br><br>RENEE JENNINGS: Yeah, it did.<br><br>BARBARA WALTERS: But that did not matter?<br><br>RENEE JENNINGS: All the kids knew she was a biological boy.<br><br>BARBARA WALTERS: How does a five-year-old biological boy begin living full-time as a girl? For Jazz, it meant growing her hair out, piecing her ears, and wearing dresses everywhere.<br><br>RENEE JENNINGS: This child will come into my bedroom in the middle of the night, "Mummy, Mummy, I had a bad dream that I had a beard and moustache, like Daddy, and I don't ever want a beard or a moustache!" And I said, "Honey, don't worry. Mummy will make sure you never have a beard and moustache".<br><br>BARBARA WALTERS: If people say to you are you are a boy or a girl, what do you say?<br><br>JAZZ JENNINGS: A girl.<br><br>BARBARA WALTERS: By any measure, the Jennings' home seems a happy place Â— kids play, kids fight. For now, Jazz lives safely inside a bubble but the enormity of their child's situation is not lost on her parents. How do you respond to people who look at Jazz and say, "This is a little boy living as a little girl. How could you do this to your child?"<br><br>RENEE JENNINGS: I did not do this to my child. This is how my child was born. We check in with her all the time. I tell her, I say, "Jazz, if you ever feel like you want to dress like a boy again, cut your hair, you just let me know". He says, "Mummy, would I what to do that?"<br><br>BARBARA WALTERS: Renee, do you mourn the loss of a son?<br><br>RENEE JENNINGS: I mourn the loss of the idea of a son. But I do miss Â…<br><br>BARBARA WALTERS: It's alright. Tell me, if you can.<br><br>RENEE JENNINGS: I miss the boy.<br><br>BARBARA WALTERS: You miss the boy, the baby boy you had.<br><br>RENEE JENNINGS: I had to pack up all of her boy clothes and the pictures and the videos. That child has gone. But there is a wonderful person now that's with us. She will always know she is loved, always, and I tell her all the time, "How much Mummy loves you. I just want you to be happy".<br><br>BARBARA WALTERS: Whenever critics may say, if you think his child at aged six doesn't realise what she might have to go through, just listen.<br><br>JAZZ JENNINGS: (Sings) In my own little corner in my own little chair, I can be whatever I want to be ...<br><br>BARBARA WALTERS: That is wonderful! If he were to make someone who didn't know you and they said, "Riley, are you a boy or girl?", what would you say?<br><br>RILEY GRANT: A girl.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>continues:<br><br>BARBARA WALTERS: And you really feel that way, don't you? Ten years ago, Stephanie and Neil Grant gave birth to fraternal twins Â— a girl, Ali, and a boy, Richard.<br><br>STEPHANIE GRANT: The perfect family. You have a boy and girl, you don't need any more.<br><br>BARBARA WALTERS: From the beginning, the twins were different.<br><br>STEPHANIE GRANT: Ali was extremely Â— always looking into life. Richard was clingy and quiet and more passive and he wanted to wear a dress. He wanted to be pretty, like his sister.<br><br>BARBARA WALTERS: At two?<br><br>STEPHANIE GRANT: At two, two-and-a-half. "I want a dress. I'm a girl, Mummy, I'm a girl". I would say, "No, you're a boy, you have a penis. Ali is a girl".<br><br>BARBARA WALTERS: Then an incident in the bathtub convinced the Grants just how seriously confused their son was about his gender identity.<br><br>STEPHANIE GRANT: So I left the room and when I came back, Richard was standing there very innocently with a nail-clipper and he was holding it to himself and it was closed. It's a cringing thought and that's exactly what I did. "Buddy, What are you doing? What are you doing?" He just looked at me with these eyes and he said, "Mummy, it doesn't go there".<br><br>BARBARA WALTERS: He was going to cut it off? Cut his penis off?<br><br>STEPHANIE GRANT: Yeah, that's at two-and-a-half. In my mind, I knew right there Â— something is going on.<br><br>BARBARA WALTERS: So here you are with this little boy rejecting everything male. At what point did you allow him to dress as a girl?<br><br>STEPHANIE GRANT: At about three years old.<br><br>BARBARA WALTERS: They called it "girl time". Richard could dress up in his sister's clothes but only when his father Neil was out of sight. The secret between mother and son went on for months. Richard's double life put a strain on their marriage. They almost separated, but Stephanie was undeterred. Richard, now four, was going to school as a boy but wanted to be a girl full-time. At night, you heard Richard's prayers. What was he saying?<br><br>STEPHANIE GRANT: He said, "Mum, I'm so mad at God." I said, "Why?" He said, "Every night I pray that God gives me a girl body but when I wake up I'm still a boy". He said, "God won't take back his mistake, He won't make it right".<br><br>BARBARA WALTERS: Neil, what happened when you heard this? I don't want to put you through something that is this difficult.<br><br>NEIL GRANT: I need a few minutes, I'm sorry.<br><br>BARBARA WALTERS: At home and at school, Richard was having panic attacks.<br><br>STEPHANIE GRANT: We had and incident during homework where he had such a panic attack he turned blue. And the next morning I went to the principle and I sat in the office and I cried. I explained everything and she looked at me and she said, "Why can't he come to school dressed like a girl? How can I do that?" He is a boy. I can't send him to school dressed like a girl. She said, "Why not?"<br><br>BARBARA WALTERS: In 2003, at age seven, Richard Grants parents allowed him to transition from a boy to a girl. He, now a she, pierced her ears, grew her hair out, wore girls' clothing, and took the name Riley. Her father Neil, who once rejected her took her shopping for dresses.<br><br>NEIL GRANT: I saw the look on her face.<br><br>BARBARA WALTERS: You understood?<br><br>NEIL GRANT: Yes.<br><br>BARBARA WALTERS: But when she showed up at school in the third grade wearing a dress, her life became increasingly difficult. She had to use the nurse's bathroom and the bullies had a field day.<br><br>STEPHANIE GRANT: It became a nightmare; it was horrible. She was known as "the girl with the dick".<br><br>BARBARA WALTERS: The girl with the dick?<br><br>STEPHANIE GRANT: Yes.<br><br>BARBARA WALTERS: And she's still bullied? That's the way things are to this day?<br><br>STEPHANIE GRANT: To this day.<br><br>BARBARA WALTERS: When Riley and I first sat down, she was cautious, but talkative, but when the conversation turned to her gender, a very different child emerged. Riley, when you're very young, what did you what people to know that they didn't know.<br><br>RILEY GRANT: That I was a girl.<br><br>BARBARA WALTERS: How did the other kids treat you?<br><br>RILEY GRANT: The same, except some people called me a boy, but I just tell them to shut up.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>continues:<br><br>BARBARA WALTERS: When I sat down with Riley, I had no idea what to expect. And when she dissolved into tears, I found myself no longer a reporter, but her comforter. One needs to understand that this is a child on the verge of adolescence, a child that hates her body. Had do you feel when you look back and you see pictures of yourself as a girl? You are a pretty girl. Thank you. I don't really see that. I just see someone whose eyes aren't really smiling. On 19th September, 2004, 14-year-old Rebecca Singer wrote a startling letter to her parents, Betsy and Peter. By the end, she was no longer Rebecca but Jeremy.<br><br>JEREMY SINGER: "Dear Mum and Dad, this is one of those stream of consciousness things that I write in the wee hours of the morning. What am I? I ask myself this all the time. Right now, what I believe myself to be is an FTM, or a female to male transsexual Â— a boy in a girl's body".<br><br>BARBARA WALTERS: Betsy, How did you feel?<br><br>BETSY SINGER: Shocked, horrified, bewildered, it was an out-of-body experience.<br><br>BARBARA WALTERS: After years of struggling silently, Rebecca, now Jeremy, began to transform into a boy almost immediately. He cut his hair short, brought male clothing, he began to wear a binder under his clothes Â— a Lycra vest that painfully flattened his breasts.<br><br>JEREMY SINGER: From the time I found out what it meant to be transgender, I knew there were physical changes that I could make.<br><br>BARBARA WALTERS: Jeremy then 16, began injecting testosterone.<br><br>DR JO OLSEN: Jeremy was a clear-cut case Â— completely ready. The testosterone was just really the next step for him.<br><br>BARBARA WALTERS: Dr Jo Olsen specialises in adolescent medicine in hospital in at Children's hospital, Los Angeles and treats dozens of transgender children like Jeremy. Thanks to hormone therapy, Jeremy now shaves, his voice is deeper and his body looks more masculine. The one about the other children with me tonight? What will happen to them? Experts are divided about when to give hormone therapy but a growing number believe that early intervention is the best choice. Soon Riley's doctor will give her hormone blockers to suppress her natural testosterone surge, then in a few years she will start to take estrogen or what is called a cross hormone. Then there is the question of if and when to have sex reassignment surgery. Eventually does Riley want to have the penis removed?<br><br>STEPHANIE GRANT: Riley would have it done tomorrow.<br><br>BARBARA WALTERS: Tomorrow is further down the road for six year-old Jazz Jennings, her parents so they would also say they would allow their trans daughter to surgically remove her penis.<br><br>SCOTT JENNINGS: Renee and I are 100 percent agreement as to how we should raise Jazz. We don't encourage we support and we just keep listening to what she tells us.<br><br>BARBARA WALTERS: No one can imagine what the special children must go through every day to be who they are. What if one day your child said I'm in the wrong body? Could they accept it? Could you?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>mi ish read many many case studies where kids feel at a very very young age that they are 'born into the wrong sex', that they are a 'guy in a girls body' or vice versa.<br><br>actually, it depends on who is doing what kind of research lar.<br>some psychologists/scientists/whatever person doing the research will look at it from a biological point of view. then u will most prob get results like -- gene ABC is what causes pple to become a homosexual, gene QWE mutates to become @(*$&amp;( and so therefore pple become homosexual etc.<br><br>but then there are other types also where they find other types of results like -- man was molested by person who is female and therefore he fears women and so he turns to males for whatever reason, woman was molested by man and because it was a nasty experience she hates men and therefore likes women, or say the father died when child was very young and so she gets attached to the mom etc etc and ends up being attracted to women.<br><br>i JUST read that....delivery trauma and rejection of feotus by the mother during the pregnancy can have an impact on the child's sexual development later on in life!!!!!!!<br><br>so you see it really depends on who wrote the paper you are reading. if you are reading something by say...a religious leader.....hmm....obviously a different story.<br>homosexuality is no longer listed in the DSM, so it's not a psychological disorder hokay~<br>homosexuality isnt all about the sex. it's....erm....waliew so complicated lar <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> come on, people who are straight are not so because they want sex from the opposite sex what -__-<br><br>now mi will read research papers on why so many people are homophobic. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br></div>
