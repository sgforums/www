              <p><br>1) Can you deny the fact that it is common for Singaporean Chinese ancestors to speak in a loud tone because they were from China? Can you deny that your very own ancestors does not speak in a loud tone? Just because you were brought up in a westernised education and were educated to believe that it is rude to speak loudly in public places or even at your own home, does that means you should start despising on the lifestyle of your own origin race? Chinese will still craved for rice for their meals and not potatoes regardless of how many times their generations were brainwashed by westerners....or should I say "the foreigners"?</p>
              <p>2) Spitting phlegm in public used to be a common habit shared by many Singaporean Chinese in Singapore. That is before the Singapore Government had no choice but to impose a hefty fine in order to educate Singaporeans to get rid of that habit. If it is happening to the PRC, why is it difficult for Singaporeans to give them a bit of our free understanding and room for improvement? Aren't they the same as us before?</p>
              <p>3) Hanging their national flags in foreign lands is a way of showing their patriotism for their own countries. It does not symbolise or carries any ill intentions towards the resident country. If Singapore were to pride itself for being a truly multi-racial and multi-cultural society, then why does educated Singaporeans have such low tolerance towards other race and citizens of other countries? I can tell you, this flag hanging thing happens in many democratic countries around the world...and not just in Singapore. And be mindful that it is not a crime to hang the flag of any legal countries in Singapore. Look elsewhere if that is not acceptable for you, but do you share the same patriotism as them and hang your own national flag overseas?</p>
              <p>4) If you were invited to work, live, educate in another country, would you not have the desire to also treat that country as your own? I believed it is a normal and necessary behaviour for all foreigners to treat their residing countries as their own to avoid homesick as it can really get very lonely and miserable when you are away from your own home country. Have you even experienced that kind of feeling before? Do you even understand that feeling?</p>
              <p>Just imagine by yourself too.....how many silly Singaporeans actually went overseas and tried to look for Singaporean cuisine to dine? And it's so weird that I'm hearing things like this "<strong>if you were to move to some other countries, would you not start learning and picking up their cultures and fit in. Or would you insist on sticking to your own culture and hope that the locals adapt to you</strong>."</p>
              <p>There's nothing wrong with giving people a bit of your understanding and room for improvement if we ourselves are also guilty of the same behaviour.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans should behave like Singaporeans, and if Singaporeans felt the need to ditch and lose their own Singaporean behaviour in order to blend in or adapt into other cultures, then I can say truly Singaporeans have no identity or are even proud of being a Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>And yet these Singaporeans demanded some form of respect from foreigners who are proud of their home countries when they themselves would not hesitate to betray and turn their back on their home countries and stop behaving like a Singaporeans when they are overseas or have lived overseas for a long period of time.</p>
              <p>This is really what makes people from other parts of the world looked down upon overseas Singaporeans and this is also what gives Singaporeans a bad name overseas.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You want an answer, then you also give me the answer to my question. What is this Singaporean culture you were talking about?</p>
              <p>Told you that it would be interesting to find out, cos I know you cannot produce the answer to my question. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p><span style="color: #993300;">Wow, I can't even start on how ridiculously flawed your statements are.</span></p>
              <p>1) Can you deny the fact that it is common for Singaporean Chinese ancestors to speak in a loud tone because they were from China? Can you deny that your very own ancestors does not speak in a loud tone? Just because you were brought up in a westernised education and were educated to believe that it is rude to speak loudly in public places or even at your own home, does that means you should start despising on the lifestyle of your own origin race? Chinese will still craved for rice for their meals and not potatoes regardless of how many times their generations were brainwashed by westerners....or should I say "the foreigners"?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">I can't deny that my ancestors weren't loud speakers and neither can you prove that, but I'll give it the benefit of doubt. But just think, current Singapore, Singapore created by the so hated PAP following western styles instead of asian flavour. Is it not a fact that Singapore is a country with its own unique culture that it's not fully asian nor western?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">I did not say I despise the China PRs who speak in a loud manner, so don't put words in my words. However, I can tell you that I dislike that alot. Do you speak loudly when you're in public areas over the phone like its the most important thing right now? Oblivious to everyone around you and do not have the courtesy to get off the train to carry on your commotion or lower your volume?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">You do realise currently there is this distinction between CHINA CHINESE and OVERSEAS CHINESE right? Like the Chinese around the world would like to call ä¸­å›½äººã€€andã€€ä¸­è�¯äºº</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Speaking loudly is not a CHINESE culture, its a CHINA CHINESE culture.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Do you dare tell me in urbanized Taipei, the people are so rude they speak loudly on public grounds?</span> </p>
              <p>2) Spitting phlegm in public used to be a common habit shared by many Singaporean Chinese in Singapore. That is before the Singapore Government had no choice but to impose a hefty fine in order to educate Singaporeans to get rid of that habit. If it is happening to the PRC, why is it difficult for Singaporeans to give them a bit of our free understanding and room for improvement? Aren't they the same as us before?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Okay, let me give you an example.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">I like eating on my bed and making a mess of it, I go to my friend's house and ask to do the same but he doesn't his room isn't the neatest, he eats on his own bed but don't drop the crumbs on it. Am I to respect his decision not to let me do it or do I still insist on doing it because I'm a guest of the house or simply because he should give me his free understanding and let me improve?</span></p>
              <p>3) Hanging their national flags in foreign lands is a way of showing their patriotism for their own countries. It does not symbolise or carries any ill intentions towards the resident country. If Singapore were to pride itself for being a truly multi-racial and multi-cultural society, then why does educated Singaporeans have such low tolerance towards other race and citizens of other countries? I can tell you, this flag hanging thing happens in many democratic countries around the world...and not just in Singapore. And be mindful that it is not a crime to hang the flag of any legal countries in Singapore. Look elsewhere if that is not acceptable for you, but do you share the same patriotism as them and hang your own national flag overseas?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">I'm not the greatest patriot of Singapore but I do have enough EQ not to hang another nation's flag in a foreign country. It's not a matter of educated or not, simple Emotional Quotation.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">It's generally not a widely accepted social behaviour in Singapore and like I said, we're not fully westernised nor asianised. So I'm currently based in Japan, it's rude not to set your mobile phone to Manner Mode when you're sitted in the priority seats. So I decide not to do that and it just so happens my phone rings loudly.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">This would be socially acceptable behaviour in Singapore but I don't do that in Japan because even though they are a democratic country, I respect their rules and the social mindset of the people.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Much like how women in Japan are expected to follow a set protocols to speaking.</span></p>
              <p>4) If you were invited to work, live, educate in another country, would you not have the desire to also treat that country as your own? I believed it is a normal and necessary behaviour for all foreigners to treat their residing countries as their own to avoid homesick as it can really get very lonely and miserable when you are away from your own home country. Have you even experienced that kind of feeling before? Do you even understand that feeling?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">I understand that feeling, when I first arrived in Japan, I started questioning myself why am I even here? I can't speak or understand Japanese to save my life. But instead of demanding the people here to speak English in order to communicate with me. I spend 4 hours each day studying Japanese and now I can communicate easily with my Japanese friends.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">I try to adapt but I don't force the locals to adapt to my practise, it's against my own principles to eat loudly but whenever I have my meals at a noodle house, I eat as loud as I can and the Chef smiles at me.</span></p>
              <p>Just imagine by yourself too.....how many silly Singaporeans actually went overseas and tried to look for Singaporean cuisine to dine? And it's so weird that I'm hearing things like this "<strong>if you were to move to some other countries, would you not start learning and picking up their cultures and fit in. Or would you insist on sticking to your own culture and hope that the locals adapt to you</strong>."</p>
              <p>There's nothing wrong with giving people a bit of your understanding and room for improvement if we ourselves are also guilty of the same behaviour.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans should behave like Singaporeans, and if Singaporeans felt the need to ditch and lose their own Singaporean behaviour in order to blend in or adapt into other cultures, then I can say truly Singaporeans have no identity or are even proud of being a Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>And yet these Singaporeans demanded some form of respect from foreigners who are proud of their home countries when they themselves would not hesitate to betray and turn their back on their home countries and stop behaving like a Singaporeans when they are overseas or have lived overseas for a long period of time.</p>
              <p>This is really what makes people from other parts of the world looked down upon overseas Singaporeans and this is also what gives Singaporeans a bad name overseas.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"> Regarding the above, Just read the rest of my reply and try to think a little. Just because some Singaporeans abandon their Citizenship, does it mean the rest of Singaporeans are to be despised and not given any rights to demand for anything?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Are you telling me that? Wow.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You want an answer, then you also give me the answer to my question. What is this Singaporean culture you were talking about?</p>
              <p>Told you that it would be interesting to find out, cos I know you cannot produce the answer to my question.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">By saying I can't produce anything abou Singapore Culture, are you inferring that Singapore do not have any culture? Because honestly Singlish itself it's a culture albeit substandard English.</span></p>

              <p>If a flood of Singaporeans were to be introduced to a westernized country, I wouldn't be surprised if we were to be unwelcome - our mannerisms are different, and can even be viewed as rude, i.e. not holding the door open for whoever that might be coming through behind yourself,</p>
              <p>But it impacts us more as Singaporeans who have always been steered towards a westernized image to find out that the PRC Chinese behave differently, to the detriment of our image that we have painfully toiled to build over the years.</p>
              <p>We all know (or at least I do) that  a Chinese man is a Chinese man. There is no distinction, not when it concerns other people except those that are unwillingly embroiled in trying to forge their own identity.</p>
              <p>Their behaviour, especially when the PRC man has arrived in Singapore in large numbers, compromises that.</p>
