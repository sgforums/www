NOTE: You retarded taiwanese are the ones who can't read and write proper MANDRIN you can't even pronounce words properly. for example "Shi (Yes)", you twits pronounce it as "si". now who's the retard who cant read and write MANDRIN properly? why don't you go home, brush up on ENGLISH and polish up your MANDRIN, and then come back and post.</strong></div>
