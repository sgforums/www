            <div class='col-md body'>Yesterday, i boarded a taxi and the taxi uncle exclaimed how lucky it was!<br><br>He said he just had a booking canceled and managed to get new passenger.<br><br>From the conversation, I came to know that taxi drivers from X company have to accept a booking if they are assigned one, even if there is another immediate passenger in front flagging for his cab. Otherwise he may get suspended.<br><br>He tells me that passengers usually book for a taxi, and he is obligated to go to the destination, but if the passenger cancel halfway, he gets nothing.<br><br>If the passenger decides to board the cab without canceling the current booking, there is no penalty on the passenger. The uncle say he has to wait for the passenger for 20 mins even if passenger failed to show up.<br><br>I asked the uncle " Isnt that very unfair? its like ordering for goods, then canceling when its has already been shipped."<br><br>The uncle was very humorous person fluent in hokkien and told me to call the cab  number 6XXXXXXX and help him to ask and then tell him...<br><br>I wanted to ask the Uncle to feedback to the management about the problem but before i could ask him, he said "this is Singapore you know"<br><br>In Singapore, like they want to raise GST, you can only lan lan accept. This is the rule... you know some times life is very "Wu Nai" (helpless) there is nothing you can do about it. Just be happy.... Life is very short.<br><br>"Bo li gia tou du yi meh?( Dont tell me you take a knife to kill them meh?)<br>Life in Singapore is like this... very "Wu nai" (helpless). A lot of things are not in control one...<br><br>Like he says for some bookings, he says knowing the location already knows it would be a wasted trip. The passenger would have flagged another cab and wasted his time for the forced booking.<br><br>To earn the extra 70 cents for each booking, the taxi company has made the life of the uncle much harder. Didnt they taxi companies earn enough from the fall of COE? The rentals hardly dropped but for the extra 70 cents per booking, they have to force the taxi drivers to accept the bookings.<br><br></div>
