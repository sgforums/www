              <p>Euthanasia is wrong. There can be no justification for approval to end one's life, assisted or unassisted.</p>
              <p>Our ancestors were only animals on earth, as scientifically provened in archeological digs, lived in caves and ate food raw, no different from bears and tigers. At some point, a higher evolved and enlightened being must have taught neantherdals the concept of civilisation, and was worshipped as an Almighty for the good it brought in communual living, seperating us from beasts.</p>
              <p>It does not take a leap of faith to believe in the concept of an almighty being. Just look at your cat, dog, or monkeys around you. Do they build cities, do they buy stocks and shares, do they worship almighty beings? After sharing this planet for million of years, they are still where they are - beasts, while we have progress beyond Earth and are looking towards the stars, with the moon as our stepping stone to the Universe.</p>
              <p>With civilisation taught to our ancestors, we were inculcated with the doctrine of valuing life. The Almighty being was right to want our ancestors to value life. The purpose being that if we don't - we will only end up killing each other at the slightest provocation, even ourselves.</p>
              <p>That doctrine was proven wise, for it ensured peace, productivity and a fruitful life on our planet. Bed of roses were not promised to us, but if we persevere, we can overcome ANY obstacles, but only if WE DONT GIVE UP ON OURSELVES.</p>
              <p>Our ancestors were taught medicines and medication techniques. Some of it lost in time, some still passed down through the centuries but we are still evolving in medical knowledge at the capacity that our brains can handle. Dogs and cat are still chewing grass as medication.</p>
              <p>One day, we will be able to unlock the secrets of DNA - the building blocks of life - and diseases will be a thing of the past. Thus we must spend heavily on R&amp;D on medical science in order to see advancement and death from disease conquered.</p>
              <p>In the meantime, many who plead for death are mainly due to high medical costs. Immediate next of kin as well as society must be spared from such high costs. If we don't, the only pragmatic solution is to influence those sick or incapicitated with diseases to die forthwith - practical but absolutely barbaric, and not the hallmark of a civilised state.</p>
              <p>Thus, the issue of euthanasia and its need lies not with the right to die, but a subconcious protest against high medical costs! Do we need aircon rooms? Do we need fluffy beds? Can a panadol be sold at 3 cents instead of 50cts a pill?</p>
              <p>So, those who protest against euthanasia must come out with a solution to help the dying - with dignity and not bankrupt their next of kin or society.</p>

              <p>I liked your post and have also read all your other previous post. Some are very educational. Some are very interesting. Some are very LOL... I find your debate very unique and strong. LOL. Like the above, using science and logic to support your stand against Euthanasia instead of using religion as started by TS.</p>
              <p>However, till the day we have not unlock the secrets of DNA, we are still term as "human". We are still subject to emotions. Our emotions are as complex as our DNA structure. It is these emotions that seperate us away from the tree. Though we are termed as humans , we are in different time, space and DNA structure with each other. And hence, different people made different choice.</p>
              <p>No one can predict the near future. Is his or her choice for the better or for the worse? We do not know. It is for he/she to find out and work out. Because of this unknown, it will be very cruel to deprive them from making a choice of their own.</p>
              <p>Just in case , I did not make my point clear. I agreed the government to lift the ban on euthanasia. Laws are dead. Humans are alive. We should not let laws to bind us in difficult and different situations or circumstances. And also the new law should disallow people from mis-using euthansia. Ideal ,rite??? ^^ Hahahaha... I hope the government can do close to it... can liao... :p</p>

              <p>I don't feel confident to comment on the GST issue, though personally i feel the ERP is neccessary to control traffic flow and reduce our dependence on oil. Let's face it, the world is not infinite and it's best to reduce our consumption and waste.</p>
              <p>I just don't see why private transport would be considered a need in Singapore while our public transport are pretty adequate (albeit uncomfortable during rush hour) to handle it.</p>
              <p>It's not realistic to expect we'd just sit up and decide we need to reduce consumption and to conserve, so i rather the government implement ways like this to control it.</p>

              <p>I don't even understand why the view of a certain religion would have any bearing on government policy save policies on religious harmony.<br><br>The real issue on euthanasia, imo, is the debate between person choice vs state's interest in preserving life/potential for abuse.</p>
              <p>Now, high medical cost is factor in euthanasia, but I believe the real reason why people opt for it is because of the quality of life or lack thereof.</p>
              <p>Assuming that the state has an innate interest in the preservation of life(given that suicide is illegal), such and option should only be made avaliable to terminal patients.<br><br>Now if an individual is suffering from, say, terminal cancer , with no hope of recovery and has already made a personal decision to spare himself/herself further pain, i do not see why there should any objections to it.<br><br>The problem with euthanasia probably lies with incoherent patients, who cannot make such a decision for themselves. Who is to say then that they would not want to live?<br>In such cases, it would be in the state's interest to err on the safe side, despite decisions made by the patient's family. This is obviously to prevent any potential for abuse.<br><br>However, even then, such a regulation cannot be cast in stone, the state should look into them on case by case basis.</p>
              <p>If Christianity so condemns such a practice, then its only authority would lie in the persuading its parishioners to take the matter up with their MP, and through them parliament.</p>

              <p><br>Yes. I am dead set against the death penalty. Death penalty should only be applied to animals, eg; tigers that maul humans, stampeding elephants, etc. These are beasts, without a care for human life, similar with terrorists, murderers, drug peddlers, traitors, etc. Any living creature that wages war on civilised society, harm our fellow human race, must be destroyed.</p>
              <p><br>But i alone does not a society make. I can only discuss and give my viewpoints. In the end, when our society decides and enact decisions into law, i obey, as a member of our society, for the majority had spoken, for the good of all.</p>

              <p>Actually oldbread kind of pointed out the core of the issue. Giving the option of Euthanasia is simply another choice we can have, if we are opposed to Euthanasia we can chose not to do it.</p>
              <p>However, people can opt for it if they chose to. This is simply offering another choice.</p>
              <p>Oppose all you want, but if you end up with a disease which causes you constant pain or deprive you of even basic mobility, Euthanasia will definitely feel more tempting. I rather the option to be there. </p>

              <p>Legalizing euthanasia on the grounds of respecting individual choice is fair enough, as long as society is prepared to accept that the same option should be given to the man who wishes to jump from his HDB flat because his wife has left him. If it is pain that drives one to consider euthanasia, that option is a poor choice because pallaitive medicine has much to offer as an alternative.</p>

              <p>that one cannot cos already outlawed liao. i think even if can have euthanasia they also want you to pay for it in hospital.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"></p>
              <p>anyway i doubt people care about whether jumping is legal when they jump in the first place. so it doesn't make a difference to legalise unless you're scared jump and never die kenna arrested <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"></p>
              <p>one of my sec sch chinese teachers said he was a volunteer cop in his younger days(when police still wear shorts) a guy jumped and he had to guard the corpse while being handcuffed to it in hospital.</p>

              <p>Then it would depend on the person's choice and the options available to him.</p>
              <p>Hospice care isn't exactly cheap either, and there are old people that wants the option to be able to die in their own home.</p>
              <p>Also there are dehibilitating diseases that even though do not cause you physical pain but robs you of quality of life (eg: confined completely to the bed).</p>
              <p>Your example isn't a very good one, considering that this man is more than capable of leading a normal life if he gets over the wife leaving him. That however is not a choice to someone with a terminal disease.</p>
              <p>It's not about you can chose to die whenever you want to. It's about given the choice to die when it's obvious(to everyone involved, including medical professionals) that there are no other options. And to continue living is simply to increase the amount of pain and suffering to both the patient and his family before the inevitable.</p>
