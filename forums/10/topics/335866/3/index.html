              <p>Perhaps current pactise is If I leave a living will saying my son is free to kill me (which I won't), then he can do so.</p>
              <p>But that is very different from any law that say it is no crime for my son to kill me, especially when he perceives that his wallet will get hurt.</p>

              <p>I think the child only has the authority when the doctor verifies that the patient is brain dead or unlikely to ever wake up from a coma. Even when there's a legal document dictating you want it that way, it's still up to the doctor's call whether it comes into power.  </p>
              <p>Personally i think it's unfair to your children to make them bear the cost of your medical support when they have no idea of knowing whether you want to go on or not. </p>
              <p>It's a massive burden, not to mention they would have to live on with the stigma and guilt that they've murdered their own parents.</p>

              <p>If we assume that history recorded this event correctly, then my view is Rommel was "forced" to kill himself. When someone is "forced", then I think this is not a suicide. This is simply an execution.</p>
              <p>In my view, this is different from a situation when the terminally ill patient consiously chooses to kill himself to spare his family from financial burden (by focusing on money).</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p><br>Rommel is not 'forced' either. He was given a choice. If he wanted he can choose not to take the cyanide and instead go to court, and hope for a legal (or some other) miracle that can save himself and his family.</p>
              <p>Likewise, the patient can choose to drain his family financially in the hope that his illness might be 'miraculously' cured. The two cases are quite analogous as far as I am concerned.</p>
              <p>Both Rommel and the patient do not want to take their lives, but they were 'forced' by circumstances to make a hard choice.</p>
              <p>But then again we can also say that a teenager whose love was unrequited chose to jump down from a 20-storey flat because he is 'forced' by 'circumstances' (rejected by a girl) to kill himself.</p>
              <p>The trick is to fine and define the demarcation line between those 'forcing circumstances' that are legitimate (socially, ethically and religiously) from those that are not.</p>
              <p>I am not arguing for or against euthanasia... Just tryting to examine the issues more thoroughly.</p>

(See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erwin_rommel">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erwin_rommel</a>) Although the Peoples Court is for all intents and purposes a kangeroo court.

              <p>I will try and put myself in Rommel head.</p>
              <p>I am presented with 2 options. One is a kangeroo trial and very likely it will lead to death of my family. Another is to take the poison.</p>
              <p>In this case, I really have no choice. I hope I will have the courage to take the poison and sacrifice my life for the family.</p>
              <p>This is different from suicide (which is take an action to escape from something, eg self pity after rejected by my girl friend)</p>

It will be kind of tricky here to ensure it's not due to the wish of wanting the monie that led to the decision of an unnecessary articifial act that leads to death.</p></div>

              <p>Euthansia is a form of self-sacrifice, to relive your family of their burden. If I remember, Jesus commited an act of self-sacrifice right?</p>

              <p><br>Agree. It is not directly relevant.</p>
              <p>I just used that case as two extreme scenarios to illustrate when killing oneself is clearly justified (in Rommel's case) and when it is clearly not (killing oneself because of unrequited love). Additionally, there are cases that are somewhere in between the above two extremes (the case of the dying patient)</p>
              <p>My point is that to sort out the issue of euthanasia and to achieve social acceptance of a decision (whatever that maybe), there needs to be an accepted litmus test that defines exactly where in the above continuum does an act of killing oneself (as forced by "circumstances") becomes justified.  </p>
