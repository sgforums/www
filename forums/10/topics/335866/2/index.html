              The moral issues are very complicated... I typed a few para jus now... GOt confused and befuddled by all teh mess of it and i deleted them all....
              
              This is such a hard thing to decide... In what conditions that u can deem it is consent? what if the patient is delirious or he is incapable of making a decision due to his conditions?

              <p>Unless the government is willingly to pay for a person on life support and in a coma for the rest of his life, or else, the government has to give people the option of Euthanasia, and allow mercy killings.</p>

              <p>We all know how WW2 German Field Marshal Erwin Rommel died. He was implicated in a plot to assassinate Hitler and was offered a choice; kill himself and his family will be spared, or face a trial that will mean persecution of his whole family. Rommel opted to kill himself.</p>

              <p>If i feel that furthur treatment will only increase my lifespan and how much i'm suffering at the same time (terminal stage for cancer for example), i rather opt for euthanasia.</p>
              <p> I don't see the benefit of paying thousands for treatments and drugs just so i can breath a little more and let my loved ones see how much i'm suffering. I can leave more for the next generation anyway.   </p>
              <p>Frankly, i think people who try to say euthanasia is a bad thing never had a loved one slowly rotting away.</p>

              <p>Yes, you are entitled to your view.</p>
              <p>My view is that I will not deliberately choose to kill myself or another person, no matter for what reason.</p>
              <p>Also, I cannot assume that people who choose my view have not seen their loved one slowly rotting away.</p>

              <p>Currently, the law bans all euthanasia. If the ban is lifted, people is able to not opt for euthanasia when they are well living. And their love ones will have to legally respect their decision.</p>
              <p>Lifting the ban gives people a choice to choose on how they want to live in such situation comes. A total ban makes no sense for those who believe in euthanasia. Likewise, a compulsory on all euthanasia makes no sense for those who dont believe in euthanasia.</p>

              <p>Whether we have choice or not, is up to whether we want to make a choice or not. If I see a law being enacted and I sit there and do nothing, of course nothing will be done.</p>

              <p>I think they already made that law for the stituation when you're in a coma and confirmed to be braindead.</p>
              <p>The idea of euthanasia however, is that you can actually chose to kill yourself if you feel you do not want to suffer anymore. A legal suicide. Don't think your son can decide for you in this stituation.</p>

              <p>From above, it appears that "private act" such as enthanasia is currently criminalised.</p>
              <p>Does that mean that government intend NOT to criminalise enthanasia?</p>
              <p>When that happens, does that mean that it will not be a crime if my son chooses to kill me if he perceives that his pocket is being hurt?</p>
