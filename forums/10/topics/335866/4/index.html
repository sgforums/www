              <p><br>Agree. It is not directly relevant.</p>
              <p>I just used that case as two extreme scenarios to illustrate when killing oneself is clearly justified (in Rommel's case) and when it is clearly not (killing oneself because of unrequited love). Additionally, there are cases that are somewhere in between the above two extremes (the case of the dying patient)</p>
              <p>My point is that to sort out the issue of euthanasia and to achieve social acceptance of a decision (whatever that maybe), there needs to be an accepted litmus test that defines exactly where in the above continuum does an act of killing oneself (as forced by "circumstances") becomes justified.  </p>

              <p>Hmm I'm not sure how 'justify' is being define but my take is that, taking of life, to be precise, any life should be avoid at best. However, it is not possible to do so in the real world out here.</p>

              <p>2. From a religious/moral/conscience point of view, is it fair to let the medical practitioner to be the butcher in taking another's life away?

              <p><br>No, today in China with a child policy, still many chinese kill their baby if the baby sex was not born to their wishes. And today many countries also support abortion, which is also a murder, but if you are to abort due to medical reason such as abnormal foetus, it is understandable, same goes to terminal illness, if you are in pain and suffering, you hv the right to end your own life, it is not a killing or suicide, but a man wishes.</p>

              <p>I don't think the issue all along was that you can be "legally killed" by your relatives because there is such an option, but only applicable when the doctor himself decides there isn't much chance of you recovering from a coma.</p>
              <p>The issue actually, is whether there should be such an option opened to a terminally ill patient who is verified to have no choice of recovering from his/her illness, which is costing alot of pain for both the patient and his/her family, both physically and finanically.</p>
              <p>The main issue is quite simple, can we have the right to chose death for ourselves?</p>
              <p>I believe the current model is quite reasonable, you need to have doctors to verify that you can't be cured and in a reasonable state of mind to make this decision. If i recall correctly, your application is submitted to a board of doctors for approval to make sure they concurred with your doctor.</p>
              <p>Even before the lethal injection, you're asked again whether you want to proceed with this.</p>

              <p>Euthanasia is wrong. There can be no justification for approval to end one's life, assisted or unassisted.</p>
              <p>Our ancestors were only animals on earth, as scientifically provened in archeological digs, lived in caves and ate food raw, no different from bears and tigers. At some point, a higher evolved and enlightened being must have taught neantherdals the concept of civilisation, and was worshipped as an Almighty for the good it brought in communual living, seperating us from beasts.</p>
              <p>It does not take a leap of faith to believe in the concept of an almighty being. Just look at your cat, dog, or monkeys around you. Do they build cities, do they buy stocks and shares, do they worship almighty beings? After sharing this planet for million of years, they are still where they are - beasts, while we have progress beyond Earth and are looking towards the stars, with the moon as our stepping stone to the Universe.</p>
              <p>With civilisation taught to our ancestors, we were inculcated with the doctrine of valuing life. The Almighty being was right to want our ancestors to value life. The purpose being that if we don't - we will only end up killing each other at the slightest provocation, even ourselves.</p>
              <p>That doctrine was proven wise, for it ensured peace, productivity and a fruitful life on our planet. Bed of roses were not promised to us, but if we persevere, we can overcome ANY obstacles, but only if WE DONT GIVE UP ON OURSELVES.</p>
              <p>Our ancestors were taught medicines and medication techniques. Some of it lost in time, some still passed down through the centuries but we are still evolving in medical knowledge at the capacity that our brains can handle. Dogs and cat are still chewing grass as medication.</p>
              <p>One day, we will be able to unlock the secrets of DNA - the building blocks of life - and diseases will be a thing of the past. Thus we must spend heavily on R&amp;D on medical science in order to see advancement and death from disease conquered.</p>
              <p>In the meantime, many who plead for death are mainly due to high medical costs. Immediate next of kin as well as society must be spared from such high costs. If we don't, the only pragmatic solution is to influence those sick or incapicitated with diseases to die forthwith - practical but absolutely barbaric, and not the hallmark of a civilised state.</p>
              <p>Thus, the issue of euthanasia and its need lies not with the right to die, but a subconcious protest against high medical costs! Do we need aircon rooms? Do we need fluffy beds? Can a panadol be sold at 3 cents instead of 50cts a pill?</p>
              <p>So, those who protest against euthanasia must come out with a solution to help the dying - with dignity and not bankrupt their next of kin or society.</p>

              <p>1st, we need to understand if she is rich or not, if so, ensure that her beneficiary heir is you, then, you can make a decision for her to end her life, most people like this are in coma, there is a life, but no more soul.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2nd, if she is poor and got nothing for you, call it a day, help her end her life better before she end your life with the hospital bills.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3rd, if she is rich but hasn't make any beneficiary or had appointed another person and not you as the benficiary, wait as long as you can, hope she wait up and change her mind</p>
