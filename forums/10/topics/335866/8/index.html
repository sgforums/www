              <p>utilitarianism is an ethical theory that all action should be
              directed toward achieving greatest happiness for the greatest
              number of people - the belief that the value of a thing, a life, or
              action must and should be determined by its utility.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Egalitarianism is the affirmation, promotion of the belief in
              equal political, economic, social and civil rights for all
              people.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Should human life be considered an utility, a tool to be used
              and then discarded when its 'use by' date runs out? After all,
              'pratical needs truimphs rights'.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The old, the retarded, the useless, the less than intelligent
              humans, the ugly, the fat, the stinkers, smokers, prostitutes,
              gays, deviants, mormans, conspiracy theorists, etc, etc, should be
              killed so that a society be kept pure, in the pursuit of 'practical
              needs'.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We would have difficulty communicating with those of different
              lingo. Lets kill them as well.</p>
              <p><br> We would have difficulty in asimilating with different skin
              colours. Lets kill the blacks, the yellows, the browns, etc.</p>
              <p><br> We would have difficulty accepting different religions. Lets kill
              them too.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We would have difficulty living with people with different
              temperament. Lets kill them.</p>
              <p><br> We would have difficulty sharing a space with someone whom we
              dislke. Lets kill them.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Look around and see who's left?</p>
              <p><br> That's the consequences when we allow 'practical needs to overide
              rights'. Utilitarianism is only good up to a certain point. When we
              apply utiltarianism to life itself, we will be in deep
              shit.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Today we talk about legalised ethanasia. Tomorrow, who will go
              next? The Pandora box of 'Practical needs' had been opened, and it
              can never be covered back.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Logically, scientifically and mathematically, utilitarianism
              will lead mankind into a higher plane of existance,to understand
              the universe and harness its energies to save mankind, for we would
              have discarded 'baggages' whom will only stop us from evolving
              faster.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But Utilitarianism will ultimately destroy mankind instead, for
              in the search of perfection, we flawed humans will only kill each
              other. The last human life will save no one.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Better we accept egalitarianism, and together, leaving none
              behind, move towards our ultimate destiny to evolve and populate
              the stars. We may not do so in this generation, but the next or the
              following ones will be able to do so, with none need to have their
              life prematuredly ended.</p>

              <p>The invalid lying on the bed suffers more from depression than
              pain. No human wants to die.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>They need pyschological help, not the needle to end life. Every
              moment of his/her life is precious during their lucid moments - to
              be able to see a new dawn, the smell of planet earth's air, fellow
              humans, etc.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>They want to know the results of their achievements
              - plans, children, grandchildren, etc, before leaving this
              planet for the great unknown - a place where no person had ever
              returned before.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What lies there, no one knows, despite our brave front and false
              bravados. No human wants to die. The plea for death is only a wish
              for attention to alleviate their pain, depression and
              loneliness.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So you want to murder them instead?</p>

              <p>i believe the attention is more on voluntary euthanasia, not free for all lethal injections for everyone or at least those who can't make the decision.</p>
              <p>dragging the old, the retarded, the useless, the less than intelligent
              humans, the ugly, the fat, the stinkers, smokers, prostitutes,
              gays, deviants, mormans, conspiracy theorists, etc, etc, should be
              killed so that a society be kept pure, in the pursuit of 'practical
              needs' into the arguement against euthanasia doesn't make sense.</p>
              <p>the consideration of euthanasia is to allow one to make a choice when they're suffering from a painful <span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>terminal</strong></span> illness, or at least to make a choice for your family when they're in that situation but are unable to make a choice.</p>
              <p>which is why i mention earlier, i'm against putting people down when they're retarded. you're confusing different situations together.</p>

              <p>i felt it should only be an option for the ones who are really dying like those comfirm by docs, terminal cases. the ones doc's felt cannot last any longer liao and in constant pain all the time(need painkiller every few hours type). and since i favour a personal decision,it shouldn't be a problem if the patient's in coma. otherwise i was thinking more about turning off life support system by family and not lethal injection put them down, something thats already a choice.</p>
              <p>as for the doctor being bribed, haha to be honest <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="icon_redface.gif"> i haven't thought about that. usually when i'm thinking about these stuff i was thinking about the ones who really need it and have no need for bribing the doc, and i'm thinking more about cancer/aids patients so i'm not sure why the doc's being bribed came in? that one seems more of a personal fault of the doc?</p>

              <p>assuming its not terminal and if there's no intention of dying in the first place, pressure is mostly about medical costs, something which needs to be changed also.</p>
              <p>we are all given choices in life, most of us are going to give up half way regardless of the reasons same thing applies to this situation. anyway if you're really sick and dying its an additional choice, if not it shouldn't be a concern.</p>

              <p>i felt it should only be an option for the ones who are really dying like those comfirm by docs, terminal cases. the ones doc's felt cannot last any longer liao and in constant pain all the time(need painkiller every few hours type). and since i favour a personal decision,it shouldn't be a problem if the patient's in coma. otherwise i was thinking more about turning off life support system by family and not lethal injection put them down, something thats already a choice.</p>
              <p>as for the doctor being bribed, haha to be honest <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="icon_redface.gif"> i haven't thought about that. usually when i'm thinking about these stuff i was thinking about the ones who really need it and have no need for bribing the doc, and i'm thinking more about cancer/aids patients so i'm not sure why the doc's being bribed came in? that one seems more of a personal fault of the doc?</p>

              <p>I think I had mentioned in the much earlier part of this thread in regards to the ethical issue.</p>
              <p>Ideally, I might have agree with you that those who are so seriously ill that is beyond recovery wish for a good death. But given in a profit-driven society, I have my reserves in agreement.</p>
              <p>The doc's bribe will comes in if the patient has bought large sum of insurances to the beneficiaries. Or the patient having a lot of assets via a will to the beneficiaries. TV drama a lot of such stories mah =)</p>

              <p>To legalise Euthanasia is tantamount to permitting homicide or suicide in any case. I don't know how my last days would be like, and if I am indeed some kind of prophet who foretells the future, I want myself to know I wouldn't die in the hands of other people. </p>
              <p>People in the past did not seek medical help to die. The idea of medicine and medical science is the remove pain, but I do not see dying earlier (even without suffering) as an elevation of torment. If the idea of science and medical treatment was to elevate pain for the living, should we just respect that ideology and not misuse it? We did not invent science, and I believe I owe most of the things I understand about life to those who actually delved further into the field to find out more. The scientists or chemists who found cure and treatment certainly did not wish to kill, and if medicine was not meant to kill in the first place, then it should not be.   </p>
              <p>To live is in itself more than a blessing, and what more can a living human ever ask for? In pain or peace, it is all part of life itself. I am not too much philosophical to speak for others, but there is no one exception for my case which I wouldn't want any form of assistance in dying. </p>
              <p>Doctors and medical officers are there not to kill, even if Euthanasia relieves pain. Is there not any other form of available help to calm the suffering? Death is certainly not an option. (At least not when the person typing here holds so much passion for life.) </p>
              <p>People (foolish ones) who commit suicide seek 'peace' or to escape reality, speaking generally. Speaking in this context, suicide and Euthanasia is similar, maybe too much. </p>
