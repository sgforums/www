              <p>Yeah, exactly. I'm not trying to attack religion or anything, but I fear if we discuss an ethical issue on the basis of religious doctrines - that God is the end all and be all of everything, there will be a problem of coverage in the ethical theory that is derived from that basis. Well, for starters, not everyone beliefs in God. It is different from say arguing the issue from a Utilitarian perspective. Although one may think Utilitarianism is full of crap, but through persuasion, one can argue for Utilitarianism over say Ethical Egoism, as we are confronted with two categorical ideas. But God, the belief of God is an act of faith, faith is not an idea. When we channel to make faith an idea, then we are in danger of superimposing our faith upon others. </p>
              <p>I think to have as near an objective argument on this issue, keep religion out of it. </p>

              <p>its still ok to be physically handicapped. they can still support themselves with the assistance of the welfare organisations. do handicrafts, admin etc. they know how to seek aid.</p>
              <p>but with severe mental retardness, (which often come along with severe physical defects), and note: i'm talking about the severely retarded, with very low IQ. they are the people who are totally unable to care and fend for themselves if left alone. ppl who dunoe how to operate a simple lock and key, and end up trapped in their homes.</p>
              <p>there are also the ones who can't speak, can't walk, and had to depend on someone to spoonfeed them. how do u imagine they will survive on their own? and do u want to live 50-70 yrs in this sort of living conditions?</p>

              <p>humane's a personal view. unless you're getting tortured or beaten to death i don't see whats inhumane about it. at the end of the day i strongly feel euthanasia should be a personal choice.and i'm personally against involuntary euthanasia.</p>
              <p>its one thing to switch of the life support system of a dying person, its another entirely to make the choice of putting down another living being because you think you're doing good.</p>
              <p>humans aside, i'm not very fond of animals doubt i'm going to be a vegan soon but whenever i read about people putting down pet i always go wtf. i rather choose staving/suffering out there than get put down out of "goodwill".</p>

              <p>my two cents:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>beyond physical suffering, there is also dignity to be considered. not being able to pee on command, having fecal matter kept in a bag beside you (as in colon-rectal cancer) all the time, depending on others for financial support, is quite degrading, for me at least.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>the act of legalising Euthanasia itself cheapens the value of life.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There is no difference between suffering at the end of life and suffering in the middle of life, why is there assymetry between our views on suicide and euthanasia? Is there a threshold of physical and emotional suffering, maybe as bad as terminal illness that, once crossed, would justify a person's suicide morally?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>pondering the above points, i'm sure people have answers out there. Anyway, no philosophical school of thought is totally crap. although skeptism comes close, because not being sure about anything sounds pretty darn sure!</p>

              <p>yes, the docs can sustain ur life for as long as possible, but are you sure you want to live that long? maybe just long enough to see your will done up, but nothing more than that, i guess.</p>
              <p>you are bed-ridden. you have no hope of recovery. you are always in great pain. breathing is a torture to you. you are going to die, leaving a mountain of debt for your family, when that money could be better spent on something else, like, education for your child. (the hospital bills, regardless of whether there's subsidy or not, is certainly not cheap, nor affordable, if you are to stay in hospital for more than a month).</p>
              <p>in this sort of scenario, it will be better off for the patient if he or she is allowed to die, to die in dignity, where everything is still in his control. in other words, he or she won't æ­»å¾—å¾ˆéš¾çœ‹ã€‚</p>
              <p>i'm sure people want to die looking their best, if not, their second best. no one wants to die looking horrible, (with sores, amputated limbs etc.)</p>

              rather, what I mean instead of engaging in open ended philosophical

              <p><br>so are you advocating a rights-based approach to this issue? Using that approach, people should, intuitively, have the right to free themselves from needless suffering, especially in terminal cases. people should also have the right to dignity in death. but do these rights equate to the not so intuitive right to end one's own life? Is it a "categorical imperative", or moral duty to end the life of someone suffering needlessly before death, or isn't it? Someone has brought this up before, but when you watch movies, especially war ones, sometimes some soldier gets horribly maimed and asks his comrade to kill him. most pple feel sad, but not many pple's intuitive reaction is one of moral disapproval.</p>

              <p>beyond the more utilitarian concerns of abuses and children killing their parents, is it a person's right to die when he wants?</p>

              <p>Yes, that is true, but the same can be said of a person suffering now. overdose on a bottle of sleeping pills and end the misery. children can sneak into the hopsital and unplug their parent's life-support. Many things can happen in real life, but for the sake of argument, and also for the societal recognition that comes with a law, we should pursue the matter in principle, whether practically, rights-based or some other form of ethical model. Is Euthanasia "right" or "wrong". Utilitarianly, it must be argued by considering the positive and negative consequences of allowing euthansia. On the other hand, in terms of rights, it must be decided if euthanasia is a right, and should be allowed or disallowed regardless of the consequences.</p>

              <p>utilitarianism is an ethical theory that all action should be directed toward achieving greatest happiness for the greatest number of people - the belief that the value of a thing, a life, or action must and should be determined by its utility.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Egalitarianism is the affirmation, promotion of the belief in equal political, economic, social and civil rights for all people.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Should human life be considered an utility, a tool to be used and then discarded when its 'use by' date runs out? After all, 'pratical needs truimphs rights'.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The old, the retarded, the useless, the less than intelligent humans, the ugly, the fat, the stinkers, smokers, prostitutes, gays, deviants, mormans, conspiracy theorists, etc, etc, should be killed so that a society be kept pure, in the pursuit of 'practical needs'.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We would have difficulty communicating with those of different lingo. Lets kill them as well.</p>
              <p><br>We would have difficulty in asimilating with different skin colours. Lets kill the blacks, the yellows, the browns, etc.</p>
              <p><br>We would have difficulty accepting different religions. Lets kill them too.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We would have difficulty living with people with different temperament. Lets kill them.</p>

              <p>Look around and see who's left?</p>
              <p><br>That's the consequences when we allow 'practical needs to overide rights'. Utilitarianism is only good up to a certain point. When we apply utiltarianism to life itself, we will be in deep shit.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Today we talk about legalised ethanasia. Tomorrow, who will go next? The Pandora box of 'Practical needs' had been opened, and it can never be covered back.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Logically, scientifically and mathematically, utilitarianism will lead mankind into a higher plane of existance,to understand the universe and harness its energies to save mankind, for we would have discarded 'baggages' whom will only stop us from evolving faster.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But Utilitarianism will ultimately destroy mankind instead, for in the search of perfection, we flawed humans will only kill each other. The last human life will save no one.</p>
              <p> </p>

We may not do so in this generation, but the next or the following ones will be able to do so, with none need to have their life prematuredly ended.</p>

              <p>wonder why the givernment now seeks such an active role
              indiscussing the issue of euthanasia, when the western countries
              are no longer so interested in the issue. the issue of euthanasia
              is somewhat active 5 years ago, so we are 5 yrs behind the western
              country.</p>
              <p>so excluding the possibility that "euthanasia" is the hot global
              discussion topic, is there any reason behind the gahmen's sudden
              interest in euthanasia?</p>
              <p>The organ trading discussion starts only after the CK Tang
              kidney trading case.</p>
              <p>so do you think that this "revived" interest in euthanasia has
              anything to do with Mrs MM Lee staying in a coma?</p>

              <p>I rather not quote you Xtreyier, because i do not want my post to be unneccesarily long.</p>
              <p>But we live in a universe where resources are finite.</p>
              <p>The human spirit, no matter how noble we feel ourselves to be do not possess the ability to counteract that rule. We talk about nobility and honour only when resources are abundant.</p>
              <p>I don't get the obsession with insisting that Euthanasia will lead to murder. But if i get hit by a dehabiliting disease <strong>I</strong> want to be given the choice of chosing death.</p>
              <p> I find nothing noble in extending it when it's obvious the time extended will give me no quality of life. It forces my children to take care of me, and even to burn their resources paying for my bills. </p>
              <p>And quite frankly, i feel it rather ironic you're preaching pro life when a while back you're wanting war against Iran for something that wasn't their fault to begin with.</p>
              <p>You're obviously well educated judging by your posts but you lack the life experiences to make good use of your education.</p>

              <p>ya. i agree.</p>
              <p>legalising euthanasia allows one to take his or her life legally. likewise, one also have a choice to remain alive.</p>
              <p>if you are a pious person, you too can have a choice not to exercise ur freedom to euthanise yourself.</p>
              <p>we are talking about people who do really want to put an end to their torment.</p>
