Auditors are getting less and less trustworthy in ensuring financial reports are proper. In fact, I think Auditing firms should be charged a penalty each time any such case happens again. This will ensure they really do their job well. They should be ban from working secondary as financial consultants too so that there is no conflic of interest. This is what happens exactly for the Enron case in USA.</div>

In process of testing whether it is true and fair, they will test the internal controls blah blah...<br><br>If there is a material departure from the GAAP, then it will be highlighted.

If they provide what the coys perceive to be a bad service, then surely that coy will not approach them next time. Perhaps the law should be amended to deal with this conflict of interests.<br><br>PS: I THINK this is the way it works. I am not sure, so correct me if i am wrong. </div></blockquote>Auditors is employed by the shareholders of the company.  IF they provide a bad service, the shareholders will vote in the annual general meeting as to whether they want to continue to employ them.<br><br>And normally, the management is not equal to share holders.<br><br>That is not the case of most of the SGP locally listed company.</div>

SH themselves.<br><br>Take for example there is a really small company that is asking whether you should put in some $$$ into it... wat would you do?<br><br>I would look at the financials (if i dun noe, i would employ a professional to do it... ie the auditors).  If it is profitable, then you will want to know who is running the show in the company and whether he/she can be trusted with ur $$$.  If the fella is a crook, then i dun think u will invest rite?  Or alternative you would want to employ someone (the mgt) which you can trust (with integrity) to run the show for you. ie to make u $$$.<br><br>That is why those fund managers (the top one esp) talk and interview the mgt in the company that they are investing in... so as to get a feel of their ability... and sometimes integrity.<br><br>At the end of the day, the SH is suppose to take all the risk (and the rewards) of their investment.<br><br>Changes will be make to the GAAP constantly to accomodate the ever changing business environment... and auditors is one of the impt contributors to this function.<br><br>OK... maybe ACCS and Citijaya is a case of undisclosed transactions.  However, the auditors is not there to find fraud.  I am not defending them, but i was involved in these sort of audit before andI can vouch that it is almost impossible to find anything wrong when the CEO, CFO (90% of the time they already have extensive audit background), MD etc etc are all in cohoot to convince the auditors otherwise.<br><br>That is the reason I say that in the end, it is the integrity of the mgt.</div>
