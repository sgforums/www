But I, for one, don't care how money is made - as long as we all have a fair chance of getting our hands on some of it.<br><br>HOW TO GET MORE MONEY<br><br>In their multi-coloured Housing Board flats, Singaporeans dream of selling their homes for the magic figure of $700,000.<br><br>Or $150,000 above valuation, whichever is the higher.<br><br>But, with some 3,000 people on public assistance of a mere $260 a month, and many others earning less than $1,500 a month, not all of us can reach the top of the beanstalk.<br><br>How many people have an extra home to sell to cash in on the rising property market?<br><br>Like many other countries, there is a substantial income gap here, and it's getting bigger. Now, the top 20 per cent of employed households earn 12 times the wages of the bottom 20 per cent.<br><br>The Government's Workfare and Progress Package do help the disadvantaged.<br><br>But what of the middle-class, often called the sandwiched class? What can they do to pull themselves up?<br><br>The question can't be ignored when the rich get richer inexorably.<br><br>Cohen wrote: 'With $1 billion in the bank you have to try hard to avoid getting richer. Assuming a 10 per cent rate of return, your arduous task is spending $100 million a year, or about $274,000 a day.'<br><br>My question is: 'Who gets 10 per cent returns?'<br><br>Certainly not the thousands of people retiring each year on their CPF. Our Ordinary Account begets a niggardly 2.5 per cent. Banks offer savings interest rates of only less than 1 per cent.<br><br>During the Budget debate this year, MP Ong Kian Min worked out the sums.<br><br>'Over the long term of 40 years to retirement, an initial sum of $10,000 at 4 per cent a year will only become $48,000. But 10 per cent a year compounded will see it growing to $453,000, almost 10 times more. This will surely make a very significant and meaningful difference to our retirement.'<br><br>His point: The rich have superior returns because they can hire the best to manage their money for them.<br><br>He asked: 'Can the CPF Board help the ordinary CPF depositor grow his money by 8 to 10 per cent per year?'<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In reality, merit scholarships tend to favor the privileged, who get to go to the best schools, have the most resources and face the fewest distractions from studying.<br>The fact is that students with academic excellence who can afford to go to top schools will do so, even without a scholarship.<br>Admission based NOT on socio-economic background is already a test of merit.<br>Scholarship should be need-based to help reduce the financial burden of the poor and middle class instead of  including the privileged.<br>ItÂ’s already a myth- that scholarships based entirely on merit attract the best minds(many of them have wealthy parents). We can see the results produced by these scholars in govt and GLCs.<br>Another fact is that many American CEOs never took SAT and do not have Masters degrees.<br></div>
