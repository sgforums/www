              <h1>14 year old Singaporean vows to leave Singapore if PAP is not voted out by the next general election</h1>
              <p>Dear TR,</p>
              <p>After reading mails from Ms Melissa Quek, Mr Devoran, Ms T.Rajendran and Ms Judy Eng, I’ve decided to stop idling behind the computer screen waiting for change to happen. I’m writing in hopes that I can reach out to people whom may read and perhaps relate to what I have been experiencing as of late.</p>
              <p>First off, I’m a 14-year-old Secondary School student. My family aren’t rich, but we are staying in a 4-room HDB flat. Even though I’m 14, I understand the things that are happening.</p>
              <p>A little about my current family position. My mother has cancer and she has to go for check-ups regularly.</p>
              <p>Early last month, about 8 hours after my mother had left for a checkup at Singapore General Hospital, I went with my father. It was 11pm then, and we both were worried about her. There was no reason for a checkup to be this long. So we went, but we didn’t know which block she was at. I called her by phone.</p>
              <p>Turns out that she was at the emergency block, Block 1.</p>
              <p>A little of a back-story. A doctor who removed the tumor in her right lung claimed there was no need for chemotherapy. However, she still complained of pain in her right chest. It turned out that the cancer cells had already infected her lymph nodes and it wasn’t detected then. Now it’s too late though. The cancer cells are slowly eating her life away.</p>
              <p>Now that when I recall this incident, I feel disgust and hate towards this medical standard. Is this acceptable? Why should a check-up, in the EMERGENCY block, end up being 8 hours long?! How on earth did that doctor think that chemotherapy was not necessary?  I had no idea what happened. By the time my mother had received the report and we reached home, it was almost 2am. I missed school the next day as I was too fatigued.</p>
              <p>What is the government doing? Did they even CHECK? Where’s our money going?!</p>
              <p>Obviously that greedy geezer and the famiLEE.</p>
              <p>This really angers me. My mother also has very little money left in her bank. She cannot go to work, and now I’m also trying to save as much as I can so she doesn’t have to give me too much allowance everyday. GIRO doesn’t help much either. Luckily, my now married sister and brother, who have their own families, are helping. But that doesn’t even amount to much. It’s still a hard road to walk, but walk it we must.</p>
              <p>Other than this beyond disappointing medical incident, I also have a school life. It’s not very enjoyable either.</p>
              <p>MRT, public buses. I’m sure everyone knows that it’s crowded as heck, and my gigantic monster of a school bag doesn’t help either. Going my car isn’t any better. The road is congested as hell in the morning. In the afternoon, it’s better. But I occasionally have a couple of PRs sitting in the seat before me, talking loudly non-stop. Even the earpieces blasting my ears to deaf doesn’t help.</p>
              <p>In school, sometimes we have CME or PG lessons and the teacher gives the class a worksheet which sings praises about what PAP has done for the people. One I recall from memory, was roughly,</p>
              <p>“Every time I see old folks gathering recyclables from a garbage can on the street, my heart laments for them. The people these days are lacking filial piety…” …. “…I am glad that the government is helping the needy with assistance schemes. The government is doing a good job.”</p>
              <p>Obviously there is something very wrong there. I thought to myself, ‘if the government is doing a good job, then why are these old folks gathering and selling recyclables?’ I asked the teacher so, but he just shrugged and replied that he doesn’t know why.</p>
              <p>He’s probably another brainwashed PAP dog, that’s why.</p>
              <p>Also, 4 china students transfered into my class during the past month. They are always getting the praises and 1st place for tests/exams. They are leeching the motivation out of everyone. No one really mixes with them. The whole class might as well be a class for PRs instead! I cannot really express myself too well with words, but every time I see them, I can’t help but hate their attitude. I know not all of them are bad, but with all these incidents like then acting all big and mighty, or talking loud and sometimes insulting us behind our back loudly, really left this impression on me.</p>
              <p>The government loves them too. They bring money with them. They are also cheaper, faster, better. The way I see it, they are cheaters, liars, asses. Again, I know not all of them are bad. I am referring to the ones that really gives the impression. I have seen it too many times. It’s easy to tell.</p>
              <p>I also sometimes worry about my future if I were to continue to stay in Singapore. No doubt the population density would get really dense, and at some point, buying a house would blow a million dollars. Everything sucks you dry. So therefore I arrived with this conclusion. If nothing is done right to change is broken system, then I’m moving to another country. Living here is as good as being in a lifetime debt to the government, and that is the same as being on a leash.<br>I feel so much rage for this greedy government. Leeching our money, which they then throw them in a well praying a genie would come out. I vow, if PAP is still not voted out after the next election, then goodbye, Singapore, I’m moving onto another country once I am able to stand on my own.</p>
              <p>By the by, there’s more mind control worksheets I’ve done.</p>
              <p>“Do you feel proud to be a Singaporean? If so, why?”<br>No. The government is ignorant and greedy, that’s why.</p>
              <p>Anyway, thanks for reading. I feel better getting these off my chest. You may do whatever you wish with this.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Feel free to do whatever you want with your damn life because I don't need to babysit 14years old like you.</p>
              <p>Blame everyone around you if you wished, but don't forget to take a good generous servings of blame for yourself. Blame Bill Gates if you wished, cos you can blame anyone you are jealous of and you don't really need to have a real reason to hate anyone.

              <p>I will not wish you well, cos I believe people like you can only learn and grow from your own life experiences and I hope you'll have plenty of bad life experiences planned ahead for you.</p>
              <p>Have fun and enjoy the pain, and I hope people like you would go and die if you are unable to grow up even though you managed to lie through your difficulties in life.</p>

              <p>Blame everyone around you if you wished, but don't forget to take a good generous servings of blame for yourself. Blame Bill Gates if you wished, cos you can blame anyone you are jealous of and you don't really need to have a real reason to hate anyone. People like you can just go make up a reason to hate someone, just like many forumers here in sgforums.</p>
              <p>I will not wish you well, cos I believe people like you can only learn and grow from your own life experiences and I hope you'll have plenty of bad life experiences planned ahead for you.</p>
              <p>Have fun and enjoy the pain, and I hope people like you would go and die if you are unable to grow up even though you managed to lie through your difficulties in life.</p>

              <p>It doesn't means that the younger the age of the person who posted, the more credible it would become.</p>
              <p>Ask yourself, What is the aim/motive/ulterior motive of the person who posted? Does he/she really needs genuine help based on their attitude displayed on their posts? How is he/she as a person?</p>
              <p>I trust my maternal instincts and I know that kind words alone cannot help or heal or straighten out anyone who has already embarked down the wrong path. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
              <p>I don't need to spew out kind words like a robot. But if you appreciates people with only kind words, I can tell you that there are many sgforumers here that only knows how to provide kind, comforting words to many on the surface because that's the only way they know how to console another person to feel them and themselves better.</p>

              <h1>14 year old Singaporean vows to leave Singapore if PAP is not
              voted out by the next general election</h1>
              <p>Dear TR,</p>
              <p>After reading mails from Ms Melissa Quek, Mr Devoran, Ms
              T.Rajendran and Ms Judy Eng, I’ve decided to stop idling behind the
              computer screen waiting for change to happen. I’m writing in hopes
              that I can reach out to people whom may read and perhaps relate to
              what I have been experiencing as of late.</p>
              <p>First off, I’m a 14-year-old Secondary School student. My family
              aren’t rich, but we are staying in a 4-room HDB flat. Even though
              I’m 14, I understand the things that are happening.</p>
              <p>A little about my current family position. My mother has cancer
              and she has to go for check-ups regularly.</p>
              <p>Early last month, about 8 hours after my mother had left for a
              checkup at Singapore General Hospital, I went with my father. It
              was 11pm then, and we both were worried about her. There was no
              reason for a checkup to be this long. So we went, but we didn’t
              know which block she was at. I called her by phone.</p>
              <p>Turns out that she was at the emergency block, Block 1.</p>
              <p>A little of a back-story. A doctor who removed the tumor in her
              right lung claimed there was no need for chemotherapy. However, she
              still complained of pain in her right chest. It turned out that the
              cancer cells had already infected her lymph nodes and it wasn’t
              detected then. Now it’s too late though. The cancer cells are
              slowly eating her life away.</p>
              <p>Now that when I recall this incident, I feel disgust and hate
              towards this medical standard. Is this acceptable? Why should a
              check-up, in the EMERGENCY block, end up being 8 hours long?! How
              on earth did that doctor think that chemotherapy was not
              necessary?  I had no idea what happened. By the time my mother
              had received the report and we reached home, it was almost 2am. I
              missed school the next day as I was too fatigued.</p>
              <p>What is the government doing? Did they even CHECK? Where’s our
              money going?!</p>
              <p>Obviously that greedy geezer and the famiLEE.</p>
              <p>This really angers me. My mother also has very little money left
              in her bank. She cannot go to work, and now I’m also trying to save
              as much as I can so she doesn’t have to give me too much allowance
              everyday. GIRO doesn’t help much either. Luckily, my now married
              sister and brother, who have their own families, are helping. But
              that doesn’t even amount to much. It’s still a hard road to walk,
              but walk it we must.</p>
              <p>Other than this beyond disappointing medical incident, I also
              have a school life. It’s not very enjoyable either.</p>
              <p>MRT, public buses. I’m sure everyone knows that it’s crowded as
              heck, and my gigantic monster of a school bag doesn’t help either.
              Going my car isn’t any better. The road is congested as hell in the
              morning. In the afternoon, it’s better. But I occasionally have a
              couple of PRs sitting in the seat before me, talking loudly
              non-stop. Even the earpieces blasting my ears to deaf doesn’t
              help.</p>
              <p>In school, sometimes we have CME or PG lessons and the teacher
              gives the class a worksheet which sings praises about what PAP has
              done for the people. One I recall from memory, was roughly,</p>
              <p>“Every time I see old folks gathering recyclables from a garbage
              can on the street, my heart laments for them. The people these days
              are lacking filial piety…” …. “…I am glad that the government is
              helping the needy with assistance schemes. The government is doing
              a good job.”</p>
              <p>Obviously there is something very wrong there. I thought to
              myself, ‘if the government is doing a good job, then why are these
              old folks gathering and selling recyclables?’ I asked the teacher
              so, but he just shrugged and replied that he doesn’t know why.</p>
              <p>He’s probably another brainwashed PAP dog, that’s why.</p>
              <p>Also, 4 china students transfered into my class during the past
              month. They are always getting the praises and 1st place for
              tests/exams. They are leeching the motivation out of everyone. No
              one really mixes with them. The whole class might as well be a
              class for PRs instead! I cannot really express myself too well with
              words, but every time I see them, I can’t help but hate their
              attitude. I know not all of them are bad, but with all these
              incidents like then acting all big and mighty, or talking loud and
              sometimes insulting us behind our back loudly, really left this
              impression on me.</p>
              <p>The government loves them too. They bring money with them. They
              are also cheaper, faster, better. The way I see it, they are
              cheaters, liars, asses. Again, I know not all of them are bad. I am
              referring to the ones that really gives the impression. I have seen
              it too many times. It’s easy to tell.</p>
              <p>I also sometimes worry about my future if I were to continue to
              stay in Singapore. No doubt the population density would get really
              dense, and at some point, buying a house would blow a million
              dollars. Everything sucks you dry. So therefore I arrived with this
              conclusion. If nothing is done right to change is broken system,
              then I’m moving to another country. Living here is as good as being
              in a lifetime debt to the government, and that is the same as being
              on a leash.<br> I feel so much rage for this greedy government. Leeching our money,
              which they then throw them in a well praying a genie would come
              out. I vow, if PAP is still not voted out after the next election,
              then goodbye, Singapore, I’m moving onto another country once I am
              able to stand on my own.</p>
              <p>By the by, there’s more mind control worksheets I’ve done.</p>
              <p>“Do you feel proud to be a Singaporean? If so, why?”<br> No. The government is ignorant and greedy, that’s why.</p>
              <p>Anyway, thanks for reading. I feel better getting these off my
              chest. You may do whatever you wish with this.</p>
              <p> </p>
