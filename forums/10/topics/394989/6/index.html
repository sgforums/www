              <p>Why? Because do you want only 1 stop hospital at SGH? And people from Woodlands, Jurong and Changi all swarm over there but the bills are so affordable that the medical insurance can be forget of (Or rather, the amount payable for government to take your approach is equals to the current but after clamied from their private insurance fee, which not everyone has one such) ?</p>

              <p><br>True, but the cost of the hospital should go down to within a million.</p>
              <p>There is too much fancy technology involved in the new hospital.</p>

              <h1>Singapore secondary school student: I am literally being overran by foreign Students in my school</h1>
              <div class="date">
              <div class="dateleft">
              <p>After reading the ‘14 year old Singaporean vows to leave Singapore if PAP is not voted out by the next general election’. The article written by the student has given me a wake up call. I am also a Secondary School student just like her.</p>
              </div>
              </div>
              <p>First off, what I would like to mention is that I am literally being overran by Foreign Students in my school. I agree that they do provide some motivation for us to catch up and win them. However, what I cannot accept is that they are not only rude, but also inconsiderate for others. I had an experience where the foreign students would just sit at any table they like in the canteen and throw whoever’s belongings onto the floor just to sit there – yes, even if there are already students sitting there, they will just push them off or threaten them.</p>
              <p>The foreign students are mostly from Indonesia, a minority of them are from china though. They usually stick together and do not welcome others into their group. I would say not a lot of people pay attention to them but they do piss people off and I would say my friends and I do not really like them. They shout across to each other in class in their own language like we are invisible, they talk loudly everywhere, copy our homework.</p>
              <p>Even when they want to copy our homework, they go like “Oi, let me see” I do not believe that they are from scholarships but rather they’re family are just plain rich. Also, some of them have the habit of skipping school for no reason whatsoever, even though we are having our O lvls this year, some of them can still go clubbing at night to the wee hours and just report sick the next day. They also treat our belonging like thrash and just throw it around on the floor if they want to sit at the place. I do not see my school doing anything about them even though they skip their CCA’s and skip school. Sometimes I really wish they would all just pack up and go back to their country.</p>
              <p>Why should these type of people be accepted into our society, they are only doing more harm than good to it. Also, why is it that Singaporean’s are a minority in Singapore, doesn’t that just prove that something is very wrong with the way this country is being run?</p>
              <p>Till this day, I still do not understand why people still vote for the PAP, when they tell people to send the elderly to Malaysia while they work in Singapore. I quote from HEALTH MINISTER Mr Khaw Boon Wan speech “My personal view is, our land is expensive. But we have nearby neighbours in Johor, Batam and Bintan. The elderly want to reach their doctors within half to one hour.” Why do we have to send our elderly overseas just to ensure they get treatment on time. Singapore is a world class country, yet we cannot even assure the elderly that they will be able to reach treatment in time when they request for help. What rights do we have to boast that we are a world class country. Shouldn’t a world class country be able to do that?</p>
              <p>I wish to share this with many others too. Why is it that in Singapore, things only go one way – up. It seems that Singapore is the only country in the world that is able to defy gravity as everything goes up, except our pays. Prices of food have increased, prices of housing have increased, GST increases, the Government gets a pay rise to avoid corruption, prices of public transport goes up, the number of ERP in Singapore goes up, Electricity and water prices goes up. Our pay? One way, down and rarely up. I still remember that during my primary school. $2 can last me for the whole week in school, right now? $2 is barely enough to last me for one meal in my school.</p>
              <p>That is all I have to share. Thank you for reading.</p>

              <p>However, maybe I am just more fortunate. When I was in Sec 3 / 4, many of them are Indonesians (About 1/4 to 1/2 of them and my class is a size of about 37 including myself) and there are no such case like her........ I dont think all the foreginers are that bad, is not like all Singaporeans are good either, if not why would there be prisons anyway.</p>

              <p>Maybe there must be a balance between each. It seemed that the ecology can bring a long term savings on utilities bills and save our earth and to be a world class country (Despite politically not), it need to have some kind of technologies for certain treatment. If not we can learn from North Korea where the hospitals and number of doctors / nurses are actually enough or even more than enough and they have no worry of such (No insurance for them, becuase their world do not have such scam concept) because the leader have taken care of it. But the problem is they have the lack of resources, and the needed technology for certain treatments (Maybe not so due to less exposure to bad life habits = less illness) but what is certain is that should they have enough food and medicine, the life generally should be ok. (Electricity is another important issue as well, but OT)</p>

But the problem is they have the lack of resources, and the needed technology for certain treatments (Maybe not so due to less exposure to bad life habits = less illness) but what is certain is that should they have enough food and medicine, the life generally should be ok. (Electricity is another important issue as well, but OT)</p>

              <p>Obviously it is from its intimate relations with the "zwei-siao" Minister that the pseudo-Bavarian "zwei-siao-Hog" can even know how much has been spent for the trees to be planted on the roof of the hospital.</p>
              <p>Was that a concern to Singaporeans ?</p>

              <p>Is it any surprise that the "zwei-siao-Hog" need a pseudo-Bavarain monicker to enhance its characteristic "guts and gore" infatuation with the likes of a little Hitler and the supposed gangsta in CSJ ?</p>
              <p>The irony of its "zwei-siao" opinion concerning lesser technology for a new hospital is that it can ironically spell the new hospital as " <em><span style="color: #0000ff;">the new Khoo Tec<span style="color: #ff0000;">h </span>Phuat Hospital </span></em>".</p>
              <p>Thish confirms the often repeated fact that it is too uptight with its views of things around itself - as it struts angrily as a pseudo-Bavarian with the brain of a "zwei-siao-Hog" to insist its erroneous views are the right views.</p>
              <p>Does it even know what technology can be fanciful ones in its sweeping statement to impress everyone with its own brilliant incompetencies ?</p>

              The article written by the student has given me a wake up call. I
              am also a Secondary School student just like her.</p>
              </div>
              </div>
              <p>First off, what I would like to mention is that I am literally
              being overran by Foreign Students in my school. I agree that they
              do provide some motivation for us to catch up and win them.
              However, what I cannot accept is that they are not only rude, but
              also inconsiderate for others. I had an experience where the
              foreign students would just sit at any table they like in the
              canteen and throw whoever’s belongings onto the floor just to sit
              there – yes, even if there are already students sitting there, they
              will just push them off or threaten them.</p>
              <p>The foreign students are mostly from Indonesia, a minority of
              them are from china though. They usually stick together and do not
              welcome others into their group. I would say not a lot of people
              pay attention to them but they do piss people off and I would say
              my friends and I do not really like them. They shout across to each
              other in class in their own language like we are invisible, they
              talk loudly everywhere, copy our homework.</p>
              <p>Even when they want to copy our homework, they go like “Oi, let
              me see” I do not believe that they are from scholarships but rather
              they’re family are just plain rich. Also, some of them have the
              habit of skipping school for no reason whatsoever, even though we
              are having our O lvls this year, some of them can still go clubbing
              at night to the wee hours and just report sick the next day. They
              also treat our belonging like thrash and just throw it around on
              the floor if they want to sit at the place. I do not see my school
              doing anything about them even though they skip their CCA’s and
              skip school. Sometimes I really wish they would all just pack up
              and go back to their country.</p>
              <p>Why should these type of people be accepted into our society,
              they are only doing more harm than good to it. Also, why is it that
              Singaporean’s are a minority in Singapore, doesn’t that just prove
              that something is very wrong with the way this country is being
              run?</p>
              <p>Till this day, I still do not understand why people still vote
              for the PAP, when they tell people to send the elderly to Malaysia
              while they work in Singapore. I quote from HEALTH MINISTER Mr Khaw
              Boon Wan speech “My personal view is, our land is expensive. But we
              have nearby neighbours in Johor, Batam and Bintan. The elderly want
              to reach their doctors within half to one hour.” Why do we have to
              send our elderly overseas just to ensure they get treatment on
              time. Singapore is a world class country, yet we cannot even assure
              the elderly that they will be able to reach treatment in time when
              they request for help. What rights do we have to boast that we are
              a world class country. Shouldn’t a world class country be able to
              do that?</p>
              <p>I wish to share this with many others too. Why is it that in
              Singapore, things only go one way – up. It seems that Singapore is
              the only country in the world that is able to defy gravity as
              everything goes up, except our pays. Prices of food have increased,
              prices of housing have increased, GST increases, the Government
              gets a pay rise to avoid corruption, prices of public transport
              goes up, the number of ERP in Singapore goes up, Electricity and
              water prices goes up. Our pay? One way, down and rarely up. I still
              remember that during my primary school. $2 can last me for the
              whole week in school, right now? $2 is barely enough to last me for
              one meal in my school.</p>
              <p>That is all I have to share. Thank you for reading.</p>

              <p>You are wrong.</p>
              <p>There is a chain effect. Yes, a child dun have to worry with ERP and COE, but think this:</p>
              <p>Some of the child (18) got a car because her dad is a businessman.</p>
              <p>Now, everyday must go to school, which means everyday (Except weekends) may have to go pass CBD etc because not everybody in the East study in Temasek Poly or people living in Woodlands, Sembawang and Yishun ended up in Republic Poly etc.</p>
              <p>Like this, then there is a chance to go via ERP and maybe there is a limit her dad give on ERP allowance. (Buying a car is a birthday present most likely dont cover these, just like lucky draw)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Of course, this is extreme case. Lets look at more realistic case.</p>
              <p>Dad owns a car. Everyday he is burden with ERP becoz the work place in CBD when they live in non CBD areas.</p>
              <p>Now what happen is, becoz he dont earn so much, with the ever expanding ERP, and price increasing, it means he can give to the family is getting less and less.</p>
              <p>With the income to the family is decreasing, then what a mother of a child could do is the reduce the allowance for their child.</p>
              <p>It affects in all age group of child.</p>
              <p>For primary school kid, it means that they have 1 less pokemon card to trade or an ice-cream.</p>
              <p>For secondary school kid, it means that they have 1 less bag, accessories or movie with their friends etc</p>
              <p>For Poly / JC kid, it means that they have less money to save for another pa toh-ing date, or give their gf / bf present in an upcoming "important date".</p>
              <p>So, they cant blame their parents for incompetence in providing enough allowance for all these but government for collecting too much money from their family and in result of reduce in all these things stated above.</p>

              <p>Also, because he is approaching 16, after his O levels, after the year of December 31, he will have to pay adult fare, despite having a secondary school card until he admitted into a Poly or JC (Much sooner than Poly). I have experienced this, so dont argue.</p>

              <p>You still missed the point. Thinking of costs few years ahead??? And if the article did not mention, that means you are second guessing. There's no point adding more "ifs". Easily, one could also ask what if his/her parents are millionaires?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As for your GST point, it's so obvious you are unclear in your head. First you say they face GST when going for those luxury items. Now you tell me it's their meals. Make up your mind. If they are seriously so hard up to worry and complain about that extra 10 cents per meal, what for go out to watch movies?</p>

              <p>You still missed the point. Thinking of costs few years ahead???
              And if the article did not mention, that means you are second
              guessing. There's no point adding more "ifs". Easily, one could
              also ask what if his/her parents are millionaires?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As for your GST point, it's so obvious you are unclear in your
              head. First you say they face GST when going for those luxury
              items. Now you tell me it's their meals. Make up your mind. If they
              are seriously so hard up to worry and complain about that extra 10
              cents per meal, what for go out to watch movies?</p>
