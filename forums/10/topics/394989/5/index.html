              <p><br>Disagree.</p>
              <p>How long have you been in the USA, Australia, NZ, UK, etc? Just for a trip, or for work? If it is just for a trip, I think you cannot stereotype USA.</p>
              <p>I have been living in the USA, worked in the UK, and parts of Europe before. To me, USA, on the whole, has relatively good standards of service. There are people who only care about tips. But there are those that have strong pride in what they do, and when they are in service, they pride themselves on good service.</p>
              <p>Of course, there are those times when I get frustrated trying to reach someone over the hotline, when I am passed from dept to dept.</p>
              <p>I will break down UK to Scotland, Wales and English. The English generally gives me a sense of being fake, they are aloof and generally aren't really friendly to Asians. The Scots and Welsh are pretty nice people, they are proud of their own customs and traditions, and they respect you when you understand their culture.</p>
              <p>I can go on further, but ultimately, I just wish to say. Do not stereotype other countries, particularly if you have only gone on a travel there. EVEN IF you have worked there like me, at most, you can voice your own opinion.</p>

              <p>seriously, this country is going to the dogs.</p>
              <p>first you see record breaking housing prices for an economy that was the FIRST to slip into recession. e.g. 4 rm hdb flats selling for over $600k to foreigners. and those 2 flats only have 60 odds yrs of lease left.</p>
              <p>coe prices jumping by 10k in 1 month.</p>
              <p>public trains and buses more crowded than ever. service frequency is dropping during peak hours, yet price keep rising. and it is not that operators like SMRT are not making any profit. according to smrt website, "<em>SMRT</em> NET <em>PROFIT</em> GREW 7.6% TO $41.2M FOR THIRD QUARTER 
              FY2009".</p>
              <p>surely they are not short of cash to purchase more buses. as for trains, i won't comment, as it is already close to its full potential alr.</p>
              <p>food prices are also rising. last time, foodcourts are the representives of economy, where food were sold at cheap and economical prices.</p>
              <p>nowadays, take a bowl of noodles plus a soft drink, it easily amount to $5, more if you order those jap,korean food etc. certain fast food set meals are now cheaper than wad you can get at a foodcourt.</p>
              <p>singapore's population has leapt by 1m from 4m in 2000, to close to 5m in 2010, with plans to go up to a further 6m in 2020.</p>
              <p>singapore's population density is already among one of the world's top. can we handle a further 1m? our infrastructure is already showing the strain of the 1m we took in over the past 10 yrs.</p>
              <p>social-wise? currently, 1 out of 3 person we see on the streets are of foreign origins, given the government's census report recently published on the newspaper. an additional 1m will mean that 1 in 2 person we see are of foreign origin.</p>
              <p>foreign talents and workers are spoiling the market, by artificially depressing the market rate for wages, taking advantage of the absence of the minimum income law in singapore. while median family income has rise, due to more dual-income families, individual income has actually experienced a small drop. (bear in mind that we are seeing a reduction in individual income and an increase in cost of living)</p>
              <p>this shows the detrimental effect of the influx of too many foreigners. (not saying that having foreigners is all bad. they still need to fill certain shortfalls in manpower in industries like manufacturing and construction. the issue is that we have too many in too short a time, and our infrastructure has not increase at the same pace as the population.)</p>
              <p>an article from the Newpaper last week spoke of the woes of local job seekers. a diploma holder, with years of experience in the service industry, seeks the position of supervisor in an f&amp;b outlet, seeking a pay of $1.6k, which is not unreasonable given her qualifications and experience.</p>
              <p>however, she was undercut by a filipino candidate asking for $1.2k salary, which is below market price for a supervisory role.</p>
              <p>bearing in mind that our government actively encourage singaporeans to upgrade themselves to make themselves more marketable, through courses and experience.</p>
              <p>but reality told us that it is eventually labor cost which makes a difference whether you get a job.</p>
              <p>and some questions to ask ourselves:</p>
              <p>1) is it true that singaporeans are not willing to take up service jobs, thus theres a shortage of labor? e.g. F&amp;B, receptionist, clerk, cashier, storekeeper etc. (white collared in nature)</p>
              <p>2) are singaporeans expecting too much? (dip holder with experience, looking for supervisory job tier. is $1.6k too much?</p>
              <p>3) government officials always quote cleaners and construction workers as jobs singaporean shun. what about "white-collared" jobs like admin clerk, F&amp;B, storekeeper, etc? Are singaporeans shunning those jobs? if not, why are there so many foreigners allowed in to work in these sectors?</p>
              <p>4) workers' dorms aside, why are we seeing so many foreign workers housed in HDB flats, condos, and private properties? employers are not able to seek out dorms for their employees, and thus have to resort to renting houses from residents, or buying up properties to permanently house their staff. this is also responsible for the rise in housing price.</p>
              <p>pt 4 is based on empirical observations of government raids on illegal subleting, where 1 housing unit houses 20 foreign workers. this shows that there is a chronic shortage of workers' housing. so all the more we should halt the intake of foreign labour. (not necessary cutting down the number, just maintaining the number would do.)</p>

              <p>Look at it this way.  When an economy grows, which Singapore has until the financial crisis, there's bound to be inflation.  Basically, the money supply has to keep up with the growth, and in this case, the increase in population.  Thus prices will go up as well.  Inflation bound to happen, and I think its just a matter of the how fast.</p>
              <p>It seems to me, that Singapore grew a little too fast and we are literally paying the price for it now.  </p>
              <p>More importantly, there is also a question of the income gap. Is the income gap growing in between the upper and middle classes? If the gap continues to grow like this, then more sad stories like this will appear.  The question is now about the distribution of wealth.  Is there social justice in the current distribution?</p>
              <p>As for the 14 year old kid... wait til u're 21 before u decide to quit.  Else ppl will think u're just another NS dodger.  Besides, migrating to another country is gonna cost a lot of money as well, money that neither u nor ur family  do not have. </p>

              <p>Look at it this way.  When an economy grows, which Singapore has until the financial crisis, there's bound to be inflation.  Basically, the money supply has to keep up with the growth, and in this case, the increase in population.  Thus prices will go up as well.  Inflation bound to happen, and I think its just a matter of the how fast.</p>
              <p>It seems to me, that Singapore grew a little too fast and we are literally paying the price for it now.  </p>

              <p>"<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">a little too fast</span></em>" - is an understatement when one consider that it was a deliberate head-on rush since independence in 1965 despite all costs to the various social and economic programs that were forced onto Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>Singapore's economic growth was based on "inflating" the "economic balloon" by attracting the many large MNCs and continue to be so - and all done at the expense of any second tier local manufacturing enterprise that should have been the economic foundaton for the bulk of local employment. </p>
              <p>There was simply an over dependence on MNCs that were only attracted to low costs, and the status quo was artificially sustained to keep jobs available to Singaporeans despite the fact that we are small in numbers - and require imported human resource to meet the demands of the MNCs.</p>
              <p>This was reported by three Economic Review Committees for changes to be made following the crash of 1987, 1997 and 2004-2005.</p>
              <p>Was economic growth sustainable up until the financial crisis ? </p>
              <p>Which financial crisis were you referring to ?</p>
              <p>There was the stock market crash on <strong>Black Monday in 1987</strong> that began in New York despite the glowing economic activities; then that was the <strong>financial meltdown in 1997</strong> that began in Thailand; and the <strong>global banking crisi in 2008</strong> that began in the USA.</p>
              <p>In all these crashes, Singapore's economy was torn to shred as the entire economy was build on the basis of depending on the good fortunes experieinced by others.</p>
              <p>Inspite the separate reviews by three Economic Review Committees - we continue the same path that do not encourage nor sustain the growth of private enterprise - by releasing the entrepreneurial energy that is held captive by the PAP Government sitting on a large sum of Singaporean's monies in the CPF.</p>
              <p>Was the "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">money supply keeping up with economic growth</span></em>" the cause for our present inflationary problem ?</p>
              <p>Was the "money supply" not supposed to be "well managed" by the super talent that was holding the portfolio of the Finance Minister - up until it was relinquished to Comrade Tharman who took over after Election 2006 ?</p>
              <p>Surely, you will get a vehement denial from this PAP Government.</p>
              <p>It has been the PAP's idea since 1965 that infation was supposed to have been managed through the strength of the Singapore Dollar, which is supposed to help us purchase all that we need at lower prices from the region and beyond.</p>
              <p>Primary Industries in agriculture and livestock farming were all divested to the various neighboring countries that were supposed to have an economic advantage over us for such activities, while we concentrate our resources to industrialising Singapore.</p>
              <p>It was a continuous balancing acts of importing and exporting goods and services with our neighbors - both near and far.</p>
              <p>Was it well managed to the extent of making ourselves strong and resilient ?</p>
              <p>It seems that one component in the Total Defense concept has not been fixed and left us continuously vulnerable and exposed.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>More importantly, there is also a question of the income gap. Is the income gap growing in between the upper and middle classes? If the gap continues to grow like this, then more sad stories like this will appear.  The question is now about the distribution of wealth.  Is there social justice in the current distribution?</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Can "social justice" exist in Singapore - when this PAP Government do not recognise anything that hints of "social justice" ?</p>
              <p>To do so will require the PAP leadership to recognise basic "Human Rights" - can this happen in Singapore, even as we are a signatory to the United Nations charter ?</p>

              <p>If one has given up on Singapore at the age of 14 - is there any need to be concerned about being another NS dodger ?</p>
              <p>Some countries prefer the younger ones then accept any older ones that can be a burden to their social systems.</p>
              <p>For those who are determined to stay and recover what rightfully belong to us, we should remain alert and concious to all the political shenanigans poured on us, as the PAP ropes tighten to give themselves a better grip on the situation that they are fast losing control.</p>

              <p>i never pro PAP but what the TS mention seem abit bias. kinda spoonfed mentality.</p>
              <p>for those who think oversea are always better, think twice.</p>
              <p>In some part of aust, if u wana a supper, you have to pay $15 -20 for a horfun and it is in downtown. if you wana fix a window grill, you wait 2mths. willing to pay 30% tax deducted from your monthly pay? </p>
              <p>of coz, i never like the PAP, many of their policy are flaws and confusing which only they can explain to themselves. lack of transparency in govt ministeries, and social welfare could be improve further.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i dont understand why govt need to build multi million hospital instead of spending the money subsidising the poor medical bills further.</p>

              <p>Why? Because do you want only 1 stop hospital at SGH? And people from Woodlands, Jurong and Changi all swarm over there but the bills are so affordable that the medical insurance can be forget of (Or rather, the amount payable for government to take your approach is equals to the current but after clamied from their private insurance fee, which not everyone has one such) ?</p>

              <p>A frustrated child must always act out its frustrations in the most pretentious ways.</p>
              <p>How else can one understand what pent up frustrations can be found from the antics of a frustratedly flogged pseudo-Bavarian "zwei-siao-Hog" ?</p>
              <p>One can be quite satisfied that it is the intimate knowledge of a 'hog' that reveals its "zwei-siao" familiarity with its own turd that lead its stupidity to share it with others.</p>
              <p>The "zwei-siao-Hog" should try harder to wipe off Hitler's goo that it had worn with such pride from its pseudo-Bavarian moniker.</p>
              <p>Pathectically, even as the "zwei-siao-Hog" struts around the Forum displaying  its own proclaimed "guts and gore" - it is possessed by the ghost of a neutered CSJ, which explains for its "zwei-siao-ness" in blaming CSJ for its own style of preferred gung-ho gangsta language and behavior.</p>
              <p>Ironically, the "zwei-siao-Hog" is shameless in its usual plagiarist ways to have no qualms to bring anyone back to its own proud vulgar creativity - so as to remind everone of its role as an accomplished <a rel="nofollow" href="/forums/10/topics/391308?page=2"><em>‘mother fucker’ (*1)</em>  </a></p>
              <p>It will be quite appropriate to address the pseudo-Bavarian "zwei-siao-Hog" by its preferred title - <a rel="nofollow" href="/forums/10/topics/391308?page=2"><em>"Hey, fucker of your own mother," (*2)</em> </a>- which will surely make his day as a 'gung-ho' macho little Hitler strutting around with a pseudo-Bavarian moniker.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, there is no vaccine against stupidity for a "zwei-siao-Hog".</p>

              <p>Hey fucker of your own mother, Aturdie, the moniker is for you and you alone. No one else in the world deserves a moniker as such.</p>
              <p>You follow the ways of Adolf Hitler and proclaim the actions of the anti-Singaporean CSJ as righteous, so all such vulgar titles belong to you alone.</p>
