              Once this new generation gets to vote, the power of PAP will be over. I wonder what new schemes PAP will come up to perpetrate their power. Maybe flood electorate with pro-PAP new citizens.

              <h1>14 year old Singaporean vows to leave Singapore if PAP is not
              voted out by the next general election</h1>
              <p>Dear TR,</p>
              <p>After reading mails from Ms Melissa Quek, Mr Devoran, Ms
              T.Rajendran and Ms Judy Eng, I’ve decided to stop idling behind the
              computer screen waiting for change to happen. I’m writing in hopes
              that I can reach out to people whom may read and perhaps relate to
              what I have been experiencing as of late.</p>
              <p>First off, I’m a 14-year-old Secondary School student. My family
              aren’t rich, but we are staying in a 4-room HDB flat. Even though
              I’m 14, I understand the things that are happening.</p>
              <p>A little about my current family position. My mother has cancer
              and she has to go for check-ups regularly.</p>
              <p>Early last month, about 8 hours after my mother had left for a
              checkup at Singapore General Hospital, I went with my father. It
              was 11pm then, and we both were worried about her. There was no
              reason for a checkup to be this long. So we went, but we didn’t
              know which block she was at. I called her by phone.</p>
              <p>Turns out that she was at the emergency block, Block 1.</p>
              <p>A little of a back-story. A doctor who removed the tumor in her
              right lung claimed there was no need for chemotherapy. However, she
              still complained of pain in her right chest. It turned out that the
              cancer cells had already infected her lymph nodes and it wasn’t
              detected then. Now it’s too late though. The cancer cells are
              slowly eating her life away.</p>
              <p>Now that when I recall this incident, I feel disgust and hate
              towards this medical standard. Is this acceptable? Why should a
              check-up, in the EMERGENCY block, end up being 8 hours long?! How
              on earth did that doctor think that chemotherapy was not
              necessary?  I had no idea what happened. By the time my mother
              had received the report and we reached home, it was almost 2am. I
              missed school the next day as I was too fatigued.</p>
              <p>What is the government doing? Did they even CHECK? Where’s our
              money going?!</p>
              <p>Obviously that greedy geezer and the famiLEE.</p>
              <p>This really angers me. My mother also has very little money left
              in her bank. She cannot go to work, and now I’m also trying to save
              as much as I can so she doesn’t have to give me too much allowance
              everyday. GIRO doesn’t help much either. Luckily, my now married
              sister and brother, who have their own families, are helping. But
              that doesn’t even amount to much. It’s still a hard road to walk,
              but walk it we must.</p>
              <p>Other than this beyond disappointing medical incident, I also
              have a school life. It’s not very enjoyable either.</p>
              <p>MRT, public buses. I’m sure everyone knows that it’s crowded as
              heck, and my gigantic monster of a school bag doesn’t help either.
              Going my car isn’t any better. The road is congested as hell in the
              morning. In the afternoon, it’s better. But I occasionally have a
              couple of PRs sitting in the seat before me, talking loudly
              non-stop. Even the earpieces blasting my ears to deaf doesn’t
              help.</p>
              <p>In school, sometimes we have CME or PG lessons and the teacher
              gives the class a worksheet which sings praises about what PAP has
              done for the people. One I recall from memory, was roughly,</p>
              <p>“Every time I see old folks gathering recyclables from a garbage
              can on the street, my heart laments for them. The people these days
              are lacking filial piety…” …. “…I am glad that the government is
              helping the needy with assistance schemes. The government is doing
              a good job.”</p>
              <p>Obviously there is something very wrong there. I thought to
              myself, ‘if the government is doing a good job, then why are these
              old folks gathering and selling recyclables?’ I asked the teacher
              so, but he just shrugged and replied that he doesn’t know why.</p>
              <p>He’s probably another brainwashed PAP dog, that’s why.</p>
              <p>Also, 4 china students transfered into my class during the past
              month. They are always getting the praises and 1st place for
              tests/exams. They are leeching the motivation out of everyone. No
              one really mixes with them. The whole class might as well be a
              class for PRs instead! I cannot really express myself too well with
              words, but every time I see them, I can’t help but hate their
              attitude. I know not all of them are bad, but with all these
              incidents like then acting all big and mighty, or talking loud and
              sometimes insulting us behind our back loudly, really left this
              impression on me.</p>
              <p>The government loves them too. They bring money with them. They
              are also cheaper, faster, better. The way I see it, they are
              cheaters, liars, asses. Again, I know not all of them are bad. I am
              referring to the ones that really gives the impression. I have seen
              it too many times. It’s easy to tell.</p>
              <p>I also sometimes worry about my future if I were to continue to
              stay in Singapore. No doubt the population density would get really
              dense, and at some point, buying a house would blow a million
              dollars. Everything sucks you dry. So therefore I arrived with this
              conclusion. If nothing is done right to change is broken system,
              then I’m moving to another country. Living here is as good as being
              in a lifetime debt to the government, and that is the same as being
              on a leash.<br> I feel so much rage for this greedy government. Leeching our money,
              which they then throw them in a well praying a genie would come
              out. I vow, if PAP is still not voted out after the next election,
              then goodbye, Singapore, I’m moving onto another country once I am
              able to stand on my own.</p>
              <p>By the by, there’s more mind control worksheets I’ve done.</p>
              <p>“Do you feel proud to be a Singaporean? If so, why?”<br> No. The government is ignorant and greedy, that’s why.</p>
              <p>Anyway, thanks for reading. I feel better getting these off my
              chest. You may do whatever you wish with this.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Wow I'm not in such a bad situation as this fellow teen but my mindset over the PAP is just the same as his! Actually the PAP has been good at first after Singapore's independence but recently their standard has gone down. And then they force us to serve NS. So are we defending our own property with NS or foreigner's property when Singaporeans can't afford houses now and most of the people who are buying are the rich foreigners? So, let's vote for another party!</p>
