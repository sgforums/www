These cost hundreds of dollars. Medisave can pay for it if patients are in hospital. But most of these scans are outpatient, so I've decided to expand Medisave to cover this," said Minister Khaw.<br><br>MediShield policies will also be reviewed so patients pay less upfront.<br><br>"For example, if you're in a private hospital and your bill is $5,000. You pay $3,000 upfront and your insurance company takes care of the rest. I've seen some numbers over the past months and I think $3,000 is too high. So there's room to reduce it further to say $2,500. And patients can save $500," said Mr Khaw.<br><br>The Health Ministry said MediShield reforms made two years ago saved thousands of dollars for patients with large bills.<br><br>The increase in Medisave limits last year also helped many Singaporeans cut down on their medical expenses.<br><br>An average Class B1 patient, for example, needs only to fork out cash for 20% of a non-surgical hospital bill, compared to some 30% before the increase.<br><br>The Health Ministry said the Medisave and MediShield changes will take place before the end of 2007.<br><br>You can find out more about the changes made to Medisave and MediShield by tuning into the programme called "A Future Singapore: Conversation with Minister Khaw Boon Wan" on January 11 at 10.30pm on MediaCorp TV's Channel 8.<br><br>There will also be a repeat broadcast next Monday, Jan 15 at 1.30pm on the same channel. - CNA /ls<br></div>

But I certainly hope that we can keep it to S$10 increase, as per the last round. So the question really is, with an extra of S$10, how much help can you bring to co-payment?"<br><br>Patients now have to pay 40 percent of large hospital bills after MediShield was revamped two years ago.<br><br>Minister Khaw says: "My desire has always been to bring it down to 20 percent. Now's 40 percent, so I don't know whether S$10 is sufficient. If $10 is only sufficient to bring it down to 30 percent, 40 to 30 percent is still a worthwhile outcome.<br><br>"I think slightly more than $10 is acceptable, but if it's more than S$20, S$30, people will find it hard (to cope)."<br><br>Moving on to MediSave, Mr Khaw says that recent changes to the scheme should not become an incentive for Singaporeans to delay treatment of chronic diseases.<br><br>The MediSave scheme was liberalised last October to help pay for outpatient treatment for those with chronic diseases, subject to an annual cap of S$300.<br><br>These diseases include diabetes, stroke, hypertension and high cholesterol.<br><br>"The key intention was to make a point Â– to please treat it when it is still mild, then your cost is not that high. If you wait until it is too late, with multiple morbidities, even S$3000 isn't enough," says the Health Minister.<br><br>The changes to MediShield will be implemented later this year.

            <div class='col-md body'>ST Forum 14 April 2007<br><br>RECENTLY, I helped a friend's father and my mother to make ElderShield claims. The irony was that both the claimants died within one year of the start of claims.<br>How many patients get to live for five years to claim the full $18,000?<br><br>The first few months of a patient's inability to perform three or more of six activities of daily living are the most taxing on family members. There is a lot of adjustments to be made by family members and the insured. A payout that works out to $10 a day is hardly sufficient.<br><br>The period for claims could be shortened, say, to three years so that a higher monthly payout can be made.

These cost hundreds of dollars. Medisave can pay for it if patients are in hospital. But most of these scans are outpatient, so I've decided to expand Medisave to cover this," said Minister Khaw.<br><br>MediShield policies will also be reviewed so patients pay less upfront.<br><br>"For example, if you're in a private hospital and your bill is $5,000. You pay $3,000 upfront and your insurance company takes care of the rest. I've seen some numbers over the past months and I think $3,000 is too high. So there's room to reduce it further to say $2,500. And patients can save $500," said Mr Khaw.<br><br>The Health Ministry said MediShield reforms made two years ago saved thousands of dollars for patients with large bills.<br><br>The increase in Medisave limits last year also helped many Singaporeans cut down on their medical expenses.<br><br>An average Class B1 patient, for example, needs only to fork out cash for 20% of a non-surgical hospital bill, compared to some 30% before the increase.<br><br>The Health Ministry said the Medisave and MediShield changes will take place before the end of 2007.<br><br>You can find out more about the changes made to Medisave and MediShield by tuning into the programme called "A Future Singapore: Conversation with Minister Khaw Boon Wan" on January 11 at 10.30pm on MediaCorp TV's Channel 8.<br><br>There will also be a repeat broadcast next Monday, Jan 15 at 1.30pm on the same channel. - CNA /ls<br>[/b]</blockquote>This is a classic case-in-point of criminals at work.
