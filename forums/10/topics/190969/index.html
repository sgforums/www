            <div class='col-md body'>Learn from the best ,but not the bad health system.<br>While many critizes Spore health sys,we shall look how<br>UK people are feeling.<br><br><blockquote> Posted: 15 May 2006 0720 hrs<br><br>English patients flying abroad to go under the knife<br><br>LONDON: Sick of sky-high prices and lengthy waits for operations, growing numbers of Britons are going under the surgeon's knife overseas, in destinations like South Africa, India and eastern Europe.<br><br>Cheaper operations are enticing more than 10,000 Britons per year abroad, some travelling huge distances to factor in some fun in the sun -- and still saving on the price of British private sector surgery.<br><br>They range from hip replacements to heart operations to aesthetic surgery, such as breast enlargements and facelifts.<br><br>The British government says waiting times for operations on the free National Health Service (NHS) are coming down.<br><br>But many patients still face delays of several months to have their operations -- some even years.<br><br>Fears about hospital hygiene, including the risk of contracting antibiotic-resistant "superbugs" like MRSA, are also making patients consider treatment overseas.<br><br>"I was in excruciating pain and all I wanted to do was get rid of it," said Angela Goldsborough, who flew to Poland for a hip replacement and four weeks' physiotherapy.<br><br>Wary of the NHS, she found her treatment was available in Krakow for 6,000 pounds (11,180 dollars, 8,740 euros) -- less than a third of the private cost in Britain.<br><br>"I was out in Poland within two weeks," the 74-year-old from west London told AFP.<br><br>"The treatment was fantastic and you could have eaten your food off the hospital floor."<br><br>Barbara Thurgood and Company has been arranging private orthopaedic treatment in Poland for over a decade.<br><br>Thurgood said it was a logical move to create fixed-price packages offering patients speedy diagnoses and treatment at a cheaper cost than in Britain.<br><br>She told AFP many clients were wealthy professionals capitalising on the option to go abroad -- including doctors.<br><br>Some head further afield for the anonymity of cosmetic surgery and recuperation abroad.<br><br>Lorraine Melvill runs Surgeon and Safari in South Africa, which describes itself as a world leader in the medical tourism industry.<br><br>"At the time when I started the business I was very aware that this was a whole new concept," she told AFP.<br><br>"Consumers now have choice. There's globalisation in all sorts of markets, so why not in medicine?"<br><br>Reflective of a booming market, Surgeon and Safari has grown 100 percent each year since launching in 1999.<br><br>Patients can meet their surgeons in Britain beforehand, and even add on a safari trip afterwards, with the stress on private patient care rather than a cheap alternative.<br><br>Sonja Evans, 40, took the plunge and flew to South Africa four years ago, having a tummy tuck on her post-pregnancy saggy belly. She faced at least a four-year wait on the NHS or a 6,000-pound bill to go private in Britain.<br><br>Instead, she paid 3,700 pounds, including flights.<br><br>"I felt terrified before going out there, purely on the grounds of vanity, but it was the best thing I ever did," the personal assistant told AFP.<br><br>"It transformed me. I went from being really shy to brimming with self-confidence."<br><br>"I would have otherwise waited on the NHS and got more depressed about how I looked," she said.<br><br>Because of the lack of a language barrier, English-speaking countries like South Africa and India are popular.<br><br>Med de Tour flew 70 patients to India last year for surgery and holidays and 55 have gone so far this year.<br><br>Their marketing director, Sahar Ali, said their big advantage was that British patients trust Indian doctors because so many work in the NHS.<br><br>They quoted open-heart surgery from 5,000 dollars (3,900 euros) compared with 25,000 dollars in Britain.<br><br>Ali said some family doctors were encouraging people to head abroad while others were set against the idea.<br><br>"We feel the NHS should be encouraging us rather than putting up obstacles: we're easing the burden on them," she told AFP.<br><br>Some detractors warn of botched overseas operations, with British surgeons having to fix the problems.<br><br>But there are just as many "horror stories" in Britain as abroad, Ali said, adding that some of her clients were people whose surgery in Britain had gone wrong.<br><br>The British Association of Plastic Surgeons (BAPS) cautions against "cut-price" cosmetic surgery anywhere.<br><br>"If it's a good quality service it doesn't matter where you get it. But if costs are cut, then quite often, corners are too," spokeswoman Lisa Mangan said.<br><br>Former BAPS president Chris Khoo said the association was concerned about developments "which reduce surgery to a mere commodity" and warned against a "consumerist approach".<br><br>"Surgery can go wrong: cheapest is seldom best. Having an operation to alter the way you look is not the same as buying a cheap sofa, which you can return," he warned.<br><br>However, as more world-class options come within reach, the exodus of aching pensioners and people worried about their looks seems set to grow. - AFP/ir<br><br>Copyright Â© 2006 Agence France Presse.
