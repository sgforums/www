              <p> <br> The demise of one of the so-called founding fathers of Singapore and PAP
               stalwart Goh Keng Swee expectedly brought about a wave of PAP 
              propaganda in the state media to remind Singaporeans of the 
              contributions of Goh and his fellow PAP colleagues.<br>  <br> In an interview with Channel News Asia on 14 May 2010, Community 
              Development, Youth and Sports Minister Vivian Balakrishnan said every 
              child in school, every soldier serving in the armed forces, and every 
              worker with a job in Singapore owes the late Dr Goh Keng Swee a huge 
              debt of gratitude.<br>  <br> While nobody can deny the fact that Goh had contributed tremendously to 
              Singapore, questions must be raised if Singaporeans really owe him and 
              the PAP a “debt” of gratitude.<br>  <br> It is only human to err and no leader is perfect. In assessing the 
              political career of Goh, we should not ignore his shortcomings as well. 
              For all his worth, Goh had made some mistakes, most notably his 
              controversial streaming in primary school which was reversed years 
              later. By then, irreversible damage has been done against many 
              generations of Singapore students who are “late bloomers” and might have
               succeeded in life under a less stressful education system.<br>  <br> A former PAP minister Othman Wok described the late Dr Goh as the 
              architect of the Singapore economy. As a matter of fact, the accolades 
              should belong to Albert Winsemius, a Dutch economist seconded to the 
              fledging PAP government by the United Nations. It was Winseminus who 
              convinced Goh to develop Singapore’s export economy and to invite MNCs 
              to set up their regional headquarters here.<br>  <br> Goh just happened to be the right leader at the right place and time. He
               was fortunate that Singaporeans are a bunch of thrifty, hardworking and
               most importantly docile people who ensured that his ideas and policies 
              were successfully implemented on the ground. Had Goh been put in a more 
              volatile environment like Vietnam, Indonesia and even Malaysia, it is 
              doubtful if he is able to replicate his success there.<br>  <br> Though Goh is a pioneer of modern Singapore and is a key figure in its 
              growth and prosperity, past achievements do not guarantee future 
              success. The fact that Goh is a visionary leader doesn’t automatically 
              mean that the present batch of PAP leaders have inherited his legacy. In
               fact, the current leaders should learn from Goh who was able to serve 
              the nation tirelessly for so many years despite being paid “peanuts”.<br>  <br> History has taught us that no leader is indispensable to a nation, no 
              matter how great he/she is. What is more important is to have an open, 
              transparent and liberal political system which allows for a peaceful 
              transition from one generation of leaders to the next and from one party
               to another.<br>  <br> Both the United States and United Kingdom have their fair share of 
              competent and charismatic leaders. Even China has long stepped out of 
              the shadow of its “Great Helmsman” Mao Zedong. It is time Singapore get 
              rid of its burden of “gratitude” to the PAP and move forward as a 
              confident and proud nation belong to all the people.</p>

              <p>Singaporeans owe Mr Goh a debt of gratitude? YEAH RIGHT! because of our beloved Mr Goh, the males of singapore have to go through mandatory national service and that's simply conscription, to it bluntly. Seriously, 2 years is too long a time to be wasted on learning stuffs that are irrevelant to our lives after ORD.</p>
              <p>What is the use of learning how to overcome the SOC? what is the use of learning how to put on camo cream? what is the use of learning how to operate a signal comms set? NO PRACTICAL USE AT ALL</p>
              <p>some people may say it's for the defence of our nation. Most people who say this are just being politically correct and self-righteous. In fact most of them hate national service too. I seriously couldn't give a damn if some foreign nation (we know who) attacks us. I might just even gap singapore.</p>
