I did clear it up for u, for the question is not in whether what is consider enough. It is which come 1st and which the priority is.  When dad have money, does he 1st spend it on granny bill or children education, which the EU are doing (cheap, if not free, healthcare and free education). Then spend the rest of other important thing in life. Here, daddy self rewarding come 1st b4 granny life and shamelessly ask for more $$ from his children.<br><br>Dun need to add more factor into a simple analogy. There is always ever increasing need and uses for money. For future or others. But to me, daddy comfort come last compare to granny and children need.<br><br>How to justify expensive health care when u are asking for more money(gst) and yet increasing ur own salary at the same time? After gst increase, did heatlhcare become cheaper? Only see MP pay rasing. It is like telling u i dun have money to pay for granny bill, but i have have enough to buy a new car.<br><br>Well, u dun have to go far to see is singapore is rich or poor. Just look at the singapore monetary reserve will do<br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_exchange_reserves" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_exchange_reserves</a><br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_wealth_funds" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_wealth_funds</a><br>Among the top 10 in the world for a country this small of only 4million ppl.<br><br>Like my 1st post, buying citi bank is an investment. Which is good, in my view. Only different is, sg government is like any other business, only care about the boss, shareholder money and not the employee. Which shouldnt be the case! It should be run like a big family.<br><br>just my innocent and navie 2 cent view.</div>

They din abandon anyone grand ma (i never said that), but couldnt they have done more. Dun u agree? They have ur parent working 6~7 days a week just to provide with enough $$ to pay for ur granny bills and children education. Why? Coz hospital and school have to generate profit? Can't get into uni co quota is full, but to pay even more have to go oversea or study private?<br><br>Investment is a great thing. But cant it come after the house are clean, everyone feed and well care for? A poor s'pore dun make granny happy, but neither will a rich s'pore that dun care about granny. Let face it, if u been to EU, u will see the different treatment they dish out to their elderly. Over there, ppl treat elderly with respect and an asset. Here they are liability that our gov cant wait to shed off.<br><br>Oh talking abt history, who is the one responsible for transforming s'pore from a debt ridden country to the rich one now. Its the sick granny and her mate now lying in hospital bed worrying abt how to pay the next bill sent out to them.<br><br>Bottom line, thing could have been 10 time better off if only they care more on issue that concern the well being of the citizen beside just the money making aspect.</div>
