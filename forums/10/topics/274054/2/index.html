            <div class='col-md body'>There is another plan which I think is more suitable. I shall choose when and where to die. I shall be allowed to withdraw the CPF at 55 and spend it any which way I want until I am down to a couple of bucks. I shall then walk to any healthcare institution and opt to be sent to a better world.<br><br>ItÂ’s our money. No one shall tell us how to spend it. We have no obligation to live up to 100 years old. ItÂ’s the quality of life that matters, not longevity. Anyway, itÂ’s not that we can dictate how long we want to live. ItÂ’s destiny.<br>Everyone has to die someday but we must decide for ourselves when and how we choose to exit this cruel world.<br><br>Euthanasia is to be encouraged instead. It shall be government-sponsored since itÂ’s an inexpensive plan. This is a better plan Â– I will definitely opt in. I want to die with dignity. I want to have the best of both worlds, on my terms<br><br>With this plan, the government need not bear the burden of taking care of my needs when I retire at 55.<br><br>Haiz, money money money moneyÂ…</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Lin Yu:</div><div class="quote_body">Said Mr Lim: "If you have a full minimum sum in CPF, when you withdraw the CPF, CPF will pay you $700 over a month. But it's for 20 years. At the end of 20 years, you'll have nothing to withdraw.<br><br>"If you buy an <span style="color: blue;">annuity</span>, the insurance company will pay you less - $500 a month. But the insurance company will have to pay you for as long as you live. And if you live to 100 (years old), they'll have to continue paying you till you're 100. Therefore it's a lesser monthly sum but you're insured a little longer.<br><br>"We may have to make it compulsory for everyone, but I think for now, we should explain to people what annuities are and how people can benefit, to get people to understand it."<br></div></blockquote>The daft Minister don't know the difference between an annuity and a perpetuity.<br></div>
