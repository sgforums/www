We asked for transparency about our CPF monies, now we get it and we still complain.

But it's for 20 years. At the end of 20 years, you'll have nothing to withdraw.<br><br>"If you buy an annuity, the insurance company will pay you less - $500 a month. But the insurance company will have to pay you for as long as you live. And if you live to 100 (years old), they'll have to continue paying you till you're 100. Therefore it's a lesser monthly sum but you're insured a little longer.<br><br>"We may have to make it compulsory for everyone, but I think for now, we should explain to people what annuities are and how people can benefit, to get people to understand it."<br><br>The daft Minister don't know the difference between an annuity and a perpetuity.<br></div></blockquote>Siao, sweet talk again. Pay you, it is as good as a real exilir pill.<br><br>Later, all CPF money must be used to buy annuity. Some can afford higher annuity age, some lower.<br><br></div>

Think he has to accept facts.  People are responding to reality created by the gahmen, and this we can't stop people from expressing their unhappiness and negative comments about the govt.</div>
