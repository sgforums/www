            <div class='col-md body'>CNA latest news<br><br><blockquote><strong>Government may make buying annuity compulsory: Lim Boon Heng</strong><br>By Julia Ng, Channel NewsAsia | Posted: 14 August 2007 1745 hrs<br><br>SINGAPORE : The government may make buying annuity compulsory, said Mr Lim Boon Heng, Minister-in-Charge of ageing issues.<br><br>Speaking to reporters after a National Day Observance ceremony at the Mitsuboshi Overseas Headquarters on Tuesday, Mr Lim said the government is looking to build the annuity component into Singapore's plan for the ageing population.<br><br>With longer life expectancy, Singaporeans will have to work longer, beyond the present retirement age of 62.<br><br>The government is considering a law on re-employment, to get employers to guarantee their employees a job once they reach 62.<br><br>But it may not necessarily be the same job or the same salary.<br><br>Mr Lim urged employers and employees to start preparing for the re-employment law as soon as possible.<br><br>This is because the law would provide only a framework and not spell out how re-employment should be done.<br><br>Besides working longer, another way to prepare for old age is to have a form of insurance that caters to a longer lifespan.<br><br>And one way to do this is by buying an annuity.<br><br>Said Mr Lim: "If you have a full minimum sum in CPF, when you withdraw the CPF, CPF will pay you $700 over a month. But it's for 20 years. At the end of 20 years, you'll have nothing to withdraw.<br><br>"If you buy an annuity, the insurance company will pay you less - $500 a month. But the insurance company will have to pay you for as long as you live. And if you live to 100 (years old), they'll have to continue paying you till you're 100. Therefore it's a lesser monthly sum but you're insured a little longer.<br><br>"We may have to make it compulsory for everyone, but I think for now, we should explain to people what annuities are and how people can benefit, to get people to understand it." - CNA /ls<br><br></blockquote></div>

If you notice, almost every week or every month, without fail they come out with something to do with money and it is the ordinary Singaporeans paying the money.<br><br>Money rules in their world.  They have not failed to create impression to the people that they love and worship money.  Politics is not on money alone!!!

They demand and expect we are just to say yes to everything they want to do to earn our money.  The recent launch of eldershield was really yucks.  Many of those who are 40 and above make lots of noise that they are so highhanded.  Just deduct the money from CPF and take it you have permitted them to do so , unless they contact the insurance company to terminate the plan.<br><br>Really, PAP is the first hand gahmen in the whole world to earn money from the people through insurance.   Damn it, PAP!<br><br>Buying annuity also means LHL do not want burden from the old age people, so now attempting this.  Cold blooded, money faced PM does not deserve our respect.</div>

What about people who hardly can make ends meet, where do they find the extra $$$ to buy the annuity?  Damn it, lee hsien loong!  Just wait, do more evil, see what you get from heaven!  damn it, he is the coldblooded arrogant toad who is a substandard PM.  By making it compulsory for people to buy annuity, this solves his worry that the old people will bring burden to him.  Such a cold blooded and good for nothing PM, we don't need.  Get him out!!!!  Or go with good brothers when they go back at the end of the 7th month!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>

Just wonder Is PAP in as our govt just to use $$$ to solve problems.  If so, this is so simple job, we don't need any highly educated people to do the job, so we don't need them!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Hey, 66.6% voters, please put your brain to good use and vote wisely in the next election.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"></div>
