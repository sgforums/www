I am afraid I run out of cash".  Now if they know that they are guaranteed monthly payments till their last days, they will have more confidence to retire better.  It is about feeling secured, Lin Yu.<br><br>If the government does not guarantee the annuities payments, then effectively, they place our retirements in the hands of private insurance companies which can go bust.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi first post here. seeing all the heated discussion spurs me on.<br><br>I am sure Daddy has valid points, i like that. I also agree that It should never be made compulsory especially for people who has the financial knowledge to obtain higher returns. I believe the govt being as clever as they are should have already considered the fact that we shall not live long.... and about the thought of our money going up in smoke. They should have a plan B to inherit this to our children (subjected to inheritance tax!) How can they give up a good chance to earn?<br><br>How stupid can a govt get when what ever you do, you are tax. You drive you kena, you dun drive you kena, you earn you kena you dun earn you still kena (GST) im sure we still need to eat ..<br><br>I believe annuity is a good way of preserving cash as many sane people confidently thought that they can manage their so call wealth better with the money in their hands run out of control often and end up poor.<br><br>The govt in singapore is already doing very good. Yes i agree that it is very suffocating living in singapore and several of their policies were extremely disappointing, but objectively i think they still care for us as citizens for their own good. Its a situation where we use each other to better ourselves. Who is there to tax if all of us canot tahan and run away? They are already trying very hard to please ppl , though many times in the wrong ways.<br><br>Then again any higher returns financial tools often comes with higher risk. If you are looking for high returns. Then you shouldnt be looking for annuity which basically is low risk low returns. where got ai pi you ai qi one.<br><br>If the govt is able to solve the current concerns abt what happens to the money if we die early/after we die and leaving it to be an option for us to choose then i believe they could possibly win my vote.<br><br>Just a note: to maximise your returns , let the money sit in cpf till abt 62 before buying an annuity / perpetuity .<br></div>
