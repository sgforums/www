If the pricing of the annuities are proven fair, then i think it is acceptable.<br><br>Under scenario 1, it is interesting to see the reaction of the public.

Other insurers and banks do not because they only have the purely guaranteed payment portion. Can't blame them for trying to make the annuity look attractive but they do deserve flak for not living up to initial picture presented.<br><br>Your latter comment was referring to AIA. Well, allow me to say that it is only a half-truth. The ST finance repoter, Lorna Tan, was eager to score a quick one and she reported without ascertaining all facts. She later won an ST award for "objective reporting". Only those within the industry who really study the facts, know.<br><br>As you mentioned, the key word is 'forecast'. This non-guaranteed clause was already written in the policy contract. Insurance selling 10-15 years ago was not as complicated as today. Financial analysis was not exactly necessary and many unscrupulous agents who wanted an easy sale deliberately omitted mention of this clause. Of course, there are also those who have highlighted it to the customer's attention. And moreover, there are also forgetful customers.</div>
