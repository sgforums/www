You don't get your money back until much later, but the interest gained for our money is still rather acceptable. Even though there may be losses, your money in this 'fixed deposit' remains untouched. From the consumers' point of view, it is satisfactory enough. Of course, financial gurus out there may have better uses for the money.<br><br>To the government, CPF represents money that can be used to invest, an increase in the liquidity of government funds, and thus a larger influence in the economy.<br><br>Annuity is also both good and bad. Good points have already been listed by the government. Bad point is you get to spend less of your money overall. Excess money do go to your beneficiaries when you die....<br><br>The point here is: when you die. How are we going to use our hard-earned money when we die????????? First, raising CPF withdrawal age, now annuity... I wonder what other plans the government can come up with... Just because a certain person can live till 90+ and still has the ability to continue to work doesn't mean everyone here can! As pointed out by a fellow forumite here, our average age for males is around 82 =&gt; 20 years after retirement age.<br><br>A few black sheeps here and there cannot manage their own money, which is why they have nothing to spend in their old age. Why involve every Singaporean in an unpopular scheme for the sake of that few black sheeps? The government says it is our own responsibility in many matters, yet when it comes to matters of money, they have to claim 'responsibility'.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>P.S.
