If you can't find a job, you don't have money, but you can't use your CPF money. What's the point of having future money, when you are having present survival issues, which threatens you from collecting your future CPF money.<br><br>It's better to let the individual decide on what their investments should be themselves. Better to let the individual choose if they want to be in the CPF scheme (for individuals like Gazelle and lionnoisy) or they want to invest the money themselves.<br></div></blockquote>CPF is a touchy subject. Don't forget we're discussing annuity, where most elderly live in an era where dependence on the govt was like a mother b.reastfeeding her infant. Many others are understandably ignorant, believing the misguided claims that CPF will cover them in their twilight years.<br><br>Our generation could probably be relied to get better value than the paltry 2.5% with our monies, but the same cannot be said of our super seniors, who may have become totally dependent on the govt for guidance.<br><br>On situations where the majority cannot be relied upon to make decisions, the govt may step in. This approach is acceptable, since it will cost even more taxpayer's monies to manage this catagory of people later on, should they find themselves in financial turmoil without any means of recovery.<br><br>In other situations, such as means testing to alleviate the problem of over-crowded hospitals, it's a fair to say that our mentality and that of the majority may 'abuse' their 'rights' and deprive more deserving patients of a bed. That the govt decided to step in is probably welcomed.<br><br>This case is decidedly different. We are talking about the insurance industry, which has played an important role in shaping family development and investments for the last 20 years. We cannot feign ignorance now, nor can the majority claim they have little or no knowledge with the intricacies and legalities of insurance-care products. The idea that the govt may choose to intervene is simply premature at this stage.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>When it comes to money and CPF, compulsory savings and deferred withdrawals, everybody gets hot under the collar! All kinds of noices can be heard.<br>The CPF scheme is unique and SG is the country that started it. Now, a few countries have followed. Many would like to introduce but unable due to obstacles and resistance from both employees and employers. As an employer, I wouldn't want to pay CPF. It is added business cost!<br><br>There is no denial that CPF has served SGreans well. If CPF is abolished, I can assure you there were be more hardships and chaos in the market. Nobody likes to have his money tied up. <strong>The worse and wrong impression generated here is that the gahmen is hard up of your money!</strong><br><br>Looking at the CPF balances of those who are about to retire, you will see that it is insufficient to last another 20 - 30 years without continued steady income. In other words, if they don't continue to work after 55 yrs and simply withdraw their monies to live by, the balance will dry up in no time. Especially with the IRs around.<br><br><span style="color: red;">Imagine this scenario: old people forced to work on meagre incomes, scavaging food at hawker centres, begging on the streets and returning to their cardboard shelters.</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>annuity is a financial product which is highly dependent on interest rates level, ie it is very expensive if the interest rate is very low and vice versa.<br>as an illustration<br>$500 per month is big sum in a near zero interest rate environment and vice versa.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>firstly, i find it interesting that when i read about cpf, the anti-pap forumers criticized cpf, mainly government delays payment till we are too old to use it.  now, we can start withdrawing money in the form of annuities at a fixed age of 55 and this is an improvement over the previous situation, you guys also complain.  We asked for transparency about our CPF monies, now we get it and we still complain.  I wonder what is going on.<br><br>in my humble opinion, annuities is one of the best forms of financial planning for retirement.  When we are talking about using cpf money for retirement and when we start talking of using cpf money to invest in annuities, it wont be bad.<br><br>OK.  there are outstanding issues to be ironed out or made clear.<br>1) when and how much do we pay for the annuities ?  Of course, the younger we start, the better it is.  The more we contribute, the higher the annuities when we retire at 55 (that also means that many of us dont need to work if our annuities is substantial enough at 55 years old).<br>2) If the annuities are priced at commercial market rate PLUS the government GUARANTEES payments, it is a steal for all of us because we are buying a commercial product with a sovereign backing.<br>3) what happens if interest rates fall to zero percent ?<br><br>In my opinion, I think our Prime Minister LEE Hsien Loong and his ministers got it right.
