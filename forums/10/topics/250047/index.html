One thing I wanna say is why don't they look at their declining winning percentage in election when they talk about salary increment/adjustment.

He might have contributed to Singapore's success in the past, but hey, Singapore is in the beginning of a perpetual decline. In fact, he just made a self-fulfilling prophecy that will start to show in the coming decade. Singapore will slip into the mediocre and will be surpassed by many regional countries. Singapore is lucky in its geographic position, right at the sea trading route, but how much longer will it last before things will change and Singaporean find itself a prisoner of its past success and a restrictive and uncompetitive society led by a bunch of narrow-minded, self-serving garhmen.<br><br>The "Founder" of Singapore is also going to be the "Destroyer".</div>
