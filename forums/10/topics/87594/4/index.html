            <div class='col-md body'>I will not claim to know what the government has planned for Singapore, but from what is going on now, we can see that in order to offset the lack of manpower, land, natural resources etc, sg has transferred her energies to other areas that do not require these things.<br><br>Our banking industry, though not as strong as others, is already quite substantial. R&amp;D is also being supported and encourage by our leaders. Also, many MNCs are basing their headquaters in sg as a stepping stone into SEA. Granted, there has been an exodus of MNC headquaters to our neighbours, but that does not mean that they have pulled out of sg completely.<br><br>I believe our leaders have a very good agenda for Sg. Though I'm not a PAP lover, I have to admit they are good at what they do.<br><br>Sg always had a policy of non aggression and sensible, pragmatic win-win solutions as our foreign policy. Go thru all information about Sg and indonesia and malaysia, our leaders have never threatened war or made any move to forceibly take anything, be it land, industries or people, nor have we: blockaded, pointed missiles, moved troops to invade/threaten any other country.<br><br>We are quoted to have the most modern army in SEA and we can and will shift troops into any aggressing country when they attack. This is no secret. Also, there is an american navel base in Sg, bomb Sg means bombing the USA navel base. You DO know what happens to any country that bombs a US navel base right?</div>
