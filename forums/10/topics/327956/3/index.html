              <p>jojobeach, tell me you don't know what are the responsibilities of a government and I'll tell you ok?</p>
              <p>The basics of a government is to grow and improve the country's economics/social growth internally and externally. To do so, they must provide a safe, stable, peaceful environment for it's citizens to multiply. Simple enough?</p>
              <p>So...tell me if Singapore does not fulfill the above standards, and our Singapore dollars isn't the strongest amongst our region. At least we don't need to sell our women to other countries as maids and mail-order-brides.</p>
              <p>People questions things that they don't understand and that is perfectly understandable. But have they wondered why most of those questions came from our generation? It's because people in our generation have not had the opportunity to grow up or lived in a country in turmoil, they have never been through a war (and those retards thinks war is in fact a cool thing), they do not know hardship and they have been spoon-fed throughout their lives.</p>
              <p>People in our generation simply has lost the initiative to seek out answers on their own, they EXPECTS government to feed them with obvious answers to their retarded questions. They should take a look around them and around the world (EARTH...not Singapore ok?), then maybe one day they might grow wiser?</p>
              <p>If the current government are weaklings, it will show on the country's performance and our dollars will be the weakest in our region. Then these people will eventually get to fulfill their ultimate aim to have a change of government.</p>
              <p>But if our current government are doing their jobs well, then would you bothered to join the retarded group cos you think it's the norm and it just seems right for you to do so?</p>

              <p><br>Our political system is simple, there lies the founder LKY, his son LHL as PM, follow by other ministers and MPs to perms sec and civil servant. Whatever they implemented, we will grumbles, post here and there, f**k there and here,...then we grumble again and again and...no more grumbling liao...follow what was implemented...then quiet now. Then they decided to implement another new set of policies, and we start to grumbles and F**k here and there again..then we quiet now..then all follow..and forget ...and then they implement another new set of policies...again the cycle goes on and on...so simple for them to govern, no demostration, no riot, no rebellions, all posting and grumbling only.</p>
