              <p>Divorce itself is an error or mis-judgement caused by
                              humans themselves on their decision of marriage, you can only
                              discriminate against situations that is out of human control.</p>
              <p>If people are willing to marry each other, why go against their
                              wedding vows and be willing to divorce?</p>
              <p>Nowadays people are not born strong enough to survive in the
                              strong world that their previous generations have
                              built and lived in. They have lost the initiative to problem solve
                              the survival needs of their race...especially in Singapore,
                              everyone out there expects somebody to feed them with a spoon of

              <p>I've already witnessed plenty of such Singaporeans in

                              Singaporeans in Singapore, but I'm sure the rest isn't

              <p>Yes I agree.. there is no such world that is perfectly fair.</p>
              <p>We can only try our best to fix the unjust and unfairness</p>
              <p>We don't need to make it even worst .</p>
              <p>A marriage vow .. is a promise.. to be made good by two person joint together by a common goal, and they need to constantly work towards that same goal.</p>
              <p>You are a woman yourself.. and we both know that .. we adapt..and people do change.</p>
              <p>When a couple no longer see eye to eye with each other's life expectations.. are we to force them to live together because of the vows? Then it is no longer a union of the heart... rather a ball and chain.. and our HDB flat.. a dungeon with iron grills no doubt.</p>
              <p>When a marriage falls apart..you cannot use super glue to force them together and make it whole again.</p>
              <p>Like my brother always says.. marriage is hard work.. but it's worth it.</p>
              <p>Nobody in their right mind.. goes into a marriage while checking out the divorce procedures.</p>
              <p>What is most important is how that divorce person handles his/her obligations during and after the break up.</p>
              <p>You may think it is ok to condemn the divorce..</p>
              <p>Let's say one day.. your hubby ran away with another woman.. can the society condemn you too ?</p>

              <p>jojobeach, tell me you don't know what are the responsibilities of a government and I'll tell you ok?</p>
              <p>The basics of a government is to grow and improve the country's economics/social growth internally and externally. To do so, they must provide a safe, stable, peaceful environment for it's citizens to multiply. Simple enough?</p>
              <p>So...tell me if Singapore does not fulfill the above standards, and our Singapore dollars isn't the strongest amongst our region. At least we don't need to sell our women to other countries as maids and mail-order-brides.</p>
              <p>People questions things that they don't understand and that is perfectly understandable. But have they wondered why most of those questions came from our generation? It's because people in our generation have not had the opportunity to grow up or lived in a country in turmoil, they have never been through a war (and those retards thinks war is in fact a cool thing), they do not know hardship and they have been spoon-fed throughout their lives.</p>
              <p>People in our generation simply has lost the initiative to seek out answers on their own, they EXPECTS government to feed them with obvious answers to their retarded questions. They should take a look around them and around the world (EARTH...not Singapore ok?), then maybe one day they might grow wiser?</p>
              <p>If the current government are weaklings, it will show on the country's performance and our dollars will be the weakest in our region. Then these people will eventually get to fulfill their ultimate aim to have a change of government.</p>
              <p>But if our current government are doing their jobs well, then would you bothered to join the retarded group cos you think it's the norm and it just seems right for you to do so?</p>

              <p>You can never have a government or country made up

              <p>People are responsible for their own happiness, and if people
              are not happy, then they must have their own initiatives to solve
              their own problems first before blaming others for causing their
              unhappiness.</p>
              <p>How many of them actually have the guts to admit their
              unhappiness came from within their own fucked-up lives?</p>

              <p>Yes I agree.. there is no such world that is perfectly fair.</p>
              <p>We can only try our best to fix the unjust and unfairness</p>
              <p>We don't need to make it even worst .</p>
              <p>A marriage vow .. is a promise.. to be made good by two person joint together by a common goal, and they need to constantly work towards that same goal.</p>
              <p>You are a woman yourself.. and we both know that .. we adapt..and people do change.</p>
              <p>When a couple no longer see eye to eye with each other's life expectations.. are we to force them to live together because of the vows? Then it is no longer a union of the heart... rather a ball and chain.. and our HDB flat.. a dungeon with iron grills no doubt.</p>
              <p>When a marriage falls apart..you cannot use super glue to force them together and make it whole again.</p>
              <p>Like my brother always says.. marriage is hard work.. but it's worth it.</p>
              <p>Nobody in their right mind.. goes into a marriage while checking out the divorce procedures.</p>
              <p>What is most important is how that divorce person handles his/her obligations during and after the break up.</p>
              <p>You may think it is ok to condemn the divorce..</p>
              <p>Let's say one day.. your hubby ran away with another woman.. can the society condemn you too ?</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Of course the society are always welcome to condemn me and anyone else in the society itself. But ultimately it is up to you if you allowed them to make you feel condemned in the first place.</p>
              <p>You can't feel condemned if you have more faith in yourselves than your society, even if the society chooses to condemn you. You can't feel inferior unless you have granted others the rights to make you feel inferior. You will ultimately decide if you want to be hurt by others or not...it is all up to you as a woman.</p>
              <p>If my hubby decides to run away with another woman who can give him better happiness than me, then I will let him go to be with his better happiness. I will do so simply if only I still loves him. If I don't love him anymore, then he might have an accident before that happens.</p>

              <p>Government are people who are RUNNING THE COUNTRY FOR IT'S PEOPLE. Remember it is COUNTRY for it's people. It is not dictatorship who convienantly runs the people as well as the country, democracy runs the country for it's people.</p>
              <p>Are the people unhappy with their country at the moment? Or are the people unhappy with the government at the moment?</p>
              <p>33% are the percentage of voters who voted against the current ruling political party. It does not represents the percentage of voters who are unhappy with their own country.</p>
              <p>By the way, Abraham Lincoln is not GOD. He is just a dead man.</p>
