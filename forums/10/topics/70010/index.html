            <div class='col-md body'>While technically, possession of pornographic materials is indeed illegal, MOE has also indicated that the school COULD HAVE done things a little better. In my opinion, I think the principal is too trigger-happy and over zealous as such, that she even "overlooked" the basic needs of the students in question.<br><br>Also, I feel that reporting to the Police should be a last resort, not an immediate option. By reporting the 14 year old student to the Police, only gives the young boy a bad start in life, and to think that the school encourages COMPASSION, sickens me utterly.<br><br>Overall, I feel the principal is rather high-handed in this respect - having no consideration for the future of said student.<br><br>All these publicity will only see the number of students enrolling in this school drop drastically next year. Because no one, wants their child to be so readily incriminated just because of a childish mistake.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, in a sense, MOE as a national education authority *barf* have to stand by the law. Even if they feel otherwise ( i dont know about this ), they still have to come out and say "Hey this is illegal you know"<br><br>Thats why this problem should be solved at school level instead of bringing in the police.</div>

Who has never in his/her lifetime made a slightest mistakes?<br><br>On other related issues:-<br>Maybe the name of those students should be published in newspaper. Education is not school responsiblity alone....this issue is not about edcation but upbring in the home which is beyond school......................so don't go blaming others for your own childrens mistakes...which sadly many sporean refuse to admit.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i beg to differ... if the students broke into the sch and cause alot of damage whist doing so... and if the students are caught sniffing glue and drugs... calling the police in wld still be the last resort...<br><br>giving them chances wld still be more appropriate... refer them to someone who can help them better... look into the reasons y they did it... show them tat it is wrong... and wat they have done hurt those ppl who cared for them...<br><br>by calling in the police... most prob u r juz confirming their mindset that nobody gif a damn bout them... i don think tat reporting a student is always the right way to go... u r staining the child's life...<br><br>regarding bout the sch nt giving the children recess... initially the sch claimed tat the students did nt ask for recess... and the sch did nt received any notification letter regarding the boy's illness...<br><br>but quoting the MOE in the newspaper todae "The staff (of the sch) responded inappropriately to the students' requests for a breakl to obtain food and drinks..."<br><br>and by the boy's mother "faxed to the sch a letter dated Jul 1, 2003 detailing her son's medical condition and history..."<br><br>so y did the sch initially claim tat the students did nt ask for recess and no letter from the parents.<br><br>i am nt saying i am perfect. but juz saying tat the sch did alot of no-nos in this situation. they demonstrated their pathetic level of communication between the sch and the parents. the principal herself tried to cover up her mistakes... but eventually have to apologise to the parents.<br><br>thus i wld like to raise one point... is it onli in primary sch tat the teachers care more bout the welfare of the students?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm gonna ask if anyone has broken the law before...<br><br>C'mon as teenagers, did anyone walk around trying to act tough and joined a gang or something? Has anyone shoplifted but not been caught? But all of us gets over it and we grow up responsible and law abiding adults -&gt; we hope.<br><br>If you're under 18, it is still harsh to be hauled to be cops and not been given a suspension OR an expelsion. I think that is a better action to take than reporting to the police.<br>Porn may be illegal in Singapore, but if the police are going to be very busy if they want to bust all the people porn hidden in their computer.<br><br>One last thing, how can MOE be seen not supporting one of their staff in the general public? But I'm sure there will be private conversations with this principal behind closed doors. Especially in Singapore where the government "can do no wrong" and she is a civil servant.</div>
