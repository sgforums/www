            <div class='col-md body'>The recent case, wherein a student shouted vulgarities at a teacher, is a very telling sign that we are nurturing a pontential nation of 'Little Emperrors'.<br><br>So much so called "rights", have been accorded to students that they are now brazen and even violent towards teachers.<br><br>I feel that policies that are in need of changes were not changed, while policies that shouldn't be changed were changed. In the end, I fear we may have a mis-shapened society of future generations; highly intelligent and well educated, BUT, low on EQ and in possession of a calculative nature and a sharp offensive tongue.<br><br>===============================================<br>Educators and parents mixed over teacher's reaction<br>July 27, 2006<br><br>WAS the teacher's demand for a published apology too much?<br><br>Some educators and parents feel the teacher might have overreacted.<br><br>Others feel that given the boy's history of being a repeat offender, he needed to be taught a lesson.<br><br>Said one junior college teacher, who declined to be named: 'If the family concerned is poor, then demanding a published apology in the newspapers would be punishing the family rather than the boy.'<br><br>She added that since the boy was a repeat offender, the school should have informed his parents during previous incidents that a further offence could result in a heavier punishment.<br><br>However, she felt that the teacher's punishment could have been too harsh.<br><br>'What does the teacher hope to achieve? If she had made it a police case, the student could have ended up with a police record just for using vulgarities,' she said.<br><br>However, a parent The New Paper spoke to felt the teacher's demand was justified.<br><br>Said Mr Samuel Owen, 51, who has a teenage son: 'It seems harsh on the surface, but the student appears to be a repeat offender who has been warned, but who still persisted with the same behaviour.<br><br>'He needs to realise that life has certain constraints and we all have to live by certain rules.'<br><br>A secondary school teacher who has dealt with similar cases said he would have handled the situation differently.<br><br>He said: 'I would try to find a way to help the student - it could involve suspension or other rehabilitative measures.<br><br>'But the most important thing is to get the parents involved, because these problem students might be facing circumstances outside school that the school has no control over.'<br><br></div>
