              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>My contention is that ministers are paid fairly.</p>
              <p>Many ministers are actually earning much more in the private
              sector before they became ministers, which for many of them, meant
              a drastic pay cut. I would like to cite Dr Vivian
              Balakrishnan as an example. He was a top eye surgeon before he
              entered politics, and for a period of time, was also the director
              of SGH. When he went into politics, however, he had to draw a much
              lower salary instead.</p>
              <p>In addition, I would like to contend that ministers are the
              life-blood of our nation. They make crucial decisions that may very
              well decide the fate of our nation. As a result, it is imperative
              that we recruit not just the smartest, but also, people who have
              proven themselves of being extremely capable in leading an
              organization. Thus, I am astounded by the fact that there are
              actually criticisms regarding ministerial salaries and so
              forth.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>With regards to the numerous digressions about the
              ineffectiveness of PAP as the government. Many have brought up the
              point about high inflation rates of Singapore. I would like to
              point out that Singapore has a rapidly increasing aggregate demand,
              which is a good thing, in fact, as it drives economic growth.
              However, we do have very limited and rapidly diminishing resources
              in the field of labour, brought about by declining birth rates, and
              this is the very reason why we have a high inflation rate.</p>
              <p>I would like to reiterate that the government does not cause
              inflation.</p>
              <p>They have, however, tried to stem it by importing foreigners
              into Singapore. This is an excellent way to reduce inflation and
              still achieve economic growth. However, there are numerous social
              problems with such an influx that the government has yet to solve.
              Hence, this further heightens the need to recruit better and more
              capable leaders into the ranks of the government, necessitating the
              high ministerial salaries.</p>

              <p>@winsomeea Hi there, I would like to clarify that I am but a 16 year old boy, who has no political motives whatsoever.</p>

              <p>@Dalforce 1941 Hi there, importing aliens (I am assuming you refer to foreign workers) would increase the supply of labour and therefore lower the competition for labour, thus allowing us to produce more. This increased production is the very essence of economic growth. (Sorry if I didn't answer your question fully. This is the most I know about economics)</p>

              <p>@Summer Hill: Well, my opinion is that baby bonus was never a good policy at all. By offsetting the long term costs of raising a child with immediate remunerations may not be very effective in resolving the conflict between the ability to afford providing for a child and the desire to have one. Rather, it seems to me that the policy did work only in the short term, to encourage parents to give birth so as to pay off their bills or to be able to afford luxury goods. Thus, it did work in the short term by enticing parents to give birth to more children.</p>
              <p>However, that would have left the parents with the huge financial burden of caring for their young in the future, and by then, the money from the baby bonus scheme would have run out; resulting in them being in a worse position to produce more children.

              <p>Because the reasoning is not based on size, or GDP, or comparison with other foreign leaders.</p>
              <p>The comparison is simply relative parity with the private sector counterpart.</p>
              <p>Again, similarly, if we look at the starter positions, such as new policemen, new teachers, there is relative parity with their private sector counterparts.</p>
              <p>I believe it is important.</p>
              <p>Because if there is a significant gap between private and public sector, there is going to be dichotomy and compartmentalization.</p>
              <p>The talented people will go to private sector and the leftover losers will go to the public sector.</p>
              <p>The public sector workers would be more incompetent, more lazier, more susceptible to bribing, etc, all sorts of problems, which would eventually create problems and difficulties for all of the society.</p>
              <p>This is not theory. This is practice and you can see it with your own eyes.</p>
              <p>Just look at Malaysia, Indonesia.</p>
              <p>In Malaysia if you get caught with traffic violation, you can bribe a policeman with "coffee money"</p>
              <p>In Singapore it is much harder to approach a policeman with "coffee money", why ?</p>
              <p>It is not some coincidence or some strange configuration of stars which created this situation. So what are the factors which created this situation ? How come Singapore in the middle of Malaysia and Indonesia can have much lesser corruption..?</p>
              <p>The answer is, because of the relatively good renumeration.</p>
              <p>In whatever organization and whatever job position, having a good renumeration is important.</p>
              <p>I believe it is doubly important in public sector because the people in that sector hold power and authority and their decisions have outsized significance and impact on the rest of the society.</p>
              <p>One minister who is bribed to give out a road construction project to a company who bribe him, is detrimental and is much more harmful, than the "coffee money" being given to a traffic policeman, so yes, as you go up the ladder, the renumeration need to keep up also.</p>
              <p>I believe it is important to have relative parity with private sector.</p>

              Hi @summer hill. So sorry for not replying, I was studying. 
              
              However I am not sure that I get your question. I am proposing that the policy the government set has but a short term effect and is therefore useless. So I do not understand your second question.
              
              Could you rephrase or elaborate a little more please. Much appreciated :)

              <p>Summer Hill: I think i get your question. You are asking about the scenario whereby the government had more foresight and implemented the policy in the 1990s, then will the economic problems we face today still exist?</p>
              <p>Well, my reply (if that is what your question meant) is that there will be no positive effects on the economy even if they did implement it in the 1990s. The policy, in my opinion was a failure (the reasons are mentioned in my previous post).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And replying to your second question, yea i've heard the song on a few occasions, but I was nevertheless unable to pick up on any of the hidden meanings. My interpretation of the song is that it merely demonstrates the artiste's love for the fifth day of the week.</p>
              <p>Hope that answered your questions :D</p>
