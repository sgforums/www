              <p>Agree.    HK's salary is higher than Sg since donkey years ago.    </p>
              <p>Don't forget , Hong Kong is not ranked No 4 as most expensive city in the world, Sg is.  </p>
              <p>The MIW suppress singaporeans to have more pay.   They actually have a training session in CDC to brainwash people that the trend now is to have low pay and work for jobs with increasing responsibilities.     I am not sure if they still conduct this brainwashing session.    Strange, like as if their families, cronies and themselves deserve high pay others are second or third class citizens don't.</p>

              <p>My contention is that ministers are paid fairly.</p>
              <p>Many ministers are actually earning much more in the private sector before they became ministers, which for many of them, meant a drastic pay cut. I would like to cite Dr Vivian Balakrishnan as an example. He was a top eye surgeon before he entered politics, and for a period of time, was also the director of SGH. When he went into politics, however, he had to draw a much lower salary instead.</p>
              <p>In addition, I would like to contend that ministers are the life-blood of our nation. They make crucial decisions that may very well decide the fate of our nation. As a result, it is imperative that we recruit not just the smartest, but also, people who have proven themselves of being extremely capable in leading an organization. Thus, I am astounded by the fact that there are actually criticisms regarding ministerial salaries and so forth.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>With regards to the numerous digressions about the ineffectiveness of PAP as the government. Many have brought up the point about high inflation rates of Singapore. I would like to point out that Singapore has a rapidly increasing aggregate demand, which is a good thing, in fact, as it drives economic growth. However, we do have very limited and rapidly diminishing resources in the field of labour, brought about by declining birth rates, and this is the very reason why we have a high inflation rate.</p>
              <p>I would like to reiterate that the government does not cause inflation.</p>
              <p>They have, however, tried to stem it by importing foreigners into Singapore. This is an excellent way to reduce inflation and still achieve economic growth. However, there are numerous social problems with such an influx that the government has yet to solve. Hence, this further heightens the need to recruit better and more capable leaders into the ranks of the government, necessitating the high ministerial salaries.</p>
