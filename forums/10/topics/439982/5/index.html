              <p>There are people who had been lawyers making millions but give
              up to do some non profit work just to help people. There are high
              paying accountants who give up job to be hawker. Salary isn't
              everything, sometimes, there are people who really wish to help
              people and money isn't the driving factor. </p>
              <p>I think a fair salary is better to attract real people who are
              keen to work in the public service line than a super high salary
              that attract greed and questionable people. </p>

              <p>All our Ministers should be classified as the Ultimate Royals of Royalty, their salaries even surpassed that of Spain's Royal Family. They are all 10 times more Royal than the Royal family of Spain. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <div class="bd">
              <p><strong>Spain's scandal-hit royals revealed their detailed income for the first time Wednesday, showing King Juan Carlos received a salary plus expenses of 292,752 euros ($382,600) in 2011.</strong></p>
              <p>The 73-year-old king's state grant of 140,519 euros was supplemented by 152,233 euros to cover expenses for official duties, said the accounts, published on the royals' website http://www.casareal.com.</p>
              <p>Prince Felipe, 43, who is married to former television news presenter Princess Letizia, had half of that figure, which would be 70,260 euros in a state grant and 76,117 euros in expenses.</p>
              <p>All top salaries including those of the royal family were cut by 15 percent in 2010 and frozen in 2011, a palace official said.</p>
              <p>By comparison, Spain's former prime minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero who left office last week had an annual salary of 78,185 euros, far less than the king's.</p>
              <p>The publication of the accounts comes as Spain's royal family battles a corruption scandal centred on the king's son-in-law, 43-year-old former Olympic handball player Inaki Urdangarin.</p>
              <p>Judges are investigating alleged corruption involving a charitable organisation formerly run by Urdangarin, husband of the king's youngest daughter Cristina.</p>
              <p>He receives no money from the state.</p>
              <p>The royal household announced it would publish the income details of the king and his family on December 12, the same day that it said Urdangarin would no longer take part in its official activities.</p>
              <p>"The king has no obligation under the constitution to publish his accounts. But it is a gesture of transparence brought about without a doubt due to pressure from the media, blogs and politicians which are suspicious of his son-in-law," said Pilar Urbano who has written several books about the royals.</p>
              <p>"While the criticism and the suspicions are not against the king or the royal household's budget but are about business deals made by his son-in-law, he feels morally obligated to make a gesture of transparency," she told AFP.</p>
              <p>Spain's economic downturn and unemployment rate of 21.52 percent had also fueled pressure for for more openness about the royals' finances.</p>
              <p>According to the accounts, Queen Sofia, Princess Letizia and the two princesses Cristina and Elena have no fixed sum but receive expenses for official duties, up to a global maximum of 375,000 euros in 2011.</p>
              <p>The overall budget was already public.</p>
              <p>The royal budget was frozen in 2010 and then cut by 470,000 euros, or 5.2 percent, to 8.43 million euros in 2011. The royals themselves had reportedly proposed the cut.</p>
              <p>Spain's royal family pay taxes on their income.</p>
              <p>Juan Carlos was proclaimed king in 1975, two days after the death of dictator General Francisco Franco who had designated him as successor in 1969. He is widely respected for helping to usher in democracy after Franco's death.</p>

              <p>All our Ministers should be classified as the Ultimate Royals of Royalty, their salaries even surpassed that of Spain's Royal Family. They are all 10 times more Royal than the Royal family of Spain. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <div>
              <p><strong>Spain's scandal-hit royals revealed their detailed income for the first time Wednesday, showing King Juan Carlos received a salary plus expenses of 292,752 euros ($382,600) in 2011.</strong></p>
              <p>The 73-year-old king's state grant of 140,519 euros was supplemented by 152,233 euros to cover expenses for official duties, said the accounts, published on the royals' website http://www.casareal.com.</p>
              <p>Prince Felipe, 43, who is married to former television news presenter Princess Letizia, had half of that figure, which would be 70,260 euros in a state grant and 76,117 euros in expenses.</p>
              <p>All top salaries including those of the royal family were cut by 15 percent in 2010 and frozen in 2011, a palace official said.</p>
              <p>By comparison, Spain's former prime minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero who left office last week had an annual salary of 78,185 euros, far less than the king's.</p>
              <p>The publication of the accounts comes as Spain's royal family battles a corruption scandal centred on the king's son-in-law, 43-year-old former Olympic handball player Inaki Urdangarin.</p>
              <p>Judges are investigating alleged corruption involving a charitable organisation formerly run by Urdangarin, husband of the king's youngest daughter Cristina.</p>
              <p>He receives no money from the state.</p>
              <p>The royal household announced it would publish the income details of the king and his family on December 12, the same day that it said Urdangarin would no longer take part in its official activities.</p>
              <p>"The king has no obligation under the constitution to publish his accounts. But it is a gesture of transparence brought about without a doubt due to pressure from the media, blogs and politicians which are suspicious of his son-in-law," said Pilar Urbano who has written several books about the royals.</p>
              <p>"While the criticism and the suspicions are not against the king or the royal household's budget but are about business deals made by his son-in-law, he feels morally obligated to make a gesture of transparency," she told AFP.</p>
              <p>Spain's economic downturn and unemployment rate of 21.52 percent had also fueled pressure for for more openness about the royals' finances.</p>
              <p>According to the accounts, Queen Sofia, Princess Letizia and the two princesses Cristina and Elena have no fixed sum but receive expenses for official duties, up to a global maximum of 375,000 euros in 2011.</p>
              <p>The overall budget was already public.</p>
              <p>The royal budget was frozen in 2010 and then cut by 470,000 euros, or 5.2 percent, to 8.43 million euros in 2011. The royals themselves had reportedly proposed the cut.</p>
              <p>Spain's royal family pay taxes on their income.</p>
              <p>Juan Carlos was proclaimed king in 1975, two days after the death of dictator General Francisco Franco who had designated him as successor in 1969. He is widely respected for helping to usher in democracy after Franco's death.</p>

              </p><p class="MsoNormal">To reduce the ministerial pay to say $500k or $600k means that
              the pay of other top civil servants has to be brought below the above figure
              afterall most of them are drawing pay up to millions. therefore it would require a national effort to ask the top people to take a pay cut.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">No way they are going to carry out this exercise despite of
              your protest. The reviewing committee foresaw this problem if they were to peg
              the ministerial pay to the lower income group. Hopefully the voice for “sacrifice”
              will drown the rest calling for lower pay.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">When Mr Chiam S T proposed a monthly salary $500k, nobody
              took him seriously and then paying top salary notion started to creep up and becomes
              unsustainable. Nobody knows how to stop it.</p>

              <p>hello</p>
              <p>to voice my opinion, I fully support the PAP in any venture they desire to undertake. They were the people who lifted this great nation to glory and riches. They were the sole driving force that made Singapore what it is today - a mightly god loving nation. so what if the salaries of the ministers are so high? they deserve it for being a leader of singapore. how dare all you people dirty and insult the name of the Sinaporean government? You are all no higher than dirty street beggars for saying these things! Members of Parliarment work very hard and sacrifice a lot of personal life to run this country just for you dirty people to insult and unappreciate. You are so lucky that the PAP are such a compassionate and forgiving group of people. They <em>even take the time to listen to you people </em>and yet you all still complain? It is a disgrace to singapore. </p>
              <p>I am a local junior member of the PAP in Bedok and frequent the PAP building and look up to my superiors. I have all the intention to join the PAP as soon as i can an be part of a life giving and godblessed force. </p>
              <p>God bless the PAP and long live Lee Kuan Yew, Lee Sein Long, all their families and decendants for doing so much for this country. </p>
