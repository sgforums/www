              <p>It is a good thing to have high salary in order to attract and
                          retain talent, and also to remove incentives for corruption and
                          other misdeeds.</p>
              <p>Some people like to focus on ministers' salaries but they never
                          think about policemen' salary, teachers' salary, etc.</p>
              <p>But I think many people understand and agree with the relative
                          parity of the salaries of policemen and teachers compared to the
                          private sector counterparts ones.</p>
              <p>But if we agree with the policy on the level of policemen and
                          teachers, logic tells us that we should also agree to a similar
                          policy on the upper level of governance, meaning, the ministers
                          must be well-paid.</p>

              <p>@winsomeea Hi there, I would like to clarify that I am but a 16
              year old boy, who has no political motives whatsoever.</p>
              <p>I am just airing my views on the political situation here in
              Singapore, because I am failing my english and I really need to
              improve on my argumentative skills. I would like to add on the
              point that I am not defending the despots (in fact, I mentioned
              that I am unhappy with certain policies of theirs).</p>
              <p>And I stand by my point about ministers drawing higher salaries
              before they came into parliament. These are known facts that are
              laid before me and I accept them, instead of denying them. But
              thank you very much for your criticisms.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>@Dalforce 1941 Hi there, importing aliens (I am assuming you
              refer to foreign workers) would increase the supply of labour and
              therefore lower the competition for labour, thus allowing us to
              produce more. This increased production is the very essence of
              economic growth. (Sorry if I didn't answer your question fully.
              This is the most I know about economics)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>@Summer hill Hi there, yes I know that too, but birth rates were
              already low in the 1990's and it led to the rise in inflation rate
              now. Hope that answered you question :)</p>

              <p>Because the reasoning is not based on size, or GDP, or
              comparison with other foreign leaders.</p>
              <p>The comparison is simply relative parity with the private sector
              counterpart.</p>
              <p>Again, similarly, if we look at the starter positions, such as
              new policemen, new teachers, there is relative parity with their
              private sector counterparts.</p>
              <p>I believe it is important.</p>
              <p>Because if there is a significant gap between private and public
              sector, there is going to be dichotomy and
              compartmentalization.</p>
              <p>The talented people will go to private sector and the leftover
              losers will go to the public sector.</p>
              <p>The public sector workers would be more incompetent, more
              lazier, more susceptible to bribing, etc, all sorts of problems,
              which would eventually create problems and difficulties for all of
              the society.</p>
              <p>This is not theory. This is practice and you can see it with
              your own eyes.</p>
              <p>Just look at Malaysia, Indonesia.</p>
              <p>In Malaysia if you get caught with traffic violation, you can
              bribe a policeman with "coffee money"</p>
              <p>In Singapore it is much harder to approach a policeman with
              "coffee money", why ?</p>
              <p>It is not some coincidence or some strange configuration of
              stars which created this situation. So what are the factors which
              created this situation ? How come Singapore in the middle of
              Malaysia and Indonesia can have much lesser corruption..?</p>
              <p>The answer is, because of the relatively good renumeration.</p>
              <p>In whatever organization and whatever job position, having a
              good renumeration is important.</p>
              <p>I believe it is doubly important in public sector because the
              people in that sector hold power and authority and their decisions
              have outsized significance and impact on the rest of the
              society.</p>
              <p>One minister who is bribed to give out a road construction
              project to a company who bribe him, is detrimental and is much more
              harmful, than the "coffee money" being given to a traffic
              policeman, so yes, as you go up the ladder, the renumeration need
              to keep up also.</p>
              <p>I believe it is important to have relative parity with private
              sector.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Comparison with private sector is ok but why only select the top highest paying and peg against that?  That will only skew the statistics and with the intentional wrong sample selection, the purpose is to "prove" something that is not reality. </p>
              <p>If the comparison is to be fair, salary should be taken from the 25% of the highest paid population and 25% of the lowest paid popluation. That will make the  average pay more reaonable.  </p>
              <p>If private sector is so attractive, and these people are just working for money and not in the service of people, then these people are better off making the economy grow by working in the private industries and earning that kind of salary rather than artificially kept in the government service with inflated salaries. It does not serve the people nor themselves for the kind of work might not even suit them but they just clung to it due to salary. </p>
              <p>If it is true to always compare to the top highest paid and pay themselves that salary, then Obama should then demand as high a salary as Bill Gates or all the top paid people in US. Similar would happen world wide and all these leaders would be paid in billions. These leaders are surely not asking for super high pay and not comparing againsts private sector because it is to them their chance to serve the people and nation. Its a different calling altogether and they are not looking at these numbers but the welfare of the nation and world. </p>

              <p>Comparison with private sector is ok but why only select the top highest paying and peg against that?  That will only skew the statistics and with the intentional wrong sample selection, the purpose is to "prove" something that is not reality. </p>
              <p>If the comparison is to be fair, salary should be taken from the 25% of the highest paid population and 25% of the lowest paid popluation. That will make the  average pay more reaonable.  </p>
              <p>If private sector is so attractive, and these people are just working for money and not in the service of people, then these people are better off making the economy grow by working in the private industries and earning that kind of salary rather than artificially kept in the government service with inflated salaries. It does not serve the people nor themselves for the kind of work might not even suit them but they just clung to it due to salary. </p>
              <p>If it is true to always compare to the top highest paid and pay themselves that salary, then Obama should then demand as high a salary as Bill Gates or all the top paid people in US. Similar would happen world wide and all these leaders would be paid in billions. These leaders are surely not asking for super high pay and not comparing againsts private sector because it is to them their chance to serve the people and nation. Its a different calling altogether and they are not looking at these numbers but the welfare of the nation and world. </p>

              <p>This is so idealistic that it makes you look like a xmm.<br> <br> Take you for example, say you earn $1.5 mil annually, would you
              give your comfortable life for a 400k job(more than 3 times lesser)
              and putting yourself in public scrutiny?<br> <br> Be practical man. There is still a bottom line to the salary you
              allow yourself to draw. Especially when you are a highly sought
              talent.</p>
              <p>And all the talk about serving the nation at heart, Singapore
              isn't facing a crisis now. There isn't an immediate need to be in
              the government, unlike when Singapore just gained independence. Why
              should the top talents sacrifice so much?</p>
              <p>Will you sacrifice so much if you were them?</p>

              <p>There are people who had been lawyers making millions but give up to do some non profit work just to help people. There are high paying accountants who give up job to be hawker. Salary isn't everything, sometimes, there are people who really wish to help people and money isn't the driving factor. </p>
              <p>I think a fair salary is better to attract real people who are keen to work in the public service line than a super high salary that attract greed and questionable people. </p>
