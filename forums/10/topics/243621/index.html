            <div class='col-md body'>SingaporeÂ’s<br>Brain Drain<br>Â‘We only have ourselves to blameÂ’ Discussion. Aaron Ng<br>Mar 17, 2007<br><br>SM Goh (Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong) remarked that we are losing our best talents.<br><br>Interestingly, I was having a discussion with some undergraduate friends earlier this week. The subject came to whether thereÂ’s a sense of rooted-ness in Singaporeans.<br><br>All of us felt that there isnÂ’t much of a sense of belonging in Singapore.<br><br>I thought that the most striking comment from a friend was regarding how Singapore government will not Â“take careÂ” of Singaporeans.<br><br>Singapore has placed a premium on individual effort since independence. The state must avoid the Â“welfareÂ” model of the West like the plague.<br><br>My friendÂ’s reasoning was that since the government says it will not Â“take careÂ” of Singaporeans, she has to take care of herself.<br><br>And that being the case, whoever offers the best price gets her loyalty because she has to ensure that her future is well-taken care of.<br><br>I canÂ’t generalise, but I wonÂ’t be surprised if a large number of our best talents are leaving because of pragmatic reasons (i.e. other countries are willing to offer better things than what Singapore can offer).<br><br>I donÂ’t think people would disagree that Singapore IS a very pragmatic country. And, I think that Singapore is paying the price for being too pragmatic.<br><br>A lot of things we do in Singapore are based on economic considerations, which is not instrinsically bad.<br><br>However, the side effect is that by living in such an environment, we end up being pragmatic people.<br><br>And a truly pragmatic person knows not the ideas of loyalty and allegiance. Whoever gives the best price gets the service.<br><br>So what happens is that we try and bring in foreigners to make up the shortfall. Guess what? Foreigners that come are also pragmatic people (see my entry on Singapore as a parking lot).<br><br>Like migratory birds, they stop in Singapore until the winter in their homeland has passed and they will fly back again.<br><br>Admittedly, there are some that might stay, but how many such people are there relative to the entire flock?<br><br>Of course, thereÂ’s also the related question of how many of our best and brightest who have flown away will return?<br><br>Could they be so pragmatic that thereÂ’s no possibility of return unless Singapore offers better than what they currently have?<br><br>At the end of the day, it could very be that Singapore ends up in a lose-lose situation. If such a thing happens, we only have ourselves to blame.<br><br>Comments:<br>By Elia Diodati<br>Who is this Â“weÂ”, the collective pronoun? Is it the literal Â“myself and a few other peopleÂ”, or the Â“society as a wholeÂ”? To what extent do the two Â“weÂ”s coincide? To what extent *should* they coincide?<br><br>By RSE<br>I donÂ’t think everyone, and maybe not even a majority, of emigrating Singaporeans are leaving for pragmatic reasons.<br>I have no statistics, but I am not the only person I know who is planning to leave for idealistic reasons Â— Singapore has no room for people who have aspirations beyond living a comfortable material lifestyle.<br>Also, not that I think IÂ’m one of them, but the best and brightest people also tend to attach greater importance to ideals than the average person.<br>In short, I do think we are paying the price for being too pragmatic, but not necessarily because people are too pragmatic to stay in Singapore.<br>From what IÂ’ve encountered of life overseas, there are ample pragmatic and idealistic reasons to leave Singapore.<br><br>By mleok<br>The opportunities in Singapore are Â— letÂ’s face it: limited. The economy is geared towards the average worker (read expendable, and could be done cheaper type).<br>Talent is overrated in such an economy. Why not let it go somewhere else to develop? Maybe, just maybe it will come back.<br><br>By aaron ng<br>It is my anecdotal impression that Singapore retains a somewhat colonial attitude, with a tendency to value all things foreign, and to either under appreciate or take for granted what Singaporeans have to offer.<br>This is a tendency that was rather effectively satirised in Jack NeoÂ’s 2002 movie Â‘I Not StupidÂ’. This is but one example of the many things that leads me to feel like a second-class citizen in oneÂ’s own country.<br>What is perhaps most disheartening, is that whenever one speaks of the brain drain in Singapore, there is never talk of how one reverses the trend, but rather the focus is on importing Â“foreign talentÂ” instead.<br>It would take significant emotional ties to overcome the allure of career opportunities on a global scale, particularly when the phenomenal pace of redevelopment in Singapore means that the places of oneÂ’s youth no longer exist in a familiar form.<br>The over-emphasis on economic pragmatism has left our society bereft of the cultural identity of what it means to be Singaporean, beyond our shared love of food and shopping.<br>To this day, I have not been able to exercise the one right and obligation that is to me the hallmark of citizenship, the right to vote.<br>Is it any wonder then that our disenfranchised, unlamented, and emotionally unanchored diaspora choose to pursue more attractive opportunities abroad?<br><br>To Elia,<br>Â‘WeÂ’ refers to Singapore in general. Of course, one can well argue that no everyone agrees with governmental policies and itÂ’s not right to use the word Â‘weÂ’, but Singaporeans elected the government into power, so I suppose the word Â‘weÂ’ is accurate enough for use.<br>The brain drain issue is not new. What is new is perhaps the speed we are losing people now?<br>I have no evidence for this though, but if it ainÂ’t that big of an issue, the government wouldnÂ’t be talking about it.<br><br>To RSE,<br>Going out for opportunities is not uncommon. China and India are perfect examples where smart people have left their countries in search of better opportunities.<br>But, these people eventually returned to their motherland. Will the Singaporean diaspora return? I donÂ’t know.<br><br>To mleok,<br>Indeed, IÂ’ve always been wondering why we are not putting in as much effort to bring back the Singaporean diaspora. Is it because itÂ’s not as cost effective? I have no answers.<br>I think at the end of the day, we have to look hard at ourselves and ask what is it that makes me Singaporean and what binds me to this place?<br>What am I happy about Singapore and what am I not happy about Singapore? Or perhaps, more importantly, can I achieve what I want in Singapore?<br><br>By Raymond<br>Actually is kinda sad to see Singapore keep taking in foreigners. Instead of trying to find more ways to make people give birth more, we are using the replacement methods.<br>I donÂ’t think foreigners will have much sense of belonging compare to those who grow up in this part of Asia. I really hope that Singaporeans with passion can stand up and build a better Singapore instead of just keep on running away and the problem cannot be solved.<br>I really hope that there will be Singaporeans who will come back eventually to help build a better nation as this is where our forefather have build and it will be sad to see that it get destroy some day.<br>Our System (has) got to change. The only way to change is a growth of talented people that will stand up against our current policy and join our hands together to make a better Singapore.<br><br>By Ned Stark<br>Worse is if in times of war, who will defend Singapore? If I was an expat, I donÂ’t think I want to stay aboard a sinking ship, I will run. Thus in times of trouble it is those who are victims of the system who will be the first ones to give their lives for the system.<br>Michael Moore shows this fact in his film Â‘Fareinheight 911Â’, whereby those from the lower strata of society are often the ones who join the army and head for places like Iraq in the name of America.<br><br>By RSE<br>To Aaron,<br>I was taking a rather cynical view along the lines of: the SingaporeÂ’s economy doesnÂ’t need (want?) talent (it needs and wants expendable labour) and talent doesnÂ’t need Singapore, so who cares if they leave? Those from China/India eventually return because China/India needs and wants them. Plus, they feel rooted enough to return, the money isnÂ’t that shabby, either.<br>As long as Singapore competes on cost alone, it will not need talent. Economies where talent is needed compete on value, not cost.<br>Economies that compete on cost however, need numbers. I suspect the government here is more worried about numbers than actual talent. ThatÂ’s what 6.5 million was about. ThatÂ’s what the foreign talent policy is about.<br>Number-wise, the Singaporean diaspora offer far less than foreigners, why go all out to bring them back?<br><br>By Bill<br>Not to sound blunt, but the PAP probably couldnÂ’t care less about people who leave Singapore because Singapore does not offer enough protection or welfare.<br>These are not the talented people Goh was talking about - the talented people the PAP wants are the ones who can earn big bucks and donÂ’t need welfare, and in fact PREFER lower personal taxes.<br>I agree that.. that idealism is probably a far greater reason why the truly talented leave.<br>These are not the people who leave because the Singapore government does not give enough handouts - these are the people who leave because they are disillusioned with the stifling system, where the government is overly conservative, authoritarian and pragmatic.<br>It is not just be the governmentÂ’s fault - Singaporeans in general are a myopic, narrow-minded, uncivilised and overall unattractive lot.<br>It is conceivable why the real talents wouldnÂ’t want to rub shoulders with them.<br>The land size is also a major problem - Singapore is too small and cramped, and people who want their own landed property, with their own gardens, backyards, a stream running behind their house and forests and mountain ranges for them to explore, would probably be attracted to the wide open spaces and charming natural environment in other countries (like Australia).<br><br>Kev<br>On a personal level, living in Canada for close to 3 years has made me feel more Singaporean than IÂ’ve ever felt before.<br>So what exactly ties me to my country? ItÂ’s a hard question to answer. For sure, food and shopping!<br>But is that enough for me to go back? Not so much. If I do plan to go home, itÂ’ll be largely due to family commitments.<br>I donÂ’t know if IÂ’m ready to go back and be told by my country (intrinsically, government) what to do, what not to do. ItÂ’s hard for me to feel like a citizen at home when my opinions canÂ’t be heard and I canÂ’t voice my opinions without feeling afraid.<br>I mean Singapore, or rather, the government (since we only had one) has disappointed me on many levels. From the education system to minority rights to basic freedom of expression.<br>Of course, all our achievements are due to the efficacy of the PAP. I canÂ’t deny that. But I really think for us to go on further and to achieve all of the governmentÂ’s rhetoric of becoming a knowledge-based economy, a global hub, a centre for excellence, there needs to be a fundamental change in the way things are run.<br>For Singapore to truly sustain itself in the next 50 years, we cannot keep looking to the government for answers, but we should instead seize our own initiative and decide for ourselves what we want.<br>Policies shouldnÂ’t be decrees.<br>I am almost jealous of the way things are run in Canada, where concerned citizens have the chance to voice their opinions on things like having more cycling lanes, tuition fee hikes, expanding highways, etcÂ…<br>It may not be the most efficient way to do things and may come in the way of progress. But I think we have come far enough where Singapore can afford some real space for public debate.<br>ItÂ’s depressing when I think about it. Yes, we have a benevolent government who has taken very good care of us, most of the time. I am grateful and proud of what weÂ’ve achieved in such a short span of 40 years.<br>But isnÂ’t it about time where, perhaps, the government can chill a little bit. And not make me feel like a criminal for having a dissident voice.<br>I love Singapore for what it is, for what it will become. But IÂ’m just frustrated that I canÂ’t play a part in it.<br><br>By Sensei Michael<br>Let me just put it this way. Back in Singapore, I was just any run-of-the-mill teacher who has to churn my pupils through endless worksheets after worksheets.<br>Here in an international school in China, IÂ’m a respected Â“Foreign ExpertÂ” who can teach the way I feel children should be taught.<br>My wife likes Shanghai. My children love Shanghai. Here I have western, Malaysian, Singaporean and local friends. The pay I get allows me to live much better than I did back in Singapore. Why should I return?<br>And IÂ’m NOT even one of those six-figure earning Â“talentsÂ”.<br><br>By Kelvin<br>Singapore as a global city? I guess that term is has more sinister undertones than I initially expect.<br>Maybe itÂ’s the unique situation that Singapore has always been and the notion of the government that only the best talents can drive the nation forward.<br>It disappoints me that maybe in the near future, I might not convicted enough to truly call this land I was born in my home.<br>Is it irrational to suggest that a drizzle of xenophobia can foster nationalism?<br>I really canÂ’t imagine what the future holds for meÂ… HmmmÂ…<br><br>By mleok<br>I resonate with some of the prior comments, in particular the sense that when abroad, we are accepted for who we are: holistic individuals with opinions, ideals, and aspirations.<br>We are valued for what we have to offer, and the ideals and goals we passionately pursue, even when they donÂ’t necessarily conform to a narrowly defined notion of economic success.<br>The government would like our most talented Singaporeans to stay, but only on their terms, and contributing in a manner of their choosing. There is nothing quite like telling our best and brightest that the things they are passionate about are irrelevant and unimportant if our goal is to have them leave for greener pastures.<br><br>By guojun<br>So yes, Singapore is a parking lot, even for many of us locals. And, while many leave due to pragmatic reasons - yes, so weÂ’re brought up to be pragmatic anyway and our loyalty can be bought oh-so-easily, many also prefer to leave on idealistic grounds.<br>Many who go overseas to live also face unemployment, discrimination and maybe even lower salaries than what they could get in Singapore. So it must be some discontentment with the State, which sends them packing, no?<br>In Singapore, being alternative makes people eye you with suspicion. The narrow-mindedness is everywhere - people have been asking me yet again what I am going to do with an arts degree.<br>In fact, being alternative goes to the extent that if we spoke up out of concern for our community we would be eyed with suspicion by our political leaders.<br>Do the phrases Â’social unrestÂ’, Â‘Sedition Act,Â’ et cetera sound familiar? Perhaps why people leave is that in Singapore, people donÂ’t feel like humans anymore - just machines.<br>Machines to get good results, earn money, get a job, family, and then die.<br>Do we want that? I donÂ’t. Singapore has long stopped being a place I would truly call Â‘homeÂ’ - itÂ’s only home because of my friends and family.<br>Stay in Singapore because itÂ’s, well, Singapore, with economic opportunities and increasing social polarisation?<br><br>By Ned Stark<br>To Guojun,<br>The worst is if you say something which is not supportive of the system, you are branded a trouble-maker and so on so forth.<br>There is this holier than thou attitude among some groups of people that galls me. In To Kill A Mockingbird, the kids are told itÂ’s a sin to kill a mocking bird. In Singapore itÂ’s a sin to raise a concern.<br><br>To Kev,<br>I agree with you that a major shift in the social sphere is needed, if Singapore wants to truly be global than the leaders have to have the courage to open up.<br>But that will entail a possible loss of power. Will our leaders be that selfless? Only time will tellÂ…<br><br>By troodon<br>Actually, the main reason I am not in Singapore is that itÂ’s not challenging enough. There arenÂ’t really any real companies in Singapore and most jobs in Singapore involve either rubbish SMEs that make crap products or government backed GLCs/Research Instituations a.k.a AStar that donÂ’t do anything of importance.<br>Singaporeans who work overseas are not Â“running awayÂ”.<br>Running away has nothing to do with it. It has more to do with working with really smart, brilliant people who are capable of doing real work, not just babble about the uselessness of NS men (Philip Yeo).<br><br>For full:<br>http://aaron-ng.info/blog/we-only-have-ourselves-to-blame.html<br><br>(Aaron is a final year undergraduate in CNM Programme, National University of Singapore.)<br><br>----------<br>A personal comment here;many Singaporeans leave because ofa lack of life here,of a lack of having some measure of personal happiness.Similarly,they lack the ability to express themselves and contribute to society.<br><br>Lee Kuan Yew has to go.There is no other reason.He is the biggest gangster in Singapore,intimidating the people into voting for him and the PAP,threatening to withhold upgrading,a scheme that every Singaporean should have the oppportunity to decide.<br><br>The government is dishounourable,prioritising the foreigners above the Singaporeans.While we do need immigrants,why should we go overboard?Similarly,their policies have created a lack of self-reliance among Singaporeans.This is simply because of restrictive policies that do not promote free expression.<br><br>While we have had to be pragmatic to survive,this country needs more idealistic people,simply because we need something more than the tangible to survive.We need the intagibles such as freedom and an opportunity to contribute meaningfully to society.<br><br>My soul may be Singaporean,but after living overseas,my heart is not.<br></div>
