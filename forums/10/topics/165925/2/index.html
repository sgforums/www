So much for creativity.<br><br>Yes, the art piece has strong feelings against the death penalty. Well, artists create their work to display their feelings. So he's against the death penalty and wants others to know his feelings. He's not imposing his opinions onto others, is he? If you don't like the piece, then don't see it. He's not forcing everyone to see it, right?<br><br>If anything, we're the ones imposing our opinions onto him by censoring him. As I've said before, I don't want foreigners to tell us how our country should be run, but I still want to listen to what they have to say.<br><br>Besides, do you seriously think the government can't manage a few 'comments' over a piece of art?</div></blockquote>You are right about that we are imposing our opinions onto him by censoring him, and I get the impression that Singapore Government wants to "improve" the situation by censoring his art piece/him.</div>

For one, I think the Australia handle the issue very badly, they should know that Singapore never back down on threats.

However, I am not in favour imposing my opinions on others and telling them what they should or should not do. The guy just wants to say something; let him have his say. If you think it's lame, attention-seeking and a poor attempt at being hip, then don't watch it. Simple as that.</div>
