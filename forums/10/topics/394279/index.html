              <h1>Resolution of the Charity/ NFPO taxation dilemma- my opinion.</h1>
              <p>I think I now understand what all this <strong>hullabaloo </strong>about the 
                          <a href="http://www.todayonline.com/Singapore/EDC100322-0000021/Spirits-remain-high-at-City-Harvest-Church">purchase of Suntec City</a> is all about. Though I think that there isn't 
                          anything currently legally wrong, I frown upon this purchase.<br> [pls post scripture related issues at my other thread: '<a href="http://forums.hardwarezone.com.sg/showthread.php?t=2705997">City Harvest Church members should read bible more often</a>'
                            (my concern here is about if and when Charities should be taxed)].<br> <br> I believe that the question of whether 
                          Charities/Not-for-profit-organizations (NFPO)should be taxed relates to 
                          the the nature of income from their operations and how such income is 
                          spent. I define 2 types of income- donations and fees, note 3 possible 
                          current situations of income dilemmas and suggest a mechanism of audit 
                          for their expenses. <br> <br> As the name portends, NFPO organizations ought not earn profits, 
                          however, this may inadvertantly occur in 3 scenarios:<br> a) Investments of capital: e.g. Equities, unit trusts, property: These 
                          should NOT be allowed, being NFPO organizations, their focus ought to be
                           in helping their charges, all excess shall be in cash deposits or fixed
                           deposits not exceeding 2 years. Foreign currency deposits of 6 months, 
                          or up to 3 years projected expenditure may be allowed with written 
                          permission from the COC, renewable upon expiry.<br> b) Property, Equity, Unit trusts, Warrants, Foreign currency with the 
                          excception of (a): NOT allowed. NFPOs should be prepared to support 
                          their charges in good times and bad. The recent <a href="http://www.wsws.org/articles/2008/dec2008/pers-d16.shtml">Madoff scandal</a> [<a href="http://www.google.com.sg/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=2&amp;ved=0CBQQFjAB&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FMadoff_investment_scandal&amp;ei=8SOoS6yODc6yrAfXprCpAQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNH_x0ssRIE6OmlrgTZIe7VR9Ugpug&amp;sig2=JNBOsUIWXY5kASoGKtrIpw">wiki</a>], recession have showed such reserves to be at
                           severe risk of erosion during crisis. NPOS if allowed to be affected by
                           such economic fluctuations, would result in a very unstable country, 
                          easily overcome by any recession. Should a NFPO property be 
                          underutilized, NO rent in excess of the maintenance cost proportional to
                           the property may be collected. It is recommended that NFPO 
                          organisations embrace the spirit of community, helping to develop other 
                          NFPOs/ develop new synergies to provide better services to the 
                          community.<br> c) NFPOs should in general not profit from services provided, however, 
                          due to understandable variances in service-demand, profits might arise 
                          e.g. a nursing service, anticipated to treat x patients, ends up 
                          treating exceeds its target by 25% resulting in surplus collection- this
                           should NOT be taxed, however, immediate notification of the COC and 
                          special mention in the annual accounts be made, should an anticipated 
                          income (donations and profits) surplus of  $100,000 or 15% existing 
                          reserves, whichever higher occur.<br> <br> That said, every registered charity, prior to beginning the work-year 
                          (decided by the charity), shall submit to the COC and make publicly 
                          available, its income expense budget plans, current assets and 
                          liabilities for that work year. Immediate notification of the COC is 
                          required should the anticipated income-expense plans change or deviate 
                          by more then 50% for the given year. (charity work years should not need
                           to be IRAS/COC specified because NFPOs are not expected to pay taxes).<br> <br> By my current opinion,  City  Harvest Church (CHC) should thus NOT be 
                          allowed to purchase the Suntec property as Suntec City is obviously a 
                          commercial property, and as I described, unsuitable for NFPO ownership. 
                          Should CHC wish to own Suntec City, it must apply to URA to convert the 
                          status of Suntec City to that of a NFPO one before attempting to 
                          purchase it. Otherwise, CHC, with it's enormous budget may apply to rent
                           the said premise to cater to its well-to-do congregation.<br> <br> Of course, embracing the power of immense faith, I'm hopeful that CHC, 
                          its leaders and strong 30K congregation, would not fail in its endeavors
                           whilst abiding by the true spirit of God and Laws of the land.<br> <br> Truly am I sorry to disappoint, but past evidences such as the monies 
                          that charities lost in the <a href="http://www.wsws.org/articles/2008/dec2008/pers-d16.shtml">Madoff scandal</a>;  '<a href="http://lushhomemedia.com/2009/09/12/is-this-10m-site-the-reason-behind-the-pkms-fracas/">Is this $10m site the reason behind the PKMS fracas?</a>'-
                           "...  a struggle for control over this money and potential fortune..."-
                           have both proven the <a href="http://www.answersingenesis.org/articles/2009/08/21/feedback-fallible-men-writing-infallible-bible">fallibility of man</a>. Any religious organization, 
                          holding this immense amount of property/ money remains a potential 
                          victim of such large fall out, a tear to our social fabric and a threat 
                          to national stability.<br> So sorry, it is with the spirit of charity that register my objection to
                           the CHC purchase. <br> <br> In addition, I believe that all properties designated NFPO should be 
                          charged property tax at the current concessionary rates payable. 
                          Property taxes should be charged on ALL properties- the concessionary 
                          rate being enough as recognition for the good that any NFPO does for 
                          society. Sure, you argue that the 'Mega' NFPOs get penalized, then 
                          again, do NFPOs really need to be mega?</p>

              <p>If numbers, collections, followers is what Pastor KH wants, then I
                           wont bother disputing the figures on his website. However, if you ask 
                          me what 33,000 young, healthy, educated people can deliver to this 
                          world, I'd say that they are under-performing.<br> <br> So in peace, I quote from <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+13&amp;version=NIV">Romans 13</a> , my reference though, yours (#17) is

              <div class="quote"><span class="byline">Quote:</span> <blockquote> Romans 13 (New International Version)<br> <br> Romans 13<br> Submission to the Authorities<br> 1Everyone must submit himself to the governing authorities, for there 
                      is no authority except that which God has established. The authorities 
                      that exist have been established by God. 2Consequently, he who rebels 
                      against the authority is rebelling against what God has instituted, and 
                      those who do so will bring judgment on themselves. 3For rulers hold no 
                      terror for those who do right, but for those who do wrong. Do you want 
                      to be free from fear of the one in authority? Then do what is right and 
                      he will commend you. 4For he is God's servant to do you good. But if you
                       do wrong, be afraid, for he does not bear the sword for nothing. He is 
                      God's servant, an agent of wrath to bring punishment on the wrongdoer. 
                      5Therefore, it is necessary to submit to the authorities, not only 
                      because of possible punishment but also because of conscience. 6This is 
                      also why you pay taxes, for the authorities are God's servants, who give
                       their full time to governing. 7Give everyone what you owe him: If you 
                      owe taxes, pay taxes; if revenue, then revenue; if respect, then 
                      respect; if honor, then honor.<br> Love, for the Day is Near<br> 8Let no debt remain outstanding, except the continuing debt to love one
                       another, for he who loves his fellowman has fulfilled the law. 9The 
                      commandments, "Do not commit adultery," "Do not murder," "Do not steal,"
                       "Do not covet,"[a] and whatever other commandment there may be, are 
                      summed up in this one rule: "Love your neighbor as yourself."[b] 10Love 
                      does no harm to its neighbor. Therefore love is the fulfillment of the 
                      law.<br> <br> 11And do this, understanding the present time. The hour has come for 
                      you to wake up from your slumber, because our salvation is nearer now 
                      than when we first believed. 12The night is nearly over; the day is 
                      almost here. So let us put aside the deeds of darkness and put on the 
                      armor of light. 13Let us behave decently, as in the daytime, not in 
                      orgies and drunkenness, not in sexual immorality and debauchery, not in 
                      dissension and jealousy. 14Rather, clothe yourselves with the Lord Jesus
                       Christ, and do not think about how to gratify the desires of the sinful
                       nature.[c] </blockquote></div>
