              <p>PAP regime insists on white washing historical events in history textbooks and they also don't really promote understanding of politics of that era, so the younger generation won't be aware of such things.</p>
              <p>Lee Kuan Yew's dirty politics and his filth will be exposed if they seriously go and teach proper history.</p>
              <p>After so long being brainwashed by Lee Kuan Yew's filthly propaganda on Singapore history, I think many will be disillusioned if they find out the truth.</p>

              <p><br>Among other things.....<br><br>Upon Singapore's integration with Malaysia, UMNO and PAP have made agreement not to interfere onto each other electorates. <br><br>Prior to the race riots, both UNMO and PAP had breached this agreement. UMNO had formed a political wing in Singapore and PAP had made inroad into Malaysia with the likes of left-wing candidates, Devan Nair and others.  <br><br>PAP realised that it was leading its Chinese majority Singaporeans down the road of second class citizenship. This was made worse by the merger referendum which the PAP urged citizens to join, espounding the benefits of merger.<br><br>At that moment, the only way PAP's vision of Malaysian's Malaysia can be realised was thru the ballot box - not here in Singapore but inroad into Malaysia.<br><br>UNMO would have seen this as an assault on both fronts - cropping Chinese encirclement and menacing communist threat.<br><br>Also, the UNMO's political wing in Singapore were of racial based, of racial agenda. </p>
              <p>The riots in Malaysis and Singapore certainly have political influences and spins. So it is not simply as having racial harmony campaigns and voila everything is nice and fine. Understand this, younger Singaporeans.</p>

              <p>everything there is political influence, because you live under the governance of the government.</p>
              <p>but think carefully, did the malay in malaysia really wanted chinese to be equal? if LKY somehow had his way in building a malaysian malaysia, how would the Malay respond, after it is just a political difference?</p>
              <p>today, whichever party come up in Malaysia, can the rights of bumiputra be questioned?</p>
              <p>Somebody in this forum is right, in Malaysia, the people control the government, in Singapore, the government control the people.</p>

              <p>Sometimes the violence is instigated by certain groups in order to achieve certain political goals.</p>
              <p>For example if you go and read "Comet in the Sky" which is available from library, there is an essay by Greg Poulgrain in which he quotes from british documents which state that the riots in 1956 were instigated by then chief minister of Singapore Lim Yew Hock with the aim of creating a pretext to arrest Lim Chin Siong.</p>
              <p>In means that the riots were orchestrated by Lim Yew Hock so that he could put the blame on Lim Chin Siong and then wipe him out.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In 1955 Lim had been elected as Singapore's youngest parliamentarian. However, a year later, after widespread riots involving industrial workers and Chinese school students, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>he was arrested and imprisoned on charges of being one of the leaders of the "communist united front" alleged to have been behind the riots.</strong></span></span><br><br>Lim's own reputation was a further casualty to the riots' mayhem and bloodshed, and he was <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>detained without trial. </strong></span></span>He denied charges that he was a communist, charges which remain unsubstantiated until today.<br><br>In a startling and revisionist essay, Dr Greg Poulgrain of Griffiths University observes that the British Governor of Singapore and his Chief Secretary in their reports to London had admitted that the police could find no evidence to establish that Lim was a communist.<br><br>Poulgrain claims it was actually Singapore's then Chief Minister, Lim Yew Hock, who had deliberately "provoked" the bus and other industrial workers and Chinese middle students to riot in 1956 in order to have Lim Chin Siong arrested.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Lim Yew Hock's own admission to responsibility for the riot appears in an official report to the British Government which Poulgrain found in the Colonial Office records in London which are now open to researchers.</strong></span></span><br><br><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>"Lee Kuan Yew was secretly a party with Lim Yew Hock,"</strong></span></span> adds Poulgrain, "in urging the Colonial Secretary to impose the subversives ban in making it illegal for former political detainees to stand for election."</p>

                                          Communists caused it. We are from Singapore and we know that this
                                          is just to cover up the real culprits. The Prime Minister of
                                          Singapore is telling, in Europe, that the UMNO politicians have
                                          caused it. The UMNO in Singapore says that the P.A.P. has caused

I can safely say that we share many views in common.<br><br>My points were directed at the younger Singaporean to think deeper that just believing the press or the govt or the rumour or our primeval feeling.</p>

              <p><br>But people have flaws, that is natural, we are not perfect, unlike homogenous country where riot and protest are common as the alike population make them more togetherness. Of course, they have the right to fight for their rights, violence can occurs only when authority take over the situation.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In fact, given our multi racial society, whereby gathering and co-ordination is hard to come by due to different religions and race background, it had been a blessing in disguise for our ruling party. In this way, you hardly or never see a common ground for people here to go on strikes, riot or protest. That is to say, if the Chinese go on riot, the malay will sit one side and see, if the indian go on protest, the chinese and malay may just keep a watch on it, that give our ruling party a lead way to play within the race. Many thought that ruling a multi racial society is difficult, but actually it is much more simple.</p>

              <div>
              <div style="clear: both;">Aeromodelling instructor Piragasam Singaravelu had to pay $22,000 in damages and another $10,000 for the apology notices for saying he had seen NKF CEO <a href="http://swordofdemocles.blogspot.com/2005/07/skeletons-in-nkf-cupboard.html"><span style="color: #99aadd;">TT Durai</span></a> in the Singapore Airlines (SIA) first-class cabin. His price for telling the truth pales in comparison to what Tan Wah Piow paid.</div>
              <div style="clear: both;"><br></div>
              <div style="clear: both;">Tan was the student leader of the University of Singapore Student’s Union (USSU) in 1975 when he was caught up in the workers’ labour problems at American Marine.</div>
              <div style="clear: both;">His nemesis was <a rel="nofollow" href="http://swordofdemocles.blogspot.com/2005/09/real-rogues-gallery.html">Phey Yew Kok, </a>Secretary General of Pioneer Industries Employee’s Union (PIEU).</div>
              <div style="clear: both;">Tan found himself jailed for 6 months for 'rioting' even though he was nowhere near the office where he was supposed to have 'broken some chairs' -- but the word of Phey Yew Kok, then PAP MP, now a fugitive in Taiwan, carried the day. The judge chose to believe Phey.</div>

              <p><img src="http://i209.photobucket.com/albums/bb111/atobe-album/PheyYewKok.gif" alt=""></p>
              <p>An Australian Queen's Counsel, Frank Galbally, who observed the trial for the Australian Union of Students, said: "In Australia, the case would be laughed out of court ... the evidence and procedure ... would, in my opinion, have aborted any trial in Australia ... [The three accused] did not get a fair trial. ... In my opinion, it is just a political trial."</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p> </p>
              <div style="clear: both;">Tan is now a partner of a law firm. The British national lives with his wife and 19-year-old son in London. He keeps in touch with Singapore politics through the Internet and visits the region often, usually to meet his 92-year-old mother, who lives here.<br><br><br><em><strong>Extracted from USSU publication, “Awakening”, Issue 25, Tuesday 4th Feb 1975</strong></em><br><br>36th Day of the Trial 3rd Feb 1975<br><br>Seow Yuet Leng a worker from Eminence Factory and a temporary representative of the PIEU branch, was testifying for the defence and told the court what she saw inside the PIEU premises on 30th Oct 1974.<br><br>On the 29th noon she was told by the secretary at Eminence that the Union called her and asked her to go for a meeting on the 30th October. She asked Lai Ah Choon on the night of 29th to accompany her there.<br><br>“When we reached PIEU at about 10.45 am I saw about 100 people in the field. Lai saw a Chinese male friend and went over to talk to him. I sat on the bed. After about 10 minutes she came over to sit on the flower bed. 5 minutes later we saw that the crowd had gathered in the field. We went up but could not hear what they said because we did not join them.”<br><br>“I went round the crowd once, then I held Lai by the hand and asked her to go into the premises. We then released our hands. When we reached the door I saw Robert Leow at the door. We were asked to go in.</div>
              <div style="clear: both;"><br>When I went in, Lin Chin Siew asked why I was with those people in the group, and then Robert Leow had asked me to go in. We went into A department, Robert Liew went in first, followed by myself and then Lai.</div>
              <div style="clear: both;"><br>Robert Leow told me that he went to the Ministry of Labour on the previous day. He said that he met Mr Leow there and he did not promise the $40 increase. He only promised an increase of 10%. He said that he was not sure whether the 10% will be added to the basic pay or on that with the extra. Confirmation of this increase could be made after the manager’s father return from America. He did not know when he will return from America.”<br><br>“Then there was a sound from outside – someone closing the door. Following this there were people knocking at the door. The door was knocked twice or thrice, pause then knocked 2 or 3 times, pause and carried on that way.<br></div>
              <div style="clear: both;">Then a person walked into the passageway. He walked a little faster than normal. Robert Leow stood up. He told us to wait for a while and he went out. He went up to the Hall. I also saw Lawrence Quek walking in that direction, to the hall. I then came out with Lai. While walking to the hall along the passage way, I saw Kwek listening into the phone in the passage way. Lai was just behind me. I wanted to go into the hall and I pulled the door a little. Kwek had his body leaning against the opened door.”<br><br>WP: Before you came out of department A, did you see any of the accused persons?<br></div>
              <div style="clear: both;">YL: I did not.<br></div>
              <div style="clear: both;">WP: Did you see me while walking along the passageway to the hall?<br></div>
              <div style="clear: both;">YL: I did not.<br></div>
              <div style="clear: both;">WP: Did you see anyone carrying a stick along the passageway?<br></div>
              <div style="clear: both;">YL: I did not.<br><br>When asked, Yuet Leng said that Kwek was then leaning over the counter phoning with his shoulders bent beside me. <br><br>"I had just stood still when Lawrence Kwek stood beside me. At that time the door had come closed. We were all in the hall.</div>
              <div style="clear: both;"><br>After Lawrence Kwek came in to stand beside me, he said something in English. I did not understand what he said. He then punched the glass on the door with his right hand and shook his hand from the wrist a few times.</div>
              <div style="clear: both;"><br>He then said, “Overturn the tables and chairs” and he himself overturned a table with his left hand. We stood there for a while. Lawrence Kwek wanted them to go in. They went in. <br></div>
              <div style="clear: both;">At that time I was very frightened. I heard “pomp” once and saw a person kicking the glass from outside."<br><br>WP: Other than Lawrence Kwek, were the tables overturned by anyone else?<br></div>
              <div style="clear: both;">YL: Yes.<br></div>
              <div style="clear: both;">WP: (Where) was Robert Leow and Lin Chin Siew at that time?<br></div>
              <div style="clear: both;">YL: They were in the hall too.<br><br>“I spoke in Lai in Cantonese that if she doesn’t run, I will run. I then ran out to the door, opened it and walked out.”<br><br>WP: Did you notice anything on the floor of the hall as you ran towards the door?<br></div>
              <div style="clear: both;">YL: Yes. The overturned tables and chairs. There were also pieces of paper.<br><br>“I went to the left after I had crossed the drain. When I was in the field, a Chinese man in his 20’s approached me. He said, “Miss, can I take a picture as a souvenir?” I scolded him. “You don’t take. What picture do you want to take.” He smiled and walked away.<br><br>“A few girls came up. One girl (she identified as Kim Hong, one of the USSU students) asked me what happened. I was too frightened and did not say anything immediately. Lai told them that he was the Assistant General Secretary. The short girl asked, “Why did they want to break it like that?” She added, “It appears to me they want to falsely accuse the workers with this matter.” I said, “I don’t know.”<br><br>“While we were there another middle-aged man came to talk to us. He left the site at about 12.55 pm.”<br><br>“At about 1 pm I went back to work. I spoke to four or five workers and told them about the event at PIEU that morning.”<br></div>
              <div style="clear: both;">WP requested for these 4 workers to be his witnesses.<br><br>Judge: If you are interested in staying till February, it’s your business.<br><br>SG: I object. He is calling these stupid and useless witnesses of his defence to prolong the trial because he knows that he had not handed in his assignments and that he is going to fail.<br><br>Raman (lawyer for one of the defendants) strongly protested. He said that these witnesses referred to by Wah Piow were also his witnesses and as such the SG’s suggestion was unfair.<br><br>The Judge said he will decide on this later.<br><br>Yuet Leng named the four girls as Wu Ching Ying, Wong Chin Liang, Chen Siew Fong and Lee Pui Liang. <br><br>“I told them that the Assistant General Secretary at AUPE, Lawrence Kwek broke the glass with his hand. I also told them that after he overturned the table he asked the union officials to overturn the tables and chairs. Lee asked me why they did all those things and I told them them I did not know and that I was very frightened at that time. I also told them about the 10% wage increase.”</div>

              <p>what make you so sure that the PRC Chinese that resided in the US are dissidents?<br>Infact majority of the PRC are life style migrant who enjoy taking up US passport and travel back to china for vacation and buy up their own properties.</p>
              <p>I don't just talked to them i worked with them....both in and out of PRC. They are everywhere.</p>
              <p>You perceived that getting information from US are biased that is because</p>
              <p>1) SG is already drunning in PRC propaganda.</p>
              <p>2) information within PRC are being block.</p>

              <p>4) Open to information and exchange of ideas.</p>
              <p> if you can't deal with that.....think how do you debates within the US....u think everyone is civilizes? think again the public you tear you to pieces.....the challenges are how do you work with people that you don't necessary agreed with. Centainly not by force.</p>

              <p>Never once did i said the PRC in America are dissidents. They are smart, so they do deserve to go to a country where their abilities are better utilized.</p>
              <p>I am however, referring to the dissidents/political refugees that the American/European media use as information sources to broadcast a negative picture of any events that happens in China.</p>
              <p>The Dalai Lama comes to mind for one. The Falungong movement for another.</p>
              <p>And i have also talk with them, worked with them and i rent a room to one and his wife. They ARE everywhere, i agree with you on this, so what's your point? Are you saying the PRCs in America can give a better picture than the ones in Singapore? Shouldn't they be bits and pieces to gain a more complete picture ? </p>
              <p>It may shock you, but i don't take my information from SG sources. I'm sorry, did it surprised you that sillyporeans actually bother to explore more of the internet?</p>
              <p>I am no more biased against the US than you are against China and according to your list, you are also subjected to number 3 and 4 yourself. I can also argue that you are drunning in anti PRC propaganda also no?</p>
              <p>I have no real wish to derail this thread on my views with America and China. But this is about racial harmony and national integration day, not about foreign affairs. If you wish to take this to another thread however, i would oblige.</p>
