              <p>Facts, inferences, lies, exaggeration, prejudice....are all bundled in one package called news, and is given through all kinds of media. It blinds and suffocate you if you are unable to differentiate the differences.</p>
              <p>there were underlying current before mumbai were attacked, before 911, before the wallstreets fat cats ran away with billions of $... what kind of actions could have been taken to protect innocent civilians from such deadly forces, physical or financial. Who make the call on what are the necessary actions, include the level of forces involved. that is the task of the government official whom we elected, to tackle those who take up arms, who abuse freedom for their own agenda and pocket, and these people are also citizens!</p>
              <p>so what are you witnessing?  "govt willing to use of force to justify their control over its people in the name of state interest?"  If you are referring to the unrest in Xinjiang, then you are either totally misinformed or you had chosen to ignore the fact, just because this happens in China.</p>
              <p>Should the Chinese government allows the two ethnic races to attack each other?  should they act otherwise? are actions taken by government to control them, from rioting, yes!</p>
              <p>Did the two ethnic races fight because of religion, cultural difference, or unhappy over distribution of wealth and job opportunities?</p>
              <p>there are all kinds of people, the law abiding ones, those who take law in their own hands, those who are blind and prejudice, for and against the government, .... together we are ONE PEOPLE from whom the government should protect? NO!</p>

              <p>if you and your neighbor start exchanging flying stones, both of you have become public nuiance and you are also endangering other neighbors. don't the police have the right to come into your house to take away all the stones? You need to fix yourself first, and exercise self control or others will control you.</p>
              <p>So what is the difference between xinjiang and tibet, one is muslim minority and the others buddists, one is populated by uyghurs and hans, the others by tibetan and hans. You can also find other minorities in both region, and in other region like gansu, ninxia...</p>
              <p>What is similar, the ones who took to the streets are called mob, there were tibetan mob, hans mob and uyghurs mob. when they killed, blood is red.</p>
              <p>What happened in xinjiang today is a result of two uyghurs minority killed in a dispute in a factory in guangzhou over job opportunities. I don't know what social intergration problem there is, but the uyghurs are free to practice their muslim faith, the tibetan their brand of buddism, and there are 30 millions muslim in China, why do you see there is a need to "terminates the entire ethnic to intergrate the entire region"? this is very strong, evil, uncalled  for accusation.</p>

              <p>No government in the world believe that there can be a completely news black out, given the technology available to the common citizens today, especially places where foreigners are free to get in and out.</p>
              <p>In this modern age, there is no lack of info on any events anywhere in the world. It is the interpretation of such info that are subject to individual, with different upbringing, political interest, private agenda, objective or subjective mindset... and most important of all, knowledge needed in interpretation, the wisdom in make judgement.</p>
              <p>Indeed, law enforcement is always needed to maintain social stability. In this days, the use of force of any kind by anybody that disturb social stability, and resulting in death to innocent citizens is termed Terrorism. Even in the days where martyr died for their cause in revolution would avoid causing any harm to innocent civilian. When demonstration turned riots targetting at innocent citizens instead of the authorities, there is no "social correctness" in any sense.</p>
              <p>We are supposed to talk about how to promote racial harmony and national integration, not to encourage segregation and street riots for individual agenda.</p>
              <p>Exactly why does "PRC deserve exactly what is happening"? why do the over 400 citizens deserve to die in urumuqi? and thousands deserve to lose their loved ones?</p>
              <p>Causing death to innocent people for your own interest is criminal, encouraging any form of action that result in death of innocent people is equally guilty of murder.</p>

              <p><span>
              </span></p><p class="header"><br><span>SINGAPORE: The People's Association (PA) turns 50 next year and chairman Lim Boon Heng has called for new ways to reach out to more residents. <br><br>Mr Lim, speaking at a grassroots seminar on Sunday, said using technology is one way to engage more youths and foster social cohesion. <br><br>Singapore today is becoming an increasingly diverse and complex society, with people of different races, cultures and nationalities living together, and these differences can divide the nation. <br><br>"I think in recent times, we have seen people becoming more religious. There's nothing wrong with that. But if each of us, in our own religion, (shut) ourselves (within it), then we narrow the common space among Singaporeans," said Mr Lim, who is also a Minister in the Prime Minister's Office. <br><br>Against this backdrop, he said grassroots leaders must find new ways to engage residents, such as through the Internet and mobile phones. <br><br>But he stressed that the fundamental role of PA remains unchanged – that is, to promote racial harmony, social cohesion and national resilience. <br><br>Mr Lim also spoke about reaching out to new audiences and said he hoped that more successful Singaporeans would give not just their money, but also their time. <br><br>This would give them a better understanding of problems that the disadvantaged face and hopefully, would result in more programmes to help this group of people. <br><br>Another area of focus is the youths. The PA Youth Movement is the largest youth organisation in Singapore. <br><br>Mr Lim said more could be done to help young people develop a common identity and understand the fundamental values behind Singapore's success, such as meritocracy and multi-racialism. <br><br>He also urged grassroots leaders to examine the effectiveness of their programmes and organise them in a way that facilitates what he calls "meaningful" interaction among residents. <br><br>He added that grassroots leaders would also need to network with other community and professional partners. <br><br>"If we are to move beyond being just event organisers to becoming facilitators and connectors, we will need to develop critical skill-sets in our staff and volunteers," Mr Lim said. </span></p>
              <p class="header"> </p>
              <p class="header"><span>Lim Boon Heng calls Singapore multi-racialist. How multi-racialist can it be? I thought it's just for the Chinese, Malays, Indians, Eurasians and other Muslim minorities to live in?</span></p>
              <p class="header"><span>Did we really shut ourselves in our own religious groups?</span></p>
              <p class="header"><span>Not really what! I still see Chinese, Malays and Indians interacing together in harmony, especially at our local grassroot events.</span></p>
              <p class="header"><span>And what about "nationalities living together"? Unless he says that Racial Harmony Day is for the Viets, Pinoys, Burmeses and Thais as well. This is still not portrayed in local media when it comes to Nationalistic TV commercials for example.</span></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Rethinking Policies, Language Of Ethnicity </strong></p>
              <p>But there is debate beyond the rhetoric. For years, critics have suggested a re-examination of China's Soviet-style system of "autonomous zones" and affirmative action for Tibetans, Uighurs and other minorities.</p>
              <p>Retired Nanjing University professor Wang Yingguo argues that these policies have actually made it harder for minorities to develop a Chinese identity.</p>
              <p>"The general trend of the Chinese nation has been for assimilation. But the establishment of these autonomous zones has created an artificial separation between races and locked in their differences," he said.</p>
              <p>Wang and other critics also suggest updating the language of ethnicity. Chinese use the term <em>minzu</em> to mean both "ethnic group" and "nation." In fact, China has been a multiethnic empire for centuries.</p>
              <p>But until about 100 years ago, Chinese saw their nation as limited to the Han ethnic group. Tibetans, Uighurs, Manchus and other ethnic groups were not considered Chinese. Wang says these concepts remain muddled.</p>
              <p>"<strong>We say that China has 56 ethnic groups. But our national anthem refers to 'the Chinese ethnic group.</strong>' So what do we mean by ethnicity? It's a mess," he said.</p>

              <p>Racial Harmony is for Singapore's races. Immigrants especially those post-1965 should not be compulsory. It should be optional. If any Viet or Pinoy wants to integrate into Singapore society, then ask the women to marry the Singapore men lor. Then this is called integration!</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Rethinking Policies, Language Of Ethnicity</strong></p>
              <p>But there is debate beyond the rhetoric. For years, critics have suggested a re-examination of China's Soviet-style system of "autonomous zones" and affirmative action for Tibetans, Uighurs and other minorities.</p>
              <p>Retired Nanjing University professor Wang Yingguo argues that these policies have actually made it harder for minorities to develop a Chinese identity.</p>
              <p>"The general trend of the Chinese nation has been for assimilation. But the establishment of these autonomous zones has created an artificial separation between races and locked in their differences," he said.</p>
              <p>Wang and other critics also suggest updating the language of ethnicity. Chinese use the term <em>minzu</em> to mean both "ethnic group" and "nation." In fact, China has been a multiethnic empire for centuries.</p>
              <p>But until about 100 years ago, Chinese saw their nation as limited to the Han ethnic group. Tibetans, Uighurs, Manchus and other ethnic groups were not considered Chinese. Wang says these concepts remain muddled.</p>
              <p>"<strong>We say that China has 56 ethnic groups. But our national anthem refers to 'the Chinese ethnic group.</strong>' So what do we mean by ethnicity? It's a mess," he said.</p>

              <p>China will see itself going thru the difficulties of containing racial harmony since opening it door. Communism is no more a force to control it. They are facing what the Americans are facing in the last century where blacks and chinese are slaves and a far class below the white. What the chinese will be facing more in future will be much worst then what the american does in the earlier last century.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And since modernisation, china have gone lax on religion issue, it allows temples, churches and mosques to flourish, that can lead to membership struggle and different perspective views that only encourage more anger and oppression. And for decades, the leader rule their country base on communism will find it hard to understand and control racisism issues. They will not have the skill and system to govern over it.</p>

              <p>but don't blame the school or the government for many in Singapore who lost their heritage and culture. HK chinese came under the brits for 150 years but they are still very much Chinese.</p>
              <p>On  the other hand, in this era of globalization, people are influenced by other culture through the net and tv, without knowing the language. disneyland came right into france, but they are not many micky mouse in france, but many singaporean grow up donald duck. many accept imported culture when they hardly speak the language.</p>
              <p>Many Singaporean lost their culture to not because of they had to speak mandarin, they became banana because they are not strong in their own culture and they dont value their heritage. </p>
              <p>Obviously the government fails in getting singaporean to speak their mother tongue, especially the chinese. we don't have malay family who speak only english and nothing else.</p>
              <p> it is about time Chinese singaporean realize that it is not the choice between english and mandarin or any dialects. We can have english, mandarin, malay and chinese dialects...

              <p><br>Among other things.....<br><br>Upon Singapore's integration with Malaysia, UMNO and PAP have made agreement not to interfere onto each other electorates. <br><br>Prior to the race riots, both UNMO and PAP had breached this agreement. UMNO had formed a political wing in Singapore and PAP had made inroad into Malaysia with the likes of left-wing candidates, Devan Nair and others.  <br><br>PAP realised that it was leading its Chinese majority Singaporeans down the road of second class citizenship. This was made worse by the merger referendum which the PAP urged citizens to join, espounding the benefits of merger.<br><br>At that moment, the only way PAP's vision of Malaysian's Malaysia can be realised was thru the ballot box - not here in Singapore but inroad into Malaysia.<br> <br>UNMO would have seen this as an assault on both fronts - cropping Chinese encirclement and menacing communist threat.<br><br>Also, the UNMO's political wing in Singapore were of racial based, of racial agenda. </p>

              <p><br>I am unsure of your claim that LKY agreed to UMNO race-based policy. To be fair, it was an era of double-dealing and more dealing. <br><br>My reading up of LKY is that he was not a race-agenda person but a power-agenda person. He envisaged a federation Malaysia with power sharing scheme that of a Malay Prime Minister and a Chinese Vice Prime Minister.<br><br>He failed to realised that not everyone viewed power in the same light as him.<br><br>Ah Chia, I just want the younger generation of Singaporean not to be so naive as to believe that race harmony is simply singing songs and embracing each others.</p>
