              <p>Read about the "headscarf martyr", she was called "terrorist" and "slut" when she asked her neighbour to make way for her son to go on the swings in a playground in Germany, and she was later killed by him in court.</p>
              <p>Her husband while trying to help her was shot in court by the guards, because they thought that as long as he wasn't blond, he must be the attacker!  </p>
              <p>Is such hatred and division sew by the government? blood is the same, but body is different, in skin color, in the clothing that go on it, the language that come out of it and the thinking behind the skull.</p>
              <p>reading the threads on FT and FW, I wont' be surprised somebody some young true blue singaporeans would attack some arabs, prc chinese, indian, pinoy or vietnamese for nothing.</p>
              <p>The chinese says, a drop in temperature overnight will not form a 3 feet thick of ice.</p>
              <p>don't know what we can do for iran, china, north korea, germany, ...or anywhere else, but surely there must be something many of us can do by giving a balanced view to avoid "sowing hatred and division among the different races, different religion, FT/local, immigrant/ true blue....IN SINGAPORE."</p>

              <p>I find it weird if people of Vietnamese, Burmese, Thai or Filipino descent were to participate in our local grassroots organisations. They can help as foreigners but not as locals. Furthermore, I don't think there is regulation that blogs should not speak ill of these races.</p>

              <p>Cultural difference, including ethnicity and religious differences, is also very different from political difference and government rules.</p>
              <p>Change the government in NK the people will have freedom, but a new government in myanmar may not guarantee no discrimination against the karen minority. Japan can change their government n times, but an alien will remain an alien.</p>
              <p>The american guards fired at the american students at the kent state university, the south korea military fired at the citizen of guangju, the thai army fired at students demonstrators in Bangkok...  Would a different indian government acted differently from Indira who ordered the Indian army to fire on the sikhs defending the golden temple? I do not agree with the governments of any of the countries mentioned, but do not be too hasty to conclude that only certain countries would "shoot their own daughters and sons."</p>
              <p>The riots in Singapore and Malaysia were started by the different races, were that something done by the government?</p>
              <p>the incident in urumuqi was a spillover from an incident from quangzhou over jobs vacancy, nothing to do with some people being minority or muslims. </p>
              <p>Singapore was never, is not and will ever be viewed as a chinese state, by Chinese Singaporean, nor the PRC Chinese, except those who don't know the difference.</p>
              <p>and this kind of ignorance is usually the reason why differences are exaggerated, distorted and twisted causing disharmony and clashes, and the blame is put on the government.</p>

              <p><span>Freedoms are intangible relatives, we subscribe to a system of electing our officials but we don't subject to deadly forces by the govt that we elected. And the govt that we elect are subjected to answering to its Law and people.</span></p>

              <p>Facts, inferences, lies, exaggeration, prejudice....are all bundled in one package called news, and is given through all kinds of media. It blinds and suffocate you if you are unable to differentiate the differences.</p>
              <p>there were underlying current before mumbai were attacked, before 911, before the wallstreets fat cats ran away with billions of $... what kind of actions could have been taken to protect innocent civilians from such deadly forces, physical or financial. Who make the call on what are the necessary actions, include the level of forces involved. that is the task of the government official whom we elected, to tackle those who take up arms, who abuse freedom for their own agenda and pocket, and these people are also citizens!</p>
              <p>so what are you witnessing?  "govt willing to use of force to justify their control over its people in the name of state interest?"  If you are referring to the unrest in Xinjiang, then you are either totally misinformed or you had chosen to ignore the fact, just because this happens in China.</p>
              <p>Should the Chinese government allows the two ethnic races to attack each other?  should they act otherwise? are actions taken by government to control them, from rioting, yes!</p>
              <p>Did the two ethnic races fight because of religion, cultural difference, or unhappy over distribution of wealth and job opportunities?</p>
              <p>there are all kinds of people, the law abiding ones, those who take law in their own hands, those who are blind and prejudice, for and against the government, .... together we are ONE PEOPLE from whom the government should protect? NO!</p>

              <p>This topics is about intergration. At current rate the PRC govt will have to terminates the entire ethnic to intergrate the entire region, do you know how big is the area that stretch from Tibet and Xinjiang?  So don't you think it is necessary to start having 2nd look at ultimately are the govt social program working?</p>

              <p>So what is the difference between xinjiang and tibet, one is muslim minority and the others buddists, one is populated by uyghurs and hans, the others by tibetan and hans. You can also find other minorities in both region, and in other region like gansu, ninxia...</p>
              <p>What is similar, the ones who took to the streets are called mob, there were tibetan mob, hans mob and uyghurs mob. when they killed, blood is red.</p>
              <p>What happened in xinjiang today is a result of two uyghurs minority killed in a dispute in a factory in guangzhou over job opportunities. I don't know what social intergration problem there is, but the uyghurs are free to practice their muslim faith, the tibetan their brand of buddism, and there are 30 millions muslim in China, why do you see there is a need to "terminates the entire ethnic to intergrate the entire region"? this is very strong, evil, uncalled  for accusation.</p>
