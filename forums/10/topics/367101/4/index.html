              <p>When LKY has no guts to even stand by his words given to a small fly, it shows that LKY try to walk like a man 6' 3'' tall - when he is only a 6 footer with a small 3" tool compared to CSJ 5' 7" physique.</p>
              <p>This piece of information should probably light your brains up more then your ability to appreciate what CSJ's doctorate degree is about.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>The court room proceedings were about LKY stating publicly that he will allow CSJ to ask any questions - instead he had to hide behind his lawyer to arrange for a shorter time allowed for proceedings to determine the outcome.</p>
              <p>There is a difference between stating boastfully in a loud public manner, and refusing to do what one has boasted.</p>
              <p>I wonder where did the PAP politicians in Singapore learn about keeping their words, when they believe themselves to be men of honor.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Do you think that you are in anybody's eye ?</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, the photos of LKY at the end of the day in court did not show LKY to be what you claimed to be. Were you hallucinating ?</p>

              <p>When LKY has no guts to even stand by his words given to a small fly, it shows that LKY try to walk like a man 6' 3'' tall - when he is only a 6 footer with a small 3" tool compared to CSJ 5' 7" physique.</p>
              <p>This piece of information should probably light your brains up more then your ability to appreciate what CSJ's doctorate degree is about.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The court room proceedings were about LKY stating publicly that he will allow CSJ to ask any questions - instead he had to hide behind his lawyer to arrange for a shorter time allowed for proceedings to determine the outcome.</p>
              <p>There is a difference between stating boastfully in a loud public manner, and refusing to do what one has boasted.</p>
              <p>I wonder where did the PAP politicians in Singapore learn about keeping their words, when they believe themselves to be men of honor.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Do you think that you are in anybody's eye ?</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, the photos of LKY at the end of the day in court did not show LKY to be what you claimed to be. Were you hallucinating ?</p>

              <p>The court also allow a person to remain silent if he do not wish to answer it, and the court do also allow a qualified representative to answer on a person behalf, why need to talk and answer to those stupid question, just like if I asked you a stupid question, i think you also got no mood to answer and let your lawyer who is paid to do his/her job.</p>

              <p> Are you capable of reading his mind - to know that <em>"he dun even need to present himself or talk to CSJ"</em> ?</p>
              <p>When a person has things to hide, it is best to keep his mouth shut, even as he has loudly boasted that he is prepared to face any intensive questioning.</p>
              <p>Do you think that CSJ can be treated like an ant - when he has already raised such a high profile of himself ?</p>
              <p>The risks of doing more silly things towards CSJ will only bring worse attention to LKY and the PAP for any acts that reflect their abuse of political power.</p>
              <p>Even those in power want to keep their face intact when their reputation is tarnished.</p>

              <p>It looks like you need to understand more then the procedural matters of the court.</p>
              <p>When a question is relevant to the proceedings - whether or not it is seen to be stupid, it will still need to be addressed.</p>
              <p>If your mood require you to abstain from giving any answers to a repeated series of questions - the conclusion is that either you are evading from getting at the truth due to your own guilt, or that you stupidity in the proceedings can be concluded.</p>
              <p>A lawyer is also an Officer of the Court, and is required to assist the Court to get at the truth of the proceedings, but when the client is determined to live out a lie - it is the duty of his lawyer to protect his client without committing perjury to himself.</p>
