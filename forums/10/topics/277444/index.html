            <div class='col-md body'>PAP's political or governing philosophy is in the final analysis despite all the claims to the contrary is "to tax, recover costs of governing with whatever means at their disposal in the name of avoiding welfarism and hoard taxes, as surpluses enabling them to do as they like like buying votes with material benefits which perpetuate their rule.<br><br>Opposition parties do not yet to come up with any governing philosophy.<br><br>If oppositions are to to take over the rule from the PAP they should make known their governing philosophy such as " to tax reasonably to provide for basic needs and services without profiteering on such services and maximize whatever tax monies they collect and surpluses created to benefit the people e.g. building up their retirement funds, medical needs and lowering costs of living and creating jobs for the citizens."<br><br>Monies spent on foreigners and foreign investments under such a governing philosophy will be eventually returned in the form of endowment funds to support various needs of the people, job creations and lowering costs of living or doing business"<br><br>In this way citizens will be looked after and monies from taxes and surpluses will be put to good use where the mouth is instead of being spent on extravagant projects, self-rewards or lost in overseas unwarranted self-glory ventures like shin corp or suzhou which do not truly benefit the people.<br><br>Given this alternative governing philosophy, any opposition party wishing to form the government on such agenda will easily accepted by the people who will no doubt support such wisdom.<br><br>When the day comes, there is no doubt that PAP will lose its power which is basically one of enriching themselves and the elites and talking about rewarding talents and keeping themselves indirectly.<br><br>Such an opposition will find its thinking miles ahead with ability to energize and motivate people as they will treat people as the centre and all policies and will put monies and taxes to good use instead of rewarding only the rich and controlling people's freedom and undermining democracy to perpetuate their self-centred control philosophy.</div>
