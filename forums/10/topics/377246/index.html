              <p>are allowed to work in SG. One of my frens who works for recruitment says that many of them have dubious qualification applying for jobs..These idiots have one advantage - No reservist NS.</p>

              <p><br>To be fair, a 10% pay cut is not going to hurt the Malaysian, Indonesia and Filipino as hard as it would hurt a Singaporean.</p>
              <p>They're already earning twice more at least  (For the malaysian) then they could back home. That has always been the issue.</p>
              <p>Plus, there's comparisons. The Malaysian, Indonesian and Filipinos have to put up with worse conditions back home (Long travel to work time for the Filipino) so working till 8 wouldn't be just as bad .</p>

              <p>As a Singaporean engineer with a good degree, I would choose to work in a MNC rather than the govt sector or SME.</p>
              <p>Might be lesser pay than govt sector, or same pay as SME, but much more free time and leeway...Furthermore, any possible OT pay from SMEs is still definitely less than what I can get from teaching tuition outside.</p>
              <p>Conclusion: Nothing much to gain by working in an SME, and more to lose.</p>

              <p>To be fair, while they earn twice more than they could back home, they are paying twice more for spending here than they would back home.</p>
              <p>If their family is back home, their spending power is twice more, but they enjoy it at the expense of not having them by their side every night.</p>
              <p>Ultimately, it is what they, and we have spend as pure necessities for ourselves, how much more we have for our families, and how much more we have as saving for the future.</p>
              <p>When 10% is cut, they are as hard hit as we are, if the money is spent here; but if the money is sent back home, their family get hit twice more.</p>

              <p>Your example seems to me to only badly affect those who live in a way that their salary is completely utilized, leaving nothing to savings.</p>
              <p>My argument is that say the foreign employee and I both save 500 dollars a month. What he can do with that 500 dollars saved and sent back home exceed what i could buy (In the case of my Chinese colleague, at least 2-3 times more day to day commodities) </p>
              <p>If, at the end of 10 years we both save 100k(Given room for raises and promotions), he could go back and get a decent sized home and car, with some leftovers. While the 100k i have couldn't even pay off 50% of my housing and car loans.</p>
              <p>When they get 10% paycut, their family don't neccessarily get hit twice more. They may not even have to cut back on anything if they weren't blowing what they received every month.  </p>
              <p>Your maths is logical, but it doesn't add up when you compare exchange rate and the general costs of things where these foreigners come from.</p>
              <p>Don't get me wrong, i like the idea of having foreigners to compete freely and share experiences. But that is only with the condition that we could compete on equal grounds, right now Singaporean males are starting off with a disadvantage.</p>

              <p>of course, maths doesn't take into consideration the years he spent alone in a foreign land.</p>
              <p>Last time my friend went to Dubai to work and after 3 years he came back and paid up his HDB. Good thing he didn't gamble due to boredom.</p>
              <p>My sister's maid have been working in Singapore for the last twelve years and she really couldn't feel how her daughters grew up, but is glad that she could sent enough money home, and were hoping that they spend it wisely. She is lucky, so far. Her daughter graduated as a nurse, and is now looking to work in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Having said all that, these people after working here for several years, it is really difficult for them to go back and live happily ever after in their villages.</p>
