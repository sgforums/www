Singapore would have hit an unemployment rate of 0% if every currently unemployed Singaporean aged 15 and above takes up whatever "low-end" jobs that are available. But even if that happens, it doesn't mean the government is super-efficient, but rather that Singaporeans have become so desperate to feed themselves but didn't know how to rob a bank, protest or fight for their own rights.<br></div>
