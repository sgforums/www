            <div class='col-md body'>The rise of China is an undeniable fact in our times. Her strong GDP and economy have been consistently on the rise, putting it on par with US economy or even stands outperforming her in the next few good years to come, this is assuming no major government reshufflement or unforeseen events. As a result, countries in Asia Pacific region can hope to achieve vibrant economy by jumping on the bandwagon of a rising China. Singapore in this aspect cannot afford to miss this opportunity or risk having a stagnating economy. At this stage it is good to know that any political instability or a slight moment of hesitation might risk turning investors off while we see the rest of Asean propel themselves forward we cannot afford to tread behind.<br><br>Singapore, a small island not endowed with any natural resources is very fortunate to be able to reach first world standard in a short span of time since independence. Three possibly reasons for this. Firstly, we have an uncorrupted, efficient adminstrators cum leaders to get us to where we are today. Honesty, intergrity and brilliant foresight are hallmark attributed to our leaders from all over the globe without failed. Secondly, her people whom are highly educated or highly skills, whether to manage or to handle sophiscated machinery, is not a problem at all. Singaporeans also have the benefits of being bilingual which open up a myriad of job opportunities either at home or abroad. Thirdly, last but not the least is being an 'Asia Hub' where Singapore can afford to act as a link to facilitate China entry into European or US markets. All these factors are non-exhaustive, yet, are crucial to attracts investments or to invite company seeking to reallocate or to startup here.<br><br>Having said all that, I too is fully aware of the social negative impact of banking on the China wagon. One of the area of concern I have is the gap between the rich and the poor would continue to rift further apart. Although it can be said that the creation of jobs, jobs and more jobs by a rising China or the Casino in time to come would compensate it, however it still lacks in providing citizens a chance to fully excel their potentials or to better seize the opportunity of the China market. In this aspect, my concern is that if the government intend to see China as a new direction to heed, future funding and helps must be adequate provided for risk-takers or socially lower income families as I expect the pace to be quicken up then before. A suggestion would be funding for risk-takers may include entreprenuership funds for SMEs or startup and social welfare funds for poorer families.<br><br>In conclusion, faced right in front of us is a rising China, an opportunity too good of a chance to be miss for all Singaporeans or for the nation as a whole. Yet behind us are a group of low income earners or families hardly able to catch up with the pacing. It is really a contest between the socialists and the economic opportunitists whom both groups served different philosophy and groups. The rise of China is a critical issue whereby I feel that we should all look beyond not only checks and balances or balance of power in parliament as determinant factors but instead to think broadly in our nation's direction to heed.<br><br>I myself is a heartlander, if I may take a stand, I would humbly say that we Singaporeans should take advantage of the rise of China, yet at the same time the government must make doubly sure that the markers are in place to help citizens faced with hardships. Then I would say: "let's move ahead together."<br><br>Your vote matter. Vote wisely.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi blazon,<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by blazon:<br><br>So what went wrong???<br>a) MNCs are not going to stay here for long, when our cost increases.<br>b) Our GLCs, born out of Government-related biz and often run by Scholars/Statemens, rely on Ready biz, and are really not True Breed Entrepenuers!!!<br>So when competition arises, they could not rise to the challenge!!! (You have to read more on real GLCs facts and figures)<br><br>=&gt;That is what is happening now with the rising competition from China!!!<br>MNCs start moving out + our GLCs had got so fat and comfortable, and could not to rise to the occasion!!!</blockquote><strong>I feel that it is not justifiable to pinpoint at the government. The rise of China as you are aware of, offer low labour costs and overheads to attract MNCs to shift their production over this is a fact around the world not strictly in Singapore. However, to my limited knowledge, we can counteract this by a three-pronged approach.<br>1. Free labour market. (tradeoff - wages)<br>2. Continuing education and training for higher skills of our people to be first class workers or managers.<br>3. Political stability. Peace, law and order.<br><br>The aim to breed entrepreneurs can come in the form of fundings to aid in capital startup or in investing in setting up an entrepreneur school. The scholars can continued to manage the GLCs however, your mentioned of rising to the occasion, ie taking opportunity of the China market can come in the form of investments not neccessarily in physical assets abroad. Citizens can following suit to invest or trade in shares of these highly administrated GLCs.</strong><br><br><blockquote><br>And here u see something else is even more Wrong!!!<br>=&gt;Our Past Model with Reliance on GLCs, MNCs and Strong Government providing us the right direction, with no-support for Private Sectors (yes, PAP do not like private sectors in the past), high-paying Elites, and a Terribly non-Creative Education System etc had Literally Killed the Private Sector!!!<br><br>There is No Culture of Entrepeneurship!?! No culture of Creativity and Innovation?<br><br>=&gt;Which means PAP had been Wrong!!!<br>In other words, right now, Spore is infact in Serious Trouble!!!<br><br>Maybe u can say luckily, our huge reserves from taxing/GLCs profits during good times had been big enough to cushion the impact.<br>Question is how long can we? when PAP had got it So Wrong in the Past!!!!<br><br>=&gt;Another question arise, how did we end up with such high cost within such short period???<br><br>And the overall question now is how did we End up with All these???<br>I feel: Flawed Policies and Beliefs!!!<br><br>In other words the PAP had been operating on Flawed Model and Beliefs!!!<br>Not just the economy model, but the whole Society system!!!<br>Well, infact many businessmen and oppositions had spoken up against this in the past only to be fallen on deafs ears!?<br>No Wonder many educated, thinkers are so angry!?<br>No wonder we need a Casino!?<br>PAP had screwed up BIG TIME.</blockquote><strong>Your argument for a vibrant economy brought about by the growth of private enterprises is not without merits. However, one have got to understand the limitation and role of the person in office. The government can provide her citizens with ample opportunities and aids but ultimately the onus lies in citizens whether they are risk-takers or not. And it is good to know that not all people are cut out for business even if the government can provide funds. The culture of entrepreneurship, creativity and innovation seem to come from citizens themselves again. Creativity and innovation should come in the form of anything, never a subject to be taught following the syllabus.<br>The threat and fast pace of globalisation with the surging price of oil inflate prices more than anything else. The direct tax of GST of 5% can only contribute a marginal amount but for indirect taxes, I wouldnt say it is wrong to tax people who own cars or luxury goods to bring about social benefits for the lower-income familes. </strong><br><br><blockquote>So, are you going to allow them to continue this "Unchecked" and only realise another mistake after another 15-20years???<br>Especially now, they are Still operating on the primary High-paying Elite + Foreigners model !!!<br>And there are also other issues why PAP is far from perfect.<br>What about those lower-paid people?!! Had the lax foriegn imports policies helping them??? I think its only making it worse.<br>And there is also the issue of manufacturing and R&amp;D etc etc.<br><br></blockquote><strong>I am not buying the argument of voting someone into parliament for checks and balances. The elected MP job should be to solve global issues and care for the welfarism of the citizens. It should never be the case of someone holding office doing nothing only checks. May I suggest that the whole political system can actually be reform to achieve checks/balances and transparency without the interference of a nanny in parliament. </strong><br><br><blockquote>One article I like is on Taiwan,<br>which I like to see as "A Country Run by its People":<br>Beauty of Taiwan Lies in its Cracks. <a href="http://www.billstimson.com/writing/taiwan%27s_cracks.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.billstimson.com/writing/taiwan%27s_cracks.htm</a></blockquote><strong>I find it particularly hilarious that people generally prefer living a life over the edge rather than peace and stability and seeing their MPs making a clown of themselves in the parliament.</strong><br><br><blockquote>B) OUr Society: Basic Democracy, Human Rights and Compassion.<br>A Society is made up of Human Fresh and Blood and Spirits, with basic Human Rights and Choices. Not just $$$ and Jobs.<br>Do we have that in on GE?? Do we have that in our media?<br>We are treated like dummies, because we are Non-Elites.<br><br>Moreover, our system had been operating based on primary $$$ alone, that $$$ can solve everything.<br>But can it solve emotional, psychological hardships?<br>We now have more and more children suicide rate and<br>more cases of children psychological/stress related issues.<br>Something is very wrong with our society !!!<br><br>Also, I personally believe that Democracy, Freedom, and a Society without Fear,  will breeds Creativity, Innovation, Entrepenuership, and thus, Competiveness. <span style="color: red;">Repression will only worsen it.</span><br><br>Its all inter-related.<br>Our System is flawed. We have created a High-Stress society !?!<br>Our country maybe rich, but many poor people and kids are suffering.<br><br>Similiarly, oppositions and public had complained of these and gave suggestions to the government before, but on deaf ears.<br>Are we going to allow that to continue to happened???</blockquote><strong>Yes. The society building blocks should be inter-human relationship. Life is not all about money. I fully share my sentiment with you. But a fact we cant deny is that Singapore is a city place not a village. Stress is everywhere even down to a farmer worrying about harvesting period. The agenda of ordinary citizens like myself is to fill my own stomach or my family, our concern is not so much on the powers dispute or balance of power in the parliament. A point to note is that this does not means that ordinary Singaporeans are oblivious to politics. It is just that peace and stability ranked high in our priorty in our lives.<br><br>I am bewildered by your statement highlighted in red reflect upon helping the poors yet at the same time hopping onto the China bandwagon. There is no full win win situation here if you think logically. The only help that the economic opportunitists can offer if elected into office is the measure in draft form which I have suggested to help the lower-income groups as mentioned in my article. It MUST be in place if we are going to quicken up and seize the China pie. Socialists on the other hands may be able to halt time and allows the lower-income groups to play catch-up but risk stagnanting the whole nation economy.<br>Face with the opportunity right before us, my take is to seize it but advocate measures so that all Singaporeans ripe the fruits of success together, making sure that no one falls behind and moving foward as one Singapore.</strong>  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Singaporeans should stop relying too much on the government to solve their personal economic problem. If the rise of China give rise to business opportunities, let enterprising Singaporeans seize them. The government can only provide a stable macroeconomic and political environment.<br><br>The MPs' role in parliament is not about policy-making. He is there primarily to debate policies and laws to be passed. If he cannot articulate the concerns of his people and does not have the intellect to question government policies, then he is not a good MP. An MP should not be a fool. He should also not be a yes-man. No party has a monopoly on passion to serve and intellect. Just like economic competition will lead to stronger businesses, some political competition will lead to better policies.<br><br>The GE is about your future. You have a choice.</div>
