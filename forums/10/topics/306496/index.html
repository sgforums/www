              <p>Buy cheaper bread and cheaper rice. LOL</p>
              <p>Why not reduce the costs of imports first. Anyway, it's not as if bakeries here sell bread cheap. Ever since Breadtalk is a hit, a whole line of similar shops opened, jacking the prices of bread up. Traditionally, it has always been these few types of bread and the costs are relatively low.</p>
              <p>After Breadtalk hits here, you look at the prices of bread. 1 loaf of bread cost a freaking $1++, with some hitting a few dollars. Eating gold? Eating for health? I don't even remember wheat bread costing some much 10 years ago, for the health conscious. Now wheat bread costs nearly $2 or even higher.</p>
              <p>Even the white bread sold in kopitiam (recognizable, no skin one) costs at least $1 now. I used to buy them at 80 cents or less.</p>
