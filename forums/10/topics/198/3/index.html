Men can do it as well or maybe even better especially during Alert Red seasons. One thing to be noted though, Unit sergents tend to be more integrated with their men while BMT sergents are just as bad as some green horn who pass out of OCS and think the world of himself...Could be due to the experience of the men that they are during which results in the difference in attitude.<br></div>

Each passing out officer is asked to select what vocation he wants upon ACPC i.e command, instructional or admin.

However i would stress that the general mentality is that BMT officers enjoy a relatively easier life compared to unit personel; this belief is already rampant in OCS. Possible reasons include:<br><br>a. BMT training has a routine programme to follow which becomes monotonous after new batches replace the ones passing out .<br><br>b. They train with greater levels of safety as for most recruits, this is probably their first time in weapons handling. If there's been a training accident, the entire school "enjoys" a TSO safety week where training (in my opinion) is "downgraded" to little more than going through the motions.<br><br>c. They have fixed training schedules and a standard syllabus to follow - in short almost like an educational centre.<br><br>In a unit, the training regime is prepared with ATEC in mind. Progressive and realistic training is just another day in army boots. Getting injured is more then normal. Seriousness is emphasized by company comdrs and PCs. That means huge responsibilities for them as they answer not only for their safety but the training standards of the men in question.<br><br>Such a position is normally bestowed on a capable officer who has the potential to handle the difficulties and uncertainties involved, maybe an SOM if u will.<br><br>Perhaps its ideal to expect equal standards and committment in BMT officer's conducting training compared to those in unit life (thereby the officers in BMT shd be of equal standards to their counterparts in units)so that presumebly the good work started in BMT can be continued. However as we all know, this is not the case.<br><br>The result of this is that newly-posted personnel in units normally get a culture shock.<br><br>[This message has been edited by controversay (edited 24 May 2002).]</div>
