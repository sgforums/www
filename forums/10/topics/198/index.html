Tear up the insides and the person cannot even hold up his bowels. he will be bleeding as well as shitting in his pants. when the rest of guys see him squealing like a stuck pig, rest assured, the the psychological damage is far efficient than him being dead or shot in the leg.<br><br>If it was a gun crew comdr or tank comdr, a head shot is ideal.<br><br>"In war, the deadliest thing is still one, well placed shot"<br>Gunnery Sgt Carlos N.

            <div class='col-md body'>No offence to all officers..but i tink the only thing in OCS that is more shiong than SISPEC's is their Jungle Confidence Course.<br>If u dont believe, juz ask those SISPEC crossover to OCS ppl..they'll tell u OCS is like heaven compared to SISPEC..<br>It not not be juz due to the physical rigous but also the culture of SISPEC..at least while SISPEC was still in Pasir Laba..<br>As my BMT sgt once told me.."SISPEC is juz like OCS squeezed into half the time"<br>I shall mention again, officers out there dont get offended..juz my point of view..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I don't think there can ever be a non-biased opinion about which comdr course is tougher or not.<br><br>Ask an officer and he will swear his course is tougher than SiSPEC's<br><br>Ask a specialist and he will also swear his course is tougher than OCS's<br><br>But i have made an observation that specialists that crossed over to senior term tend to achieve top 10% of the course. Be it sword winners or platoon top.<br><br>But this was back in 1985. i'm not so sure abt now. But i'm in favour of SISPEC being located in Tekong.

Being a spec means u are effectively the ground level commander, having to make some level of decisions on the field itself, as opposed to the deeper planning and forecasting method used by officers.<br>To make it to SISPEC, u have to pass SOC, IPPT, range in BMT as u'll not have time to built up on these fundamentals of soldiership in the hectic schedule of SISPEC training.<br>The change in mentality from "sotong and follow orders" recruit to "tink practical and make pressured decisions" SISPEC trainee is drastic and requires some adjustment.<br>Hope u get a better idea of SISPEC...."school of infantry, specialists ,<br>here we come, soldiers from every creed and race........"</div>

Go to OETI, eat talk and idle for 3 months and get out. Eventually will get 3SG also. How long you take will depend on your vocation and qualifications. If you're a poly engineering grad and get to become a vehicle mech, will get 3SG in 6 months, and pay is as good as or even better any cheong sua cheong hai SISPEC alumni.<br><br>And don't let anyone tell you that a mechanic 3SG is less important in war than a comabat spec.

What it means is that good combat leaders should never ever neglect logistics in favour of tactics alone. Wars have been won or lost on logistics.<br><br>I don't look down on combat vocs, and I never said that it was easy or amteurish. In fact I admire them for the hell they go through. What the saying meant, and I fully agree is that amateurs study only tactics, while the real proffessionals will look at the logistical side of things as well.</div>
