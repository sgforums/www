That is why my first officer succeeded where his successor failed. He gave his specs and men the respect and incentive they deserved and everyone pulled along with him, while giving them the trust they knew and could do their jobs. But then, isn't that true for any organisation?<br><br>I dunno if thats how it'll be like in war, but then hopefullt I'll never get to find out.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ducati, Nope.  Going in soon though.  Half of me is considering becoming a career soldier.  Heh.<br><br>Which is why I need to find out how the Army runs its people from the inside.<br><br>By the way, I heard some people comment on our specs and troops that have gone thru sispec.  They told me that we champed the US Marines in most aspects.  How true is that?</div>
