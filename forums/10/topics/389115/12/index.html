              <p>Dont know why singmen or sggals have to do with pap talk. I cam back to sg for LNY and I feel really good with the sun and sea. Unfortunately, i lost my way to my home when I was taken by a taxi uncle who cannot speak Chinese or English. What wrong with this place?</p>
              <p>I got into my estate and was stopped by an Indian security guide who insist me to alight from my cab and walk 200m to my home with my luggage. I almost got a fight with him and finally he relented when I treatened to call the police. How can I not be allowed to go into my estate when my IC shown I live there?</p>
              <p>When I finally got inside my estate I was confused if i got back to Singapore. I came to find out that I got from China to Singapore and ended at India. How could my estate with 1400 units have such a large Indian population that resemble little India? It was only 6 months since I left this place and why are there so many FTs now living here?Well, I console myself that we are a generous lot as ppl who could live in a pte estate must have been paid well for working in sg. They are probably those 'elite' that our government welcome into this country.</p>
              <p>I give up!!!! I dont know if there is ever a place call home for  I dont want to live forever in China, I want to come home but..............</p>
              <p>Maybe it is time for Indian to come to work in Sg, Singaporean to go to China...,and PRC to come to Sg. But wait..why should any country, not India or China for sure..welcome us the most stupid Singaporean to work in their country.</p>
              <p>The whole thing dont add up..what wrong with the government? even a stupid accountant like me know if debit and credit dont add up, it will not balance and the balance sheet will stink. More jobs in sg? or more foreigner in sg? The answer is obvious, just look around us!!!!!!!!!!</p>

              <p>Dont know why singmen or sggals have to do with pap talk. I cam back to sg for LNY and I feel really good with the sun and sea. Unfortunately, i lost my way to my home when I was taken by a taxi uncle who cannot speak Chinese or English. What wrong with this place?</p>
              <p>I got into my estate and was stopped by an Indian security guide who insist me to alight from my cab and walk 200m to my home with my luggage. I almost got a fight with him and finally he relented when I treatened to call the police. How can I not be allowed to go into my estate when my IC shown I live there?</p>
              <p>When I finally got inside my estate I was confused if i got back to Singapore. I came to find out that I got from China to Singapore and ended at India. How could my estate with 1400 units have such a large Indian population that resemble little India? It was only 6 months since I left this place and why are there so many FTs now living here?Well, I console myself that we are a generous lot as ppl who could live in a pte estate must have been paid well for working in sg. They are probably those 'elite' that our government welcome into this country.</p>
              <p>I give up!!!! I dont know if there is ever a place call home for  I dont want to live forever in China, I want to come home but..............</p>
              <p>Maybe it is time for Indian to come to work in Sg, Singaporean to go to China...,and PRC to come to Sg. But wait..why should any country, not India or China for sure..welcome us the most stupid Singaporean to work in their country.</p>
              <p>The whole thing dont add up..what wrong with the government? even a stupid accountant like me know if debit and credit dont add up, it will not balance and the balance sheet will stink. More jobs in sg? or more foreigner in sg? The answer is obvious, just look around us!!!!!!!!!!</p>
