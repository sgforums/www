              <p>singaporean need to view politics more of a process rather than an end...that is to say Don't think in terms of voting PAP completely out....but at the end of the day you want to have the abilities to influent the BILLS that pass in the parliment.</p>
              <p>So rather than saying a replacement but a more balance opposition party to distribute power within the parliment would be a desirable outcome. Or else we will see a thru  Train and nobody can stop them.  </p>

              <p>firstly, i wonder if most people understand the rationale behind the price hike in GST etc. i guess most people just care about the bread and butter on the table, seeing things with a myopic view and fail to think about the future?</p>
              <p>PAP does come out with some good policies( oh yea FYI, most of the important policies are unpopular,hence only a good government manage to carry them out), i have to admit this. but IMO, its the way they carry out the policies that is causes some 'sore eyes' among its people. nontheless, it still helps the economy.</p>
              <p>P.S.  do most people even think before they post? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>
