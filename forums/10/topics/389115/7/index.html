              <div class="quote_body">
              <p> </p>
              <p>Can the dark angel never change ?</p>
              <p>Only a Tart will forget the faces of its multiple sex partners and the sexual events after a few weeks - should anyone be surprised if you are not speaking from experience ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Do Singaporeans really forget about the last painful increase - even when the increase had been introduced in such minisicular portions ?</p>
              <p>Or is it not a fact that Singaporeans will find themselves trapped in the endless monthly cash bind when bills have to be paid - and suddenly find themselves having to tighten their belts yet again ?</p>
              <p>Has it not been a case that our money continue to drip out of our wallets like a dripping tap that empty a water tank over time ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Why will the angel avoid telling the truth, or is the angel preferring to soften the propaganda and promote the PAP's interest in a backhanded way ?</p>
              <p>Was the Singapore Government paid for their ability to tame the ground, or did the PAP pay themselves for cheating Singaporeans from the Truth ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Singapore Government got an easy job to govern Singapore as the PAP had fixed a clean sweep for themselves in Parliament - so as to be able to pass any legislations as they pleased - that will even disallow ONE person to hold a public protest about anything, let alone about the rising cost of living in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Unders such circumstances, can Singaporeans as a collective lot be reminded of what hit them over the last few months or years - when prices keep creeping up by 0.5 percent or 0.01 cent per unit consumed ?</p>
              <p>What does an angel know about the pain from price increases, when bills are settled by Daddy - and especially when the angel will not even remember the various sexual escapades with the multiple sex partners that she had ?</p>
              <p>Be assured, Singaporeans do remember the price increases when they have to force themselves to tighten their belts when cash is short before the next wage increase or cash rebate is received.</p>
              <p>Is it any wonder that this Government will return some cash at the end of each year - $200 to $400 per working person, only to milk more from the wallet - like the increase to property tax that wipe this returned amount at one go, and milk you more from the new price increases in utilities and transport fares ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Only one - who will forget the ecstacy given by a favored sex partner - will be able to forget anything - including the pain inflicted on oneself.</p>
              <p>Speak for yourself if you wish to be as escapist from reality, and do not attempt to speak for every other Singaporean who remembers.</p>

              <p>PAP mastered our typical Singaporeans psychological behavor very well, they know how to pull and release the string as and when needed. Recently, a big WOw Ha at my nearby coffeeshop started when those regular Uncles and Aunties got their rebates, beer clinging and seafood ordering was the joy of the day, even as i walked pass, they pull me in and invite me for food, "Xiao mei, lai lai..." , no more talking about transport increase, food increase, bills increase as they use to be.</p>
              <p>So, if you look at it, just a mere small amount of rebates can make Singaporeans forget all things of the past... i have no doubt, PAP had truly engaged a top psycharist in their domain.</p>

              <p>the government increases GST etc so as to curb the growing demand for resources. if the demand is growing faster than the supply, it will lead to inflation. and since sgp has no natural resources, such inflations are imported. then there is not much the government can do as they dont control the supply. hence they are trying to 'tame' the demand.</p>

              <p>But then when prices went down....why power supply bills never goes down, so are all the others including essential goods...</p>

              <p>Already,there are PAP minister get attacked by the public.</p>
              <p>Already,there are riots happening during general election period,after which the ppl know the election result of PAP winning again.This show that Singaporeans are capable of staging a riots n even revolts.</p>
              <p>Already,if u were to take a look at various internet forums,under politics column,the public are showing very high emotional anger of how PAP have mismanaging this country for years.And not letting any opposition party to really have a say in the parliament.Just 2 dieing seats in there.</p>
              <p>All this signs,show that there are really problems exist in years of PAP dictatorial ruling.So,if u dont let opposition enter the parliamentary gate in a considerable numbers,how are we n the PAP going to solve the problem?</p>

Please don't point fingers and put words into my mouth, be mature to know what is going on.    So childish.   You are just one of the many kiasu kiasi Singaporeans.    With people like you, PAP will behave worse than now and before if they get voted in again.</p>

              <p>the government increases GST etc so as to curb the growing demand for resources. if the demand is growing faster than the supply, it will lead to inflation. and since sgp has no natural resources, such inflations are imported. then there is not much the government can do as they dont control the supply. hence they are trying to 'tame' the demand.</p>
              <p>then some may ask,how is this fair to those lower income groups? now, the government uses the money they collect from tax and redistribute it to the lower income group as tax/gst rebates etc, hence trying to pull the income gap closer.</p>
              <p>hence i do not understand why people are complaining about hike in prices of this and that. does the government control a very big proportion of the price? the market out there is quite a 'free market' with little intervenetion. so why are the people pinning all the blame( in terms of price hike) on the government?</p>

              <p>Use GST to control inflation ?</p>
              <p>So, when there is inflation, increase GST and when there is deflation, decrease GST ? Do you see this is happening in Singapore ?</p>
              <p>The increase in GST will increase the cost of living and in turns this will lead to the demand for higher wages and higher cost of production and the increase in GST will also increase the input costs for the firms and this will in turn lead to higher cost of production and this will fuel inflation.</p>
              <p>The introduction of the GST is due mainly to the ageing population and hence the government shifts from direct taxation to indirect taxation to generate its tax revenue.</p>
              <p>The increase in GST from 5% to 7% is to generate tax revenue to finance the workfare scheme to help the lower income workers as these workers' wages are too low and unable to cope with the high cost of living.</p>

              <p><br> Also most of the foreign ministers know pap ministers very
              well.</p>
              <p>If a opposition party took over, I dont think foreign ministers
              will know them and also they will hold back everything and see how
              opposition flaring in spore. That will be the hardest time for
              spore and sporean.</p>
