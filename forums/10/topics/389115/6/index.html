              <p><br>so that they wake up this time round, the problem with Older singaporeans is they keep criticising the govt, but when i come to election, they will said "aiya, pap win one lah, no need to think so much lah" so it end up like a culture here, alway give up and said PAP wins, pap wins, no need to vote they also win. Like this give the young ones like us a very vague picture of what is going on...and in the end we also follow them, like father, like daughter.</p>

              <p>Very simply put it, when was the last time public transport prices increase, what was the reason behind it, and how much was increased, and what was the public reaction. ALL forgotton rite???</p>
              <p>That is why our govt has an easy job than most other govt, because they can make us forget and then out of nowhere rise prices of essential goods. And yet they are well paid ya...and paid not for rising prices, but they are paid for the ability to tame the ground and make us forget about the past increment in prices, only those minor cut are kept re- emphasized so that in the end you remember only those cut, but never the rising.</p>

              <p>what alternatives do you have, it is not like car alternator, when you can choose, there is simply no sound and proven capable oppositions. After 50 years of ruling, what you expect? change just because of cost of living? i dun think so, many are still able to cope up with the cost of living and yet save money for rainy days.</p>
              <p>People are not so naive to change for the sake of change, you put your family and life on the table to make a change, if you vote the wrong one, and that party wins, it can be worst than be good. Question is, why do we need to change? is our life in danger, is our foods in shortage, is there no jobs, is there no roof on top of you, is there no freedom to move about? is there no peace and harmony? is there too unhygiene and dirty to live in here????? ask yourself before you vote ya.</p>

              <p>Can the dark angel never change ?</p>
              <p>Only a Tart will forget the faces of its multiple sex partners and the sexual events after a few weeks - should anyone be surprised if you are not speaking from experience ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Do Singaporeans really forget about the last painful increase - even when the increase had been introduced in such minisicular portions ?</p>
              <p>Or is it not a fact that Singaporeans will find themselves trapped in the endless monthly cash bind when bills have to be paid - and suddenly find themselves having to tighten their belts yet again ?</p>
              <p>Has it not been a case that our money continue to drip out of our wallets like a dripping tap that empty a water tank over time ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Why will the angel avoid telling the truth, or is the angel preferring to soften the propaganda and promote the PAP's interest in a backhanded way ?</p>
              <p>Was the Singapore Government paid for their ability to tame the ground, or did the PAP pay themselves for cheating Singaporeans from the Truth ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Singapore Government got an easy job to govern Singapore as the PAP had fixed a clean sweep for themselves in Parliament - so as to be able to pass any legislations as they pleased - that will even disallow ONE person to hold a public protest about anything, let alone about the rising cost of living in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Unders such circumstances, can Singaporeans as a collective lot be reminded of what hit them over the last few months or years - when prices keep creeping up by 0.5 percent or 0.01 cent per unit consumed ?</p>
              <p>What does an angel know about the pain from price increases, when bills are settled by Daddy - and especially when the angel will not even remember the various sexual escapades with the multiple sex partners that she had ?</p>
              <p>Be assured, Singaporeans do remember the price increases when they have to force themselves to tighten their belts when cash is short before the next wage increase or cash rebate is received.</p>
              <p>Is it any wonder that this Government will return some cash at the end of each year - $200 to $400 per working person, only to milk more from the wallet - like the increase to property tax that wipe this returned amount at one go, and milk you more from the new price increases in utilities and transport fares ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Only one - who will forget the ecstacy given by a favored sex partner - will be able to forget anything - including the pain inflicted on oneself.</p>
              <p>Speak for yourself if you wish to be as escapist from reality, and do not attempt to speak for every other Singaporean who remembers.</p>

              <p><br>"Talk" will always be "Talk" - until the opportunity is given for "Action" to be made.</p>
              <p>Anything can be made "Cheap" by one's own actions - simply not to give that single opportunity for oneself to try out those who have sacrificed and volunteered to serve the Singaporean Public.</p>
              <p>The Singaporeans in the 1950s heard LKY "talk" alot - even without any experience - and gave him that "opportunity" to perform.</p>
              <p>Those present in the 1960s gave LKY a second chance - even after the failure of his insistent merger with Malaysia, which was pressed ahead with a pseudo referendum exercise.</p>
