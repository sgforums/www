              <p>Just you peoples who are advocate of oppositions or for a change, if you keep mingling among yourselves, sing song, clap hands, talk cock, chit chat happily and merrily, nothing is going to happen, cos you are not truly engaged, nothing move, you need to go into PAP website to challenge them, loose nevermind, but you know the in depth of their idea and way of doing thing. From there, you will have a better position of being a true opposition. Like the chinese use to say, knowing your enemy well is as tho wining the battle already.</p>

              <p>Obama went top because the white had make a mess out of it foreign policies and economy, so the white is hand off in politic for a while, when the situation if good again, the next election will be a white one. He is just an interim servant put in to answer and take care of the shit the white left behind. Dun be fooled ya.</p>
              <p>The Ching had ruled for 200 years, it is not merely Sun or ah seng come and change it, in fact, it is the modernisation of the world that the Ching failed to Change that led to failure in term of governing and military. And during that turn of the century, lots of monarchies are on the downhill way, not only the ching, it is a fashion, a political fashion of that time, and along come one ah seng or ah sun and sized the opportunity. Mao also see the opportunity to topple Sun's party. The key word is opportunity. You cannot change anything without an opportunities ya.</p>

              <p>For the opposition to come in and have a bigger say on the policies - the opposition will need to have at 51% of the 84 seat parliament, which will make the PAP to lose control of the Government </p>

              <p>40 years has resulted in the arrogance shown in <a rel="nofollow" href="http://theonlinecitizen.com/2009/12/mm-lees-interview-with-natgeo-transcript//">’the statements made by MM LKY in an interview with National Geographic on 28 Dec 2009’ </a>- as seen in the following extract from the full transcript:-</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Q: “It was sort of striking because you feel like, what you’re saying is interesting because it’s like some people seem to thrive in certain environments and some people don’t, I don’t know why.”</p>
              <p>Mr Lee:  “Well, we’ve got ethnic Chinese and ethnic Indians here. <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">The settled ones have become less hard-driving and hard-striving and we’ve got recent migrants, they are hungry, they’re determined to succeed having uprooted themselves and they’re doing better</span></strong>.”</p>
              <p>Q:  “Is that okay? Is that fine, I mean?”</p>
              <p>Mr Lee:  “No it worries the old citizens. They say look this is fierce competition, my children won’t be getting the scholarships because they’re doing well in schools, they push their children very hard. In fact, they need no pushing. They come here from China with no English language and they know that without English, they won’t get along. So there are many cases of boys and girls aged 12, 13 who come into our secondary schools and by the time, they finish the schools, they top the class in English.”</p>
              <p>Q: “That’s interesting, it’s like my grandparents came to New York. When they came in, they don’t speak English and they did great. They just really tried hard and made a life for themselves and I think after a number of generations, it’s very difficult to keep that kind of drive up.”</p>
              <p>Mr Lee:  “Of course, of course.”</p>
              <p>Q:  “Do you think that’s inevitable or do you think that people just get lazy or what?”</p>
              <p>Mr Lee:  “<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">No, I think the spurs are not stuck on your hinds</span></strong>. They are part of the herd, why-go-faster? But when you’re lagging behind, you must go faster to catch up with the herd. I’m quite sure that there are children of the migrants who strive arduously. When they grow up in the same schools as the Singaporeans, the same playing fields, same environment and they begin to adopt Singaporean habits in the ways of living and thinking. So I’m quite sure they’d become like us. Well, because we’re shrinking in our population, our fertility ratio is about 1.29.</p>
              <p>Q: “I actually wanted to ask you about that.”</p>
              <p>Mr Lee:  ”So it’s a worrying factor. So we’ll need a constant inflow but we’re a small population, so we get the inflow and we get the inflow from the educated end of the population, both Indians and Chinese and they’ve got surplus populations. Well, I won’t say surplus but they’ve got huge population, huge numbers.”</p>
              <p>Q:  “They have people to spare, that’s for sure.”</p>
              <p>Mr Lee: “No and they’ve got fierce competition there, so when they come here, higher standards of living for the time being, better social environment with jobs.”</p>
              <p>Q: “What would you say the parents of the second or third generation of Singaporeans and their children are not able to compete with the new people? How do you tell them?”</p>
              <p>Mr Lee: “We tell them look they have got to work harder or they’ll become stupid. It’s just that they don’t see the point of it. Why race when you can canter and save your energy and do other things?   Art, ballet, sports whereas these new migrants, they spend all their time slogging away in the library or at home.”</p>
              <p>Q: “You’re not saying that arts, sports and ballet are not important, are you?”</p>
              <p>Mr Lee: “No, I’m not saying they are not important but an inordinate amount of time is spent on extra-curricular activities.”</p>
              <p>Q:  “I told my son if you stop playing basketball, you do better on these tests but I like playing basketball. I said, well.”</p>
              <p>Mr Lee:  “Well, I think it’s an inevitable evolution of any society and therefore, a regular inflow of migrants without too huge a deluge will keep that society on its toes.”</p>
              <p>Q:  “You have 25 per cent here of people who are expatriates. Is that too much?”</p>
              <p>Mr Lee:  “Well, there’s a little discomfort in some areas because in some areas, they seem to congregate, the new ones. The Indians somehow find the East Coast congenial. They concentrate there, so they become very obvious. The Chinese are more scattered, not so obvious except in the food courts where they are doing the hard work because Chinese cooks from China are willing to work for $1,000 less a month and they’re just as good. So the employer looks for them.” </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em></em></p>
              <p>In the next election, Singaporeans should now arrange to send into Parliament - as many possible, all those candidates standing on the Opposition side - so as to give some competition to the PAP.</p>
              <p>It is time to stick the spurs into the thick hide of the PAP, so that it will learn to serve Singaporeans.</p>

In fact, i wanted all Singaporeans to be arrogance, as most have gone thru the years of nation builidng and now most have succeed in life. And when you go to a surrounding developing country, you feel so arrogance being Singaporean, because you have all your right.</p>
              <p>Can I ask you a question?"</p>
              <p>Angel: Certainly MM.</p>
              <p>UNcle Lee: Do you exercise to keep fit?</p>
              <p>Angel: yes, to tone down my fat on the tummy</p>
              <p>Uncle Lee: Yes i can see that, so now you are arrogantly showing off your tummy to me, you have all the rights, because you training thru pain and time, so if you ask me, i said that i am arrogance because i built singapore to what she is today, trim, lean, peaceful, harmony and prosperous" Next question !  </p>

              <p>A very relevant point made - but it will never attract the attention of a Taiwanese 'hum' that is interested only to display its <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.butler.org/healthGate/images/si55550966.jpg"><strong>‘Labia Majora’</strong></a> - just to gets its daily orgasmic fix in this SgForums and satisfy its needs as an "Attention Seeking Whore".</p>

              <p><br>i hanged there already, my funny sense is, what can i learn and gain from people of my own, i need to venture into the unknown, i need to get engaged with my opposite, then from here, i learned and also able to transmit back more information to PAP.</p>
              <p>Just you peoples who are advocate of oppositions or for a change, if you keep mingling among yourselves, sing song, clap hands, talk cock, chit chat happily and merrily, nothing is going to happen, cos you are not truly engaged, nothing move, you need to go into PAP website to challenge them, loose nevermind, but you know the in depth of their idea and way of doing thing. From there, you will have a better position of being a true opposition. Like the chinese use to say, knowing your enemy well is as tho wining the battle already.</p>
              <p>So, you guys should buzz off from here, not me ya</p>
