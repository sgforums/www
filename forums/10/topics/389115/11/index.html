              <p>The election advertisment will show and teach you how to cross the right bracket/column for the party you choose, but during the advertisment, as an example for first timer, uneducated, uncles and aunties, the actor/actress will cross the PAP column. And finally, they will said, voting is confidential, vote correctly. Thank you.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So most will vote PAP with confident and correctly as per the advertisment</p>

              <p><br>It certainly shows that the Chinese proverb remains true - that "fresh water cannot mix with salt water".</p>
              <p>What does a Taiwanese "hum" know about coffee shop conversation when it spent half of its life working in the Bar at night, and spend the other half of sleeping in the day ?</p>
              <p>Can the uncles' opinions that the Taiwanese 'hum' hear at the bar be the same as those uncles at the coffee shops ?</p>
              <p>Either the Taiwanese 'hum' is far older then it claims to be that it does not realise that the coffee shop uncles today are a different breed as those in the 1950s through the 1970s.</p>
              <p>The uncles sitting at the coffee shop today - from age 40 to 60 years, would have gone through the compulsory education of the 1960s - can these uncles not be aware of Kenneth Jeyaretnam ?</p>
              <p>If it is true that these uncles are not aware of Kenneth, then it surely must be the fault of the PAP government for causing such political ignorance amongst the population.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Taiwanese 'hum' should learn to either stay within the confines of its Bar, return to Taiwan and breed itself more productively then wasting its time about SG politics.</p>

              <p><br>It certainly shows that the Chinese proverb remains true - that "fresh water cannot mix with salt water".</p>
              <p>What does a Taiwanese "hum" know about coffee shop conversation when it spent half of its life working in the Bar at night, and spend the other half of sleeping in the day ?</p>
              <p>Can the uncles' opinions that the Taiwanese 'hum' hear at the bar be the same as those uncles at the coffee shops ?</p>
              <p>Either the Taiwanese 'hum' is far older then it claims to be that it does not realise that the coffee shop uncles today are a different breed as those in the 1950s through the 1970s.</p>
              <p>The uncles sitting at the coffee shop today - from age 40 to 60 years, would have gone through the compulsory education of the 1960s - can these uncles not be aware of Kenneth Jeyaretnam ?</p>
              <p>If it is true that these uncles are not aware of Kenneth, then it surely must be the fault of the PAP government for causing such political ignorance amongst the population.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Taiwanese 'hum' should learn to either stay within the confines of its Bar, return to Taiwan and breed itself more productively then wasting its time about SG politics.</p>

              <p><br>Obviously the 'hum' from Taiwan cannot possibly know that there is a future for Singapore even without the PAP.</p>
              <p>Only 'hums' from Taiwan are trained like animals to prepare themselves for the future.</p>
              <p>Real Singaporeans do not need training as since the first generation that arrive into Singapore have been prepared to face squarely all and any challenges.</p>
              <p>Did the generation in the 1960s trained for separation of Singapore from Malaysia, or did we not simply accept the fact and move on to pick ourselves up and face the future ?</p>
              <p>Without the PAP, Singapore managed to become the center of trade in Southeast Asia since its founding in 1819.</p>
              <p>With the PAP - Singaporeans continue to struggle today, as our forefathers had struggled in 1957 when Singapore achieved self-rule with PAP at the helm.</p>
              <p>Even then, our forefathers had life better when the British had a say over the PAP government given only internal self-rule responsibility.</p>
              <p>Life became harder when Singapore had total independence under LKY and the PAP after being kicked out of the merger arrangement in Malaysia.</p>
              <p>If the Taiwanese 'hum' knows nothing about being a Singaporean, stop faking as if it knows everything about Singapore, and undermine the confidence of Singaporeans to live and face the future without the PAP.</p>
