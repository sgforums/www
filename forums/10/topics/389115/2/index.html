              <p>We should only look at our own country and people and not compare it with the other countries.</p>
              <p>People in country X is having difficulties in life doesn't means we should fare no better than them. Why don't you compare it with some better countries and say "hey why do country Y have this and we don't?"</p>
              <p>This is one thing which I do not comprehend and the reason why we never will improve because we are always stuck thinking if there are others faring poorer than us, then it is ok for us to stop improving.</p>
              <p>And this is where people like PAP steps in and say "Be glad you are doing better than others and bla bla bla, therefore let's raise the taxes or something". We are doing the same 'better' as before but not improving at all even with all the taxes and costs raised.</p>
              <p>I do not see why it is justifiable to increase taxes/cost of living If we are still doing the same 'better' from 5 years ago, let alone when we are obviously not doing any better now.</p>

              <p>The problem is with Singapore putting all its political eggs in one basket.</p>
              <p>Ultimately like it or not, the PAP has to admit that in the long run it is in the best interest of Singapore and the PAP to have a opposition, and a credible one at that. Unfortunately Singapore is so far off from having a true democracy that one wonders wht the future holds.</p>
              <p>Ultimately, one-party-states lead to intellectual inbreeding and groupthink. This is because the entire system lacks any real internal checks and balances, not to mention as opposed to recruiting from people of diverse political opinion, one party tends to recruit those that would agree with them, leading to selection pressure over the long run, to create a party that with far less vitality then the original generation of leaders, favouring adherence to party guidelines as opposed to actually finding solutions.</p>
              <p>What this means is that it is a VERY big question, that lacking a credible opposition, or not allowing Singaporeans sufficent political space to breathe, one wonders how exactly the nation will turn out after this current generation of leaders pass on and the next take over. Our MM will not be around forever, and one wonders how things will play out. Will there be a power struggle? Nobody knows.</p>
              <p>One can cite the example of China as an example of "sucessful", one party rule. But before one gets to far one needs to realize that China, due to singular party rule and adherence to a "cult" of infailablity of the party (Mao in particular), eventually created the cultural revolution that caused plenty of deaths, suffering, and turmoil in the nation. The party itself was forced to reconsider a lot of it's internal policies.</p>
              <p>The thing is, can Singapore afford such a mistake? Are we on the brink of making one? Will our policies, driven relentlessly with no real opposition to act as a check and balance lead to a state where we quite literally plunge our soceity over the edge like China's during the cultural revolution? Nobody knows.</p>

              <p>I am giving you the real substance of a situation, of course, i can alway agree with you and go along with your anti govt way of thinking just to get into the groove or gel up with you guys, but what for??? no meaning at all ya.</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">In the parliament is all same clan! what they suggest or propose nobody is going to gun down or seriously cripple the plan as long as is generating revenue for the current government, who cares about fellow citizens as long they keep on collecting money.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">Opposition is needed to balance the tide and the fight. Example. We cannot have PRs coming in to stir up our property prices and yet they can say HDB is affordable. We know what is happening and we need to do something before our generation will have to purchase HDB starting from a million. HDB is one of the main income and the higher the better for them. <span> </span>And there is many more, our Singaporean values is depreciating. What you are doing, God is watching careful of karma for the MIW <span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">Opposition is only our hope hopefully there will be changes in our future. Precious our votes we need to protect our country.</span></p>
