              <p>hmm.what i'm thinking is that if oppositions are really good and
              can induce a better change for SG's future, then the people would
              have voted for them. and i really hope the reason why people vote
              for opposition is because the opposition can really bring forth its
              people,society and economy to a higher level, not just because
              people are not satisfied with PAP.</p>
              <p>policies made by PAP are good. but i have to admit that the way
              they do it isn't very convincing or satisfying. that is why they
              have invoked the wrath of much singaporeans. however, they still
              manage to help the country progress.</p>

              <p>It is not so much of a choice as I mentioned that we can choose from both the ruling and the oppositions. The giant GRCs have brought down the quality of candidates. The original idea of inclusion of a minority is an applauable cause. Now to make up the big numbers both can't put all the best in a GRCs and we received the choice of some mediocre candidates.</p>
              <p>Yes, in the past when candidates fought with own effort and we seen the result of a flourishing state. But with complacency of getting elected without much effort we get complacency in this present government that is floundering.</p>
              <p>The system of good cause has been abused. The present policies aren't as convincing and sound as they used to be hence the resentment.</p>

              <p>i agree with you on this. like what '<a href="/users/26326">SingaporeTyrannosaur</a>' said about singaporeans not having enough political space to breathe. it's quite an unfair practice by PAP and i dont see eye to eye with this issue. oppositions are not given a level playing ground to compete and justify for themselves. but that being said, a part of me doubts the quality of most oppositions today.</p>
              <p>P.S. anyway, my main point isn't about this. haha. i'm pretty messed up now. my objective in conveying certain message have been twisted all around after reading so much other stuff. haha. nontheless, your point got me thinking. thanks for sharing your interesting view! <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/smile.png" alt="smile.png"> GTG now.</p>

              I agree. They will still be the ruling party but may lose some seats in
              this coming elections. It will take at least a century for them to be
              out. </strong></p>
              <p>I mean, singapore is doing so well regarding the economical
                  issues.</p>
              <p><strong>jy700: we do very well meh. where got? I think we are still in a recession or expecting a new recession soon.</strong> <br> <br>As for the taxes, well, other countries pay up to 30% so do be
                  thankful.<br><br><strong>jy700:
              But other countries earn twice than us. Before getting a deduction of
              30%. Lets quote. A garbage collector in Australia earns about $2500 and
              gets deduction of 40% of his tax ($1500) vs a garbage collector who
              earns $1000 in Singapore without any tax deduction perhaps because he
              is of lower income group.</strong></p>

              Our medical costs and school fees are pretty high, as compared to other
              countries, though lower than US, but higher than UK/Australia. Housing
              is one big problem. The HDB has underestimated market demands. <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> </strong></p>

              <p>I mean like.. hello? Do you know how much PAP has done for Singapore
              even though they kept sucking money? Without them, perhaps Singapore
              would not have been how it is like today. I used to detest them too.
              But have you guys ever studies history? Perhaps if you do, you wouldn't
              be complaining and bearing grudges with them. In fact, I think we
              should thank them for everything that they did.</p>
