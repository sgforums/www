              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">yes. they don't really support human rights honestly. they are trying to sell their ideas via National Education as compulsory subject in secondary schools, to "educate" how govt work, think and do. Seldom, we get to see them show support to our culture, our dialects and our rights to do what we want. For instance, there used to be cantonese radio programs and such. When they take over, they gradually phased out our very own dialects and such. They only say good things about advancing towards the future and why this and that has to happen, at the end of the day, do they actually care about our feelings, do they respect our dialects? we are either hokkien/cantonese/hakka and etc, but the govt never support any media programs and such for us. ...i am embarrassed to call myself singaporean in that sense. Thinking deeply, I think everyone would like to have government for people, not people for government</p>

You go around the region, peoples are so envy of singaporeans, get good education, got jobs, got a roof on top and sure to have 3 meals if not good foods on the table, can get to places within minutes, can go tour, can enjoy peace and harmony in a green garden...what else do you want??? if you feel embarass, at any one time, someone in indonesia, philippine, malaysia, mynmar, thailand, vietnam etc etc will like to exchange citizenship with you.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">hahah. u are really comical. when i talk about something, you talk about another thing not related to my topic. hahah. of course lah, i feel embarrass and i would like to exchange citizenship if there really is. if not, I won't be typing here.

              <p>policies made by PAP are good. but i have to admit that the way they do it isn't very convincing or satisfying. that is why they have invoked the wrath of much singaporeans. however, they still manage to help the country progress.</p>
