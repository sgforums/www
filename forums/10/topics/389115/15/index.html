              <p><br>Only a dumb demoralized 'hogs' will be "zwei-siao" not to be awaken when the Opposition can take an entire GRC.</p>
              <p>People will surely become interested in politics when the CAN have as a say in politics - when those whom they elect into Parliament will be able to voice the people's views, and not become YES Men in Parliament.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If any one Singaporean is prepared to stand up to be counted and allow to be identified to be one in the Opposition Representation - that Singaporean is already prepared to care enough to stand up for the people.</p>
              <p>Why will a "zwei-siao-HOG" attempt to go against the tide and insist that the Opposition Representation is no use if they still don't care about the people - when they have already risked all to stand on the side of the Opposition ?</p>
              <p>Obviously, the "dumb-ass" of a "zwei-siao-HOG" is where the HOG got its brain stuck and cannot see it as any human being with some intellect can see.</p>

              <p><br>Singaporeans have been waiting for more then 53 years - since 1957 - while the Opposition has been seemingly bidding their time for a greater impact.</p>
              <p>How long more does the pseudo-Bavarian HOG wish to prolong the "zwei-siao" waiting ?</p>
              <p>Can Singapore afford to wait any longer ?</p>
              <p>When is the best time for the impact to be greater ?</p>
              <p>If not now, then when ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Obviously, the "zwei-siao-HOG" will wish to have the Opposition to be "good" and stay quiet - as Chiam and Low has been quiet for more then 15 years in Parliament.</p>
              <p>Does Parliament with an overwhelming PAP Majority need logical reasons or workable plan to block the passing of any bill ?</p>
              <p>Even PAP MPs are forced to vote against their own conscience and submit to the PAP Parliamentary Whip - and forced to vote according to Party Lines.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In the worst case scenario, even if the PAP should still win a freak election - due to no small contributions from self-doubters like the "zwei-siao-HOG" - Singaporeans will still need to have <strong>more Oppposition MPs in Parliament</strong> like CSJ, who will dare to speak more aggressively and be more articulate then the present ineffective and inarticulate Chiam and Low.</p>
              <p>It is for the very reason that Singaporeans need MORE Opposition Members in Parliament that will ensure honest and more transparent debate and process of Parliament  - as one or two cannot block a PAP majority in Parliament.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If only the "zwei-siao-HOG" has some iota of intellect in the false bravado shown, it will not be part of the 40% helplessly hopeless Singaporeans that was so clearly elaborated in the other thread - <a rel="nofollow" href="/forums/10/topics/391630?page=1#post_9644266"><strong>‘PAP Model : Starting Ahead and Finishing Last’</strong> </a></p>

              <p><br>Singaporeans have been waiting for more then 53 years - since 1957 - while the Opposition has been seemingly bidding their time for a greater impact.</p>
              <p>How long more does the pseudo-Bavarian HOG wish to prolong the "zwei-siao" waiting ?</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Obviously, the "zwei-siao-HOG" will wish to have the Opposition to be "good" and stay quiet - as Chiam and Low has been quiet for more then 15 years in Parliament.</p>
              <p>Does Parliament with an overwhelming PAP Majority need logical reasons or workable plan to block the passing of any bill ?</p>
              <p>Even PAP MPs are forced to vote against their own conscience and submit to the PAP Parliamentary Whip - and forced to vote according to Party Lines.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In the worst case scenario, even if the PAP should still win a freak election - due to no small contributions from self-doubters like the "zwei-siao-HOG" - Singaporeans will still need to have <strong>more Oppposition MPs in Parliament</strong> like CSJ, who will dare to speak more aggressively and be more articulate then the present ineffective and inarticulate Chiam and Low.</p>
              <p>It is for the very reason that Singaporeans need MORE Opposition Members in Parliament that will ensure honest and more transparent debate and process of Parliament  - as one or two cannot block a PAP majority in Parliament.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If only the "zwei-siao-HOG" has some iota of intellect in the false bravado shown, it will not be part of the 40% helplessly hopeless Singaporeans that was so clearly elaborated in the other thread - <a rel="nofollow" href="/forums/10/topics/391630?page=1#post_9644266"><strong>‘PAP Model : Starting Ahead and Finishing Last’</strong> </a></p>

              <p><br>How did you come to the conclusion that <em>"writing becomes CSJ's defeat and political death...."</em> ?</p>
              <p>In actual fact, his writing is the only way to spread his thoughts and counter the negative propaganda organised by LKY's PAP machinery - who is clearly afraid that CSJ's will sound too convincing and gain more supporters to the SDP.</p>
              <p>CSJ's political death is surely not due to his writings but due to his sudden appearance on the political stage - just when LKY thought he had cleared all the political threats that will jeopardised LHL's smooth and peaceful rise to the throne.</p>
              <p>LKY thought that he had removed the political threats in Francis Seow, Tang Liang Hong, and JB Jeyaretnam in the late 1990s, and was surprised to get CSJ suddenly appearing on the SDP side after rejecting the invitation to join the PAP - which was made by his NUS Faculty Head, who is a PAP strongman.</p>
              <p>It was part of LKY's plan to remove any politician from the Alternative Parties that can give LHL a hard time, as this can only cause LHL's cancer to resurface.</p>
              <p>What other possible reasons can there be - that LKY will be so dogged in hammering CSJ, who was then a young and inexperienced politician ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>While strategic alliances have been made during Elections, it cannot hold the various political parties together after the elections - especially when politicians are mostly self-centered people who each have their own political ideas and ambitions.</p>
              <p>What will you include as "strategic actions" - if writing books to spread one's own message is looked at as being "suicidal" as you claimed in your statement ?</p>
              <p>Strategic actions can take many forms - some that CSJ had taken will include the efforts to educate Singaporeans on their political rights, to take back the public space that the PAP insist on shutting Singaporeans out while lay claims to be their exclusive ownership, to awaken Singaporeans to realise the actual political landscape that the PAP is attempting to disguise with their own propaganda.</p>
