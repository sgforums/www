"We cannot wait forever for Singapore to join hands to build a straight bridge."<br><br>He said Menteri Besar Datuk Abdul Ghani Othman and state economic advisor Datuk Ayub Mion had both impressed on the Prime Minister the need to build the bridge soon.<br><br>In their presentations, they showed artistsÂ’ impressions of the curved half-bridge which could be built on the Malaysian side of the border.<br><br>The elevated bridge would join the existing Causeway on the Singapore side of the Johor Strait.<br><br>Johor has maintained that for ecological reasons, the Causeway must make way for a new bridge. A new span bridge would also complement efforts to turn the cityÂ’s waterfront into a world-class tourism hub.<br><br>At yesterdayÂ’s briefing, the State also pointed out that the height of the bridge should be raised from the present 18m to 35m to enable the passage of international cruise ships.<br><br>Singapore has not indicated if it is in favour of a straight bridge to replace the whole Causeway, despite two rounds of talks between Abdullah and Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong.<br><br>This uncertainty is of concern to Johor state officials, who feel the Federal Government should go ahead and build a half-bridge.</blockquote>(Source:<a href="http://www.nst.com.my/Current_News/NST/Wednesday/National/20050608080448/Article/indexb_html" rel="nofollow">New Straits Times </a> )</div>

The bridge does not help in any way in controlling pollution, except to bring the dirty water from the west to the east.<br><br>Under mahathir, the motive could be political. At no time was military an issue.<br><br>The only drive behind the bridge is $$$$, for the JB MB and his gang, with a bit spilled over to the government.

Now many of their clob companies are disappearing with no new injection of capital and business.<br><br>but building a bridge that can be open for  large vessels to cross is stupid.  it takes 30 mins to open or lift a draw bridge and 30 mins for only 2 vessels to cross.  the vessels must also be piloted by license pilot.  the oil leakage by these large ships will also pollute the shores<br><br>meanwhile what happens to cars,trucks , people ,all waiting so that they can steal shipping business  from singapore ports.  one large vessel takes 30 mins to cross, you figure out , how many vessels can cross aday.  do you think the $$$$ ships can wait.  and imagine it only takes 5 ships in waiting or queue to block the causeway channel.<br><br>building  2 underground tunnels is better idea, but expensive.<br><br>i agree a  new 6 story bridge needs to be build with pleasure craft passing below.  it will encourage leisure sea activities on both sides of the shores.<br>the draw bridge can be lifted in cases of high activity of terrorist alert.<br><br></div>
