The fact is, after i left NS, I encounter much much fewer ppl using vulgar languages.<br><br>Verbally, I use vulgar words sometimes, when I run of words, usually when the debate is going nowhere. When I do that I know I am letting my inner beast taking over my emotion. If the other side started using vulgar languages, I always tell myself when dog bark at you, you don't have to go down on four legs and bark back like a dog. What do you do when dog barks at you? just stay away, let the dog be dog.<br><br>There are many words which we can use to rebutt, scold, be sarcastic, ...... when I write, I have time to find those words to express myself, don't have to resort to vulgar languages.<br><br>Do you teach your children vulgar languages or do you tell them not to use???<br></div>
