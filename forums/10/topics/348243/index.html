              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">To put in simple terms, what is it, is simpy passing of loans to other people.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Home buyers HBs need loans to buy houses. Lending agencies LAs lend them the money.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">LAs sell the loan to Loan Buyers LBs. LBs1 sell it to another Loan Buyer LBs2.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">LBs6 could be, say, those that bought Lehman's Brothers Mini bonds.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">So why did it collapse? </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">LAs when they lend the money to HBs have no risk because they sell the loans to LBs</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Therefore, they can lend to anyone... to sub prime people. The reason they lend to sub prime people is that the banks will not lend them the money and therefore the LAs can charge much higher interests rates. (There is another story, they package the loan in such a way for people the sub prime to take up the loan even when the know these people eventually cannot pay! There is also another story, Carry Trades.... tied to the sub prime crisis)</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Let's say the LAs charge 10% and then sell the loan at 9.99% and earns 0.01%</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">LBs1 sells it to LBs2 and charges 9.98% and LBs1 also earns 0.01%</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">The problem starts when the HBs stops paying. It is not a problem If the price of houses continues to go up for they will just take the house and sell it.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">If the price of houses come down, then they cannot sell it or sell it at a loss, and the problem starts.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">CDOs encourage sub prime lending because the LAs have no risk. Sub prime lending is risky to say the least and that is why banks do not lend them.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Just because it is packaged into CDOs, the banks are indirectly lending to people that they will normally not lend the money to. They are willing to indirectly lend because the CDOs are securities like stocks and shares and can be sold away (unlike a home mortgage, where they cannot sell, and so they are careful who they lend the money to, but not CDOs.)</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Not only can they sell it, they can buy insurance for the CDOs. (That's another story tied to it.)</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">So how is it that the CDOs can be valued at zero when the houses continue to have value? Like in the stock market, the CDOs are "marked to market".... hahaha... if I explain further you will only be thoroughly confused....</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><br></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">So what you need to know is simply that CDOs are simply pieces of papers that people buy and sell, and the papers represent the sub prime loans given to people the banks will not lend, to buy houses. It collapsed with the collapse of the price of property in the USA.</span></span></p>

Why is it that every fucker likes to call himself a genius. FUCK LA, it was all a scam. PhD in bullshit theory also no use what.

              <p>Yes, he has no obligation as "the head of federal reserves".</p>
              <p>He has obligation as "ex-head of federal reserves".</p>
              <p>He didn't do anything when he is in power, and nothing goes wrong for 2 years... than fine, his foresight that nothing will go wrong yet holds true. The obligation lies with the "current head of federal reserves" who assume nothing will go wrong down the line, and didn't do anything about it.</p>
              <p>If want to go back, why not blame the guy who appointed greenspan, since he also has the obligation of picking the right guy, or the guy who appointed the guy who appointed greenspan, and so on.</p>

              <p>If u have watch the program, or the short clip i pasted above, you would have understood, he could have prevented it but he miscalculated the risk. during the freq meeting with congress, he was repeatedly ask, about the derivative trading but he keep mentioning keeping liquidity in the market was key to keep american economy growing. the derivative or CDO was out of control under the term of alan greenspan not benarke. that is not to say benarke was not to blame. but i guess he was too late to stop it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i think you have lost track the line of responsiblity.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i draw a line of responsible eg citibank CEO Vikram Pandit whether he was to blame for Citi plight? probably most would agree no, becoz he create the problem at Citi nor could be able to stop it becoz he wasnt there. Now since he is there, he try to save it.</p>

              <p>obviously your line and my line of responsibility is different.</p>
              <p>I tends to put the blame who causes the crisis while u like to blame who handle the crisis.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>the crisis is created during the term of alan greenspan. when bernake took over in 2006, the CDOs are already out of control and probably spread to rest of the world. At least now, i wont blame benarke yet, coz we shld be judge for how he handle the crisis.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>about your bush question, i hold bush for the blame as of now, if obama cant revive the US economy after spending trillions</p>
              <p>within his term. the rest of the world can judge him then.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">To put in simple terms, what is it, is simpy passing of loans to other people.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Home buyers HBs need loans to buy houses. Lending agencies LAs lend them the money.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">LAs sell the loan to Loan Buyers LBs. LBs1 sell it to another Loan Buyer LBs2.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">LBs6 could be, say, those that bought Lehman's Brothers Mini bonds.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">So why did it collapse? </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">LAs when they lend the money to HBs have no risk because they sell the loans to LBs</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Therefore, they can lend to anyone... to sub prime people. The reason they lend to sub prime people is that the banks will not lend them the money and therefore the LAs can charge much higher interests rates. (There is another story, they package the loan in such a way for people the sub prime to take up the loan even when the know these people eventually cannot pay! There is also another story, Carry Trades.... tied to the sub prime crisis)</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Let's say the LAs charge 10% and then sell the loan at 9.99% and earns 0.01%</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">LBs1 sells it to LBs2 and charges 9.98% and LBs1 also earns 0.01%</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">The problem starts when the HBs stops paying. It is not a problem If the price of houses continues to go up for they will just take the house and sell it.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">If the price of houses come down, then they cannot sell it or sell it at a loss, and the problem starts.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">CDOs encourage sub prime lending because the LAs have no risk. Sub prime lending is risky to say the least and that is why banks do not lend them.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Just because it is packaged into CDOs, the banks are indirectly lending to people that they will normally not lend the money to. They are willing to indirectly lend because the CDOs are securities like stocks and shares and can be sold away (unlike a home mortgage, where they cannot sell, and so they are careful who they lend the money to, but not CDOs.)</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Not only can they sell it, they can buy insurance for the CDOs. (That's another story tied to it.)</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">So how is it that the CDOs can be valued at zero when the houses continue to have value? Like in the stock market, the CDOs are "marked to market".... hahaha... if I explain further you will only be thoroughly confused....</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><br></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">So what you need to know is simply that CDOs are simply pieces of papers that people buy and sell, and the papers represent the sub prime loans given to people the banks will not lend, to buy houses. It collapsed with the collapse of the price of property in the USA.</span></span></p>

              <p><br>I think the problem is though he have access to the information, he didn't draw the same conclusion. I don't know much about CDOs but i'm betting trying to figure out the sort of problems it will lead to involves an immense amount of data, spanning across disciplines outside of just economics.</p>
              <p>At that stage, drawing a conclusion is going to be more based on past experiences and idealogy than any actual objective analysis.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>I think Alan Greenspan is really being honest when he said that he didn't understand CDOs.  Like what some of the rest has mentioned, CDOs are highly complex with too many variables because its lumped so many "things" in one bundle.  Things that are supposed to achieve some form of equity.... I'm not sure on the terms, but thats what I understood after reading up abit on this debacle. </p></div>

              There is only one word  to describe the present financial debacle - FRAUD.  The greed of men has resulted in fraud.
              Some commentors have written that there were warning signs, about 10 years ago but people incharge of financial regulations like Alan Greenspan just ignored them.  Make more money until the bubble burst.  Even now some financial institutions in the west after obtaining govt bailout money, still pay millions to their top executives. 
              The so-called values and freedom that they often cried out loud and wanting to export to other countries. What values are they exporting to other countries? I will say, FRAUD &amp; GREED.
