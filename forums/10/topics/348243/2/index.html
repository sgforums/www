              <p>Hmm...what you guys said about Greenspan might be correct.....</p>
              <p>I think he might be "playing dumb"</p>
              <p>A lot of people when they got into trouble, will pretend to play dumb.</p>
              <p>Do u remember the scandal with the gas company...Enron...the boss said...I dont know, I dont remember, I dont understand....</p>
              <p>Or with the Bush picked attorney general....when he appear to be grilled in American congress, his favourite reply is always.....I dont remember....I dont recall....</p>
              <p>Or about some bank executive...I forgot this one what case....Citibank something...when being asked about some financial products or procedure, in court, he always said....I dont understand that....Im not familiar.....I dont know...</p>
              <p>So I believe in lawyer tactic there is such a thing called pretending to be dumb....</p>
              <p>I think Greenspan might be also playing dumb when he said he doesnt understand these derivatives.</p>
              <p>He might not be referring to computer models, because even if he doesnt understand computer formulas, he must have understood the overall picture, that those instruments are getting way too overleveraged and pose a systemic risk because they got built like some flimsy sand castle, without any solid foundation, and getting out of hand with derivatives on derivatives on another derivatives. I firmly believe he understood that.</p>
              <p>Those players are just doing their parts, but people need someone with helicopter view, who can see everything. That someone is the authorities, which included him.</p>
              <p>But he didnt take action. I think he just underestimated or neglected the risks, so he just let it go on.</p>
              <p>So now when the game blow up, people got angry, they want to blame the authorities for neglecting their responsibility, so what do they do? They say, "but I dont understand this..."</p>

              <p>     
              By Wang Yusheng (China Daily)</p>
              <p>As the global financial turmoil triggered by the US subprime crisis
              worsens affecting more countries, disputes are also rising on how to
              end this mess.</p>
              <p>And as critics search for the arch-criminal to blame for this
              crisis, one point of view convicts supervision authorities such as the
              Federal Reserve. This view holds them guilty of loose market
              monitoring, while it acknowledges capital's greediness for maximum
              profit is just the law of nature.</p>
              <p>True, the lack of supervision is a major contributor to the
              collapse. But it might be a misjudgment to identify the US Federal
              Reserve (Fed) as the arch-criminal despite its delinquency of
              responsibilities as the watchdog of the US financial system<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The Fed, which actually runs as the central bank of the US, is in
              fact an organization consisting of private bankers and large enterprise
              groups, and independent of government control. Almost all the
              high-ranking officials of the Fed are heads or elites representing
              those groups, like Alan Greenspan and Ben S. Bernanke, from whom the US
              government will appoint one as chairman of the Fed. On the surface, the
              Fed is the overlord of the country's banking system, but the fact is
              it's just a lord.</strong></span></p>
              <p>Greenspan confessed recently that the Fed should have monitored and
              restrained overgenerous and irresponsible lending, but he didn't
              intervene in the free market. He obviously thought the free market is
              mighty enough to adjust the financial mechanism. And as a result, he is
              partly accountable for the current situation as the Fed's former
              chairman.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>But don't you believe this politicized, exculpating and misleading
              cant. In fact, Greenspan had been sharing the same financial concepts
              as well as vital interests with the real overlord of the system behind
              the dark scene. They were comrades in the same trench fighting for
              their common fate. Now, Bernanke also comes from the same camp.</strong></span></p>
              <p>Then, let's talk about the big three US rating agencies, Fitch,
              Moody and Standard &amp; Poor, which people once believed to be the
              most authoritative and credible financial managerial bodies. A large
              number of materials exposed lately show that these three trumpeters of
              the overlord had all the time been blaring a fantasia in praise of the
              harmlessness, safety and benefiting potential of bonds supplied by the
              latter.</p>
              <p>For money's sake, they labeled countless safety marks on those
              poisonous bonds created by the Wall Street, and sometimes they even
              made up good-looking rating statistics for enterprises that had no
              credit references being filed.</p>
              <p>Elites in the industry, if they had any doubts, will be driven out
              immediately. But even these elites, if they stopped thinking to
              maintain their jobs, sighed that they were not doing professional
              rating analysis; rather, they were selling their souls to put coins in
              the devil's pocket.</p>
              <p>What appeared coincidentally, when the big three had their revenue
              doubled in the past five years, were that many innocent Americans and
              people in other countries were fooled by their lies.</p>
              <p>And if one moves to the US treasury and government, republicans have
              been advocating absolute and unfretted market economy of liberalism
              since the Reagan administration, and peddling it all around the world.</p>
              <p><img id="1085433" style="width: 160px; height: 106px;" src="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/opinion/images/attachement/jpg/site1/20081121/00221917e13e0a90409c25.jpg" border="0" alt="" align="right"></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>For example, the so-called "Washington Consensus" was established in
              former US president George Bush's period. Therefore, policies and
              concepts of the government can be basically considered as rooted in the
              same origin of rules of the banking system fixed by its overlord.</strong></span></p>
              <p>To deal with issues like financial innovation and financial
              derivatives, official policies and industry rules were actually made in
              a complementary way for the common strategic goal. Only after
              uncovering the deepest root of the financial storm can we discuss
              solving the problem in an efficient way.</p>
              <p>First of all, the US government must carry out the duty as the final
              supreme ruler of the financial system and put every corner of the
              market under scrutiny. Tough it is difficult to do this since White
              House is used to being influenced by those banking overlords, it's
              worth a try. After all, it's American people who choose their
              president. Additionally, ruling power there is tripartite.</p>
              <p>Second, the US must give up its blind faith in absolute liberal
              market economy and have relevant concepts and policies corrected. In
              the times of globalization, market economy shouldn't be denied and
              derivatives still need to be developed, but we must insist on the
              following three indispensable preconditions: financial innovations and
              derivatives must be based on real economy; they cannot step over the
              reasonable scope of core capital; and they must be strictly supervised
              and assessed.</p>
              <p>Third, from a global point of view, the existing international
              financial system, especially the IMF, must be adjusted to adapt to the
              trend of multi-polarization.</p>
              <p>Here two points are very important, discourse power and monetary
              power. For the former, democracy and equal consultation must be
              introduced in discussing international affairs, rather than leaving the
              whole thing to be judged by one or two countries.</p>
              <p>As for the currency issue, it is necessary to strengthen
              surveillance over the US dollar and increase transparency of its
              operation because it serves as a main international reserve &amp;
              settlement currency.</p>
              <p>Uncle Sam should not have his note printing machines run at his own
              will simply because it just shifts a crisis elsewhere and causes
              turbulence. For sure, it is difficult for the US to take such ideas of
              reform. But right now, everyone knows the only question is how to
              reform, rather than whether to reform or not.</p>

              <p>The commander in chief of the world system of banking control was
              Montagu Norman, Governor of the Bank of England, who was built up by
              the private bankers to a position where he was regarded as an oracle in
              all matters of government and business.</p>
              <p>In government the power of the
              Bank of England was a considerable restriction on politi­cal action as
              early as 1819 but an effort to break this power by a modification of
              the bank's charter in 1844 failed. In 1852, Gladstone, then chancellor
              of the Exchequer and later prime minister, declared, "The hinge of the
              whole situation was this: <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>the government itself was not to be a
              substantive power in matters of Finance, but was to leave the Money
              Power supreme and unquestioned." </strong></span></p>
              <p>This power of the Bank of England and of its governor was
              admitted by most qualified observers. In January, 1924, Reginald
              McKenna, who had been chancellor of the Exchequer in 1915-1916, as
              chairman of the board of the Midland Bank told its stockholders: "I am
              afraid the ordinary citizen will not like to be told that the banks
              can, and do, create money. . . . And they who control the credit of the
              nation direct the policy of Governments and hold in the hollow of their
              hands the destiny of the people."</p>
              <p>In that same year, Sir Drummond
              Fraser, vice-president of the Institute of Bankers, stated, "The
              Governor of the Bank of England must be the autocrat who dictates the
              terms upon which alone the Government can obtain borrowed money."</p>
              <p>On
              September 26, 1921, <em>The Financial Times</em> wrote, "Half a dozen men at the top of the Big Five Banks could upset
              the whole fabric of government finance by refraining from renewing
              Treasury Bills."</p>
              <p>Vincent Vickers, who had been a director of the bank
              for nine years, said, "Since 1919 the monetary policy of the Government
              has been the policy of the Bank of England and the policy of the Bank
              of England has been the policy of Mr. Montagu Norman."</p>
              <p>On November 11,
              1927, the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> called Mr. Norman "the currency
              dictator of Europe.". This fact was admitted by Mr. Norman himself
              before the court of the bank on March 21, 1930, and before the
              Macmillan Committee five days later.</p>
              <p>Montagu Norman's position may be gathered from the fact that
              his predecessors in the governorship, almost a hundred of them, had
              served two-year terms, increased rarely, in time of crisis, to three or
              even four years. But Norman held the position for twenty-four years
              (1920-1944), during which he became the chief architect of the
              liquidation of Britain's global preeminence. Norman was a strange man whose mental outlook was one of suc­cessfully
              suppressed hysteria or even paranoia. He had no use for govern­ments
              and feared democracy.</p>
              <p>Both of these seemed to him to be threats to
              private banking, and thus to all that was proper and precious in human
              life. Strong-willed, tireless, and ruthless, he viewed his life as a
              kind of cloak-and-dagger struggle with the forces of unsound money
              which were in league with anarchy and Communism.</p>
              <p>When he rebuilt the
              Bank of England, he constructed it as a fortress prepared to defend
              itself against any popular revolt, with the sacred gold reserves hidden
              in deep vaults below the level of underground waters which could be
              released to cover them by pressing a button on the governor's desk. For
              much of his life Norman rushed about the world by fast steam­ship,
              covering tens of thousands of miles each year, often traveling
              in­cognito, concealed by a black slouch hat and a long black cloak,
              under the assumed name of "Professor Skinner."</p>
              <p>His embarkations and
              de­barkations onto and off the fastest ocean liners of the day,
              sometimes through the freight hatch, were about as unobserved as the
              somewhat similar passages of Greta Garbo in the same years, and were
              carried out in a similarly "sincere" effort at self-effacement.</p>
              <p>Norman had a devoted colleague in Benjamin Strong, the first
              gov­ernor of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Strong owed his
              career to the favor of the Morgan Bank, especially of Henry P. Davison,
              who made him secretary of the Bankers Trust Company of New York (in
              succession to Thomas W. Lamont) in 1904, used him as Morgan's agent in
              the banking rearrangements following the crash of 1907, and made him
              vice-president of the Bankers Trust (still in suc­cession to Lamont) in
              1909.</p>
              <p>He became governor of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York as the
              joint nominee of Morgan and of Kuhn, Loeb, and Company in 1914. Two
              years later, Strong met Norman for the first time, and they at once
              made an agreement to work in cooperation for the financial practices
              they both revered.</p>
              <p>These financial practices were explicitly stated many times in
              the voluminous correspondence between these two men and in many
              con­versations they had, both in their work and at their leisure (they
              often spent their vacations together for weeks, usually in the south of
              France).</p>
              <p>In the 1920's, they were determined to use the financial power
              of Britain and of the United States to force all the major countries of
              the world to go on the gold standard and to operate it through central
              banks free from all political control, with all questions of
              international finance to be settled by agreements by such central banks
              without interference from governments.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>It must not be felt that these heads of the world's chief
              central banks were themselves substantive powers in world finance. They
              were not. 
              Rather, they were the technicians and agents of the dominant
              invest­ment bankers of their own countries, who had raised them up and
              were perfectly capable of throwing them down. </strong></span></p>
              <p>The substantive<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> finan­cial powers of the world were in the hands of these investment
              bankers (also called "international" or "merchant" bankers) who
              remained largely behind the scenes in their own unincorporated private
              banks.</strong></span></p>
              <p>These formed <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>a system of international cooperation and national
              domi­nance which was more private, more powerful, and more secret than
              that of their agents in the central banks. </strong></span></p>
              <p>This dominance of investment
              bankers was based on their control over the flows of credit and
              invest­ment funds in their own countries and throughout the world.</p>
              <p>They
              could dominate the financial and industrial systems of their own
              coun­tries by their influence over the flow of current funds through
              bank loans, the discount rate, and the rediscounting of commercial
              debts; they could dominate governments by their control over current
              gov­ernment loans and the play of the international exchanges.</p>
              <p>Almost
              all of this power was exercised by the personal influence and prestige
              of men who had demonstrated their ability in the past to bring off
              suc­cessful financial coups, to keep their word, to remain cool in a
              crisis, and to share their winning opportunities with their associates.</p>
              <p>In this system the Rothschilds had been preeminent during much of the
              nine­teenth century, but, at the end of that century, they were being
              replaced by J. P. Morgan whose central office was in New York, although
              it was always operated as if it were in London (where it had, indeed,
              originated as George Peabody and Company in 1838).</p>
              <p>Old J. P. Morgan
              died in 1913, but was succeeded by his son of the same name (who had
              been trained in the London branch until 1901), while the chief
              decisions in the firm were increasingly made by Thomas W. Lamont after
              1924...</p>
