            <div class='col-md body'>CNA 3 Nov 07<br><br><blockquote>Prudent to protect sinking funds of town councils: DPM Wong<br>By Wong Mun Wai, Channel NewsAsia | Posted: 02 December 2007 1835 hrs<br><br>SINGAPORE : Protecting the sinking funds of town councils is prudent, said Deputy Prime Minister Wong Kan Seng on Sunday.<br><br>He said capping the amount town councils can invest in non-government investment vehicles at 35 percent will protect the money they have for the future.<br><br>Mr Wong made his comments while meeting residents and shopkeepers at Bishan North Shopping Mall on Sunday.<br><br>The new rule by the Ministry of National Development (MND) on investing town council money kicked in on December 1st.<br><br>The aim is to strike a balance between town councils trying to get a good return on their funds and not taking unnecessary risks with residents' money.<br><br>Mr Wong agreed with this new rule, saying if town councils rundown sinking funds because of wrong or bad investments, then the money will not be available for other uses if and when needed.<br><br>Inflation hit a 16-year high recently at 3.6 percent and is expected to hit 4.5 or 5 percent next year.<br><br>Government bonds and short-term fixed deposits give a return of around 1.5 to 3 percent which is lower than the returns from riskier market investments.<br><br>So when asked about inflation eating away the low financial returns, Mr Wong said inflation is only one factor considered when investing and protecting sinking funds.<br><br>DPM Wong said: "There are world prices due to many reasons and therefore we have this increase in inflation. But it goes up and down and we just can't depend on that alone as a measure to decide how we invest our town council funds. So we cannot look at one spot and say it may go up to 5 percent, or 4 percent inflation and therefore that particular decision by MND will not cover the inflation."<br><br>Mr Wong said residents he spoke to did not complain about the price of hawker centre food going up, although some were concerned about general food prices having gone up.<br><br>The shops are part of the heartlands.<br><br>Mr Wong spoke to shopkeepers selling produce like fish and vegetables, listening to the concerns they face.<br><br>Some concerns included higher prices of produce and limited display areas, said shop owner Mr Ker Yeow Chong, who've been running his business for more than 15 years.<br><br>Other MPs from the Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC also joined Mr Wong on his Sunday visit. - CNA/ch </blockquote>It is a timely advice given the volitality of the market. however, something cross my mind.<br><br>1. What is the primary function of the Town Council?<br>Given that the primary function of the TC is to take care of the estate, why is it into investment?<br><br>2. Who is doing all the investment?<br>Did the TC employed a professional investment manager for the investment? If it does, is the return justifiable for the ROI?<br><br>3. Who approved or oversees the investment? the MPs? If an investment turns sour like that of the Barring, CAO or Sembawang, who is answerable?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>my worse fear is that if their investment make money residents would not benefit from it but when they lose money town councils might raise their charges.<br><br>$1 billion in town council funds : whatÂ’re they used for?<br><br>Posted by theonlinecitizen on December 3, 2007<br><br>By Leong Sze Hian<br><br>I refer to the CNA news report Â“Prudent to protect sinking funds of town councils: DPM WongÂ” (CNA, Dec 2) and the article Â“Move to protect council fundsÂ” (Today, Dec 1).<br><br>According to Creative TechnologyÂ’s (CT) annual report, Holland-Bukit Panjang Town Council (HBPTC) was listed as one of the majority shareholders with 530,000 shares currently valued at about $3.2 million. I understand that CTÂ’s share price from 2003 to 2007, has ranged from a high of $27.30 to itÂ’s current price of $6.10 on 12 October 2007.<br><br>According to CTÂ’s Statistics of Shareholding as at 19 August 2005, HBPTC held 200,000 shares. The CT high price for fiscal 2005 and 2006 was $27.20 and $14.40 respectively. Does this mean that the 200,000 shares could have cost as much as $5.4 million?<br><br>When did HBPTC purchase its CT shares, and at what price?<br><br>If it had held its total holding of TC shares on 1 July 2006, I believe it would have been valued at about $6 million.<br><br>According to HBPTCÂ’s annual report, it had $8.4 million of quoted equities on 1 April 2005.<br><br>If this is the case, does it mean that it accounted for about 70 per cent of HBPTCÂ’s total quoted securities portfolio of $8.4 million?<br><br>If the above assumptions and timelines are correct, why is its quoted securities portfolio so apparently non-diversified?<br><br>IsnÂ’t diversification the key principle of prudent investing?<br><br>What guidelines do town councils use in investing their residentsÂ’ funds?<br><br>Another question which needs to be asked is: What are the profits from such investments used for and have they ever been used, since town council funds keep growing to more than $1 billion now? Perhaps the town councils should include this in their annual reports and make them public.<br><br>When we last checked, only 6 out of the 16 town councils have their annual reports easily available on their websites. Why are the reports of the other 10 town councils not available on their websites?</div>
