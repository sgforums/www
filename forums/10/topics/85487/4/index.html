            <div class='col-md body'>Transport , infrastructure ,convenience blah blah blah.If you have your physical prowess without a heart, does that make you great?Rather I think that just shows you are a hollow giant.China may be rich but are their people mature and educated?Just one look around and you will see a people whose social and emotional maturity is way below par that of their marvellous infrastructure.If they want to be truly counted as great, then they have o behave like a society deserving of commendation, not false praise lavished on them by groups eager for a pie of their domestic market.We also have spanking new cars, clean streets and sparkling buildings, but are we really happy inside, or are we slogging away in a cold place where you cannot be yourself because of many different factors?Is outer appearence all that matters.Shame on you who believe all that China is made out to be.China is progressing, I grant her that, one day she might become a truly great power once again.However, right now, she has to learn to be a graceful lady, not the arrogant bitch which I see right now.</div>

If the people of China are so bad, Why do u think there is a growing trend of Singaporeans and taiwanese retiring and emigrating to China? Use your head and think.  If u dislike China so much, you must be hating United States  to the core.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, that's just my humble opinion.You know, if all of us read up more on the world around us, not just on the "official" sources, we would realise that there is much more that goes on beneath the facade.No doubt, there are many who are migrating over because of economic and monetary opportunities, but is China the end-all and be-all.What irks me the most is that everyone sees China as the only place in the world that one can do business in.A huge population of 1 billion people is different from a consumer base of that amount.Look at China with an opportunistic eye, but do not see it as being the 8th winder of the world.Btw, why should I hate the US to the core if I hate China?It doesn't make sense at all.</div>
