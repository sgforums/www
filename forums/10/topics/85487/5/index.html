            <div class='col-md body'>quote:<br><br>"and the very act of making Lord MacCarthy kneel to the Emperor is a symbol of that insular thinking which precipitated their downfall"<br><br>this is debateable because i feel that it is the epitome of how the West fails to sensitize to the culture of the Chinese. There had to be a compromise, but don't you think it is because the White man feels that he is superior to other races, which is why he didnt kneel?<br><br>The downfall of China is undoubtedly partly due to Insular thinking, as well as, foreign transgression. In short, From the 1800's, China's power waned, and the country was  being misgoverned. Opium was brought in by the British to reduce trade deficit, and when Lu Xun tried to stop it through ban or by burning, the british assualted canton. Eventually, various islands like hong kong were ceded.  if you read chinese history, you'll find that only recently, from the 1921, was china ruled by the chinese and without any of its territory seized.<br><strong><br><br>To answer the topic objectively, i feel that we are just plain unlucky to be utilized  in a propaganda war. There is no doubt that the "unofficial official" was delibrately blown out of proportion by the Taiwanese Media becuase it desperately needs diplomatic recognition.<br><br>Already there are many states switching sides to China and taiwan is launching a counter by promising small pacific island states economic aid if they recognise Taiwan. China on the other hand denounces those who recognise Taiwan.<br><br>Even if majority of taiwanese favour reunification, Do yo think Taiwanese politicians would accede to a request. If they do unify,. they would be lesser officals.<br><br>in conclusion, lets just wait for things to unfurl. And yes i think sometimes we should read up before commenting. Because jumping into conclusion aint good.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> </strong></div>

I travelled for the past 10 years to China; Huadong, Huabei, Dongbei, Zhongnan, Xinan, Xibei, not only once but &gt; 20 times per year.

It is just that in rich and poor countries the way of cheating is different. Think about it this way. Even in the world's richest country the USA, there are many coporations with a long history such as Enron, Worldcom etc that will purposely falsify their accounts in order to cheat prospective investors. So much so that many old retirees who invested money inside those companies are forced to come out of retirement to work again. The stituation is quite serious...  Like I said before I have lived in china for a few years and those years I have been eating foods from China but nothing has happened to me, i am still alive and talking to u right? Honestly the situation of 'fake foods' is nowhere as serious as the local media potrays.<br><br>One last point, the US president George Bush. He lied about WMDs in Iraq and fooled the rest of the world to think likewise. His invasion of Iraq has led to the deaths of many Iraqi civilians and american soldiers and yet the whole world just remains diam diam..... If this can be tolerated, what else cannot be tolerated?</div>

He'll rather make it private.<br><br>China's reaction is just a matter of "face". It can't stand a small friend visiting its foe.<br><br>We have to remember that diplomatic issues as delicate as this isn't easy.<br><br>I'm very sure he calculated the "risks" involve.<br><br>I even got LHL's sentiments exactly now that he made an official statement.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>On lhl's visit - Singapore has miscalculated China's reaction. China has overeacted to the extent of bullying singapore.<br><br>This is the New Chinese mentality. "WE are BIG and You are small". We you tell the Chinese that you are Singaporean, they say that it is a well managed "small" country. They think they have arrived and all countries should KOWTOW to them as in the olden days where coultries make pilgrimages to the Chinese emperor.  Singaporean businessman going to China has been and will continued to be screwd by them.  The only country that the Chinese are afraid of is the Americans.  But not for long.  Wait till they get all the american investment into China then they will squeeze their Balls like they did to the Taiwanese. Singapore leaders should realise this. Look at Suzhou. Don't think you are Singapore chinese that they consider you as family. they will sell you out for the sake of money and power.<br><br></div>
