I did not fabricate those articles or anything. How does saying the truth makes one biased towards something?  China doesn't have backbone just bcos they have signed FTA with Japan. By ur logic, the japanese also don't have backbone, right? The americans nuked Japan but look at the youth of Japan. They idolise americans like mad and if u ask them which country they admire most, they will tell u its United States. Does that mean japanese have no backbone?<br><br></div>
