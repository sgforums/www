Lee kept a low profile during his stay and refused to answer questions from reporters.<br><br>Asked about his feelings over the past few days, Lee just responded with a smile. Prior to his departure, he bid farewell to journalists by waving his hand and saying only "good-bye."<br><br>Lee, who is scheduled to become the Southeast Asian city-state's prime minister at the end of this month, arrived in Taipei late last Saturday for an unofficial visit.<br><br>He visited Beijing in May and local media speculated that Lee might bring messages from mainland China's leaders on how to resolve the current cross-Taiwan Strait political standoff.<br><br>However, a senior government official said Lee defined his Taipei visit as a "journey of understanding and communication" aimed at "meeting old friends and making new friends" before he assumed the premiership.<br><br>"Lee had no intention of mediating in cross-strait talks nor did he bring any messages from Beijing, " said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.<br><br>The official said Lee held extensive talks with Chen during two rounds of talks a day earlier, covering political, financial and economic issues.<br><br>"But he was very cautious and prudent when touching on cross-strait and diplomatic issues, "the official said, adding that Lee seldom took the initiative to mention cross-strait topics.<br><br>The official further said the two sides did not reach any concrete conclusions or agreements on possible bilateral cooperative programs during Lee's visit.<br><br>Lee had a hectic itinerary during his stay. On Tuesday morning, Douglas Paal, director of the Taipei office of the American Institute in Taiwan -- the de facto U.S. ambassador to the country -- paid a visit to Lee for an hour-long closed-door meeting.<br><br>Later in the day, Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou hosted a luncheon in honor of Lee and his entourage.<br><br>Ma described the lunch meeting as a "gathering between good old friends, " saying that he became acquainted with Lee while doing his doctoral program at Harvard University.<br><br>As Ma turned 54 Tuesday, Lee and his wife presented Ma with a birthday cake at the luncheon.<br><br>Ma said the Taipei city government has maintained close ties with Singapore. He himself has been to Singapore three times in the past few years and many city government officials have also made frequent visits Singapore to discuss various cooperative programs. Deputy Taipei Mayor Ou Chin-der and all city government department chiefs were also present at the luncheon.<br><br>Ma said he exchanged views with Lee on a range of topics, including cross-strait relations, substantive Taiwan-Singapore ties, East Asian economic integration and bilateral cooperation in severe acute respiratory syndrome prevention.<br><br>Commenting on Beijing's anger over Lee's Taiwan visit, Ma said Beijing's continued diplomatic embargo against Taiwan only hinders the development of cross-strait relations.<br><br>The mainland often strongly objects to leaders from other countries having any formal dealings with Taiwan, but Ma said Taiwan's existence as a vibrant and prosperous democracy is an undeniable fact and that Beijing should face up to this reality.<br><br>Lee's talks with Chen reportedly focused on the enhancement of mutual cooperation and regional issues, including hastening the signing of a free trade agreement and cooperation in regional security affairs.<br><br>Chen also hosted a dinner in honor of Lee and his entourage, which included Singapore Defense Minister Teo Chee Hean. Vice President Annette Lu and many other senior government officials also attended the dinner at Chen's official residence.<br><br>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan hosted a luncheon in honor of Lee and discussed Taiwan's economic development, such as the investment conditions in industrial parks in Taichung and Taoyuan areas, as well as small- and medium-sized enterprises on the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.<br><br>Lee also paid a courtesy call to Defense Minister Lee Jye Monday afternoon to express appreciation for Taiwan's assistance in the training of Singapore troops under the Hsingkuan (starlight) cooperative program.<br><br>On Sunday, Lee met with Premier Yu Shyi-kun for wide-ranging talks. He also inspected the Singapore representative office's operations and met with several elite members of Taiwan's business community.<br><br>Singapore, which has an ethnic Chinese majority, has for years engaged in a delicate balancing act over Taiwan, engaging an increasingly powerful mainland while at the same time maintaining close economic and military links with Taiwan. The city-state played host to the highest level meeting between Taiwan and the mainland in 1993.<br><br>(CNA)</span><br><br>No wonder China is making noise......if LHL can meet high level officials like Chen and more, is that still an "unofficial and private visit"??? I just hope he knows what he is doing.</div>

My dad used to tell me LKY use to hold meeting with the leaders of taiwan and the mainland in singapore. His purpose is to act as a middle manbetween the 2 countries. Therefore I have reasons to believe that his purpose for this trip is a need. Perhaps it might be china who wanted him to go and talk to them as a third party instead of directly talk to them.</div></blockquote>Problem is (a) China &amp; Taiwan has changed in terms of their bargaining ability compared to the early 90s. China now specifically tell everyone else to butt out! And (b) who LHL think he is? He does not have the same amount of currency like LKY. This thing is getting to his head.<br><br>Conversation! My god! Read the news! China would not have a dialogue with any Taiwan leaders that does not support "reunification".

            <div class='col-md body'>This world is all about might and power. In the past China needs us but now it is the exact opposite. Not only S'pore, Asia's economy is very dependant on China since it is the strong demand from Chinese consumers that is driving economic growth around asia.(For example Japan. In the year 2003, China purchased 50% of japanese exports) China's political and economical clout is very big already so naturally China is becoming more vocal than ever before.<br></div>
