            <div class='col-md body'>Singapore says it opposes Taiwan independence<br>(Agencies)<br>Updated: 2004-07-12 17:59<br><br>Singapore moved on Monday to calm China over a visit by its Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong to Taipei, saying it was a private and unofficial trip to "meet friends".<br><br>Following an angry reaction from Beijing to the visit, Singaporean Ministry of Foreign Affairs released a statement that emphasized Singapore's support for the "One China" policy and its opposition to Taiwanese independence.<br><br>"Lee is making a private and unofficial visit to Taiwan to meet with friends. He last visited them in 1992," the statement said.<br><br>"Singapore has consistently maintained a 'One China' policy. We do not support independence for Taiwan. This is our fundamental position.<br><br>"Deputy PM Lee's private visit does not in any way change this policy, nor does it represent any challenge to China's sovereignty or territorial integrity."<br><br>Lee's visit comes at a particularly sensitive time as he is due to take over from Goh Chok Tong as prime minister this year. Goh has said he will announce the handover date sometime over the next few weeks.<br><br>China reacted angrily on Sunday to the trip, with foreign ministry spokeswoman Zhang Qiyue expressing "strong dissatisfaction" and "protest" on Sunday.<br><br>"The Singaporean side should take full responsibility for results from the event," Xinhua quoted Zhang as saying.<br><br>Zhang said the Taiwan issue is directly related to China's sovereignty and territorial integrity and the Chinese government firmly opposes official relations in any form between countries that have established diplomatic ties with China and the Taiwan authorities.<br><br>The Singaporean leaderÂ¡Â¯s visit hurts China's core interests, the political base between the two countries and the feeling of 1.3 billion Chinese people, said the spokeswoman.<br><br>Beijing opposes any official foreign visit to Taiwan, which is an integral part of national territory. The two sides split at the end of a civil war in 1949.<br><br>In its statement, Singapore's foreign ministry said it "values our close and extensive bilateral relations with China".<br><br>"It would be regrettable if bilateral relations were to be affected by this private visit."<br><br>Lee is the son of Singapore's still-powerful founding father, Lee Kuan Yew, who has remained in Cabinet as Senior Minister since handing over power to Goh in 1990.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by gerrykoh:</div><div class="quote_body">Why can't his Taiwan friend come over to Singapore or meet in some other country instead? Heard the Taiwanese giving it a lot of publicity which we don't need. This will definately affect our economy &amp; our business with China. Govt. tells us to go overseas to do business, then we get 'sabo', who will pay? China will retaliate, she already said will not allow anyone to interfere in internal affairs. Better send someone impt. to apologise </div></blockquote>You may get the same reaction from China if we allow them to visit us (if his "friend" is of high rank). China did that when one of the high ranked people (forgot who) in Taiwan tried to visit Indonesia. The trip was later cancelled when Indonesia decided to withdrew the visa approval.</div>
