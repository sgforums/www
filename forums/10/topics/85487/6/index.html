            <div class='col-md body'>Well said.We will not kowtow to China, economic prospects not withstanding.Pride and soul of our nation was built on people seking a better life, free from the incompetence and tyranny of the Qing, another dynasty which assumed China was the center of the world.To have the hubris of the Chinese government forced down our throat like it's something we must accept is simply unpalatable.It's not about whether China is a powerful nation or not, in fact, this episode has shown how ungentlemanly and low they will stoop to attempt to influence otheres to ignore Taiwan's existence.</div>
