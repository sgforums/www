            <div class='col-md body'>seems like ppl here don't understand economics.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  for every developed/developing countries, inflation is a norm. Deflation or stagnation or hyper-inflation can mean that the country is slipping into crisis. A small amount of inflation is often viewed as having a positive effect on the economy. One reason for this is that it is difficult to renegotiate some prices, and particularly wages, downwards, so that with generally increasing prices it is easier for relative prices to adjust. many prices are "sticky downward" and tend to creep upward, so that efforts to attain a zero inflation rate (a constant price level) punish other sectors with falling prices, profits, and employment. Efforts to attain complete price stability can also lead to deflation which is generally viewed as a negative outcome because of the significant downward adjustments in wages and output that are associated with it.<br><br>not that i'm being pro-govt but just a little information about why prices are increasing. singapore has an mixed economy and there are many factors why inflation is occurring. the rich poor divide is another problem that is existent in every developed country today. unless singapore closes itself like north korea or make itself communist to distribute wealth 'equally', it will always exist in a globalised economy as millionaire businessmen continue to make more and more money. So even if the opposition take over or PAP continue to rule price will continue to increase unless the govt is willing to let our country slide backwards or turn us into a welfare state.<br><br>sorry to those who cant understand</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Oil / Fuel prices is something that concerns me deeply.<br><br>Transport companies applied before for increase in fares in view of raising oil prices, its true that the oil prices did hit a high, but thats what the market is about, highs and lows.<br><br>The application went through despite plenty of discussion, but on the period of implementation, oil prices are already back to the norm.......<br><br>the bigger picture is that , if they are apply for fare hike because of oil price increase, could we , citizens apply for fare decrease when oil prices hit a low?<br><br>Since they are rather privatized companies, why are we citizens suffering for their profitability? In a normal competitive marketing scenerio, with "real" competition, you cant just any-o-how increase ur price to make more money, as you have to deal with competition! With unesccesary price increase, consumer have the choice to buy another fairly priced competitor's products.<br><br>However, in our transport scenerio, we have sadly not much options but to submit. Why can the transport companies look at themselves? how to function more efficiently? How to reduce cost internally? why cant their CEO and directors take a pay cut to increase company's profitablitly? there are many ways, not just to increase selling price, which in a real competitive market doesnt permit.</div>

A loss of employment will ensue as well. Inflation is definitely inevitable.<br><br>However, inflation has to be accompanied by rise in wages.

Because Singapore's export economy is dominated by non-Singaporean transnational corporations (TNCs) who have not been burdened with the need to directly share their technologies, <strong>Singapore's capability to innovate is said to be much less than that now displayed by Taiwan and South Korea. </strong><br><br>Along with the other NIEs, Singapore shared certain factors that tended to increase its international competitiveness, among them stable macroeconomic policies, sound financial systems and good infrastructure, an educated workforce, a work ethos, and policies which encouraged entrepreneurial activity. However, in the area of foreign investment Singapore took quite another path compared to South Korea and Taiwan.  In fact, the Singapore government's treatment of foreign investors -- at least in the early years of development -- was almost preferential when compared to indigenous capital.  <strong>Through infrastructural subsidies and tax incentives to foreign exports, the local Singaporean business class was to an extent marginalized.</strong><br><br>In both cases, <strong>a huge anonymous underclass of cheap labour supported the superstructure; in the case of Singapore</strong>, Malaysians (of every race, not just Malays) and other Southeast Asians, who are offered only the barest of legislative protection by the government.<br><br>However, one important weakness in Singapore's approach is the question of technological innovation, considered the last stage of technology transfer.[10] For a variety of reasons, state-of-the-art R&amp;D by TNCs is nearly always concentrated in a few developed countries, and high technology tends not to be developed outside the TNC's home-base.  Cutting-edge R&amp;D in particular is usually undertaken close to management and decision-making centres where there exists a large local market, and a pool of advanced and specialist technical skills.[11] <strong>Another important weakness is that the very presence of strong TNCs can inhibit local companies from deepening their technological capabilities, preferring to import foreign technologies that are proven and ready-to-use, rather than invest in their own R&amp;D.</strong>[12] This is arguably what has already happened in Singapore as a consequence of their developmental path.<br><br><strong>The cost in human terms of this success has been high: Singapore today is an authoritarian corporatist state that intervenes in virtually every aspect of citizen's lives.  Singapore has become a nation of functionaries who serve the interests of the TNCs and the Singaporean state elite.  Within such an environment there exists very little true entrepreneurship.</strong><br><br><strong>FDI has not assisted in the development of an innovative population; rather it has assisted in the creation of a self-satisfied, arrogant society that seems content to live off its natural advantages.[23] Singapore today resembles an enormous air-conditioned shopping mall, with squeaky-clean streets and traffic so orderly as to border on the bizarre. </strong><br><br><a href="http://www.okusi.net/garydean/works/fdising.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.okusi.net/garydean/works/fdising.html</a></div>
