And are there measures that you plan to take to contain this inflation rate?"<br><br>In response, Mr Lim said, "We're watching this closely of course. We expect generally in the second half, costs to go up higher than in the first half. Then of course we also have the one-off impact of the GST. But our experience shows in the past, when we had similar increases in GST, that this is a short-term impact, and that over time the impact of course will be mitigated.<br><br>"So overall we still look at an inflation path of between 1 (and) 2 percent this year, which is a little higher than what we had in the past years, but definitely still very reasonable, considering this is already more than 16 quarters of growth." - CNA/ms<br><br><span style="color: blue;">Fcuk you lah, you four-eyed specky bastard.<br><br>Do you even know what you are talking?<br><br>Considering the initial posts on price increases and the recent GST hike, "0.5 to 1 % inflation in the first half of this year"  must surely be a grotesque understatement.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">"....when we had similar increases in GST, that this is a short-term impact, and that over time the impact of course will be mitigated."</span><br><br>Mitigated with the 'one-off' GST offset package? That is nothing compared to the $1.5 billion in GST revenue every year, also taking into consideration that corporate taxes, despite its reduction of 2 percent, generates more foreign direct investment than before.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">"So overall we still look at an inflation path of between 1 (and) 2 percent this year, which is a little higher than what we had in the past years, but definitely still very reasonable, considering this is already more than 16 quarters of growth." </span><br><br>16 quarters of growth may be a golden generation for Singapore but not necessarily the majority of Singaporeans. 'Still very reasonable', indeed.<br><br>Surely, a show of sensitivity, instead of justifying the party's policies at all costs, would have been much appreciated here.</span><br><br></div>
