              <p>Hamas, you want your land back? fight for it. And don't be a crybaby about your country being invaded if you choose to fight for it, fighting for it means you are fair game. Not strong enough to fight for your land? THAN DON'T PISS THE ISRAELIS OFF.</p>

              attacks and Israeli reprisals, though sporadic rocket attacks on

Israel, in response to rocket attacks out of the Gaza has shut off fuel, electricity and water to the Gaza, in effect punishing the entire population, most of which have not committed any acts of violence towards Israel. </span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000;">There have been many discussions about the Palestinians wanting to wipe Israel off the map, yet when one looks at the map of the region, it is in fact the Palestinians who are being driven "off the map", and the United States has done nothing to condemn what is seen by many as collective punishment or even ethnic cleansing. </span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000;">Things like 9/11 happen daily in Palestine only like 10X more inhuman all due to American funds... From this view it is quite simple to see the injustice. </span></p>

              <div><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: 'lucida sans unicode';">Dear Hanan,<br><br> 1. I think I cannot convince you on anything simply because your
              perception of things is not based on logic or reason but merely on your
              strong belief that you are always right, even if the whole world says
              you are wrong.<br><br> 2.	<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Jews have lived with Muslims in Muslim countries for centuries without any serious problem.</strong></span><br><br> 3. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On the other hand in Europe, Jews were persecuted. </strong></span>Every now and
              again there would be pogroms when the Europeans would massacre Jews.
              The Holocaust did not happen in Muslim countries. Muslims may
              discriminate against Jews but did not massacre them.<br><br> </span></div>
              </div>
              <div id="more" class="asset-more">
              <div><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: 'lucida sans unicode';">4.
              But now you are fighting the largely Muslim Palestinians. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>It cannot be
              because of religious differences or the killing of Jews living among
              them. It must be because you have taken their land and expelled them
              from their homeland. I</strong></span>t is therefore not a religious war. But of course
              as you seek sympathisers from among the non-Muslims, the Palestinians
              seek sympathisers among the Muslims. That still does not make the war a
              religious war.<br><br> 5. Whether you speak Hebrew or not is not relevant. Lots of people who
              are not English speak English. They don't belong to England. For
              centuries you could speak Hebrew but remained Germans, British, French,
              Russians etc.<br><br> 6. Lots of Jews cannot speak Hebrew but they are still Jews. Merely
              being able to speak Hebrew does not entitle you to claim Palestine.<br><br> 7. The Jews had lived in Europe for centuries. They identify themselves
              with their domicile. They fought the wars of these countries often
              against other Jews living in enemy countries.<br><br> 8. These countries are their homeland. So why should they take
              Palestinian land to make their own country? They could take any of the
              European countries as their own country. The United States of America
              should offer one of its states as Israel.<br><br> 9. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>As to history, the Malays had occupied a lot of land in Southeast
              Asia since time immemorial. Today much of our land has become part of
              neighbouring countries, having been conquered or because of treaties
              entered into by the British. We should really go to war to regain our
              land especially as there are Malays living there.</strong></span><br><br> 10.	But we want to live in peace with our neighbours. So we accept the borders drawn by the colonialists. <br><br> 11. You may say it is a joke to believe the Philistines are the
              forebears of the Palestinians. But what may be a joke to you is a
              serious belief of much of the non-Jewish world.<br><br> 12. We did not have a Jewish representative at our conference. But I am
              sure when you have a conference in Israel you did not have Muslim
              representatives either.<br><br> 13. I can sympathise over the killings of the Jews. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>But show me
              pictures of total destruction of Israeli towns and villages. Show me
              the effect of the primitive Hamas rockets on the Israeli people.
              Compare them with the effects of your bombs, rockets, shells, chemical
              weapons you used on the Gazans. When did Hamas blockade you and starve
              Israeli people and deprive them of medical attention. Did Hamas build a
              wall to separate Israelis from other Israelis including from family
              members? Did Hamas build settlements in Israel?</strong></span><br><br> 14.	This idea of out-terrorising the terrorists, of massive retaliation on a scale that horrifies the whole world will not work.<br><br> 15. Our people who went to Gaza were amazed at the attitude of the
              people there. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Even after the deaths of so many of them, the deaths of
              their children and babies; even after their towns have been flattened,
              their schools and hospitals destroyed, they show no fear. Every one of
              them expects to die at any time because of your attacks but they would
              never surrender. When asked they simply said it is their land and they
              would defend it to the last. </strong></span>Even an Arab Christian priest was
              determined to stay on in Gaza. Those of their children who survive will
              prepare themselves to defend their land like their parents. Your
              attacks fail to terrify them or to force them to submit. You only
              succeed in instilling greater hatred of Israel and the Israelis.<br><br> 16. When it was pointed out to them that they are no match for the
              Israeli forces and their weapons of mass destruction, when it was
              pointed out that their rockets were primitive and cannot compare with
              the destructiveness of Israeli rockets, they were not disheartened. The
              Israeli attacks simply strengthened their resolve to go on fighting.
              The Israeli idea to out-terrorise them has not worked and I believe it
              would not work.<br><br> 17. Your arguments simply confirm my belief that the Jews have the same
              degree of hatred for the Palestinians, despite the fact that you suffer
              less than them.<br><br> 18. The war has degenerated into a feud between Palestinians and
              Israelis. The Palestinians know they cannot win the war but that simply
              heightened their hatred for Israelis. They will nevertheless try to
              kill Jews, even if that will intensify Jewish hatred for the
              Palestinians. And you will retaliate with many times greater ferocity
              because you cannot force them to their knees. Their resistance simply
              increase your anger and hatred of them.<br><br> 19. We have come to an impasse. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>If Israel is bent on occupying
              Palestinian land, on building Jewish settlements, on building Berlin
              walls and on sanctions and blockade, the Palestinians will continue
              their futile attacks. Arabs will die, maybe 10 for every one Jew. </strong></span>But
              with the hatred for Jews which they harbour, that is a worthwhile
              sacrifice. And Jews will kill more Arabs to express their hatred. And
              so it will go on as it had gone for 60 years, as it will go on for
              another 60 years or more.<br><br> 20.	Dear Hanan, tell your Government to compromise. <br><br></span></div>

              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000;">For those of you who haven't been following along
                  with the latest out of the occupied territories, the Gaza, and
                  Israel, let me fill you in. Israel, in response to rocket attacks
                  out of the Gaza has shut off fuel, electricity and water to the
                  Gaza, in effect punishing the entire population, most of which have
                  not committed any acts of violence towards Israel.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #000000;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000;">There have been many discussions about the
                  Palestinians wanting to wipe Israel off the map, yet when one looks
                  at the map of the region, it is in fact the Palestinians who are
                  being driven "off the map", and the United States has done nothing
                  to condemn what is seen by many as collective punishment or even
                  ethnic cleansing.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #000000;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000;">The 2 parties are not equal, we always hear in
                  the news “ both parties should stop "Comparison is not
                  valid"<span> </span> we should look at the bigger
                  picture it’s a rock against a tank, apache helicopters, grenades,
                  International media and the list goes on.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000;">Things like 9/11 happen daily in Palestine only
                  like 10X more inhuman all due to American funds... From this view
                  it is quite simple to see the injustice.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #000000;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #000000;">Palestine Moslems
                  and Christians were driven out of their homes whole families and
                  tribes just to make room for the Jews I don’t see how its fair and
                  yes the reason behind the west supporting is both a tactical
                  military point of view and also the fundamental conservatives the
                  religious right if you will who believe that Jesus will descend
                  there...!!!!!!........it’s a sad situation....yet no remedy for the
                  people of Palestine.</span></p>

              <p>Recently, i watched a chinese ancient war movie, RedCliff 2, i like the last few words said by a general who fought thru with all his might and army. Looking back at the deaths and chaos created, he said "In the end, nobody win, we all loose"</p>

              <p>Personally I'm dead-against Israel existing as a nation. There was no need for it to be made, and the western nations have gone and supported it to a ludicrous extent with military funding and, as has been noted, ignoring it's massive human rights violations.</p>
              <p>In addition, creating a country by annexing part of another one and forcibly removing the current residents (I know, I know, not the original plan, but that's how it ended up working out, and no one, save the residents, really seemed to care.) is an unjustifiable idea anyways.</p>
              <p>Today Terrorism is defined by the American government as the threat or the use of violence to advance a political cause by individuals or groups, whether acting for or in opposition to established governmental authority, when such actions are intended to shock, stun, or intimidate a target group wider than the immediate victims. Actually such a general definition will include all wars of liberation from the American War of Independence to the French Revolution. The worst aspect and perhaps the most common feature of terrorism is the unleashing of violence against innocent civilians.</p>
              <p>things like 9/11 happen daily in palestine only like 10X more inhuman all due to american funds..</p>
              <p>Finally, the creation of Israel has so upset the political balance in the middle east that wars are still being fought over it sixty years later.</p>
              <p>It was a terrible idea that should never have happened.</p>
