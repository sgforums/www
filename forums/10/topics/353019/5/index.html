I deny that I am biased, but rather insist that I have tried to be truthful in assessing the facts and relevant law. It is the character of the <br>occupation that gives rise to sharp criticism of Israel’s approach and attacks, especially its harsh blockade of Gaza, resulting in the collective punishment of the 1.5 million inhabitants. By attacking the observer rather than what is observed, Israel plays a clever mind game. It directs attention away from the realities of the occupation, practicing effectively a politics of distraction.</p></div>

                      Israel, let me fill you in. Israel, in response to rocket attacks
                      out of the Gaza has shut off fuel, electricity and water to the
                      Gaza, in effect punishing the entire population, most of which have
                      not committed any acts of violence towards Israel.</span></p>

                      Palestinians wanting to wipe Israel off the map, yet when one looks
                      at the map of the region, it is in fact the Palestinians who are
                      being driven "off the map", and the United States has done nothing
                      to condemn what is seen by many as collective punishment or even
                      ethnic cleansing.</span></p>

              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000;">Things like 9/11 happen daily in Palestine only
                      like 10X more inhuman all due to American funds... From this view
                      it is quite simple to see the injustice.</span></p>

              <p>You are questioning the Jewish right to exist. Jewish people have Israel and its territories in their hearts. You are indirectly refering to Jews as a whole.
