              <p><em>As I said earlier, do you really think the other Arab
              nations will still recognise Israel or even have a truce with
              Israel even if the Jewish state moves back to the pre-1967 borders?
              The answer is no.</em></p>
              <p><strong>Official translation of the full text of a
              Saudi-inspired peace plan adopted by the Arab summit in Beirut,
              2002.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>The Arab Peace Initiative</strong></p>
              <p>The Council of Arab States at the Summit Level at its
              14th Ordinary Session,</p>
              <p>1. Requests Israel to reconsider its policies and
              declare that a just peace is its strategic option as well.</p>
              <p>2. Further calls upon Israel to affirm:</p>
              <p>3. Consequently, the Arab countries affirm the
              following:</p>
              <p>4. Assures the rejection of all forms of Palestinian
              patriation which conflict with the special circumstances of the
              Arab host countries.</p>
              <p>5. Calls upon the government of Israel and all Israelis
              to accept this initiative in order to safeguard the prospects for
              peace and stop the further shedding of blood, enabling the Arab
              countries and Israel to live in peace and good neighbourliness and
              provide future generations with security, stability and
              prosperity.</p>
              <p>6. Invites the international community and all
              countries and organisations to support this initiative.</p>
              <p>7. Requests the chairman of the summit to form a
              special committee composed of some of its concerned member states
              and the secretary general of the League of Arab States to pursue
              the necessary contacts to gain support for this initiative at all
              levels, particularly from the United Nations, the Security Council,
              the United States of America, the Russian Federation, the Muslim
              states and the European Union.</p>
              <hr>
              <p><em>For purposes of comparison, the following is an
              earlier draft discussed by Arab foreign ministers on 25 March,
              2002, in advance of the summit:</em></p>
              <p>The Council of the Arab League, which convenes at the
              level of a summit on March 27-28, 2002 in Beirut, affirms the Arab
              position that achieving just and comprehensive peace is a strategic
              choice and goal for the Arab states.</p>
              <p>After the Council heard the statement of Crown Prince
              Abdullah bin Abdul Aziz in which he called for the establishment of
              normal relations in the context of a comprehensive peace with
              Israel, and that Israel declares its readiness to withdraw from the
              occupied Arab territories in compliance with United Nations
              resolutions 242 and 338 and Security Council resolution 1397,
              enhanced by the Madrid conference and the land-for-peace principle,
              and the acceptance of an independent, sovereign Palestinian state
              with al-Quds al-Sharif as its capital, the Council calls on the
              Israeli government to review its policy and to resort to peace
              while declaring that just peace is its strategic option.</p>
              <p>The Council also calls on Israel to assert the
              following:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>
              <p>Complete withdrawal from the Arab territories occupied
              since 1967, including full withdrawal from the occupied Syrian
              Golan Heights and the remaining occupied parts of south Lebanon to
              the June 4, 1967 lines.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
              <p>To accept to find an agreed, just solution to the
              problem of Palestinian refugees in conformity with Resolution
              194.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
              <p>To accept an independent and sovereign Palestinian
              state on the Palestinian lands occupied since June 4, 1967 in the
              West Bank and Gaza Strip and with Jerusalem (al-Quds al-Sharif) as
              its capital in accordance with Security Council Resolution
              1397.</p>
              </li>
              </ul>
              <p>In return, the Arab states assert the following:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>To
              consider the Arab-Israeli conflict over and to enter into a peace
              treaty with Israel to consolidate this.</strong></span></p>
              </li>
              <li>
              <p>To achieve <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>comprehensive peace for all
              the states of the region.</strong></span></p>
              </li>
              <li>
              <p>To <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>establish normal relations
              within the context of comprehensive peace with
              Israel.</strong></span></p>
              </li>
              </ul>
              <p>The Council calls on the Israeli government and the
              Israelis as a whole to accept this initiative to protect the
              prospects of peace and to spare bloodshed <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>so as to enable the Arab
              states and Israel to coexist side by side and to provide for the
              coming generations a secure, stable and prosperous
              future.</strong></span></p>
              <p>It calls on the international community with all its
              organisations and states to support the initiative.</p>
              <p>The Council calls on its presidency, its secretary
              general and its follow-up committee to follow up on the special
              contacts related to this initiative and to support it on all
              levels, including the United Nations, the United States, Russia,
              the European Union and the Security Council.</p>
