              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000;">For those of you who haven't been following along
              with the latest out of the occupied territories, the Gaza, and
              Israel, let me fill you in. Israel, in response to rocket attacks
              out of the Gaza has shut off fuel, electricity and water to the
              Gaza, in effect punishing the entire population, most of which have
              not committed any acts of violence towards Israel.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000;">There have been many discussions about the
              Palestinians wanting to wipe Israel off the map, yet when one looks
              at the map of the region, it is in fact the Palestinians who are
              being driven "off the map", and the United States has done nothing
              to condemn what is seen by many as collective punishment or even
              ethnic cleansing.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000;">The 2 parties are not equal, we always hear in
              the news “ both parties should stop "Comparison is not
              valid"<span> </span> we should look at the bigger
              picture it’s a rock against a tank, apache helicopters, grenades,
              International media and the list goes on.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000;">Things like 9/11 happen daily in Palestine only
              like 10X more inhuman all due to American funds... From this view
              it is quite simple to see the injustice.</span></p>

              and Christians were driven out of their homes whole families and
              tribes just to make room for the Jews I don’t see how its fair and
              yes the reason behind the west supporting is both a tactical
              military point of view and also the fundamental conservatives the
              religious right if you will who believe that Jesus will descend
              there...!!!!!!........it’s a sad situation....yet no remedy for the
              people of Palestine.</span></p>

              <p>wow, so there is so many ways israel can fuck with Hamas and there are still rockets fired at Israel? THEY ARE NOT VERY SMART TO FUCK WITH  ISRAEL THAN, AREN'T THEY?</p>
              <p>than there is a simple way around this. don't fire rocket at Israel, stop anyone from firing rockets at Israel. Since they are not very smart, than there is a simple way to learn. you fuck with Israel, you suffer. What did you think Israel should react to rocket from Gaza? take it lying down like an idiot?</p>

              <p>Personally I'm dead-against Israel existing as a nation. There
              was no need for it to be made, and the western nations have gone
              and supported it to a ludicrous extent with military funding and,
              as has been noted, ignoring it's massive human rights
              violations.</p>
              <p>In addition, creating a country by annexing part of another one
              and forcibly removing the current residents (I know, I know, not
              the original plan, but that's how it ended up working out, and no
              one, save the residents, really seemed to care.) is an
              unjustifiable idea anyways.</p>
              <p>Today Terrorism is defined by the American government as the
              threat or the use of violence to advance a political cause by
              individuals or groups, whether acting for or in opposition to
              established governmental authority, when such actions are intended
              to shock, stun, or intimidate a target group wider than the
              immediate victims. Actually such a general definition will include
              all wars of liberation from the American War of Independence to the
              French Revolution. The worst aspect and perhaps the most common
              feature of terrorism is the unleashing of violence against innocent
              civilians.</p>
              <p>things like 9/11 happen daily in palestine only like 10X more
              inhuman all due to american funds..</p>
              <p>Finally, the creation of Israel has so upset the political
              balance in the middle east that wars are still being fought over it
              sixty years later.</p>
              <p>It was a terrible idea that should never have happened.</p>
