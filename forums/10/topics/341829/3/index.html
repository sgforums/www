              <p>whoa dudes. I not pro gahmen but in this case really gotta say some of you lack balance in your opinions.</p>

              <p>suffice to say, it works both ways. sometimes its the problem with the individual sometimes within the system</p>
              <p>system problems :</p>
              <p>1) welfare scheme YES, complicated, confusing and multiple schemes YES. public awareness of schemes POOR</p>
              <p>to top things off, social workers are overworked and handle a huge mulitude of cases per individual. how to provide quality care and concern when they are outnumbered and overworked ?</p>
              <p>2) abuse of system :</p>
              <p>i m not saying this old man is an abuser of the system but do observe that, he get P.A (criteria 65 and above, proven medical disability / condition that impairs him from working and no known support group, i.e relatives or friends)</p>
              <p>and he gets offered a Job. but what happens ? he complains about it and the transport fare ?</p>
              <p>he dosent make mention of the fact that there are schemes like PAYU and utilities and town council conservancy fees waiver arranged by social workers.</p>
              <p>3) government policy :</p>
              <p>from my experience working and temping there and government rhethoric, it is my humble opinion that government dosent want to move towards a welfare model.</p>
              <p>the bedrock behind the government's stance and policy still lies with community and family help. government action should only occur in the case where the individual involved has no family , cannot be helped by community then the government step in.</p>
              <p>it is a final safety net. not a welfare state. i know i m probably going to get flamed for saying this but most people cannot differentiate between them and see the government's intent.</p>
              <p>which is to actually create a system where people rely on their own initiative. i.e you dont have money, u need a job, you look for a job, government agencies help you find, pay for education and training and give you a small amount to help you while you find a job.</p>
              <p>it is not meant to replicate social welfare systems like in europe where you get single parent benefits, unemployment benefits and social security. we wont have that. we probably cant afford that.</p>

              <p>Since you worked in the agency, there is no argument .. but you mentioned that there are scheme to help destitude like him, question was this bought to him or it is expected that he knows about.  I for one do not know that there are such scheme.  The government's intention is clear.  You are able, work for a living. If you are not, then they help. then again, what kind of help and how much can they really help?  It is because of the fear of abuse that we often read the amount they gave it pittance...  can bearly tie over lor ...</p>
              <p>I had approached government agencies too when I lost my job some 10 years ago.. guess what, all they can give me is cleaner job.  I would had accepted it if it is not for the fact I managed to find a construction site job.   As I am considered old, I had to work extra hard to show these employer that I am just a good if not better. </p>
              <p>I asked for re-training programme and I was pushed from one agency to another and end of the day, got none.  Finally, on my own, I managed to find my own job with a decent salary.  Am I sore ?  Yes I am, why ? Because as a Singaporean, completing NSF etc, my government did not help me.  Instead, it cut off my electricity and reduced my water supply !  My MP told me SP being privatised must run on it own and government cannot interfer.  He just advise me to pay up as much as I can ... . . . .. .</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>1) You said the welfare scheme do exists but is confusing. So is this the people fault? Did the gov do anything to make it easier so the really poor have access to these scheme?</p>
              <p>So if the social workers are overworked, shouldn't the gov do anything abt it? The gov has billion of reserve every year but it can't afford to hire more social workers?</p>
              <p>2) If the cleaner job is $300 and the transport is $100++, is it enough to even survive in Singapore?</p>
              <p>You mention that there are schemes like
              PAYU and utilities and town council conservancy fees waiver
              arranged by social workers, <strong>but could it be these scheme are not even made know to the old man which is why he never mention it</strong>? So again, whose fault is it?</p>
              <p>The old man did mentioned that "Not enough.<strong> The water bills is already
                                      a couple of dollars…..</strong>in 2, 3 or at most 4 days, the money is
                                      gone." which mean he is still required to pay utilities bill, So obviously, he is not aware of the so-call PAYU schemes or whatever so it doesn't apply to him.</p>
              <p>3) Is it very clear that in this case, the gov was helping the old man half heartedly. Just give him $150 per mth and throw him any cleaner job, and that's it.  The old man did said he wanted to work, but of course, it must be reasonable too. At least the gov should find him a job and somehow work out the sum so that he can survive. What's the point of finding him a job which a large portion goes to transport.</p>
              <p>And even if he take up the cleaner job, and that's $200 + $150, is that enough? -&gt; Yes, if the gov waive the utitities and whatever bill which I stronger believe didn't happen in this case!</p>
              <p>And having worked as a temp at one of the MCYS community
              development centres, you really think that there's no room for improvement in the current system?</p>

              <p>So if the social workers are overworked, shouldn't the gov do anything abt it? The gov has billion of reserve every year but it can't afford to hire more social workers?</p>

              <p><br>its not easy being a social worker cos of the workload you get and of course the pay. imagine yourself getting a degree from nus only to earn like 1.9k a month. also the cases that you face everyday will take a toll on you, not everyone can split a clear line btw smypathy and empahty, so not everyone can be a social worker.</p>
              <p>talking about reserves, there is a reason why its called "reserve"</p>
