              <p>LOL, so can you kindly teach me how to "double 100 dollars
              within 2 weeks"? Or "earning 10k in 2 weeks starting with just 100
              dollars"? If it is so easy, everyone will be millionaire, if not,
              billionaire!</p>
              <p>So if like what you said it is that easy to earn money, are you
              a millionaire (if not, should be billionaire)? If not, why?

              <p>Don't think it's about the pay or increasing the number of social workers, social work is an extremely stressful job to do because of the many tragedies and sad cases you'd have to deal with. It's a job that's pretty much makes you feel there isn't any hope in life or there just isn't any happy endings.</p>
              <p>I've done a part time censer before for the URA i think and i was required to interview the old people in Chinatown. I already found it very difficult to ask family questions from a old woman who has 2 retarded daughters, with every answer i get even more depressing than the next. I can't imagine how it would feel having to deal with cases like that on a daily basis, and how long before you just slip into depression. </p>
              <p>I would guess the turnover rate for social workers to be quite significant.</p>

              <p>The right-wings will claim that it's the old man's fault that he didn't plan for his old age when he was younger and his ability to earn was much higher, resulting in today's situation.</p>
              <p>The left-wings will claim it's the government's fault for not providing a social safety net for these old folks. They love to use this example to start espousing on the greater income disparity and so on and so forth.</p>
              <p>At the end of the day, who is right? The left-wingers or the right-wingers?</p>
              <p>Let me tell you, there's no winner at the end of the day. The old man is the real loser.</p>
              <p>While you people debate about toppling this current regime or blaming the old man for his lack of foresigh, he still has to live on his meagre $150 every month.</p>
              <p>Really, sometimes, is politicking really so enjoyable? To the point where we start associating this with the oversight and failings of the PAP and even to Temasek Holdings' fault?</p>
              <p>So what if you win? So what if you topple the regime? So what if you discredit Temasek Holdings?</p>
              <p>At the end of the day, this old man will still live on anonymously and someday will pass on without so much as a miniscule effect on the lives of others. Does it occur to both sides that we should start solving the problem and stop pinpointing the source of the blame?</p>
              <p>What happened to realpolitik? Is it so unfashionable nowadays that we have no choice but to keep asking 'why' it went wrong and 'who' is responsible for it instead of asking 'how' or 'what' we can do to solve the problem?</p>
              <p>Really. Speakers' Corner is not a place to play the blame game. We need people to stop listing problems for the sake of finding faults. We need them to provide some solutions as well.</p>
              <p>Shame on those who politicised this issue. Shame on you.</p>

              <p>The right-wings will claim that it's the old man's fault that he didn't plan for his old age when he was younger and his ability to earn was much higher, resulting in today's situation.</p>
              <p>The left-wings will claim it's the government's fault for not providing a social safety net for these old folks. They love to use this example to start espousing on the greater income disparity and so on and so forth.</p>
              <p>At the end of the day, who is right? The left-wingers or the right-wingers?</p>
              <p>Let me tell you, there's no winner at the end of the day. The old man is the real loser.</p>
              <p>While you people debate about toppling this current regime or blaming the old man for his lack of foresigh, he still has to live on his meagre $150 every month.</p>
              <p>Really, sometimes, is politicking really so enjoyable? To the point where we start associating this with the oversight and failings of the PAP and even to Temasek Holdings' fault?</p>
              <p>So what if you win? So what if you topple the regime? So what if you discredit Temasek Holdings?</p>
              <p>At the end of the day, this old man will still live on anonymously and someday will pass on without so much as a miniscule effect on the lives of others. Does it occur to both sides that we should start solving the problem and stop pinpointing the source of the blame?</p>
              <p>What happened to realpolitik? Is it so unfashionable nowadays that we have no choice but to keep asking 'why' it went wrong and 'who' is responsible for it instead of asking 'how' or 'what' we can do to solve the problem?</p>
              <p>Really. Speakers' Corner is not a place to play the blame game. We need people to stop listing problems for the sake of finding faults. We need them to provide some solutions as well.</p>
              <p>Shame on those who politicised this issue. Shame on you.</p>

              <p>The point is that the interview provides <span style="color: #ff0000;">too little information</span> for us to pinpoint whose fault is it and like <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/users/196917">teraexa</a> said, whats the point?</p>
              <p>And like what <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/users/30200">Stevenson101</a>, Why should feeling your intentions are morally accepted means you can do and say whatever you want, allowing no one to challenge your logic?</p>
              <p>Since you are so narrow-minded, i think it will do you good to perhaps move on to another forum glorifying the opposition parties.</p>

              <p>In the interview, he (and his wife) said the workplace is very far and the transport cost $100++. And for a 69 year old to cycle everyday to work? Even a young man is unable to do so.</p>
              <p>He said the transport is $100++, so he may have only $100++ left after minus the transport. And he mentioned in the interview himself that it's okay for him but after minus the meal (if he eat outside), but what about his wife? (if you bother to watch thru the entire interview).</p>
              <p>I am not sure if he take up the job, will the $150 subsidise disappear as well? or is the $150 meant for him and his wife.</p>
              <p>The interview also asked him isn't the gov handout supposed to be $300++ which he said NO, only $150.</p>

              <p><br> its not easy being a social worker cos of the workload you get and
              of course the pay. imagine yourself getting a degree from nus only
              to earn like 1.9k a month. also the cases that you face everyday
              will take a toll on you, not everyone can split a clear line btw
              smypathy and empahty, so not everyone can be a social worker.</p>

              <p>Than why the gov can't increase the salary of the social worker to attach more people to join as social worker? And does social worker need to be degree holder? I think 1.9k is a great starting pay for poly graduate.</p>
              <p>There's hundred of worse job than social worker, like those working in funeral line, having to see dead bodies everyday. But I am sure there are still plenty of people willing to work as long as the salary is great.</p>
              <p>Give me just 10% of our PM salary and I don't mind even to tend to dead people everyday.</p>
              <p>LOL, the reserve is like your CPF. You may be out of job, no money, sick, dying, but still can't touch your CPF money even if its hundreds of thousand.</p>

              <p>Don't think it's about the pay or increasing the number of
              social workers, social work is an extremely stressful job to do
              because of the many tragedies and sad cases you'd have to deal
              with. It's a job that's pretty much makes you feel there isn't any
              hope in life or there just isn't any happy endings.</p>
              <p>I've done a part time censer before for the URA i think and i
              was required to interview the old people in Chinatown. I already
              found it very difficult to ask family questions from a old woman
              who has 2 retarded daughters, with every answer i get even more
              depressing than the next. I can't imagine how it would feel having
              to deal with cases like that on a daily basis, and how long before
              you just slip into depression. </p>
              <p>I would guess the turnover rate for social workers to be quite
              significant.</p>

              <p>Ya, and there are many many many jobs which are equally or more stressful. But why do you think there are still people working in these job? Answer -&gt; because of the pay.</p>
