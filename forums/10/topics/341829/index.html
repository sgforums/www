              <p><strong>Prologue:</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>69 year old Mr Chua used to work as a construction laborer in the past. He is still healthy and able to work, but nobody wants to employ him, citing age as a concern.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As he does not qualify for the Public Assistance scheme, he is only given a monthly allowance of $150 which he supplements by borrowing from his friends.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Excerpts of interview translated from Hokkien:</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>SG Enquirer:</strong> Do you go to look for work ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Mr Chua:</strong> Yes, I cycled everywhere from Geylang to Whampoa, but they say I am too old and refuse to employ me…..I told my friends like this die already I have no job to do, no job no money. If this house has to be paid by me, then I really die.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>SG Enquirer:</strong> How much did the government give you a month ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Mr Chua (crying):</strong> S$150 only. They open a bank account for me and deposit the money into it every month.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>SG Enquirer:</strong> Is it enough ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Mr Chua:</strong> Not enough. The water bills is already a couple of dollars…..in 2, 3 or at most 4 days, the money is gone.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>SG Enquirer:</strong> Are food prices high now ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Mr Chua:</strong> Yes, very expensive ! When I go out to look for job, I dare not drink coffee at coffeeshop. I ordered hot water instead, no money what to eat ? Can only drink water.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>SG Enquirer:</strong> Did you ask your MP to help you look for job.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Mr Chua:</strong> Yes, they gave me a job as a sweeper at ….don’t know where, offered me S$300 monthly, but the transport fares cost a hundred plus dollars already.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>SG Enquirer:</strong> Did you ever go hungry ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Mr Chua:</strong> When we are hungry, just take some roti (bread).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>SG Enquirer:</strong> Do you still have CPF ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Mr Chua:</strong> No.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>SG Enquirer:</strong> Are you upset with your predicament ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Mr Chua:</strong> Yes, but what to do ? When we run out of money, I have to go around to borrow from my friends and when the S$150 is deposited on every 3rd of the month, I will use it to repay them.</p>

              <p>i have no sympathy for this old man. it's good enough that he received $150. Rather than nothing. It's his own fault that he didn't make plan for his old age. And now when he is in this predicament, he wants free stuff. People give him job, complain about bus fare, which is not that much since he can use his senior citizen card. All complains but no effort.</p>

              <p><br>if ppl always think that live is a no.s game, then it shall be a no. s game to that person. In this case, you. People have options in life. There is no way that one live life without options. And if you choose the right options and work really hard. You wont be in such a sorry state.</p>
              <p>The most pathetic part is him trying to get more money from the govt. My grandmother is 79, have half of her children asking money from her. Yet she still manage to survive. She may not live well, but she is able to at least sustain herself. And it's because she works hard and make good choices. Not like that old bum who wants 'free lunch'.</p>
              <p>That 1000 that fails. Do you have facts to back up with your claim? Of course many people go through hardship in life, in this case, being monetarily poor. Yet I don't see them doing the same thing like that old bum. Seeking free lunch and sympathy from ppl.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Some people lived from hand to mouth daily for all their lives cause they were not priviledge to get an education and started work as soon as they can walk.  The work that's available to them is also hard labour that pays little and they struggle eberyday. So they end up having nothing in their old age. There's quite a lot of these category of old age people around. I thought usually the religious groups will try to help out. Some old people go to temples for free food cause they cannot afford anything outside.  </p></div>

              <p>As youngster, I look at people who waste their parent's money in school and not knowing what they will be in future. Yes I won't have sympathy people.</p>
              <p>But seriously, when you see them 70 year old, weak and frail without support while you are 70 year old, with a healthy bank balance and family, would you not lend a hand and instead laugh at their stupidity?</p>
              <p>The human heart is not made of stone, it's easy to say all these cruel words but when you really meet with such situation, would you really still mean what you say?</p>
              <p>Think before you speak.</p>

              <p>i have no sympathy for this old man. it's good enough that he
                  received $150. Rather than nothing. It's his own fault that he
                  didn't make plan for his old age. And now when he is in this
                  predicament, he wants free stuff. People give him job, complain
                  about bus fare, which is not that much since he can use his senior
                  citizen card. All complains but no effort.</p>

              <p>that was the old generation. most of which do not plan for the future. sure enough he may have made a mistake by not planning, who can blame him? giving him a choice he wouldn't wanna end up in this state would he?</p>
