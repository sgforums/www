              am hoping, and foreseeing, that it will change over time as the

              <p>I doubt it will get better. Pick up a Social Studies book and you see that this regime is doing its best to justify its policies, going as far as doing comparisons between the British IHS and the Singapore health system. Of all the welfare systems they picked, they picked one of the most inefficient to do the comparison. How can this be justified? Clearly, education is getting politicised and the regime is resorting to something nigh brainwashing just to sustain itself.</p>

              <p>Let's consider an example on minimum wage. If you had
              a liberal democracy, instead of a self-serving fascist dictatorship
              that utilises the parliament as a theatre, it would not be too hard
              to enact minimum wage legislations, would it?</p>
              <p>Very clearly, the policies adopted by the regime are
              self-serving in nature (by easing immigration requirements on
              unskilled labour and having no minimum wage, you hardly need a
              rocket scientist to figure the outcome would actually be an influx
              of cheap foreign labour that actually helps to artificially induce
              an exponential increase in labour supply thereby reducing the
              efficiency wage, would you?) and serve to exacerbate the problem
              instead of actually redressing it. If you need any further insights
              on the desperate measures this regime is resorting to
              pursue artificially-induced expansionist economic policies,
              check out <span style="font-family: Microsoft Sans Serif; color: #000000;"><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.singapore-window.org/sw01/011101bo.htm">http://www.singapore-window.org/sw01/011101bo.htm</a> (someone posted this link on another thread which clearly makes for
              an interesting read).</span></p>
              <p>More pertinently, with a reasonable minimum wage model in place,
              how is it reasonable anyone could actually be offered a $300/month
              job which, in essence, is below subsistence level in the context of
              any developed country? Perhaps, applying a minimum wage in the
              context of this thread, it would actually go some way towards
              reconciling the differences between the two camps on the state of
              affairs concerning this chap as a reasonable level of income that
              commensurates with the living standards of the developed world
              would clearly result in fewer "bums" around (this is basic labour
              economics).</p>

              <p>The minimum wage is to ensure that it is enough at least for a person to survive. If not, with the influx of foreign worker, the wage will keep falling whereas the standard of living will keep rising.</p>

              <p>It's survival of the fittest. If foreign workers and maids can survive with such low salaries, you have to be able to do more to deserve a higher pay. If the salary is too low even for foreign workers (and remember employers have to pay a levy for them), then employers will be forced to raise salaries to retain their workers. Market forces will decide what should be the minimum wage.</p>
