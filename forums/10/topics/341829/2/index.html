              <p>i have no sympathy for this old man. it's good enough that he
              received $150. Rather than nothing. It's his own fault that he
              didn't make plan for his old age. And now when he is in this
              predicament, he wants free stuff. People give him job, complain
              about bus fare, which is not that much since he can use his senior
              citizen card. All complains but no effort.</p>

              <p>huzane89? so that mean u are born in the 1989? meaning u are 19yrs this year? how much was ur pocket money? are u working yet? are you born without a chance to go to school? have you tried looking for job but got rejected?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Read carefully! he was reject work coz of his age. At his age, 69yrs old, he still have to work. that alone is wrong!!! Even if he is just a cleaner his entire life, dun u think he should atleast get to retire after spending 6 decade of his life working labour job?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It isnt just about wanting free stuffs. It is about repaying the elders for their part in making what singapore is today. Be it labour job or elite job. Itis a god eat dog workd out there and if the gov dun even care abt it citzen, what does tell you of it? What's the point of collecting another 2% gst?</p>

              <p>that was the old generation. most of which do not plan for the future. sure enough he may have made a mistake by not planning, who can blame him? giving him a choice he wouldn't wanna end up in this state would he?</p>

              <p>Agreed.  If given a chance, who don't want to plan for old age ... but sometime it is not as simple as that ... the recession now come more often and many have to dig deep into the pocket.  other are forced to use up their saving ...  by which time, age have catches up with you and you find yourself in a situation where saving is gone and too old to work...  so is he really at fault for not planning ...  really can't balme at all right  ?. </p>
              <p>I am fifty now ... the last recession wipe out my whole saving and I am still in debt..  although now got a job that pay quite ok, I am still paying debts ...  trying hard to save some money, just in case ... but what if something happen and I am back to square one where I have to dig into my saving and friends started to avoid me, will I not fall into this situation ?  there are reasons people is reduced to such state ... no one want it ok ? </p>
              <p>The stupid idiot that say people can choose how to live have not experience what life is all about..  just hope he doesn't fall into this trap. . ..   si gin na</p>

              <p>Si gin na - your grandma is 79 and her children is still asking money from her?  What kind of children they are ..  speak volumne on your behaviour here ...  Like you, I didn't pity those who beg for money especially those that were younger than my father.  I used to think, if my father at the age of 70 plus can still work, why can't these people take a proper job and earn themselve some pride.  Many of these were much younger than my father.</p>
              <p>I was wrong.  Everyone got their own story.  We must understand before we comment.  I was not 100% wrong then, but then I was not right too ..    Then I lost my job and need cash very badly, like the old man, I was only offered cleaner job.  How to support  family and take care of my parents..  I used all my saving and all the help I can get ...  I only managed to get a job many years later but which time, I am a pauper owning many many people money.  What pride do I have then ? </p>

              <p>I think the old man could seek for a flyer distribution job, but bring a chair to sit down... Maybe take less pay cuz he will be less active, but overall, he would still likely earn &gt;$300 per month...</p>
