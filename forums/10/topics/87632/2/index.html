But usually temp staff are paid by hours. say u work fr 9-6pm.. that's 9 hours but they'll pay 8 excluding lunch break.<br><br>I thought that was the norm and most companies practise that. I guess it became a sort of standards whether you are a hired temp direct from company or from agencies.</div>

Why? Because we have no leave and no off and no bonus. On top of that, we are paid by the hour. The worse thing is that you ofen have to clock OT when they are busy and when its more free, they don't allow you to clock more OT. Says must help company save money. Ya rite. And who likes to says those things. The PERM staff who have got nothing to lost!</div></blockquote>Frankly speaking, a temp staff is only employed to do some 'Kio Sai' work. Temp staff dun have any responsibility also, as in if company had some big problem, temp stuff is not responsible for anything. They do not play an important role in the company.<br><br>Of course, if they train you well, give u benefit and then one day u still have to go how?? They lugi mah.<br><br>Get use to it, that's the life of temp staff. Next time, u are a perm staff of a company, u will naturally know why they are treated this way</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Oh yeah. I think its just discrimination. They offered the previous staff before me a perm job lei. Cause he handsome and got degree and is low enough to boot lick all the office girls ma. Me? I only work and work. Give me a break. I don't see any reason to pretend to be happy and hee hee haw haw with them when my work flow don't stop and I need to concentrate on my job. My previous job also like that. That one I three day quit already. With health company. I temping with another ABC guy. He got a degree and they give him the easier job and dumb all the shit on me. The govt still complain bout birth rate. I think easier for them to set up a recruitment agency better. After all, see money and educational paper first only ma.<br><br>Once I get rich I will migrate for good man. With money, who scared of different environment. I don't believe with a billion in my hand I cannot twist the environment around to what I want. Or maybe I should continue to stay in Singapore and set up a company to make life a living hell for all those mba,phd,degree snobs working for me <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>
