            <div class='col-md body'>Recently been doing a temp job and I seriously feel that as temp staff we are discriminated. Why? Because we have no leave and no off and no bonus. On top of that, we are paid by the hour. The worse thing is that you ofen have to clock OT when they are busy and when its more free, they don't allow you to clock more OT. Says must help company save money. Ya rite. And who likes to says those things. The PERM staff who have got nothing to lost!</div>

And it can be heavenly to hell depending on your position and your negotiation skill. Typically, the drawback of contract work is that you do not enjoy any company benefit (No insurance, no CPF (maybe), no company discount etc...) since you are not recognised as a staff of the compnay in most cases. The good side is that those items are usually covered by higher pay (since you do not fall into any "company rule on salary range", but it is not necessary true.

            <div class='col-md body'>you r xanther,<br><br>as the job title say' temp' staff which means they are just temperary measure for the company to employ additional stuff to meet the seasonal demand of the job scope. although i must say some company simply exploit the situation and use temp staff for a long time.<br><br>reason, u r right, benefits. company no need to pay you anything. u pay as you work. company save heaps on these benefits. by the way, temp staff have to pay CPF also. unless undertable agreement. which means company save more too. but for most company they will pay to aviod problem with CPF board.<br><br>this is market situation. u r doing a temp job because either u cant find perm job or to subsidies your income. employer know that too. this is employer market.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>But I do know that temp staff are supposed to be paid for holidays according to the law. But MOST COMPANIES don't do that lor. If you complain to the MOM then they will sack you. I think the MOM shoud do something bout it. I thought Singaporeans was supposed to abide by all laws? Or maybe when the law is not convienient then can cover one eye is it?</div>
