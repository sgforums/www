What difference does it make whether you are a singaporean living in singapore or a msian living in msia? So i had to infer the real meaning of your question, which is about the cost of living. So my answer is, it doesn't matter whether i am either, because the cost of living would be about the same if i was out of a long term job, ceteris paribus. I have spent some time in a much much more expensive country before, without working, all i can say is that, if you are prepared for bad times ahead, then you can cushion the blow. No use blaming the system of any particular country, you have to do your own homework first.<br></div>
