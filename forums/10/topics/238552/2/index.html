            <div class='col-md body'>Some people resort to bullying tactics to get others to keep quiet in this forum. I was once accused of 'intimidating' one of the forumers, but it was because i was quite harsh in exposing a plagiarist (someone copied quotes of famous people but try to pass it of as his own).<br><br>From my experience in this forum, most of the bullying tactics are deployed by the anti-pap and they also accuse me of being a pro pap even though i keep saying that i'm not pro anything. It is rather sad that these bullies spoil the forum and make it difficult for those who want to have a fair debate.<br><br>In my opinion, their mission in this forum is to weed out those that they think are pro pap and so that it becomes a political tool for them. But the irony is that, they keep accusing the gov of deploying the very same tactics that they are using!!!!!!!!<br><br></div>
