Once a foreign doctor has received full registration with the SMC, he is free to practise wherever he wants in Singapore.<br><br>I think the minister wants greater competition in the private sector as well. For Singapore to become a medical hub, he would want lower charges in private hospitals to attract foreign patients. With more foreign doctors working as GPs in Singapore, the price differential between public and private sector primary health care will diminish. More patients will be diverted from the polyclinics to the GP clinics if the foreign GP charges less, further reducing the queues in polyclinics.<br><br>Singaporeans want cheaper healthcare but do not wish to pay more taxes, despite an aging population that will inevitably consume more of the same. Whilst doctors from China, Pakistan and India are paid far less than their counterparts in Singapore, bringing in these FTs is the logical solution.<br><br>Local doctors will have to differentiate themselves and offer higher value services if they wish to maintain their income. Alternatively, they may have to acquire qualifications that will enable them to work in Europe or the US. Those who cannot offer services beyond what the foreign doctors can provide will see themselves in a downwards spiral of increasing competition and decreasing wages.<br><br>Consumers will benefit though.

After 6 years, when foreign doctors can set up as GPs in the HDB estates, the impact will be felt most keenly by the neighbourhood GPs.<br><br>Singaporean specialists are protected by the specialist register, which requires postgraduate qualifications from the Royal Colleges in the UK/Australia, certificates from the American Boards in the US and the MMed degrees in NUS. Foreign specialists with equivalent qualifications are already drawing similar and higher salaries in private hospitals, so we will not see any significant influx anytime soon.<br><br>For patients, it will also be good for those with special communication needs. There will be doctors from China for those who speak Mandarin or dialects, doctors from India for those who speak Hindi and Tamil, and plenty of Malay doctors from Malaysia as well.<br><br>As for salary, I expect those with basic MBBS will see their salaries depressed by the influx of foreign doctors. Specialists with internationally recognized qualifications from US, UK and Australia will not be affected. They can also work overseas if they are already listed as a specialist elsewhere.<br><br>Financially speaking, it will be better for Singaporeans to study medicine in Universiti Malaya or UKM, where the fees are lower than in NUS. Upon graduation, work in Singapore and specialize in cosmetic surgery, aesthetic medicine or ophthalmology. You will earn alot more injecting botox to treat wrinkles and performing laser keratoplasty for myopia than treating patients with cancer or diabetes. If you continue to treat hypertension, cough and colds; you will see your salary drop. And by the way, forget about geriatrics or psychiatry. The old cannot afford to pay much and the insane can never pay.<br><br>There are winners and losers in globalisation. Some patients benefit, others are worse off.</div>

ThereÂ’s no need to recruit doctors from outside EU.<br>Lowering healthcare costs in Singapore is going to stay as a priority. Until we can produce enough doctors of our own, recruitment of foreign doctors will continue. We might even see some Singapore-born doctors working in UK coming back to Singapore.<br></div></blockquote>There will always be people who aspire to do medicine. However, if the salary of health professionals drop, the best students will be enticed to go into the finance sector where it is more lucrative.<br><br>There are sufficient junior doctors in the UK but there is a shortage consultants, particularly in some disciplines. Singapore specialists with internationally recognized qualifications can find jobs in the West if they wish to emigrate.<br><br>Singaporean doctors working in the UK are not going to return for lower pay. The job market in the UK is getting tighter but it is the junior doctors who are feeling the squeeze. Consultants and those who are advanced in their training will not be affected.</div>

One possible result of an influx of foreign GPs could be over-servicing.<br><br>It is a well-known fact that GPs earn a portion of their income by selling medicine in their clinics. If their income drops as a result of foreign doctors, there will be a tendency to over-prescribe to increase their income. The way to deal with this may be legislation requiring doctors to provide just the prescription to the patient who then purchases the medicine from the phamacy, if so desired. There will be a balance struck between the convenience but higher cost of medicine from the doctor's clinic versus the inconvenience of finding a pharmacy who stocks the medication.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Another likely development in the future will be a response from Singaporean GPs to deal with the influx of foreign GPs. I predict there will be a move towards legislation requiring that partners of a private GP clinic must have a graduate diploma of family medicine (GDFM) or higher postgrad qualifications.<br><br>Foreign GPs will be able to work as employees but not as partners in a clinic or be allowed to set up one of their own. It also means that local doctors who do not have such postgrad qualifications will suffer as a result and foreign GPs who acquire the diploma will be better off than the local doctor who doesn't. However, overall that would increase the standard of primary health care in Singapore.<br><br>I would advise all GPs in Singapore to acquire such postgrad qualifications quickly before they are pushed out of the market by foreign GPs. There is of course the option for older GPs of emigrating to retire in Indonesia, Malaysia or China; where the lower costs may mean they can still maintain their standard of living.</div>
