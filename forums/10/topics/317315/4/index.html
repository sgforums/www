              <p>1st let me say NS is not without good.</p>
              <p>In terms of time, NS undoubtedly takes up 2 - 2.5 years.</p>
              <p>Compared to foreigners who mostly no compulsor NS, this is the lead time they have against NS folks. During this 2- 2.5 years, they could have finished 1 diploma or 75% of a degree ahead of us or earned easily something like 70K more already.</p>
              <p>How can anyone deny this basic mathematical commonsense?</p>
              <p>As I said, there is good thing about NS - I have grown physically. </p>

              <p>Yeah, they mean the targets <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not being met on time</span>. Duh</p>
              <p>Ya, you can say anything. Even though someone did it, you would still say it is difficult to do and blame it on external events. Nobody ever said reaching targetted goals (other than unrealistically easy ones) were ever easy.</p>
              <p>Even if some other people can still do a lot of things during NS, you would still say it is difficult.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My point is, if someone can do it, so can I. And if I can do it, so can you. Everyone has an equally smart brain; it is just how you want to use it to achieve things.</p>

              <p>in germany, i think they serve 1 year. when i was there backpacking some years ago, i met a bunch of ORD germans. they were all piss drunk, celebrating their `release'. one funny thing is that they have marker pens with them and they ask anyone and everyone to `autograph' or pen best wishes on the cotton track suit that they were wearing. i was `honored' to be asked by that drunken bunch to sign on their tracksuits. i felt like lupe fiasco.</p>

              <p>basic military knowhow only took 3 months</p>
              <p>It is the courses after that. That can take long. For me, all the courses add up to around 13 months (including the BMT) if there were no break in between. Then following on is application practice of these things, through local and overseas missions. But maybe it is because of my vocation. Of course, for a person posted to be a clerk or RP or storeman, etc... Nothing much new to learn...</p>
              <p>Overall, useful learning period is about slightly longer than 1.5 years.</p>

              <p>basic military knowhow only took 3 months</p>
              <p>It is the courses after that. That can take long. For me, all
              the courses add up to around 13 months (including the BMT) if there
              were no break in between. Then following on is application practice
              of these things, through local and overseas missions. But maybe it
              is because of my vocation. Of course, for a person posted to be a
              clerk or RP or storeman, etc... Nothing much new to learn...</p>
              <p>Overall, useful learning period is about slightly longer than
              1.5 years.</p>

                  ideally, you make the best use of your time in whatever situation.

              <p>Sleeping is a necessity of life, but NS is not. If your body can take jus 4 hours of sleep, why waste 12 hrs sleeping? Unless ofcourse u enjoy it.... But nt everyone enjoy sleeping</p>

              <p>all your points are going nowhere. it is mandatory you do ns as

              <p>What i am saying is, if ns is shorten, we could have our freedom of time to pursue our own goals. I did not say impede growth, but Goal. whether the end result is good or bad after the 2 years, its still 2 years. Grow one certainty must, if not one is as good as dead.</p>
