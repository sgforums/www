              <p>Compared to Singapore, all have to be conscripted; sg males have
              no choice.</p>

              <p>If it was forced conscription in Germany, they wouldn't have

              <p>Why do we need 2 years for NS? since we know that not the entire 2 years is truly utilised, like ppl have mentioned. guard duty. vocation. etc...</p>
              <p>unless you aspire to be a security guard, then maybe stuff like guard duty will be helpful to you. but otherwise, its just more time wasting.</p>
              <p>field camp? maybe it was be applicable in the 1970s. but now, everywhere is HDB alr. the enemy will not occupy ur useless forests which has no strategic, economic purpose, and risk being suck dry by mosquitoes. any possible war in spore would certainly involve iraq style urban combat. so whatever they have for you is pretty irrelevant anyway. that is, unless you are the invading force, which is quite unlikely.</p>
              <p>if you slash away those irrelevant aspect of NS, and giving room for the typical singapore paranioa, 1 yr would do, actually.</p>
              <p>To win a battle, the troops need to shoot accurately. however, that doesn't really seem to be strongly emphasized in the army. the accuracy of the average infantryman is pathetic.</p>
              <p>as quoted, "the objective of war is not to die for your country, but to make the other bastard die for his" ~General George Patton</p>
              <p><span class="huge">but the spore army seems more interested in training you to run as fast as possible. is that what you mean by meaningful?</span></p>
              <p><span class="huge">yes, you do make friends in NS. thats something good. but, similarly, you can also make friends without going thru NS. </span></p>
              <p><span class="huge">2yr NS may not be such a waste if they offer decent, competitive SALARY, instead of the peanuts allowance. if they can't afford to pay ppl decently, den they jolly well don't FORCE ppl into this poorly paid "service". </span></p>
              <p><span class="huge">linking back to the issue about education. serving 2yrs of NS means u go to uni 2 yrs later. that means that your parents would have to work longer, to see you through your studies. (don't talk about prt-time job here, pls. that's only enough to offset your living cost, not your tuition fee). </span></p>
              <p><span class="huge">many of these parents are almost at retirement age when their child enters uni. so they have to work longer, to see that their children can complete his or her course without financial difficulties (e.g., having to drop out cos you can't pay the tuition fee).</span></p>
              <p><span class="huge">even if it does not set you back, it does set back those around you, economically or socially.</span></p>

              <p>And there you have it, your parents have sufficient funds to put you through UNI. That is already an advantage you have over other guys.</p>
              <p>With the two years, guys from poorer families can use that time to earn money to fund THEMSELVES through UNI.</p>

              <p>I can tell you I have enough funds to fund myself through uni without my parents. One of the reasons why it is CPF money was taken out because fixed D interest rates at that time was higher than the CPF rates.</p>
              <p>Even without CPF, one can get a bank loan, and the interest only starts accruing immediately after graduation, not during uni. Meanwhile, one can easily teach sufficient tuition students (or other ways of earning) to cover the uni fees. At 25~30 per hour for merely O levels, it is not hard at all, especially when you hear stories of people teaching up to 8 tuition students.</p>
              <p>And I have already mentioned earlier, I have a friend who have enough to fund himself 4 times the uni fees. He made all the money himself; he did not score as well, but i can definitely say he's much smarter. Both his networth and aspirations are much higher.</p>
              <p>So ya, it is not anyone's fault if a fresh uni grad has to finance his debt right?</p>
              <p>You see no reason for more than one year because you have no idea how multiple courses can add up to greater than one year for a number of vocations. That is, if you support the policy of NS in the first place.</p>
              <p>And from two years in army, you can already save enough for a uni education even from the little amount they pay in army. It depends on how you use the money. For a person with a long term goal to save up for uni during army, it is not very hard at all, with the current pay structure.</p>

              <p>i seriously agree. not all parents save up for their children' uni education.(can't bother to, can't afford to, etc)</p>
              <p>you can go uni straight after ns, and come out to work as a uni grad.</p>
              <p>those who can't afford to go uni,must first earn their tuition fee. an A level grad certainly does not earn much, to save enough to enter uni within 2 yrs of wrk. (if you are that poor to not being able to afford spore uni, most likely that you would also have to support yourself with ur own pay)</p>
              <p>that way, these ppl may lag behind by at least 4-5 yrs. are you willing to do that?</p>
              <p>don't tell me that 4 yrs is short. if it is, try holding ur breath for 4 yrs before you say anything. so isn't that an obvious impediment in the advancement of your future?</p>

              <p>I don't disagree that the 2 years could have been spent on advancing your career. I also don't deny that the pay is pittance. But if someone were to plan their lives, they would have factored in NS into the planning. You know it is going to happen, you know it will take 2 years, you will know what is in store for you; you can thus definitely plan it such that even with NS, you can still succeed. NS is not something thrusted at you out of the blue.</p>
              <p>Yet if one has nothing in mind at all, sad to say, NS will be a waste of time in one's development, since one will be in a 'protected' 2 years, safe from FTs, safe from being fired, being fed and paid an allowance, etc.</p>
              <p>Anyway as I have said, I'm still neutral to the NS policy, so I won't give a reply to the last few paragraphs.</p>

My current thinking is, since I'm already behind others, I will do my best to catch up. Like the friend I mentioned above, he will be starting on a full-time job and be part-time as a property agent. His aspiration is to start a company that is scalable and profitable within 5 years.</p>
