              <p>If you really think so, you are seriously a born loser. Yeah,
              just continue to put the blame on external events, and do nothing
              about it. Just continue to complain and rant. PAP likes people like
              you.</p>
              <p>I can't comprehend how blaming NS for delaying your life is
              stating the truth. You are not delayed unless you want it to
              be.</p>
              <p>Even without NS, I would still aim for the age of 28. What I
              have meant is that NS will not delay my target; I will still be
              able to earn enough by 28. Even for 26 years old, I have a friend
              who is planning to get engaged immediately after graduating (25
              yrs) and getting married by 26. It is what you plan and want; not
              because some sissy excuse that NS delayed you. And no, he's not a
              scholar or anything. It's because he planned way ahead of people,
              myself included.</p>
              <p>I have even a friend, my age, graduating this semster too, who
              has already $100k networth. His story is definitely amazing.</p>
              <p>Fact is, there are many people who have done it; NS did not
              delay them in their goals and dreams. If they can do it, so can
              you. But if you think you are delayed, then you are definitely
              delayed.</p>
                            </div>

              <p>oh dear, the name calling degenerated into born loser now? You are delayed regardless of whether you admit it/ try to convince yourself otherwise. PAP? erm coherence please?</p>
              
              <p>You can do what you want to make up for it. You can work extra hard to make up for the lost time, but the fact remains that if that time was not wasted, and you did the same amount of work, you would have gone further. </p>
              
              <p>For example, lets assume you aim to make 100k  by 28. not too hard a goal to be honest. So lets say no ns or a girl. you have after uni about 5 or  years to work to achieve that. If you had ns, you only have 3 years. 
              Assume pay = 20k a year, so meet 100k aim for girl/no ns.</p>
              
              <p>But only 60k with ns, ok lets assume 61 or 62 k with ns. Now you can say okz I won't let my time in ns be wasted, I'll go invest in shares, etc during the 2 years. So + 40k from investments.</p>
              
              <p>Doesn't change the fact that the girl/no ns couldn't have also invested in share for that 2 years and gained even more? =&gt; 100k + 40k. I'm not even adding in the compounding effect of having the capital to invest earlier.</p>
              
              
              <p>No amount of mindset reconfiguration changes that. Of course you could try to convince/delude yourself otherwise. You are delayed regardless of whether you think you are.</p>
              
              <p>On the other hand laying blame on external events/people does not mean not trying. Make no mistake about that. Should try to make the best that you can of the situation. But denial of it will not help.</p>

              <p>let's get real. in your living years, you have more than enough time and opportunity to make a difference. Age and opportunity cost of time has nothing to do with it. nelson mandela is a case in point, you make the most of your time in a meaningful way you deem fit.</p>
              <p>i am sure your life is not so one dimensional even if you want to be a scientist. there will be other life skills you pick up. i feel sorry for you when you say that you get into a vacuum just because you are in ns. ideally, you make the best use of your time in whatever situation. i would also argue that ns is character building in its own cynical ways.</p>

              same thing. Unless you set unrealistic or low goals. taking the previous example. with ns maybe you can set 100k by 28. 
              
              without ns you can set 150k.
              
              actually even dreams too like say atheletics, the 2 years means 2 more years for you to get better and get more results (like dreams of completing maybe 21 grandslams?) before you peak and go down. (yes I know it's more flexible nowadays, but still it's not that  flexible and only applies to national level athletes if i'm not mistaken.)

              <p><br> same thing. Unless you set unrealistic or low goals. taking the
              previous example. with ns maybe you can set 100k by 28. without ns
              you can set 150k. actually even dreams too like say atheletics, the
              2 years means 2 more years for you to get better and get more
              results (like dreams of completing maybe 21 grandslams?) before you
              peak and go down. (yes I know it's more flexible nowadays, but
              still it's not that flexible and only applies to national level
              athletes if i'm not mistaken.)</p>

              <p>No it is not. It just means whatever you do, you will require a different strategy.</p>
              <p>Eg: A goal to earn 100k in 3 years (if you are delayed by ns) entails a different strategy to earn 100k in 5 years</p>
              <p>Sure, you can say without NS, you could still earn it 2 years earlier. But my point, which you have till now not understood, is that if you want to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">reach a goal by a certain age</span>, NS will not delay you.  Back to your earlier example, you mentioned without NS, instead of marriage at 28, one would have been able to marry at 26. The fact here is, with or without NS, I will still set the target age at 28 years old. In that sense, NS does not delay me. It is only necessary to adopt a different set of strategies and mindset to reach that goal.</p>

              <p>it was 3 yrs in the first place.. people complain, they review, become 2 half, then now become 2yrs. some people suggesting abolish the whole thing.</p>
              <p>I think 2 yrs is just nice. for whatever to learn in order to protect.</p>
              <p>seriously, its 2 yrs or 3 yrs is also beyond control. they set we follow. they reduce we benefit.</p>
              <p>the idea still stands, if you can make it, the 2 or 3 yrs doesn't make much difference given guys are all doing it. females justify the idea of maternity that can occur anytime during their careers if they are not careful.</p>
              <p>its the same as if you are so good with convincing people of those ideals you spkers corner people have, you probably would have done it effortlessly and within a few valid posts. no need spend the entire time saying " LKY go go go" "die die die" etc..</p>

              <p><br>Definitely, everyone can use the 2 good years doing something better. But NS is a responsibility! Some things can't be justify with just economics or selfish thinking of doing productive things for yourself.</p>
              <p>National Service is like someone said before, is like doing cleaning in your house. even though it's a chore, but it is necessary.</p>
              <p>You save this 2 yrs, if you die early and young, what's the difference? If you spent that 2 yrs and die early and young, maybe we should say sad for you? Please, as long as someone dear to us dies young or old, we'll be equally sad.</p>

              <p>And it also depends on how you utilise your time. For example, what do most people do during nights out or weekends during NS? For me, I taught tuition.

              <p>What did another of my friends do? He started reading up on investment books. There were one or two more friends who did some of these more constructive things. But others? Eat, sleep, play, during the excessive 'rest' time.</p>

              It is you who do not understand that your point is moot. well unless you set goals without thought to possibility of accomplishing it or you just set easy goals.
              
              if you can change strategy to accomplish a goal faster, it merely means your previous strategy is lousy and you should have used the other strategy regardless of the 2 years or not.
              
              Or if you can still achieve a certain goal by a date without changing strategy then yoour target must have been pretty low.
              
              Not so sure about the married part although i would say being in the army for 2 years does reduce chances of meeting the right girl and thus possibly not letting you get married by 26 because of a lack of partner.(lets not talk about  desperate measures like foreign bride or settling for anyone...) But your targets should have been different depending on whether you had to waste that 2 years or not and thus you have the delay.
              
              My point to you is that you are delayed in that sense whether you want it or not.
              
              And lastly just meeting some targets set does not mean that there's no delay.

              <p><br> It is you who do not understand that your point is moot. well
                      unless you set goals without thought to possibility of
                      accomplishing it or you just set easy goals. if you can change
                      strategy to accomplish a goal faster, it merely means your previous
                      strategy is lousy and you should have used the other strategy
                      regardless of the 2 years or not. Or if you can still achieve a
                      certain goal by a date without changing strategy then yoour target
                      must have been pretty low. Not so sure about the married part
                      although i would say being in the army for 2 years does reduce
                      chances of meeting the right girl and thus possibly not letting you
                      get married by 26 because of a lack of partner.(lets not talk about
                      desperate measures like foreign bride or settling for anyone...)
                      But your targets should have been different depending on whether
                      you had to waste that 2 years or not and thus you have the delay.
                      My point to you is that you are delayed in that sense whether you
                      want it or not. And lastly just meeting some targets set does not
                      mean that there's no delay.</p>
