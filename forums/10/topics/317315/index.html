              <p>melbournite, i don't know why it is in your warped interest to lob rubbish over from where you are at in this forum. it serves no purpose, is illogical and lean towards incitement. i noticed there have been quite a fair bit of shit from you of late.</p>
              <p>i gotta ranked this as one of the most childish thread started by anyone. if you are still a singaporean, you are a bloody disgrace to the country. if you are aussie already, you need to grow up.</p>

              <p>on the other hand, the 2 years spent in ns should have made you a more mature person... you would have seen all the different characters that life can present to you... and all the kind of bullshit that you will encounter in your working life later on...</p>

              well, it's true that 2 or 2.5 years have been wasted. IT could have been used more productively like earning mroe money, getting your degree, gf/wife, or just enjoying yourself.
              
              too bad i guess being born as male singaporeans. life is really quite unfair and we'll jsut have to make do =?

              <p>The Ts has his point... Without the 2 years in NS, some ppl

              the gahmen could do it to reimburse us with better wages to

              efficient this can be shorten.</p>

              she wants to start a family, you are just a student, not so good
              right, so wait wait wait till 30 b4 marriage lor, see if she can
              wait...</p>
              <p>Lose interest in studies, I might agree, but thats only a few,
