Based on the 9 year stat lifespan allowed for cabs, that works out to max 2,000 cabs replaced per year... $7K 1 time off, goes down to abt $2.20 per day.. Even it's cheaper by $7K on avg now, can you garanutee that the COE prices will continue to remain at this rate for H2 06 and H1 07?<br><br>Even so, for now the rental is fixed for now, now it goes to the other component of the taxi rental scheme - Diesel cost... From 50c in 1995 to $1.10 now, it has gone up by double! For this I know you will blame the ruling party for everything, but never blame the West, Iran, North Korea for creating tensions in the global politics arena...
