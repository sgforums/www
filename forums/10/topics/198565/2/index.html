            <div class='col-md body'>Last time taxi fare 40 cents slowly 80 cents then $1.60 and $2.40 and now is increasing rapidly.. some might think that it is ok to rise the fare, but think twice, yes , we can take bus, mrt, but about how olds and handicapps? Some of them are having financial problems, and what more reasoning fuel, increase, COE and wadever?? Everything is increasing,fare is increasing, and our salaries has not been increasing, expenses are going high.. Even taxi-drivers said that increase of fare affect the rate of passenger boarding, they rather earn lesser..<br>To people who agree the rising of fares, fares has been increasing all over the years,you people wouldnt you like to take cab with starting price of $5~10 bucks in future, you cant tell..jams always occurs here, numerous traffic lights are planted, each red light increase as high as 50 cents.. ERP are to paid by passenger.. distance from east to west cost around $20 without peak and jams.. our neighbouring countries take onli 6 RM from east to west.. Does this means that local diesel has gold compound in its formula? Or the air-con being blown fromtaxi is pure 100% oxygen?<br><br></div>
