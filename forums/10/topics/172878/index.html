As for violence, every country has it, even Signapore: teen gangs, bullying, assault etcetc. Just because TNP/ST/TODAY don't report, doesn't mean it don't exist here. As for kids bringing guns and killing peers, the statistics are state-specific; some states, I'm sure, are pretty peaceful.</div>

When it come to chinese looking faces in america, those just migrated from Taiwan and China, speak much better chinese than singaporean and the ABC speak better american than us.
