              <p><strong>20 firms pledge to give one-off payout to help workers cope with inflation<br>By Wong Siew Ying, Channel NewsAsia | Posted: 29 May 2008 1946 hrs</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>SINGAPORE: About 20 companies have decided to adopt the National Wages Council's recommendation to give their rank-and-file employees a one-off lump sum payment to help them cope with inflation.</p>
              <p>"I am happy to say that in the next couple of weeks, we expect to see a few more companies following suit," said labour chief Lim Swee Say.</p>
              <p>Taking the lead was the government, Singapore's largest employer. It said on Wednesday that civil servants will receive a one-off payment of $100 to $300 along with their mid-year bonus of a half-month's pay in July.</p>
              <p>Mr Lim, the NTUC Secretary General, also said some companies have agreed with their unions on the amount of the one-off payment.</p>
              <p>He said the labour movement will not dictate the quantum of the payouts.</p>
              <p>Mr Lim said: "Most of them... target their workers earning below the median salary - S$2,500 and below. In some cases, they are providing a one-off payment ranging from S$200-S$500.</p>
              <p>"As far as the NTUC is concerned, we do not dictate a specific number, because at the end of the day, it depends, firstly, on the affordability of the companies, and how much the companies empathise and sympathise with the low-wage workers.</p>
              <p>"The least the employers can do is to show their sincerity and do whatever they can. The more they can afford... give more. The less they can afford... give less. But as my union leader says, something is better than nothing." - CNA/ir</p>

              <p>in bad times, any good news would be used for propaganda purposes. gahmen want public to know that they have <strong>recommended</strong> companies to give their empoyees bonus so they can take the credit if companies follow their "recommendation" while they still do not want to piss off the employers who do not want to follow their "recommendation".</p>
              <p>hey mr gahmen, if you want to take credit for helping sporeans during difficult times, do not make these type of "recommendations". make it a mandatory guideline.</p>

              <p>NWC has been used as an instrument to give ministers and all in the government exceptional bonuses and increments instead of wage adjustments for all employees.</p>
              <p>In any year it will be the same routine praising of their economic performance with civil servants benchmarked to GDP in receiving 2-3 months or more of bonuses and from this case to grant rewards to top or senior civil servants higher bonuses like 3-6 months partly in July and partly in Dec bonuses plus super-increments. Even if for years the private sector companies are not following such presumptuous taking of public monies for self-rewards of ministers and senior civil servants and even though only a few lucky companies in the private sector of not even 05 % of total work force are getting such NWC bonuses or increments NWC would still make it look like it is doing so for all employees in the work force. Is NWC truthful in making such recommendations or is it making such recommendations only to give some sort of legitimacy to the whole self-rewarding of their own kind.</p>
              <p>It is sad that while government warns against people for telling lies but this sort of NWC is being set up using the name of public to reward their own kind with impunity. Have any MPs noticed such inequity and speak up for the people?</p>

              <p>What I meant was that the main issue in this post is: NWC has been used as a tool to legitimize all the extraordinary multi-fold bonuses and salary increments majority in the private sector are not getting.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Because of NWC the ministers and top civil servants are getting all the extra multi-month bonuses twice a year once in July and another in Dec as done in NKF on top of their already above-market wages private sector employees except the very few lucky ones are not getting. That is a fact.</p>
