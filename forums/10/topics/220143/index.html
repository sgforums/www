Asians unlike the westerners are used to being ruled by autocracy leaders if not dictatorship.  However, as the societies mature and so are the people more affluent in the western values, people will start to demand democracy in their countries.<br><br>Sadly, people in Singapore do not see that. They (most of them) are just apathy to freedom and the notion of equality. Singapore society typifies George Orwell's "Animal Farm"... and guess what there will be no sympathy from the rest of the world because you guys are just to gutless to change. All you forumers can talk but when it comes to action (voting time), many of you guys just vote PAP!...<br><br>So, guess what do you get, higher GST, public transport fares, etc.... serve you right!<br></div></blockquote>Haha, no disrespect, but you'd be better off chanelling your efforts in some subtle way to alleviate global poverty or improve environmental conservation efforts instead of preaching political theories/reasonings to those already brainwashed by the fascists...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>one day i will stop Sg from pulling my nose, if maybe not by voting, then it will be by some and many other ways. E.g. become non-interested in politics, isolate from the civil bodies, find another corner in Sg with more life.<br><br>the Sg style of governing is dead non-creative, and by making 7, they made citizens less resourceful now. Take away this, take away that, and now take away another 2%, not for entertainment or luxury, but for paying the basics like food, water, clothes and transport.<br><br>Sg will profile the low-income, making sure the non-resourceful ones who get helped are not able to get anymore more resourceful in their lives, then they get helped. After being helped, they are still as non-resourceful and as helpless, because the cost of living is stripping away their resoucefulness. And if you are resourceful enough, no help sorry.<br><br>In precis, if you take money from somewhere to calm the dissents, and nothing is done to help people to be more resourceful, this is uncreative. But if you let people live in a more free land with a consistent cost, even without helping, more good-wills will bestowed by fellow-man onto another fellow-man. And if you really can help, this is creative.<br><br>I loathe the fact that i cannot find a place under my feet in Sg that makes me feel i am a free man. Every place is about cost, the property tax, and the consumer's tax (which means consuming drink, food, water, transport). After taking ownership of policies discussion, then another blow of 2% comes in for the family man. The Sg stlye of government is always this dampening, this burdenly nature.<br><br>2 steps forward, and 3 more steps to make a happy 10 round.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br></div>
