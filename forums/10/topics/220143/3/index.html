[/b]</blockquote>I believe what you have said is not absolutely true and accurate. Look at the current political landscape in Singapore. Are the oppositions' opinion given the necessary weigh and thought through by PAP MPs and ministers? Look at the constructive suggestions from Sylvia Lim about the Haze and what did she get in return?<br><br>Obviously, you are young and naive.  PAP fairs no better in disregarding oppositions. So you think they don't "shoot" too? On one hand they say Singapore needs credible oppositions, but when credible oppositions appear, guess what have they done? Either trying all sorts of dirty handed way to discredit the oppositions or even threaten them with lawsuits and jails... how many credible oppositions have left Singapore because of that?<br><br>If you have absolute power in Singapore, you can do anything and say anything with no repercussion.  I think you have to take a look at Singapore from 1959 till now and understand how PAP got into power and maneuver to grap absolute power. It reminds me of the Roman empire time. We see a Caesar and the so call Senate running Rome (or in this case Singapore).</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There is a big mis conception that SDP has no policies. What SDP is fighting for is not bread and butter issues like those of WP's and SDA's.<br><br>SDP is fighting for more fundamental issues like the constitution, fair elections, the makeup of the govt bodies, etc. They are just as important as the bread-and-butter issues. These are the issues MM Lee deemed NO-GO zone for many years. Any oppositions who touch these issues are gonna get really hammered by PAP and its machinery from the govt-bias judges to the mata who called themselves "non law enforcement" policemen.  The citizen of Singapore are too blinded by the mass "brainwashing" in our education system. Why do you think PAP consistently instill fear among us, citing racial issues to terrorism, using ISD as a weapon to detain any political activities or oppositions. Look at JBJ, Francis Seow, Tang Liang Hong for example. These are bright lawyers who dared the PAP to debate on the national constitution, human rights and freedom in Singapore that got themselves in PAP's cross hair.<br><br>SDP has not real agenda... just ranting for nothing....

What SDP is fighting for is not bread and butter issues like those of WP's and SDA's.<br><br>SDP is fighting for more fundamental issues like the constitution, fair elections, the makeup of the govt bodies, etc. They are just as important as the bread-and-butter issues. These are the issues MM Lee deemed NO-GO zone for many years. Any oppositions who touch these issues are gonna get really hammered by PAP and its machinery from the govt-bias judges to the mata who called themselves "non law enforcement" policemen.  The citizen of Singapore are too blinded by the mass "brainwashing" in our education system. Why do you think PAP consistently instill fear among us, citing racial issues to terrorism, using ISD as a weapon to detain any political activities or oppositions.

Too bad many Singaporeans cannot understand these higher level issues, thanks to our world class 'education' system.<br><br>PAP, with its media control has also succesfully protray Chee as a clown.

            <div class='col-md body'>I think it doesn't really matter even if the opposition parties do not have any concrete plans or solutions. At least they showed that they are still in-touch with the ground level and know what are the issues that are bothering the Singaporean commoner. Unlike the PAP MPs who seem to be living on Mars and do not know what's happening on Planet Earth.<br><br>Like the recent US elections. Even if you cannot get Bush out right now, at least you can put in the Democrats to check and balance his policies. Similarly, we do need a sizeable number of opposition to at least voice out against issues such as the FT policies, GST hikes etc.<br><br>I didn't get to vote at all my entire life because my district's always a walkover. Hopefully, there'll be enough opposition to contest my district next elections.</div>
