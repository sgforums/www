            <div class='col-md body'>aiya no matter who you vote for PAP sure win one...<br><br>I believe PAP use their authority as the ruling paty( note that they are the ruling party not the government.) and displace the different estates far apart from each other into the same GRC or what...<br><br>I think they count the number of voters from the previous election and join the lesser votes for the PAP to the area that have a majority support. Hence, no matter what, its a win win for PAP.<br><br>e.g. A part of Hougang belongs to Aljunied GRC when Aljunied is like miles away. Reason: Hougang GRC is being dominated by the workers party thus they cannot afford to lose. Thats why they combine this two areas together.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dr Chee on GST increase:-<br>14 Nov 06<br><br>Could there be anything worse than the Government raising the GST to 7 percent when Singaporeans are hurting economically, especially those in the lower income groups?<br><br>Yes, the spin that raising the GST would benefit those in the lower income groups.<br><br>Ignoring all the data showing that the poorest households continue to see their incomes fall, the Government makes bald assertions that its latest move to increase the GST would in fact benefit these people.<br><br>PM Lee Hsien Loong tells Parliament that it is good to increase the GST while the economy is good. This begs the question: Good for whom?<br><br>While the rich continue to get richer, many of whom are not Singaporeans, poor Singaporeans are left with nothing but desperation. The number of suicides, mental illnesses, crimes and divorces has mushroomed in recent years and is a result of the GovernmentmentÂ’s heartless economic policies.<br><br>All this while PAP Ministers live the good life by paying themselves millions of dollars in salaries, oblivious to the hardship and toil of the average Singaporean.<br><br>Yet the elite of society remains unrepentant. It even derides the working class for not having the wherewithal to make a success of life. Worse, PAP MPs continue to chide Singaporeans for Â“complainingÂ” and not taking enough responsibility.<br><br>In the meantime, Government entities like Temasek Holdings make reckless decisions that cost Singaporeans billions of dollars in questionable business ventures.<br><br>Is the GST hike, set to rake in almost $1.5 billion for the Government over two years, an attempt to recoup the losses made over the Temasek-Shin Corp and Singtel-Optus deals?<br><br>The horrendously careless acquisition of Shin Corp may incur losses of up to $3 billion while the much-criticised ownership of Optus stands to face a write-down of up to $8 billion.<br><br>In addition, has the Government been transferring our reserves to state-owned enterprises to prop these companies up since the Constitution was amended in 2004 to allow this?<br><br>Sadly, however, no answers will be forthcoming. Worse, the PAP is thumbing its nose at Singaporeans and saying: Â“So what if we increase the GST? What are you going to do about it?Â”<br><br>This is because the system manipulated by the PAP shields it from having to account to the people. It does not allow Singaporeans to speak and vote freely which means that we will continue to live under the thumb of the ruling elite.<br><br>Depending on their mood, ministers will from time to time encourage citizens to speak up. But make no mistake: this is not a change of heart. It is just a ploy to mollify the electorate and give them a chance to let off steam.<br><br>The Singapore Democrats feel the frustration and the anguish of the people. But without our rights to free speech and peaceful assembly, citizens are powerless to make the Government more responsive to our needs.<br><br>Without citizen power, the Government will not have to consult the people and it can do as it wishes, when it wishes.<br><br>The SDP will continue to raise issues concerning the welfare of our fellow citizens. This remains our priority. But in order to help the people to improve their quality of life and welfare, we need to work to take back our democratic rights without which we will continue to be at the mercy of the PAP.<br><br>Chee Soon Juan<br>Secretary-General<br>Singapore Democratic Party<br>14 Nov 06<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The problem is that the opposition does not put forward their own solution or their own plan. Maybe they do but people are not aware. So people perceive that they can't seem to stand on their own without the PAP. They have to leverage on PAP's mistakes and unpopularity instead of their own ability. They have to do better than that if they really wanna beat the PAP.</div>

Everything they say feels so close to the hearts of the average Singaporean... but why aren't they getting the majority of the votes?<br><br>Because they failed to win over the hearts of Singaporeans who paused a while to think... "So what if you raised all the problems and difficulties of Singapore citizens? We also know what we are going through now... What we want is solutions! Credible and feasible solutions! No blabbering of nonsense.... No promises that are simply impossible to achieve!"<br><br>The opposition has touched the hearts of many by raising out the current problems that we face... but they lack the solutions to win over the majority of the votes...<br><br><strong>**Will you vote for a movie critic to become a movie director just because he is good at criticizing movies?**</strong><br><br>Think about it...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In general, I agree that the opposition lacks quality. A few more Slyvia Lim, Low Thia Khiang and Chiam See Tong would be extremely helpful in their case.<br><br>However, taking a look from their position. Are they incapable of putting forward their solutions? I think if we forumers here can think of solutions, surely they could too.<br><br>So that leaves us with why are they not putting for their solutions? Before we condemn them as NATO, let's put ourselves in their position as examine these.<br><br>Let ask ourselves why CST did not promise 80million upgrade package to PP residents? Could he not thought of this? Or is it because they know they do not have the power/ authority to change this and so; instead of making empty promises, the best they can do is to highlight the flaws in PAP's policies and hopefully, the citizens will become aware and the PAP might decide not to implement these unpopular policies.<br><br>Take the "means testing" policy proposed by our health minister. Had the opposition put forth so many questions that he cannot answer, I believe means testing would be fully in place right now.<br><br>Then we move on to why did the opposition not have power to change things? Well, this is simple. It is because there are idiots who would constantly choose to be blinded and continues to hand absolute power to the ruling party.<br><br>Imagine a parliament where there are 20 or even 30 opposition. The ruling party would think thrice or four times before implementing any policies that might hurt the general population; instead of simply announcing new policy, roll them out and give the public crap excuse for doing it; expecting no retaliation in return.</div>

As many have said, raising GST is across the board, everyone suffer from it, so at the end of the day, it is still the same.<br>The SOLUTION is simple, raise tax on the high income, distribute them to the low income.<br>However, this will not be done.. u know why?<br>Simply becos, our dear Ministers, MPs etc belong to the super rich category, u think they will raise their tax of the rich and decrease their income?<br></div>
