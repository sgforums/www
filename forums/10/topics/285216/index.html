I believe it is hypocrisy.<br><br>Only openness, accountability and transparency can help us to upgrade our governing system.<br><br>Such a problem affects all aspects of government from the way draconian laws are being passed to change our election sytem to GRC thereby serving the narrow-minded agendas of the ruling party to the way government is taxing the citizens with all forms of direct and indirect taxes to the latest postponement of CPF withdrawal drawdown age from 55 to 85.<br><br>There is a lot of hypocrisy in the way policies are arrived and implemented.<br><br>So I would rather that you first understand the real problems first before starting to go into the next level of which type of power should be granted to the ISD or the state or PM to help them in doing a better job.<br><br>Priority should be accorded to the collective decision implementation processes which will ensure finally that leaders do not abuse power and can answer to queries of all kinds as posed by Jimmy Carter to his president without any one being persecuted.<br><br>Have our leaders the true talents to govern the country with fullest support of all citizens based on such openness ? What is wrong with evolving to such an open and accountable governing system for stability, law and order and progress from support and understanding of the whole population.</div>
