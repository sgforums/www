            <div class='col-md body'>China urges United Arab Emirates to stop official contacts with Taiwan<br><br>Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Qin Gang on Friday urged the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to stop official contacts with Taiwan.<br><br>Qin made the remark when asked to comment on the UAE's allowing Taiwan leader Chen Shui-bian to pass through its territory.<br><br>"The United Arab Emirates ignored China's strong opposition and insisted on allowing Chen Shui-bian to pass through and have political activities. It violated the UAE's commitment to sticking to the one-China policy and brought about a negative impact on the China-UAE relations," Qin said.<br><br>"We have expressed strong dissatisfaction about this and put forward a serious presentation to the UAE," Qin said. "We require that the UAE immediately stop official contacts with Taiwan in any form."<br><br>Source: Xinhua</div>

Ever since the Democratic Progressive Party(DPP) came into power in the year 2000, everything is going downhill. Taiwan's unemployment rate is soaring. As a result their crime rate is also skyrocketing.

Here's the related article:<br><br>http://atimes.com/atimes/China/FF30Ad04.htm<br><br>Currently I am living in China. I have met lots of Taiwanese in Shanghai, Hangzhou, Guangzhou etc. The Taiwanese I met can be classified into 3 groups: students, white collar middle class and businessmen. Whenever I ask them the reasons for coming to mainland China, the answers they give me are always the same, which are:<br><br>1) We are sick and tired of the political struggles between the Pan-Green and Pan-Blue parties.<br><br>2) Taiwan's unemployment rate and costs of living are skyrocketing and we have no choice but to migrate elsewhere in search of a better life.<br><br>What does the above tells u of the reality of Taiwan? If Taiwan is indeed far more developed than China, why are so many Taiwanese fed up and pessimistic with Taiwan and prefer to migrate to China, USA, Australia and other places? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Mainland China is already the 4th hottest destination for emigrating Taiwanese.

If China is an oppressive dictatotorship, why are there so many Americans and other foreigners migrating there to work and live despite the fact that they could be making more $$$ elsewhere?

Even in Singapore a country which started modernising a few decades earlier than PRC, there are so many such cases. Here are just a few examples:<br><br>http://www.singapore-window.org/sw03/031124cp.htm<br><br>http://www.singapore-window.org/sw00/000614ai.htm<br><br>http://www.singapore-window.org/sw02/021127sc.htm<br><br>http://www.singapore-window.org/sw02/020530hr.htm<br><br>For such a small country like Singapore, the number of human rights violation and political dissidents is quite scary. Francis Seow and Tang Liang Hong are still in exile. Look at these:<br><br>http://www.singapore-window.org/sw01/011206au.htm<br><br>http://www.singapore-window.org/sw01/011124sf.htm<br><br>http://www.singapore-window.org/sw99/90501sc.htm<br><br>Yet not a single Singaporean has the guts to question why the government is doing these.

Do u know that Indian security forces are massacring civilians in the thousands over there? Look at these:<br><br>http://www.indiatogether.org/peace/kashmir/articles/indhr.htm<br><br>http://www.phrusa.org/research/torture/torink.html<br><br>http://www.hrw.org/reports/1999/kashmir/doda.htm<br><br>After reading the above links, I think that anyone with a conscience should rally behind the people of Kashmir and support their quest for independence.
