            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Atobe,<br><br>Thank you for your kind infos'. I have done a search on this company and he is still a director of this pte ltd company. Sometimes, the Rcb takes a while to have this info updated. I will try to do another search again.<br><br>I have also lodge a complain to the " Insolvency &amp; Public Trustee's Office " giving them all hard copies prove and they will investigate this case.<br><br>Please correct me I if I'm wrong about my lay man underdstanding..<br><br>that any undischarged bankrupt is not suppose to issue any cheques signed by him &gt;$500 to any person or entities and by doing so is amounting to " cheating / cbt ". It is than the duty of the police to take action or this is a civil case?.<br><br>Given the understanding by the senior investigating officer, from police station, that there is no law which states that a bankrupt is not allowed to issue any cheques signed by him. If this being the case, than I think this grey area should be amended and addressed to read aloud more clearly.<br><br>It doesn't make any sense that a official assignee administer all the affair of the bankrupt and the law does not forbid him to issue cheques, be it personal current or company current account and worse of all, he is still the Pte Ltd company Director.<br><br>I think the law is complicated already, shouldn't such clear cut case law be enforced more straight forward than having to go round the bush and some parties are also trying to dodge their responsibility.<br><br>These are alll my opinions. I think the public have always taken for granted that the police will take actions for cheating case, etc.... but many are unaware that there are many grey areas which can or cannot be enforced, all subjected to interpretations by the parties concerned, very confusing isn't it?.<br><br>Thank you all for your patience. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>

I think a task force should be formed and to investigate into selective bankrutcy cases and try to uncover bankruptcy involving cheating or some sort. In this way, will also discouraged such activity. This task force can be made up of volunteers, trained by qualified departments and empowered to conduct investigation into such cases.<br><br>I came into contact with debt collection companies, and during this period came to know of many cases which they have handled which are actually debts incurred by debtors through some form of " conning " and such creditors resorted to debts collection services because they are not getting anyway using the legal channels.<br><br>They paid huge sum of $$ but at the end of the day just got judgement and have to spend more $$ to follow up but result is still disappointing.<br><br>There are so many such victims and only if the police will to take some responsibility and charged culprits, than, these will definitely greatly discouraged such scheming " conning " plans by would be cheating case.<br><br>I'm inclined to believe many culprits have evaded prosecutions, hence, they are motivated to continue and expand such activity becasue they got away easily from the law for what seems to be criminal but actually they are free to continue.<br><br>Above are just my opinions and without any implications against any departments or people.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>
