            <div class='col-md body'>I've never seen a boat or warship damaged to that extent before.  At least not from a war shot.<br><br>To totally ram off the entire aft section, one conclusion can be drawn, nobody realised the collision course in time.  At least the RSS Courageous did not see it coming at all, else given its light weight to power ratio, would have been able to move out of the way.<br><br>Question is, given current technology, isn't ship radar capable of detecting a ship so big like the ANL Indonesia coming at them?  Considering the RSS Courageous is afterall, a warship.   I suspect, the RSS Courageous was not "supposed" to be sitting where it was.   And it probably did not turn on surface detection systems, maintaining EMCON (Emissions Control).  The reason why ships are under EMCON is that they are not supposed to be there, and don't want ANYBODY to know that they are there.  It would also explain why the 4 service women, some of them being electronics and communications specs were not on duty at that time.<br><br>I've heard stories of entire US CVGs and SURTASS forces operating under EMCON, disappear from one location, then appearing at another without being detected in transit.  Like Ghosts on the the sea.<br><br>I remind everybody that this is my own conjecture, on what could have happened.  It is not the truth, but a guess.  And whether the RSS Courageous was really operating under EMCON, keeping a watchful eye on Pedra Branca, we do not know.  But my guess is that, because they were sent there and not broadcasting any coordinates.  And in an effort to be undetected by any foreign military intelligence gathering platforms, they were totally undetected by the ANL Indonesia, that was sailing right into them.<br><br>IF such tragedies can happen during peace time, I do not want to know what will happen in a war.<br><br>My admiration and salute, to the Guardians of our waters.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Update on the EMCON Theory.<br><br>"The vessel's radar warning receiver is the NS 9010C, supplied by Elisra based in Bene Beraq, Israel. The NS 9010C radar warning receiver performs rapid detection and analysis of hostile radar transmissions and features instantaneous frequency measurement (IFM), instantaneous direction finding (IDF) and threat analysis. "  Quote Naval Technology.com on the Fearless APV.<br><br>Even under EMCON, passive warning systems such as these would have been in operation.  Which means the Courageous SHOULD have detected the ANL Indonesia's radar if it had one.  However, given the nature of such ESM systems, the Courageous had to be moving in order to have a proper estimate of the Ship's location and range, depending on signal strength and bearing.<br><br>IF the Courageous was not moving, it would only have an increasing signal strength, and ONE line of bearing.  Signal strength and ONE line of bearing would not have been able to provide sufficient estimate of the incoming vessel's range and speed.  It would only provide a bearing and perhaps course.<br><br><img src="http://www.naval-technology.com/projects/fearless/images/fearless5.jpg"><br><br>How can a vessel as maneuverable as this been unable to detect, and avoid collision with a ship so big?  Sure the ANL Indonesia was moving at a fairly high speed, 16 knts.<br><br>Again, the guess is, the RSS Courageous might have been ordered to hold her position, anchored or not.<br><br>Summary of theory, RSS Courageou under EMCON.  MAY have detected ANL Indonesia with passive system, but no way to confirm her speed, range and course as she was sitting still.<br><br>Will continually update as soon as I get more information.</div>
