Forget about the Malaysian Conspiracy theory. It does not make sound sense to listen to course and speed direction transmitted by a land base control when you are about to enter the Singapore Straits at night. The Malaysians may make stupid comments but I hope that they are rationale and pragmatic people deep down. An intentional act to cause the collision would be stupidity and recklessness of the first degree.</div>

Looking through the posts, I thought that I will shed a light as far as I think is allowed<br><br>1. APV has a mixed crew and the 4 servicewomen are organic components of the ship crew. We will always have onboard technicians (Weapon Electronic Technicians - WET/Engineering Tech - ENT/Marine Engineers - ME) The Combat Technician (CT) scheme adopted by the RSN has futher blurred the distinction between combat and technical personnel. Regardless of whether defects are present, technicians will always be onboard<br><br>2. The possibility of the radar and the engine been down simultaneously is extremely remote. The 2 systems are separate. RSN ships will never go out for patrol missions if any one of its major system is down.<br><br>3. ESM equipment is never used for collision avoidance. In peacetime patrol mission, the aim of the mission is to maintain surveillance of our waters. There is no reasons to maintain radar silence. A commerical navigational radar would be sufficient in normal patrol missions and the Kelvin Hughes radar installed onboard the APV is an excellent navigational radar. The signature of it is probably well known. Therefore no reason to mask the signature by employing EMCON<br><br>4. It is highly improbable that the RSN ship is at anchor especially on patrol. We need to be responsive to any contingencies that might arise during a patrol mission and being anchored will hinder us immeasurably. Should we need to be at a position, the waterjet propulsion system of the APV/PV allows you to literally hover at the point. The propulsion and steering system of the ship is reponsive as can be seen in the pictures. Watchkeeping officers onboard ships were taught to keep away from container ships and other commercial vessels due to the slower responsivenss of those ships. The distance apart under normal circumstances would be about 3 - 4 cable at least which works out to be about 500m. RSN ships will not coem close to container ships unless in very congested waters such as in the main Singapore Straits or unless in extraordinary circumstances.<br><br>5.

So, given the fact that there was a collision, the ESM readings should have been pretty high, given a commercial nav radar.  The operator will realise that the contact is VERY CLOSE.

But should the ship be at sailing at a slow speed - Triangulation would not be possible. Furthermore the commercial ship would be using a commercial navigational radar and this will not incite any interest from the part of the ESM operator. Furthermore in congested waters like the Singapore Straits, a filter should have been operational in the system to sieve out background electronic information such as commerical nav radar transmission. This will explain why an increase in intensity of the commercial nav radar system was not detected.<br><br>Also, as a patrolling warship, the chances of the APV being achored is VERY unlikely.  I totally agree.  So why was it NOT in motion?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> We do not know the motion status of the ship at the moment of coilision based on released information. However it could be that the APV was travelling at a very slow speed such as 3 - 4 knots. One of the patrol aims is to show our presence in our waters and you do not need to move at a high speed to do so. Moreover surveillance in the entire Singapore Straits is covered not just by the patrol ships but also by the land base systems such as the VITS administered by MPA. Should any need arise, the APV can be summoned to the required location at short notice.<br><br>EMCON includes shutting off of EVERY emitting device. Navigational radar, ship light included.  U're not supposed to even light a cig.  Communications on VERY secured channels only.  If the APV's nav radar was on, it would definitely have seen the giant ANL Indonesia coming at it.

Which is more likely given the conclusion that warships would not sail with major systems non-operational.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> The navigational radar is most probably turned on. It will be easy to blame human negligence for not spotting ANL Indonesia in sufficient time to prevent collision. However assuming that human error was not involved in the radar detection (the visual lookout should have spotted the container vessel in ample time given the prevailing visibility), it could be that the vessel approached the APV from the blind arc of the radar. However this in no way excused the failure of not spotting the container vessel visually.<br><br>Personally, to me, the RSS Courageous was NOT operating under normal perimeters.
