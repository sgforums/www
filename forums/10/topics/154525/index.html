            <div class='col-md body'>Sept 23, 2005<br>SGX not the sole guardian of capital markets: Chairman<br>Pillay says exchange cannot do much about fraud unless whistle-blowers act<br><br>By Lee Su Shyan<br>COMPANIES CORRESPONDENT<br>THE chairman of the Singapore Exchange (SGX) rejected claims yesterday that the organisation had failed to do enough to prevent recent corporate wrongdoing.<br><br>Mr J.Y. Pillay said he sympathised with shareholders caught up in scandals such as those of China Aviation Oil (CAO) and Accord Customer Care Solutions (ACCS) but he emphasised that the SGX is 'not the only guardian of the capital markets'.<br><br>His remarks came during a question-and-answer session that was part of the stock exchange's annual general meeting.<br><br>Given the spate of scandals over the past year, it was no surprise that an out-of-pocket investor would have something to say.<br><br>The shareholder, who prepared a two-page statement, told Mr Pillay: 'I suffered losses in Informatics, CAO and ACCS. Luckily I do not have Citiraya shares. How much loss must I suffer from people's non-compliance, dishonesty and criminal acts before you take preventative measures?<br><br>'You owe investors a good job by tightening the screws to eliminate breaches so SGX will remain a safer place than a casino. I have left my nest egg in your hands.'<br><br>Mr Pillay gave one of his longest answers of the session: 'First of all...I sympathise with your losses. We are not the sole and entire guardian of the capital markets. We have a role to play to ensure listing rules are properly conceived and enforced.'<br><br>He said there are other 'organs of state' which come into the picture in relation to supervisory, regulatory and enforcement areas. He cited the code of corporate governance: 'It is promulgated by another government agency and implemented through the SGX, but we don't decide it or control the contents.'<br><br>The code is a voluntary one that gives guidance to listed companies on the composition of the board of directors, for example.<br><br>Mr Pillay said that when it comes to fraud, there is 'little the authorities can do unless matters come to their attention through whistle-blowers'. He added that he felt the scandals were likely caused by fraud or 'other violation of law. The law will enforce its verdict accordingly'.<br><br>Another question yesterday centred on SGX's aim of increasing retail participation above the current level where only one in eight retail accounts are active.<br><br>The question tied in with Straits Times reports that SGX wants to charge broking firms for access to live prices. If brokers pass the costs on, retail investors who trade over the Internet may think twice about trading.<br><br>SGX chief executive Hsieh Fu Hua said that even as such fees are levied in other countries, retail demand has also grown.<br><br>As SGX also won shareholder approval for a performance share scheme, it will cease to grant stock options.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Former Singapore corporate pin-up boy charged with defrauding Nokia<br><br>Saturday September 24, 2005, 6:14 pm<br><br>SINGAPORE, (AFP) - A budding entrepreneur once hailed as the poster boy among Singapore's financial circles has been charged with padding repair bills to mobile phone-maker Nokia, a report said.<br><br>Businessman Victor Tan, 34, founder of mobile phone service firm Accord Customer Care Solutions (ACCS), faces 43 counts of conspiring to prepare "fictitious warranty repair claims of Nokia mobile telephones," the Straits Times said.<br><br>The charges centre on monthly bills totalling some 4.3 million Singapore dollars (2.56 million US) that were sent to Finnish-based Nokia last year for repairs of phones still under warranty. Many of the repairs were allegedly never carried out.<br><br>Similar charges were levelled against 11 other members of his firm on Friday, including former ACCS chief financial officer Yip Hwai Chong, 38, and ex-general manager Damien Ang, 35.<br><br>An alleged key member of the conspiracy, Tan was also accused of dishonest behaviour as a director of ACCS by not informing other board members of the fictitious repair claims.<br><br>Meanwhile, seven Nokia customer service centre managers have also been charged with creating false warranty repair jobs. Six have resigned or had their services terminated, while a seventh was suspended on Friday.<br><br>"Nokia is in discussions with the new management of ACCS to recover any fictitious warranty claims and invoices," the Straits Times quoted a Nokia spokesman as saying.<br><br>ACCS, which became a listed company in 2003, was a former darling among stock market punters, as was Tan, a former award-winning entrepreneur once lauded as one of Singapore's youngest chief executives.<br><br>Mr Victor Tan was named the Emerging Entrepreneur Of The Year. As CEO &amp; Managing Director of Accord Customer Care Solutions Limited (ACCS), Mr Victor Tan saw the tremendous potential in the after-market services (AMS) business for mobile phones and set out to build a global local network through ACCS. Today, ACCS serves the top brands in mobile communication devices and high-tech consumer electronics products across 15 countries in the region. Under Victor TanÂ’s visionary leadership and management, ACCS was listed in March 2003 and is currently valued at a market capitalization of S$622 million. ACCS was voted Best Newly Listed Company in Singapore, Sixth Overall Best Managed Company in Singapore and the second Best Small Cap Company in Singapore in the Asiamoney 2003 poll.<br><br></div>
