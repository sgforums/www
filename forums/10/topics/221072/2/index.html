When they restricted boys to their building blocks and girls to their cooking sets, they are just trying to shape the child up into society's expectations. Why is it that boys are not allowed to cry? Why girls are allowed to say and express their fustrations and emotions at that point of time? Isnt this the loophole of social ethnics which have shape us up all into one people with one thought? Allowing boys to cry does not make him less manly nor threaten his masculine status and vice versa for girls. The misconception has deepened into 'mordern' society now a days that homosexuals are being discriminate by fellow 'normal' human beings.<br>It have been proven that being a homosexual can be due to their biological set up and the environment that they were brought up in.<br>Please refer to the website below for more information.<br>http://etd.rau.ac.za/theses/available/etd-09072005-083731/restricted/RESEARCHPROPOSAL2005.pdf</div>

It all boils down to the social norms.<br>it would be disastrous if children view homosexual marriages as acceptable and actually contemplate getting into one when they would have otherwise been hetreosexuals.<br><br>Homosexual acceptance is like a special order at mcdonalds. Society can change their mindset towards these homosexuals and occasionally the special order can be prepared. However, we cannot change an entire menu just to suit these people.<br><br>[/b]</blockquote>ok i get ur point.. it simply boils down to our social value of the majority. but i couldnt be surprised if these values and social norms will change along the years, hard to say though but one thing for sure discrimination will always exists.. hard to eradicate<br><br>Actually what is wrong with Homosexual marriages ? what is wrong being urself and being a homo? People fear homo becos they do not understand what it is like being a homo, same-sex love is wrong. Can tell me what is so abnormal abt following ur own heart...?<br><br>u find it wrong becos of UR own values????.. but does it mean that it should defer other homo people from finding happiness...<br><br>u must get married then can buy HDB flats with some discounts... the benefits of marriage here..<br><br></div>

This can be found in my above reply which has a website attach. You can also type in homosexuality in any search bar and many articles about how homosexuality come about is due to hormonal and genetic problems is plenty. Hence, these people only followed the calling towards their nature and did not attemp to unbalance it.<br><br>Legalising same sex marriage does not have any negative message sent to the public. It is not up to the person to choose whether they want to be gay or lesbian, its in them, they cant choose. So by legalising same sex marriage, the government is just granting greater freedom and recognition to these people. It does not affect the heterosexuals as this has got nothing to do with them.<br><br>We should also educate our future generation on homosexuality that it is not wrong. And they should try to understand and change the negative attitude which many people nowadays have towards homosexuals. These discriminating attitude are the greatest barriers towards the freedom of these people.</div>
