              <div><span style="font-family: times new roman; font-size: 130%;">In
              this article, I’ll be writing on a recent and continuing history of SM
              Goh Chok Tong with a slight twist. There are little doubts that he was
              a popular PM in comparison with his predecessor and successor. His
              “softer” approach and style was a breath of fresh air to many. Upon his
              stepping down from his premiership, there have been many articles
              written on his policies, his leadership and his achievements. This will
              not be one of them. Simply, if I do write on those standard contents,
              you will be better off reading the Straits Times than this lengthy
              blasphemy (not that Straits Times always purport the unbiased truth!).<br><br>The
              first lesson of observing political truths is to never treat an entity
              as one (btw, who am I to teach lessons of politics…Ooops). In other
              words, is never to stereotype or characterize the entity. What is the
              PAP? What characteristics does the PAP MPs or Ministers have? These
              questions are fallacies. Behind the scenes of unity, there may be
              differences in opinions, characters and ambitions. There is no PAP
              character or person but is just an amalgamation of diverse people and
              their motives. <img style="margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px; float: left;" src="http://static.flickr.com/86/215162059_f753864711_m.jpg" border="0" alt="">Anyway,
              many of policies made within the Cabinet are not unanimous. That is
              politics; the innate and unseen character of each participating entity.
              Of course, like what Lim Kim San mentioned about assessing people is
              that one could only briefly know the other person through observation
              and instinct. This is what made assessing politicians so difficult. In
              the public face and media spotlight, we thought we know them like
              friends but there are more that we don’t know than we thought we know.
              The resulting impact is that we place mental and perception brackets on
              their names, like Lee Kuan Yew (the Authoritarian), Goh Chok Tong (the
              Good Guy) and the Cabinet (the group of “Yes-men”) based on what the
              media feeds to us. This article (or blasphemy, depending on how you see
              it) will just add fuel for your thoughts with statements from GCT and
              on GCT. Ultimately, this blog can’t claim to know or speak the unspoken
              truth on GCT or any politicians, but just form an alternative
              perception track. I’ll leave you to make your own conclusions.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">His Political Beginnings</span></strong><br>In
              LKY’s memoirs (Chapter 41 – Passing the Baton, Pg 735), he mentioned
              about how he ease the way for GCT to succeed him. For those who have
              not read that chapter, I strongly recommend that you do. That chapter
              is very interesting as words are contained within words. Depending on
              which angle you read, you will get a different story.<br><br><img style="margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px; float: right;" src="http://static.flickr.com/64/215162051_874ba9198c.jpg" border="0" alt="">First,
              we must know that LKY’s book was an international bestseller across
              many countries, and read by most leaders around the world. Second fact
              is that whatever he wrote in his book about GCT or LHL would be what
              foreign leaders read about them. In that chapter, he described GCT as
              “not a natural politician…tall, gangling and awkward, and spoke English
              with a heavy Hokkien accent.” This is not the best description for the
              person who is about to succeed you. LKY also described GCT as
              “self-conscious and without the gift of speech-making but had ability,
              dedication and drive, and was interested in people”. Later LKY even
              mentioned that he found an English women to teach GCT to speak in a
              more relaxed and natural way. For a person who will be Prime Minister,
              he still needed someone to assist him to look for a tutor? This might
              have pointed out that GCT wasn’t really in the “driving seat” but had
              an instructor beside him, constantly.<br><br><img style="margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px; float: left;" src="http://static.flickr.com/60/215165939_dcedbfb2df.jpg" border="0" alt="">Another
              interesting point to the chapter was GCT not wanting move into LKY’s
              office. “I did not suffer any withdrawal syndrome. Chok Tong did not
              want to move into my old office in the Istana Annexe, which I had
              occupied for 20 years since I moved from City Hall, but chose to create
              a new office on the floor above mine.” Aside from the niceties that one
              might think of when he first read it, there might be more significance
              in that statement. Maybe LKY was literately the “power behind the
              throne”, or maybe it suggested how much power LKY had and wish to
              remind GCT about it. More importantly, what is the message that LKY
              wants to bring to all the leaders in the world about his deputy?<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Building His Own Legitimacy</span></strong><br>Perhaps
              the second lesson of politics is the word, “legitimacy”. Whether be it
              an organization or leader, it or he has to have some form of
              legitimacy. The forms of legitimacy includes: mandate from people
              (elections), leadership charisma (eg: Mao Tze-Dong), expert knowledge
              (for technocrats), military power (like in Indonesia) or economic
              performances. The last form of legitimacy, economic performances, is
              developing into the most important form for any political office. For
              the case of PAP, the core strength is their ability to provide economic
              success and is unmatched by any parties. No opposition parties came
              close to challenging them in that area. The trends for the past few GEs
              was for the oppositions to divert away from economical issues and focus
              on other side issues such as human rights infringements.<br><br>For
              leaders, they too have to build their own legitimacy and mandate as
              well. “Inherited” authority will not last long without legitimacy.
              Similarly, if a leader managed to last long (in at least a
              semi-democratic country), you could somewhat say that he is not riding
              on “inherited” authority but has some form of legitimacy (yes, I am
              hinted at someone).<br><br>In the case of GCT, many assumed that he was
              a seat-warmer, sandwiched between the Lees. In his early political
              years as PM, he needed to gain support from three areas, within the
              Cabinet, within the Party cadres and with the Singapore population. His
              apparent tactics was to first gain the mandate of the Singaporeans by
              General Elections then gradually make changes within the party and
              Cabinet to place the men loyal to him in key positions. Doing the
              opposite might anger his predecessor who still has considerably power
              and influence over all matters. He has seen lessons from his
              neighbouring counterparties and will be careful not to make the same
              mistakes. However, his election mandate will not come easy. Since
              Independence, LKY has been Singapore’s only Prime Minister. For GCT to
              step into his shoes and gain the confidence of the population was no
              easy feat.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Altered Ego in Elections</span></strong><br><img style="margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px; float: right;" src="http://static.flickr.com/85/215165936_461a4d73f5.jpg" border="0" alt="">However,
              his first GE (1991) was setback from him and probably changed his
              “election personality” several degrees. In the 1991 GE, the PAP lost a
              record of 4 seats to the opposition, one of which was his female Senior
              Minister of State, Seet Ai Mee. Other wards, such as Bukit Batok, were
              barely won by the PAP. That election was the turning point of his
              “election mentality”. Since then, he has opted to be tougher during
              elections with his words and actions.<br><br>In the 1997 Election, he
              was determined to be tough on the Oppositions and would take them out
              by any means, previously endorsed by LKY. During the “Battle of Cheng
              San”, GCT gave this message,<br><br></span><blockquote>
              <p><span style="font-family: times new roman; font-size: 130%;">“You
              decide. You choose Tang Liang Hong, Jeyeratnam, raise their status and
              lower the Prime Minister’s the Deputy Prime Ministers’ stature, in
              Singapore, internationally, that will have very serious consequences.”<br><br>“What
              we are now doing is to… put all the chips on the table. It is a
              winner-takes-all situation. MRT, LRT, Punggol 21, upgrading, estate
              improvement, libraries, kindergartens, better schools… all these are
              plans which… have put to the people.”<br><br>“We win, Cheng San will
              get not just the attention of Lee Yock Suan and the team. Cheng San
              will get the Government’s attention, my attention, Lee Hsien Loong’s
              attention, Tony Tan’s attention. Even in Marine Parade you don’t get
              such attention. So you win big or you lose big. So tomorrow, you have
              to decide.”<br></span></p>
              </blockquote>
              <div><span style="font-family: times new roman; font-size: 130%;"><br>Of course, we all knew what happened to Tang Liang Hong and JBJ after that Election.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Era of Disposed Number Ones &amp; Downfall of Twos</span></strong><br>“<em>cheng ye xiao he, bai ye xiao he</em>” – He who gave you success, can bring your downfall.<br><br>If
              one reads the memoirs of Lee Kuan Yew, both volumes, you could sense
              his apprehension over several domestic issues such as Party splits
              (which I will mention later), succession planning, ousting of top Asian
              leaders and the downfalls of Number Twos. Not known to many is that the
              PAP suffered a Party split twice, once by the charismatic Mayor Ong Eng
              Guan and by the leftist, Lim Chin Siong. The latter split was
              devastating and almost permanently crippled the PAP. In recent history
              of our neighbours, UMNO suffered two party splits when Tengku Razaleigh
              openly challenged Mahathir in 1987 and when Anwar fell out with Dr M.
              These incidents, locally and abroad, remained deeply entrenched in
              LKY’s mind, even until today.<br><br><img style="margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px; float: left;" src="http://static.flickr.com/96/215162054_3138805616_o.jpg" border="0" alt="">The
              world has seen plenty of examples of the difficult relationships
              between the leaders and their deputies. All these incidents led both
              LKY and GCT to rethink their own potentially precarious position. No
              matter what LKY said, deep down, he wanted LHL to be the Prime Minister
              someday. And he could only exert his influence if he is still in
              Cabinet. And for GCT, he knows what LKY wants from him and knows that
              LKY still has the ability and power to remove him should there be a
              need to. This is a tango that both are dancing in secret. Given their
              delicate relationship, it is not surprising to see GCT echoing most of
              LKY views and words. If you look through all the news reports on GCT,
              majority of his words are singing in the same tune as what LKY
              previously sung. In the opinions of many, GCT never really stepped out
              of LKY’s shadow.<br><br></span><span style="font-size: 130%;"><span style="font-family: times new roman;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Unwillingly Unseated?<br></span></strong>Many
              often wondered if GCT stepped down willingly from the position of PM or
              was he pressed into doing so. Perhaps only three people in Singapore
              know the answer. But what we can do is to decipher his actions and
              words leading up to his stepping down. In the article on Lee Hsien
              Loong, I’ve mentioned this before and will do it here again. During
              GCT’s last National Day Rally as Prime Minister, he mentioned this:<br><br></span></span></div>
              <blockquote>
              <p><span style="font-family: times new roman; font-size: 130%;">“You
              may also have heard this old story about Loong. Back in 1990, Loong had
              a quarrel with Richard Hu. Dhanabalan sided with Richard. Loong lost
              his temper, reached across the table, and gave Dhanabalan a tight slap!
              The whole Cabinet was thrown into commotion. I then forced Loong to
              apologise.<br><br>I must be suffering from amnesia. I just cannot remember this incident! Now you know how creative Singaporeans are!”</span></p>
              </blockquote>
              <div><span style="font-family: times new roman; font-size: 130%;">GCT
              need not mention the Dhanabalan incident since it was already 13 years
              ago (from the National Day Rally). People wouldn’t remember if they
              weren’t reminded by him. But he still made that comment and later
              claimed amnesia. And for the first time in Singapore history, GCT
              created a three-step process to the transition of power, through
              endorsements from the PAP Central Executive Committee, PAP Cabinet
              Ministers and the PAP MPs. The words and actions of GCT during that
              year can be quite intriguing. But I’ll leave you to decipher that.<br><br></span><span style="font-size: 130%;"><span style="font-family: times new roman;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Can there be Three Tigers in One Mountain?<br></span></strong><img style="margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px; float: right;" src="http://static.flickr.com/86/215162052_808c32e868_o.jpg" border="0" alt="">One
              question that no one explicitly asked was whether the system and post
              of Senior Minister would exist when LKY passes. The current situation,
              of having two former Prime Ministers in the present Cabinet (plus the
              present PM), is unprecedented in any part of the world. Since it
              currently exists, the question should really be whether it should
              continue to exist and will it cease to exist. There are some coffeeshop
              talks on this issue that before LKY passes, GCT will either step down
              or have his loyal men removed. (According to market talks) Given LKY
              sensitive nature developed during the tumultuous times (see the History
              of PAP) and struggle of the traumatic party split, he will leave
              nothing to chance. Although the possibilities of a party split or power
              struggle is negligible, he will not rest until that has been resolved
              even after his death.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Necessary Stage of Change: Uprooting the Roots</span></strong><br>Some
              might find this (removing GCT or his men) objectionable or unwarranted,
              but there is nothing inherently wrong with that. The mistake that
              Abdullah Badawi (Malaysia’s current PM) made was his inability to
              gradually and systematically remove his predecessor’s men from the
              Cabinet and plant his loyal lieutenants into key positions. Now, he is
              facing a situation of having policies with no one loyal enough to him
              to implement it. With half of the Cabinet still loyal to Mahathir and a
              strong number two candidate in Najip, his position is vulnerable to
              ousting. That is the main reason for him to undertake several key
              Ministries (PMO, Home Affairs and Finance) himself.<br><br><img style="margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px; float: right;" src="http://static.flickr.com/85/215165940_fcc1bc2019.jpg" border="0" alt="">For
              LHL’s team to be effective, it is vital and necessary for him to place
              his people into the key Ministries. As predicted before the GE 2006, I
              expected Yeo Cheow Tong, Lee Boon Yang and Lim Boon Heng to gradually
              step down (within one year) and it is taking shape now. Yeo Cheow Tong
              has stepped down, and both Lee Boon Yang and Lim Boon Heng have
              indicted their stepping down within a year. MPs loyal to GCT like Dr
              Tan Cheng Bock (Golf partner of GCT) have also stepped down. For GCT
              himself, he has been assigned to foreign and finance affairs issues
              such as Middle East Islamic finance hub and Malaysia bilateral issues.
              This isolates his impact on “domestic politics”, leading him away from
              the public eye and leaving room for LHL in the spotlight. Again, there
              is nothing wrong with that, all in the name of “renewal”.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Deciphering GE2006</span></strong><br>Similarly, during the GE2006, two incidents are worth analyzing. Firstly, before the GE, <img style="margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px; float: left;" src="http://static.flickr.com/90/215165935_4cfe2bc558.jpg" border="0" alt="">GCT
              openly challenged the opposition parties to test Marine Parade GRC (his
              ward). Yes, all MPs and Ministers also challenged or stated that they
              welcomed opposition contest. But for GCT, it was different. He needed
              the contest to demonstrate that he is still more popular than LHL,
              something which he is sure of but required undisputable figures. If he
              scored well in the contest, it might prolong his career in LHL’s
              administration or (very remotely and speculatively) offer him a chance
              of a comeback (which GCT himself wouldn’t even expect or probably
              want). But he didn’t receive a contest and it turned out worse.<br><br>The
              second incident was his assignment to win back Potong Pasir and Hougang
              from Chiam (SDA) and Low Thia Khiang (WP). This is an astute move by
              LHL (possibly LKY). On the face of it, it demonstrates the new PM’s
              serious intent on recovering Potong Pasir and Hougang. The implicitly
              explicit reason is to keep the opposition leaders, Low and Chiam, busy
              in their own wards and negate their effects on the neighbouring GRCs,
              especially Aljunied GRC. But the real beneficiary of this strategy is
              LHL. There are four possible scenarios out of this strategy: 1) winning
              both Potong Pasir and Hougang back; 2) winning one of them back, like
              to be Potong Pasir; 3) losing both wards by lesser margins and; 4)
              losing both wards by larger margins. </span></span></div>
              <div><span style="font-size: 130%;"><span style="font-family: times new roman;"><br><br><img style="margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px; float: right;" src="http://static.flickr.com/74/215162056_1f653a62a1_o.jpg" border="0" alt="">If
              (1) happens, LHL will be credited for winning back the PP and Hougang
              but not GCT, since GCT was not able to do it when he was PM. But the
              government will run into lots of foreign affairs (such as democracy
              advocators) issues of having no oppositions in parliament
              (inter-parliamentary visits require oppositions as well). </span></span><span style="font-size: 130%;"><span style="font-family: times new roman;">If
              (2) happens, LHL will still be credited more than GCT. If (3) happens,
              it shows the slight impact of GCT’s campaigning influence. Lastly, if
              (4) happens (which happened), it will be the worst scenario for GCT. As
              he mentioned during the campaign, the losses will affect his “personal
              prestige” and “reputation”, almost like a slap in his face. Since
              scenario (4) materialized, GCT doesn’t have the chip to say that he is
              more popular than LHL or LHL is any less popular than him. And since
              LHL didn’t campaign at PP and Hougang (at all), the burden of loss is
              solely and squarely on GCT.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Conclusions</span></strong><br>Once
              again, I’ve asked more questions than provide answers. This is probably
              what makes a perceivably dull local politics interesting. As mentioned
              in the beginning, I am no pseudo-Lim Kim San and can never be and never
              will be. Never can I claim to speak the uncensored truth about one’s
              character since I don’t know him in person. What I can do is to spark
              some interest that allows you to question the answers you see or hear
              in public and make judgments of your own. Of course, we maybe wrong and
              must accept that we might be wrong. There is always more that we don’t
              know than know. This article provides only an alternative view which
              might be wrong, so do make your own judgment call. </span></span></div>
