            <div class='col-md body'>The alternative to authoritarianism and top-down system which would perpetually be suing oppositions to disable them from taking part in democratic election process is Objective Management.<br><br>By setting out the objectives, programs and policies in objective people-friendly way, people will be empoered to take part and reach for goals and objectives in a fair and competitive manner without feeling suspicions or wrong doings,<br><br>Leaders must not be so kiasu as many of the oppositions who are sued are just doing their part for the good of the country. Good leaders must be people who can set personal examples, and who are prepared to govern all tasks objectively with openness and accountability as the latter is the only way to involve all which will assure of mass results.<br><br>Good government is one where politicians are able to see larger goals than their own narrow party interests. The judiciary must serve the people objective and dispense justice with equity and fairness and not be seen as pandering to the wishes of the power that be. MPs must be left to play their part without being cowered by their own party uppish personal wishes, intuitions and private agendas.<br><br>Another name to such a system is probably : leading by example or good corporate governance. Now under the present system, the top is overly concerned with their own personality cult and leadership and egos to give way to collective objective governance.<br><br>It is now after the recent lessens from Asian Financial Crisis for the present leaders to understand their shortcomings in personalising leadership and change to collective objective leadership which is the only system which will bring about widespread progress through mass participation in progress.<br><br>But it is easy said than done. The process management is only possible when tasks can be carried out in empowering work processes attainable by all.

Vasoo). The PAP has however denied the accusation and insisted the offense was real. Chiam See Tong urged Chee to stop the accusations and get back to real business.<br><br><strong><span style="color: red;">However, Chiam was not supported by most of the party and the Central Executive Committee voted to get rid of him as general secretary and replace him with Chee. </span></strong> Supporters of Chiam quickly left the party and formed the Singapore People's Party in 1994.<br><br><span style="color: red;">As if this was not enough, the party even decided to strip Chiam See Tong's membership in the party. Had he lost his membership, under the current law, he would also have to lose his seat in parliament. </span><br><br>This invoked unhappiness among opposition supporters in Potong Pasir.<br><br>Chiam took up this issue to the courts which ruled in favor of him as it was illegal to do so.<br><br>Hence between 1993 and 1997, Chiam kept his seat in parliament officially as a SDP member. In the 1997 elections, he took over from Sin Kek Tong as the secretary-general (leader) of the Singapore People's Party.<br><br></blockquote></div>

Legally, it is the only recourse to address a 'wrongful' statement made against you; note that i place 'wrongful' in inverted commas as the determination and presentation of the case can be warped to suit your own ends.<br><br>The NKF was probably the one clear example of how legal defamation suits were used to con the public into thinking that allegations of funds mismanagement and unethical use of public monies were wholely 'untrue'.
