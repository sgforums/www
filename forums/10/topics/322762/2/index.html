              <p>Are you trying to say you are short-sighted? Birth is a very small part of life.</p>
              <p>What good is lowest infant mortality with a fertility rate that dropped to 1.24?</p>
              <p>Even if you had the lowest infant mortality, but life overall is stressful and overall the rest of your life is only ranked a low 58?</p>
              <p>It's no wonder you only want this No.1, it fits in with your selective way of using certain facts and discarding the rest.</p>
              <p>Is this the same method you used to ignore certain important questions posed to you such as those asked in military nuts, and also the the one about you using clones?</p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Don't understand what you meant by your statement "Only half of Aussie!!", as can be seen from the data, Australia had a score of 91 for health and Singapore 78, mathematically it's not half. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Alas the scoring system is not based soley on infant mortality rate, as can be seen from the explanation of the scoring system, they based it on a number of criterias, some of these factors are, number of people per doctor, the number of hospital beds per 1,000 people and public expenditure as a percentage of a country's GDP.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">If you look at doctors per 1,000 population, Singapore is 140 doctors per 100,000 population, whereas Australia is 247 doctors per 100,000 population. Isn't it better to have more doctors per population?</span></p>
              <p><a href="http://hdrstats.undp.org/indicators/58.html"><span style="color: #0000ff;">http://hdrstats.undp.org/indicators/58.html</span></a></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">As for hospital beds per 1,000 population, Singapore has 2.9 hospital beds per 1,000 population, whereas Australia has 7.4 hospital beds per 1,000 population. Isn't it better to have more hospital beds per 1,000 population?</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">For your comment about higher GDP spending on healthcare being bad, then maybe you should consider what are the consequences if government has ZERO spending on healthcare. So essentially, does lower spending on healthcare means good, or higher spending on healthcare good?</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The statistics I posted below are abit outdated, unfortunately WHO doesn't have public access data for the current few years. The best I could managed was 2005-2006, but I guess it could provide some kind of a reference as to the fairness of their scoring system.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>I don't see their system bias in this aspect of the analysis. Perhaps we should ask ourselves if we have been the victim(s) of government propaganda to the point of rejecting concrete data. The government has an ulterior motive to manipulate data (propaganda) to it's convenience so as to pacify her citizens, what ulterior motive has this organisation reporting on the quality of life for 192 countries.</strong></span></p>

              <p>Actually, I don't really care where Singapore ranked... But I am more interested in the way they rank. Read about some maslow hierarchy of needs</p>

              <p>Basically, you will want to fill up the needs at the bottom before filling up those at the top, so you basically don't care about culture and arts unless you can fulfill your food and safety needs.</p>
              <p>Which is why arts and culture is a consider a good gauge of a country's wellbeing, as they actually have the luxury to care about them. Just imagine the importance the iraqis give to arts compare to safety.</p>
              <p>Think france deserved to be top in standard of living, with it's free and leisurely culture and relative shorter work hours. If you think of it that way, Singapore is somewhere in the middle, with it's stressful life in general.</p>

              <p>Every generation will have to encounter "Maslow's hierachy of needs".</p>
              <p>The "quality of life" for each generation will depend on how quickly each generation can reach the top of that hierachy of needs; or at which level it gets stuck without further progress over some tolerable span in time.</p>
              <p>Depending on the peer pressure or societal influence, each may have different goals or ambitions; or different levels of drive and satisfaction - that will determine each person's perception in the "quality of life" attained, and voluntarily stopped further progress at differing points in Maslow's level of needs.</p>
              <p>Maslow's model is only a road map in gauging the path in which one takes in Life to attain satisfaction - represented as the quality of life.</p>
              <p>If Maslow's guide is followed as the basis to evaluate Singaporean's position, do you think that Singaporeans have reached the top rung of Maslow's model in SELF-ACTUALISATION - the top index in the Quality of Life measure ?</p>
              <p>According to your wikipedia reference on Maslow - SELF-ACTUALISATION -</p>
              <p>"<em>is the instinctual need of humans to make the most of their abilities and to strive to be the best they can. Working toward fulfilling our potential, toward becoming all that we are capable of becoming</em>".</p>
              <p>Can SELF-ACTUALISATION be achieved by Singaporeans after 50 years as a nation moving from self-rule to independence, from a colonial entrepot to a financial, manufacturing and service centre ?</p>
              <p>Has Singaporeans been allowed to achieve self-actualisation in a society in which a paternalistic system has been put in place - that forced Singaporeans to depend on the monopolistic enterprise of the Ruling Political Party bent on controlling and monopolising every aspects of political life of every Singaporean ?</p>
              <p>When the Ruling Political Party removes the political rights of the Citizens - after being elected by the Citizens - can there be Quality of Life in the high index ?</p>

                      whereas Australia has 7.4 hospital beds per 1,000 population. Isn't

                      presentations to emergency departments in 2006-07 - the equivalent of a
                      third of the population.</p>

              <p>The average cost of treating a patient was $3,922.</p>

              <p>The report also revealed waiting times for elective surgery.</p>
              <p>The longest wait is for knee replacements - with a median wait of 162 days.</p>
              <p>Septoplasty (113 days) and hip replacements (106 days) came in second and third.</p>
              .......
              <p>Australian Medical Association president Rosanna Capolingua said the
                      report showed the public <span style="color: #ff0000;">hospital system was at breaking point.</span></p>
              <p>She said the Rudd government had not done enough to fix the acute

              <p><br>First of all there are merits to the Australian Free Healthcare system that Singapore lacks. e.g. If say you fall sick now, you have used up all your medisave and cash. You walk into SGH and tell them you have no money to pay. <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Do you think they will attend to you, provide medication, hospital bed, consultation, test and surgery?</span></strong> I ever asked the admin staff in charge of medisave, I told them "I don't have any more money. Can I just use my medisave to pay for outpatient treatment?" They said, "No".</p>
              <p>Let's look at this <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">objectively</span></strong>, we have 140 doctors per 100,000 population, whereas Australia has 247 doctors per 100,000 population. Which means our doctors have to work almost twice as hard to see as many patients as the Australian doctors. Either that or, the only other reasonable explanation is, Singapore doctors have less patients to attend to, because the majority of them can't afford treatment, that's why they forgo treatment. With less patients for the Singapore doctors, it would be easier to maintain a shorter waiting time than the Australian doctors.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Both healthcare system have its merits. The Australian system has it's merits because it leaves no man behind, even if you are penniless, healthcare will be accorded to you. A situation where something is free leads to abuse by people, with more citizens going for checkups and outpatient treatment, the patient number grows, therefore the long wait for treatment.</p>
              <p>The article cited by you also states that, it's because of reduction of healthcare spending by the Howard government that resulted in the long waiting times. The new PM might be emphasizing extreme issues to make his point about healthcare, does it mean that for all cases it's always that long. Also isn't there more cause to increase public health spending rather than what you claim, spending less on healthcare is better. It is better for the Singapore government context because they place the onus on you to maintain your own medical bills.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>"After 11 years of Liberal neglect - including $1 billion slashed from public hospitals in 2003 - there is much to be done," Ms Roxon said in a statement.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>For the Singapore system, you have to be financially secure to be able to afford the treatment. If you don't have money, you need to beg, borrow or steal in order to get treatment. The waiting time is shorter, normally 1-2 months wait for outpatient treatment.</p>
              <p>The merits for Singapore system is, the wait is 30 to 60 days, but you must be able to afford the hospital charges. No money no talk.</p>
              <p>The merits of the Australian system is, it is free, but waiting time might be longer, but waiting times for cases differ, depending on your affliction. If the the doctor specialising in the particular area of medicine is rare, then longer waiting times are expected. Singapore system wait long long also don't have. ç­‰ä¹…ä¹…éƒ½æ²¡æœ‰.</p>

              <p>You are clearly talking rubbish here.</p>
              <p>Firstly Singapore is a CITY STATE, hence it's infant mortality rates are what you'd expect from a urbanized CITY with relatively good medical care, because it is all easily accessable in the small island.</p>
              <p>Hence's it's EXPECTED that it has to have a low infant morality, because of the lack of rural areas and births that other nations have to contend with. When other nations tally their infant mortality, they have to factor in births in rural and non urban areas which will certainly drive up the figure.</p>
              <p>Hence Singapore's low infant mortality rate is not due to actual good care, but more of geographic size. </p>
              <p>But the most shocking thing is that how Singapore, being a small nation and hence making it very easy to make healthcare accessable to its population can actually score WORSE then many other nations, especially Australia.</p>

              <p>How many Australians are at really at risk of a shooting in their lifetime?</p>
              <p>You are commiting the spotlight fallacy here.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>The Spotlight fallacy is committed when a person uncritically assumes that all members or cases of a certain class or type are like those that receive the most attention or coverage in the media. This line of “reasoning” has the following form:</p>
              <p>1. Xs with quality Q receive a great deal of attention or coverage in the media. 2. Therefore all Xs have quality Q.</p>
              <p>This line of reasoning is fallacious since the mere fact that someone or something attracts the most attention or coverage in the media does not mean that it automatically represents the whole population. For example, suppose a mass murderer from Old Town, Maine, received a great deal of attention in the media. It would hardly follow that everyone from the town is a mass murderer.</p>
              <p>The Spotlight fallacy derives its name from the fact that receiving a great deal of attention or coverage is often referred to as being in the spotlight. It is similar to Hasty Generalization, Biased Sample and Misleading Vividness because the error being made involves generalizing about a population based on an inadequate or flawed sample. The Spotlight Fallacy is a very common fallacy. <strong>This fallacy most often occurs when people assume that those who receive the most media attention actually represent the groups they belong to. For example, some people began to believe that all those who oppose abortion are willing to gun down doctors in cold blood simply because those incidents received a great deal of media attention. Since the news media typically cover people or events that are unusual or exceptional, it is somewhat odd for people to believe that such people or events are representative.</strong></p>

              <p>Many people have suggested adopting a certain KPI to measure ministers' performance and tie their salary level to such KPI. That will be the best solution to our long-standing issue over ministers' pay scale. If collectively all the ministers succeeded in raising the quality of life based on such international agency's assessment all the ministers will be justified to receive the minimum of S$600,000.00 pa. (which is already overly generous taking into account USA president's or China' PM pay scale).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Should any one of the ministers score exceptional KPI measured by his ministry's performance, another S$300,000.00 can be added as incentive or performance bonus.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Any ministers who failed in his ministry's KPI will have his S$600,000.00 reduced by 10% for each point of failure. WKS for example should receive not more than $600,000.00 less 10% i.e. $540,000.00 pa. Bonus should not be higher that 3 months as they are all iron-rice-bowl employees not easily losing their jobs due to market downturn or poor company result.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If not sure about the ministers' pay scale refer to the next GE as a referendum with properly phrased quantum to enable proper sanction by the citizens.</p>

If collectively all the ministers succeeded in raising the quality of life based on such international agency's assessment all the ministers will be justified to receive the minimum of S$600,000.00 pa. (which is already overly generous taking into account USA president's or China' PM pay scale).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Should any one of the ministers score exceptional KPI measured by his ministry's performance, another S$300,000.00 can be added as incentive or performance bonus.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Any ministers who failed in his ministry's KPI will have his S$600,000.00 reduced by 10% for each point of failure. WKS for example should receive not more than $600,000.00 less 10% i.e. $540,000.00 pa. Bonus should not be higher that 3 months as they are all iron-rice-bowl employees not easily losing their jobs due to market downturn or poor company result.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If not sure about the ministers' pay scale refer to the next GE as a referendum with properly phrased quantum to enable proper sanction by the citizens.</p>

              <p>This is the least of the whole issue if we can get the rationale settled broadly first. The Suggestion of tying the ministers' salaries to mean wages and KPI has been given by many people and this is found quite fair and acceptable because it will definitely avoid artful legal corruptions using biased comparison, fear or legality (parliamentary MPs voting for their own salary quantum is definitely a conflict of interest and immoral even if its decision is legal) tactics have been given by many people and this suggestion is quite widely accepted.</p>

              <p>Not considering the bias against the government in your usual posts and also the difficulty in implementing a seemingly fair KPI system to please majority of the people, your suggestion at least is a meaningful one and I do agree with the rationale behind your suggestion.</p>
