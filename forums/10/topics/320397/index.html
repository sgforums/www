"We will not rule it out."<br><br>"We are buying something that we intend to keep for the next two to three decades and grow with them", he said, adding that GIC was a long-term investor.</span></span></span></span></p>

              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-size: small;">After throwing in billions of dollars into credit-crunch battered financial institutions, Lee Kuan Yew is prepared to deploy more capital into this area. Ever confident about GIC's investments, the octogenarian further defended GIC's decisions:</span></span></p>

Will there be another Swiss bank like UBS for wealth management? I doubt it, we doubt it, that is why we invested in it." Citigroup, he added, had "an enormous spread worldwide as a retail bank".</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black; font-family: Arial;    "> </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-size: small;">Interesting rationale. According to Lee Kuan Yew, UBS and Citigroup have "inherent capabilities to recover" from the credit crisis. Well, this is quite a debatable statement.<br><br>Just a few months after GIC's investments, recovery of the banking sector is far from sight. Instead, the banks are </span><a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=aC_bgDO7aCoY&amp;refer=home"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #de7008;"><span style="color: #de7008;"><span style="font-size: small;">scrambling to raise more capital </span></span></span></span></a><span style="font-size: small;">to deal with the damage the credit crunch has dealt them:</span></span></p>

Citigroup, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, sold $6 billion of hybrid bonds in the company's largest public debt offering, while New York-based securities firm Merrill Lynch raised $9.55 billion by issuing debt and preferred securities.<br><br>Bond offerings soared as investors grew more optimistic financial companies can recover from $309 billion of writedowns and credit losses tied to the collapse of the subprime-mortgage market. Banks and securities firms sold 85 percent of investment- grade debt this week, Bloomberg data show. <strong>High-yield bond issuance swelled to the most since November</strong>.</span></span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"> </p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-size: small;">An inherent ability to recover from the crisis? Not without a lot of additional capital - extra capital which is going to dilute your existing stakes.<br><br>The debt issuance is not the end of the story.

Citigroup already has raised more than $30 billion of capital since December. A weakening U.S. economy and rising consumer delinquencies forced Chief Executive Officer Vikram Pandit to rescind assurances earlier this year that the bank didn't need to raise more funds.<br><br><strong>"This was extremely disappointing</strong>," William Fitzpatrick, an equity analyst at Optique Capital Management in Racine, Wisconsin, said in a Bloomberg Television interview.

              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-size: small;">Citigroup's issuance of equity financing is implicit acknowledgement that it won't be able to deal with the upcoming problems in the credit markets without substantial help.

Giannone<br><br>NEW YORK (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley analysts on Monday told clients to "sell the rally" in financial stocks, slashing forecasts for big bank earnings and warning that <em>the current credit crunch is only just beginning</em>.<br><br>In aggregate, Morgan Stanley reduced its estimates for 2008 large bank earnings by $17 billion, or 26 percent, and reduced 2009 forecasts by $13 billion, or 15 percent. The analysts expect higher loan losses and expenses, offset by higher net interest income, though profits could fall further still if the Federal Reserve stops lowering interest rates.<br><br>"More capital hikes and dividend cuts (are) coming as our credit deteriorates and forward earnings decline," analysts led by Betsy Graseck wrote in a report. "<strong>We think we are only in the third inning of the credit cycle and expect this credit cycle will be worse than (the slump in) 1990-91</strong>."</span></span></span></span><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-size: small;"> </span></span></p>

              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-size: small;">Just for the record, a baseball game usually has nine(9) innings. Morgan Stanley's declaration that we are only in the third inning of the credit cycle, simply says we're not even a third of the way through the game. A </span><a href="http://seekingalpha.com/article/74461-sell-into-the-financials-rally-morgan-stanley"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #de7008;"><span style="color: #de7008;"><span style="font-size: small;">Seeking Alpha contributor has also observed</span></span></span></span></a><span style="font-size: small;">:</span></span></p>

              <p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small;">The credit markets have improved, in terms of increased liquidity, with the Fed opening up the discount window for investment banks. However, the real economy, which has had only a minimal impact on the financial markets thus far, is deteriorating rapidly. Home prices are continuing to decline, costs of living are continuing to increase (look at the price of oil and food for examples), and the job market is reeling.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial; "><span style="font-size: small;"> </span></span></p>

The Fed put out one fire, but threw gasoline on the other - through massive inflation - and we have not even begun to witness the effects this will have on our economy</span><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">. </span></span></p>

              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-size: small;">Well, well, it appears Lee Kuan Yew doesn't seem so wise any more. Certainly not as wise as Warren Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway has stayed away from picking up stakes in these big banks. And its just as well that we clearly see the difference here, as GIC and Temasek have been repeatedly using slogans to "invest for the long term," to parade themselves as value investors of the Buffett kind.<br><br>But Lee Kuan Yew doesn't really understand Warren Buffett. He also said in the interview with Bloomberg:</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial; "><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-size:
                              85%;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black; font-family: Arial;     ">'[Buffett] has a different view. He has to give returns to his investors year by year. We don't have to. We have to think in terms of the next 10, 20, 30 years. We are buying into something which we intend to keep for the next two, three decades and grow with them.'</span><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial; "><span style="font-size: x-small;"></span></span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"> </p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-size: small;">But I think anybody who knows Warren Buffett knows that Buffett's favourite investment horizon <strong>is forever</strong>, and that the investment legend has repeatedly stressed that Berkshire's focus is not on the quarter-to-quarter or year-to-year earnings. In all his writings to shareholders, one can clearly discern that Buffett has his eye on the long term future. Furthermore, Buffett's track record of consistently outperforming the market spans a good <strong>50 years</strong>... </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-size: small;">Thus, for Lee to say the Buffett is narrowly focused on the year-to-year performance of his company, is to demonstrate a <strong>gross and fundamental misunderstanding </strong>of Buffett's investment philosophy - and thus it was ridiculous for Lee Kuan Yew to claim that GIC has significantly different obligations to its shareholders compared to Berkshire.<br><br>Finally, let's not forget </span><a href="http://utwt.blogspot.com/2008/04/gic-ubs-jim-rogers.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #de7008;"><span style="color: #de7008;"><span style="font-size: small;">Jim Rogers' warning </span></span></span></span></a><span style="font-size: small;">to Singapore's Sovereign Wealth Funds earlier this year:</span></span></p>

They are going to lose money," he added, referring to investments by Government of Singapore Investment Corp and Temasek in Citigroup, Switzerland's UBS and Merrill Lynch.</span><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

              <p>certainly not... buffet only employs the bare minimum necessary to run his company, his philosophy is cut down on whatever that is not needed or redundant, contrast that with the govenment who is very generous with their numerous "top level" employees.</p>

              <p>MM Lee being the Special Advisor of Citigroup and Chairman of GIC. Is that considered a conflict of interests?</p>
              <p>Citigroup in need of help confirm have to ask someone. If the biggest bank in the world goes bankrupt, there would be even more severe consequenses. More political I think.</p>
              <p>Is it a good investment? I doubt it. Anyway we have to wait 20-30 years to judge hahaha....since it is a long term investment. By that time....you guys know what to do if you manage to live that long. :D</p>
              <p>GIC should declare its annual compounded returns to the public. Are they being transparent?</p>
              <p>We wouldn't know if the growth of our CPF is due to the increasing CPF contribution by Singaporeans and PR. Or is it due to the real growth of annual returns in investments overseas.</p>
