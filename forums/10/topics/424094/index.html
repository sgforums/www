Your letter said almost everything except answer my question of why the SDP was left out of the <em>Talking Point</em> episode that was aired last Sunday evening.<br><br>You
               write that the “SDP’s views on the changes to the electoral boundaries 
              were reported by MediaCorp”, that the episode in question was “prompted 
              by the announcement of changes in electoral boundaries”, that the 
              programme was “meant to be a more qualitative discussion” and so on.<br><br>What has all this to do with the SDP being left out of the programme?<br><br>You
               also say that there has been no other single programme which featured 
              the RP, WP, and NSP  in one show but “there were different episodes of 
              Talking Point which featured the different parties separately and on 
              different topics.” Was the SDP ever invited to any of these?<br><br>The <em>Talking Point</em> programme has been airing for years. During that time, the SDP has 
              never been invited to be on it. Other parties have - repeatedly. And you
               expect people to believe that there is no discrimination against us?<br><br>Just because you say that there is no attempt to discriminate against the SDP doesn't make it true. You need to demonstrate it.<br><br>To this end I have a proposal: <em>Talking Point</em> can do an episode where the PAP is invited to present its Budget and 
              the SDP its Shadow Budget with both sides having an intelligent and 
              robust debate on the matter.<br><br>The SDP, you may know, is the only 
              opposition party to publish an alternative to Budget 2011. For that 
              matter, we are the only party to have ever come up with a Shadow Budget 
              in the history of Singapore. Given this, it is timely to have such an 
              episode. I am certain that your viewers would be intensely interested to
               watch an SDP-PAP debate.<br><br>Sincerely,<br><br>Chee Soon Juan<br>Secretary-General<br>Singapore Democratic Party</p>
              <br> <blockquote>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Dear Dr Chee,<br><br>Thank you for 
              writing in with your feedback. We would like to emphasize that Channel 
              NewsAsia, which has reported on local, regional and international news 
              developments for over a decade now, has no agenda to advance, except to 
              carry the news and views which are relevant to our viewers.<br><br>Let me also assure you that there is no attempt to discriminate against the Singapore Democratic Party (SDP).<br><br>In
               fact, the SDP’s views on the changes to the electoral boundaries were 
              reported by MediaCorp on several of its media platforms. In case, you 
              missed the news reports, Dr Chee, you were quoted as saying that you did
               not see a logical explanation in how the boundaries had been drawn and 
              they "seem to have been carved up in a haphazard way to benefit the 
              PAP". Other examples of stories include the report of political parties 
              doing their walkabouts and opposition parties planning to discuss 
              constituency allocation.<br><br>The latest episode of Talking Point, 
              which you referred to, was prompted by the announcement of changes in 
              electoral boundaries on the afternoon of 24 February 11, and the program
               was due for recording the following morning.<br><br>Many considerations
               go into the conduct of such a forum, including the program duration, 
              size of panel, turnaround time and identifying topics of relevance. For 
              instance, one key point of discussion was how new Single-Member 
              Constituencies would affect plans and strategies of incumbent MPs and 
              the parties contesting. The programme was not meant to be a 
              comprehensive report card detailing the reaction of every single 
              political party in Singapore. At the latest count, there are at least 11
               active political parties in Singapore. The approximately 40-minute 
              programme, excluding commercial breaks, was instead meant to be a more 
              qualitative discussion, to give viewers a flavour of the different 
              points of view about the changes to the electoral boundaries, as seen 
              from the Opposition camp as well as incumbents from the ruling party.<br><br>On
               your reference to “a previous episode” of the programme which you said 
              had invited the NSP, WP, and RP but not the SDP, we would like to 
              correct this misconception. There has been no other single programme 
              which featured the mentioned Opposition parties in one show. There were 
              different episodes of Talking Point which featured the different parties
               separately and on different topics.<br><br>Last weekend’s programme had
               received encouraging feedback from several viewers. We aim to produce 
              programmes that add value for the viewing public, and we will 
              continually work to improve our productions. For this reason, when we 
              receive comments, whether constructive or otherwise, they would always 
              be seriously considered.<br><br>Thank you.<br><br>Yours sincerely,<br>Han Chuan Quee (Ms)<br>Vice President, Corporate Services<br>Channel NewsAsia<br>MediaCorp Pte Ltd</p>

              <p>Singapore population used to be more left wing and even PAP declared itself leftwing, later Lee Kuan Yew carried out the policy of depolitisation of Singapore society, destroy all politics etc and thus resulted in the de-ideological state of Singapore politics.</p>
              <p>Lee Kuan Yew doesn't care about political ideology. He is only interested in power.</p>

              <p>Which ideology serves his interests of obtaining power, he will follow.</p>
