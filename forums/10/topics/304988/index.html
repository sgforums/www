After being arrested without any fair trial from the court (worse than ISA), Sukarna died few years later. No one including his childrens are not allowed to see his last face. No mourning, no debates of whether this father of independence should be forgiven, no billion dollars of lottery for his children to inherit, no freedom of speech and movement. Come on, we don't even know how he died?<br>Then for Suharto, he forced chinese to give up their chinese identity, no classes of chinese, no chinese new year, but they still being treated as 3rd class citizen.<br>and he still hope to be given some honour and forgive by the people?<br>Did he ever forgive those people who has different opinions from him?<br>Did he ever appreciate the contribution of those people that he killed during his regime?</p></div>
