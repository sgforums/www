              <p class="first">The working classes have lower IQs than those from wealthier backgrounds and should not be expected to win places at top universities, an academic has claimed.</p>
              <div id="an_lrec_ad"></div>
              <p>Bruce Charlton, reader in evolutionary psychiatry at Newcastle University, suggested that the low numbers of working-class students at elite universities was the "natural outcome" of IQ differences between classes.</p>
              <p>In a paper shown to the Times Higher <a href="http://uk.news.yahoo.com/fc/education.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Education</span></span></a> magazine, Dr Charlton questioned the Government's drive to get more students from poor backgrounds into top universities like Oxford and Cambridge.</p>
              <p>He said: "The UK Government has spent a great deal of time and effort in asserting that universities, especially Oxford and Cambridge, are unfairly excluding people from low social class backgrounds and privileging those from higher social classes.</p>
              <p>"Yet in all this debate a simple and vital fact has been missed: higher social classes have a significantly higher average IQ than lower social classes."</p>
              <p>The fact that so few students from poor families get into Oxbridge is not down to "prejudice" but "meritocracy", he said.</p>
              <p>The Government criticised Dr Charlton's comments. Higher <a href="http://uk.news.yahoo.com/fc/education.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">education</span></span></a> minister Bill Rammell said: "These arguments have a definite tone of 'people should know their place'.</p>
              <p>"There are young people with talent, ability and the potential to benefit from higher education who do not currently do so. That should concern us all."</p>
              <p>Sally Hunt, general secretary of the University and College Union, said: "It should come as little surprise that people who enjoy a more privileged upbringing have a better start in life.</p>
              <p>"It is up to all of us to ensure that not having access to the social and educational benefits that money provides is not a barrier to achieving one's full potential."</p>

              <p>I think we humans cannot function from pure rationality.</p>
              <p>It does not matter that students from poorer families have lower IQs. We as humans would like to help everyone especially people who are poorer. We have something other than research reports to base our decisions, something called empathy, emotion, love.</p>
              <p>Just look at the article above, the 2 responses there, were emotionally-based responses, and not rationality-based responses.</p>
              <p>This reminds me of a certain similar theme sometime back ago....about how we should think of ways to cut cost in medicine....especially old people who are dying...</p>
              <p>Those academics, policymakers, etc, they forgot 1 very important aspect of their study. Humanity cannot function from pure rationality.</p>

              <p>Spot on, KB.  As kilua notes, the oft-missed point of IQ measurement is that it's dependent on a base of knowledge - nobody's yet been able to measure Spearman's <em>g.</em>  Taking the point that all things being equal, better education equals higher IQ, Charlton's simply stating the obvious.  I'd be interested to see his article in full, but making the reported point is useless unless Charlton's taken it to the conclusion that the effort is better spent on earlier education rather than on opening the gates way too late.</p>

              politically incorrect maybe but it makes some sense... and it's not as simple as throw lots of money at it... the uk is a lot bigger than SG, SG is smaller than London...
              
              The problem lies in communities and the families rather than the kids themselves - a hell of a lot of kids from 'working class' environments often don't get the encouragement to perform that others do and thus think it's ok to mess around at school and not learn anything - when you get that in entire communities that attitude can engulf an entire school system for that area, and thus no matter what the teachers do the classes will almost always have an ehr of 'i don't care', because they want to drop out after GCSEs anyway, making it difficult for those who want to learn to learn, however usually those who want to do. And they do get into the uni they want to. It's the same for the areas where people are aiming to get past A levels - it'll still be the people who work hard who make it to the big unis.
              
              His statement may be a little too sweeping but as a trend it's true - those from areas that don't expect degrees generally won't get them and those from areas that do will... sad but true. the ball lies in the parents court and if they're not gonna help their kids then what are kids gonna do?

              differences in IQ: implications for the government’s ‘fair access’ political
              agenda</span></strong></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Bruce G Charlton</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Since
              ‘the Laura Spence Affair’ in 2000, the UK government has spent a great deal of
              time and effort in asserting that universities, especially Oxford and
              Cambridge, are unfairly excluding people from low social class backgrounds and
              privileging those from higher social classes. Evidence to support the
              allegation of systematic unfairness has never been presented, nevertheless the
              accusation has been used to fuel a populist ‘class war’ agenda.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Yet in
              all this debate a simple and vital fact has been missed: higher social classes
              have a significantly higher average IQ than lower social classes. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">The exact
              size of the measured IQ difference varies according to the precision of
              definitions of social class – but in all studies I have seen, the measured
              social class IQ difference is substantial and of significance and relevance to
              the issue of university admissions. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">The
              existence of substantial class differences in average IQ seems to be uncontroversial
              and widely accepted for many decades among those who have studied the scientific
              literature. And IQ is highly predictive of a wide range of positive outcomes in
              terms of educational duration and attainment, attained income levels, and
              social status (see Deary – <em>Intelligence</em>,
              2001). </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">This means
              that in a meritocratic university admissions system there will be a greater
              proportion of higher class students than lower class students admitted to
              university. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">What is
              less widely understood is that – on simple mathematical grounds – it is
              inevitable that the differential between upper and lower classes admitted to
              university will become greater the more selective is the university. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">***</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">There
              have been numerous studies of IQ according to occupational social class,
              stretching back over many decades. In the UK, average IQ is 100 and the
              standard deviation is 15 with a normal distribution curve. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Social
              class is not an absolute measure, and the size of differences between social
              classes in biological variables (such as health or life expectancy) varies
              according to how socio-economic status is defined (eg. by job, income or
              education) and also by how precisely defined is the socio-economic status (for
              example, the number of categories of class, and the exactness of the
              measurement method – so that years of education or annual salary will generate
              bigger differentials than cruder measures such as job allocation, postcode
              deprivation ratings or state versus private education). </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">In
              general, the more precise the definition of social class, the larger will be
              the measured social class differences in IQ and other biological variables. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Typically,
              the average IQ of the highest occupational Social Class (SC) - mainly
              professional and senior managerial workers such as professors, doctors and bank
              managers - is 115 or more when social class is measured precisely, and about
              110 when social class is measured less precisely (eg. mixing-in lower status
              groups such as teachers and middle managers). </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">By comparison,
              the average IQ of the lowest social class of unskilled workers is about 90 when
              measured precisely, or about 95 when measured less precisely (eg. mixing-in
              higher social classes such as foremen and supervisors or jobs requiring some
              significant formal qualification or training).</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">The
              non-symmetrical distribution of high and low social class around the average of
              100 is probably due to the fact that some of the highest IQ people can be found
              doing unskilled jobs (such as catering or labouring) but the lowest IQ people
              are very unlikely to be found doing selective-education-type professional jobs
              (such as medicine, architecture, science or law). <span> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">In round
              numbers, there are differences of nearly two standard deviations (or 25 IQ
              points) between the highest and lowest occupational social classes when class
              is measured precisely; and about one standard deviation (or 15 IQ points)
              difference when SC is measured less precisely. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">I will
              use these measured social class IQ differences of either one or nearly two
              standard deviations to give upper and lower bounds to estimates of the
              differential or ratio of upper and lower social classes we would expect to see
              at universities of varying degrees of selectivity. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">We can assume
              that there are three types of universities of differing selectivity roughly
              corresponding to some post-1992 ex-polytechnic universities; some of the
              pre-1992 Redbrick or Plateglass universities (eg. the less selective members of
              the Russell Group and 1994 Group), and Oxbridge. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">The ‘ex-poly’
              university has a threshold minimum IQ of 100 for admissions (ie. the top half
              of the age cohort of 18 year olds in the population – given that about half the
              UK population now attend a higher education institution), the ‘Redbrick’
              university has a minimum IQ of 115 (ie. the top 16 percent of the age cohort);
              while ‘Oxbridge’ is assumed to have a minimum IQ of about 130 (ie. the top 2
              percent of the age cohort). </span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">When
              social class is measured precisely, it can be seen that the expected Highest SC
              to Lowest SC differential would probably be expected to increase from about
              three-fold (when the percentages at university are compared with the
              proportions in the national population) in relatively unselective universities
              to more than thirty-fold at highly selective universities. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">When
              using a more conservative assumption of just one standard deviation in average
              IQ between upper (IQ 110) and lower (IQ 95) social classes there will be significant
              differentials between Highest and Lowest social classes, increasing from
              two-fold at the ‘ex-poly’ through four-fold at the ‘Redbrick’ university to
              nine-fold at ‘Oxbridge’. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">In other
              words, according to social class definitions, the average child from the
              highest social class is from nine-to-thirty times more likely to qualify for
              admission to a highly selective university than the average child from the
              lowest social class. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Naturally,
              this simple analysis is based on several assumptions, each of which could be
              challenged and adjusted; and further factors could be introduced. However, the
              take-home-message is simple. When admissions are assumed to be absolutely meritocratic,
              social class IQ differences of plausible magnitude lead to highly significant
              effects on the social class ratios of students at university when compared with
              the general population. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Furthermore,
              the social class differentials inevitably become highly amplified at the most selective
              universities such as Oxbridge. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Indeed, it
              can be predicted that around half of a random selection of kids whose parents
              are among the IQ 130 ‘cognitive elite’ (eg. with both parents and all
              grandparents successful in professions requiring high levels of highly selective
              education) would probably be eligible for admission to the most-selective
              universities or the most selective professional courses such as medicine, law
              and veterinary medicine; but only about one in two hundred of kids from the
              lowest social stratum would be eligible for admission on meritocratic grounds. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">In other
              words, with a fully-meritocratic admissions policy we should <em>expect</em> to see a differential in favour
              of the highest social classes relative to the lowest social classes at all
              universities, and this differential would become very large at a highly-selective
              university such as Oxford or Cambridge. </span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">The highly
              unequal class distributions seen in elite universities compared to the general
              population are unlikely to be due to prejudice or corruption in the admissions
              process. On the contrary, the observed pattern is a natural outcome of
              meritocracy. Indeed, anything other than very unequal outcomes would need to be
              a consequence of non-merit-based selection methods. </span></p>

              <p>Well that's the way it works out anyway... the debate is how many people from each social class get those top grades not anything else.</p>
              <p>And there has been no suggestion that the rich need higher grades. Some universities look down on private schools here because they tend to teach for pupils to take exams rather than teach pupils to learn and thus those from a private school background with good grades can often do worse in uni than people from public schools with the same grade. but that said there are many of a poorer background in private schools and many richer in public... so that's not really relevant to the matter in hand.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Ha!  What a sham!  Charlton writes about social class not being an absolute measure, but conveniently glosses over the fact that IQ is by definition a relative score.  He's arguing for tightening the screws on the stern while the bow could be leaking like a sieve.  Given that different tests produce different scores for each person, it's very foolish of him to take IQ scores as a self-evident fulcrum upon which to base the rest of his argument.  Guess he doesn't have a very high IQ. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p></div>

              <p>IQ scores aside, i would think its getting harder for working class to to climb the social ladder in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Academic performance is increasingly dependent on the "<strong>army of tutors</strong>"  a student has.Being born in a high social class gives advantage to resources available for private instruction.</p>
              <p>I remembered years back NUS produced a study to show private tuition had no effect on improving school grades. But is it a case of seeing what they want to see -  IQ is the dominant factor affecting grades and family background gives little advantage in academic performance.</p>
              <p>If the study could select only</p>
              <p>i)competent teachers and</p>
              <p>ii) motivated students</p>
              <p>rather than a general sample, would the conclusion be the same?</p>
              <p>After all</p>
              <p>i)competent teachers and</p>
              <p>ii) unmotivated students</p>
              <p>or</p>

              <p>ii) motivated students</p>
              <p>produce little effect on improving the grades of the student.</p>
