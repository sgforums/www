              <p>EXACTLY how much is sunk in or exposed, I do not think the majority is interested to them as they feel that it does not affect or relate to them.</p>
              <p>TC collects HDB conservancy charges or not? i no no leh. advise leh.</p>
              <p>So, I think like the halimah mp said no need worry wanz. Lets see if any MP voice up this concern. If none, I think it certifies that we really no need to worrys whatever amount of TC funds has sunk in.</p>

Their parents sometimes weep tears of pride when they see them study so many years mugging the books and come out a GRADUate of the ultimate kind.

              <p><br>From his response, he is not 100% ignorant.  Probably he can't stand those who disagree with Pay and Pay still want to survive here.  Strange logic, for people who don't agree with the ways of Pay and Pay must get lost and those who support Pay and Pay stay on.   Then all oppositions must also get lost and migrate.  Let this island be filled with people who support and agree with PAP.  Ha ha ha ha.</p>
