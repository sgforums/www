              <p>You think everyone is rich and capable to migrate, use your brain, kid.   If I am given the opportunity I will go, no need to worry for me.   If you are genuinely in knowing the PAP's ways then there is no need to tell people to start packing and go.      Why act a wolf in sheep's clothing to tell people who don't agree with PAP off in such a coward way?    Stop pretending you are below 21 and go on with your nuisance to oppose people who disagree with PAP.    Troll you are!</p>
