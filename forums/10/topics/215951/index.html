            <div class='col-md body'>Critical analysis from the Singapore Media Watch:<br><br><a href="http://www.mediawatchsg.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.mediawatchsg.blogspot.com</a><br><br>We publish what the Straits Times don't.<br><br><strong>Thai amnesty for errant foreign investors mooted - Straits Times </strong><br><br>Straits Times<br>19 October 2006<br>Leslie Lopez<br><br><strong>Abstract</strong><br><br>Foreign investors should be free from prosecution for three years while they reveal the full extent of their ownership of Thai companies, says the nation's chief economic adviser.<br><br>Such an amnesty should also provide ample time - up to 10 years - to allow such companies to rid themselves of any illegal holdings, Dr Ammar Simawalla told The Straits Times in an interview yesterday.<br><br>Dr Ammar also said that the interim government here in Bangkok should not just focus on the controversial deal between Singapore's Temasek Holdings and Shin Corp, but should conduct a sweeping overhaul of the country's foreign ownership laws.<br><br>"Let's be frank, <span style="color: red;">past governments have been in cahoots with foreign business</span> in the use of nominees to bypass ownership laws," said Dr Ammar, whose views are taken seriously by Bangkok's ruling elite.<br><br>He said overseas investors in Thailand had side-stepped local laws limiting foreign ownership to 49 per cent for years. They have done this by parking their undeclared equity holdings with local nominees.<br><br>Dr Ammar says the practice became prevalent because "government lawyers winked at the use of nominees". It enabled foreign investors to flout the spirit of Thailand's ownership laws.<br><br>Temasek came under fire over allegations that it violated Thai laws by using local business nominees to hold stakes in Shin Corp on its behalf.<br><br>The Singapore investment agency has <span style="color: orange;">strenuously denied those charges</span>, and has insisted that it complied with all the laws and regulations in Thailand.<br><br><strong>Our Review</strong><br><br>For those of you who have been following closely the Temasek-Shin Corp controversy in both the Thai and local dailies, you will not fail to notice the stark constrast in the style of reporting between the two in terms of emphasis and tone.<br><br>While the local media had been unusually quiet in the past one week, publishling only a reply from Temasek on 17 October 2006 in the Straits Times Forum and a report today in the Straits Times, the affair has enjoyed generous coverage in Thailand with daily updates available on The Bangkok Post and The Nation. Are Singaporeans less concerned about their national affairs than the Thais?<br><br>What the Thais report<br><br>If you have read the Thai reports, you will agree that they have used strong and harsh words on Temasek. Critical information such as the magnitude of its financial loss and damage to foreign relations are suppressed and not reported in the local media.<br><br>Just to quote a few examples:<br><br>1. Temasek Holdings of Singapore is willing to cut its losses and reduce its holding in Shin Corp. (The Nation, 18 October 2006)<br><br>2. Temasek's exposure in Shin turned into a giant mistake following the ousting of Thaksin Shinawatra as prime minister in last month's military coup. (The Nation, 18 October 2006)<br><br>3. The deal has also put Temasek's business practices in the spotlight and has brought an<br>awkward atmosphere to relations between Thailand and Singapore. (The Nation, 17 October 2006)<br><br>4. Democrat Party deputy secretary-general Korn Chatikavanij said Temasek's statement was ambiguous and could not be used to interpret plans for its next step. (The Nation, 17 October 2006)<br><br>5. Singapore state investment firm Temasek Holdings stands to lose more than Bt20 billion if it were to sell off its controversial majority holding in Shin Corp, financial experts believe. (The Nation, 18 October 2006).<br><br>These statements will give readers an impression that:<br><br>1. Temasek had probably made a big mistake in the purchase of Shin Corp.<br><br>2. The financial losses from the sale of its share will be tremendous.<br><br>3. Relationship between Singapore and Thailand has been strained due to the controversy enshrouding the deal.<br><br>To read the rest of this article, please read it at:<br><br><a href="http://www.mediawatchsg.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.mediawatchsg.blogspot.com</a></div>
