              <div id="post_message_2109511">
              <div id="post_message_2109511"><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/video_and_audio/7950333.stm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #417e15;">http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/video_and_audio/7950333.stm</span></span></a><br><br>BBC: Your own family has been quite involved in these funds. Your wife, till recently, ran Temasek. Your father’s deeply involved in GIC. Is there a risk that when the news is bad, as it has been over the past year for these funds, people will tend to blame your family rather than the institutions?<br><br>LHL: I think the way you put it is not the way things work in Singapore. The Minister Mentor is chairman of GIC not because he’s my father. It’s because he’s the best man for the job and he has been chairman since he was prime minister. Ho Ching is CEO of Temasek not because she’s my wife but because the chairman of Temasek and the board decided that they wanted to appoint her as CEO. And they’re there as long as they’re effective, performing, and if they don’t perform, well, they have to take the consequences. <br><br>BBC: A thing or two about perception. Perception is important in politics. And in difficult times like these, do you think, in retrospect, it might have been better for your family to have a lower profile?<br><br>LHL: (Laughs) Life would have been easier for me if the Minister Mentor were not my father and Ho Ching were not my wife. But they’re there. This is the way Singapore has worked. I think Singaporeans have understood this is how the system works. And they will render judgement when elections come.<br><br><br>BBC: Talking about elections, this is probably going to be the toughest year that most Singaporeans can remember. Are you anticipating some shows of public anger or displeasure because it is such a new experience for so many Singaporeans?<br><br>LHL: I think it is quite understandable that in a situation like this Singaporeans will be quite anxious, will be worried about their future and I think they have seen what the government has been doing. We had a very decisive Budget this year. The package was not only a big one but a directly focused one on saving jobs and helping people see through the downturn. And we will have to make sure we explain to people what can be done, what we’re doing and what they have to do.<br><br>BBC: People tend to blame governments…<br><br>LHL: Yes, that tends to happen but on the other hand, we’ve been through crises before and most times, after we’ve come back out and if we’ve handled it properly, we’ve come out stronger and better for the experience. <br><br>BBC: Finally Prime Minister, I read that you’re apparently the highest-paid head of government in the world. Your salary is about four, five times what President Obama gets. Are you worth all that money?<br><br>LHL: (Laughs) I’m not comparing myself and I don’t look at these rankings. We go on a system which is open, honest, transparent. What is the job worth, what is the quality of person whom you want. You need the best people for the job and these are jobs where you make decisions which are worth billions of dollars. And you cannot do that if you’re pretending and you just say, well, we’re all in it for the love of king and country. We wanted to be honest, we want people not to come in for the money but at the same time, their sacrifice cannot be too great. And at times like these, you want the best possible government you can have.</div>

              <p>I think like doctors, medicine is a calling not a job or inducements to join the profession. if you are in for the money, then you are not a really passionate doctor to practising medicine, as the saying goes. there are some better paying jobs like law and businesses.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>likewise, serving the nation is a calling. you dun join the politics because of money, cos you will never get rich from it. if pay is a consideration, then dun join politics. I am sure there are people who are willing to serve the nation, even if you pay them an annual salary of 100,000.</p>

              <p>Clinton and Lewinsky was the private affairs which i have no interest in.   What is more important is Clinton turned the US economy around in his term as President.   As for obama, we will continue to see what he will contribute.    What has leehsienloong contributed ever since he took over as PM?   Increase and adjust the salary of his and his team members to world class salary?</p>
              <p>So do you think leehsienloong is better than these 2?</p>

              <p>Quote from LHL: what is the quality of person whom you want. You need the best people for the <strong>JOB</strong> and these are jobs where you
                                      make decisions which are worth billions of dollars.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It should not be a "job" to serve the country but an honour and privilege. And your quality is also not very "high". You are you-know-who's son and that's why you perceive yourself to be of superior "quality" to others.</p>

              <p>Good point, so who ever said we are paying our PM $1 per month? Why did you ask this in the 1st place?</p>
              <p>In every single domain, there are market rates. Political leaders are no different. If there is no one to control rewarding, human beings have a tendency to over-reward. This is what is happening in SG now. How do you justify a $3million salary? You tell me.</p>

              <p>How much more idiocy can an amateur politician display in a reply that is filled with contradiction and simple stupidity ?</p>
              <p>Does one pretend when we "<em>just say we're all in it for the love of king and country</em>" ?</p>
              <p>Like his father - are both of them pretending when both do not seem to take the simple words in the Singapore Pledge with an solemn seriousness, even as this Pledge is taken on the most solemn day of the Calendar - on National Day ?</p>
              <p>Is there a <strong>KING</strong> in Singapore, or is the "cat out of the bag" that the Dynasty is being created by small incremental steps ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The word "<strong>wanted</strong>" in his statement is surprisingly made in the <strong>past tense</strong> - does it mean that the PAP no longer have "honesty" as a pre-condition ?</p>
              <p>Has the PAP now opted to use money to buy the required "honesty" in exchange for the sacrifices made for being called to Public Office ?</p>
