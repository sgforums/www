They have been too secretive for all the years since it was first established.<br><br>I am not surprised if there are ISD Officers are accessing sgForums.<br>Who knows at the next moment, they might be investigating who I am and why I wrote this, without me knowing???<br><br>But I strongly believe that ISD Officers are doing their very best everyday, every hour and mintue to protect Singapore.<br>My Salute to all the men and women who have served in ISD and the Special Branch.<br></div>

What is their motto and mission?<br><br>2. how is their structure and organisation?<br><br>3. their orbat: what are the various depts in MSD?<br><br>4. what do the various depts do?<br><br>5. do they deals with military security only? or many other matters?<br><br>Perhaps you would reply by saying that it's all about Military Security, they are not allowed to let anyone know anything except those concerned.<br><br>I can understand that. Never fool around with the survival of Singapore, like some people who fool around in niteclubs with the PRs.<br><br>Please kindly place your comments.<br><br>p/s: wondering if there is any MSD personnel in the forums, reading what i have commented earlier???<br>I think there is.<br></div>
