              <p>I am a Chartered Accountant, holding a high pay job in China and returned to Spore every 3-6 months. I live in an apartment in China that every Singaporean can only dream of. It is penthouse located at the 30th floor looking over every corner of the city. I was driven for work and leisure. I have maids that clean the house and do the cooking that taste fantastic and I can look forward to a good meal after a hard day work. On the weekend, I travel to look around either by jets or driven to as long as I can find the most beautiful places around me. Am I lucky ?? BUT I WISH I can be home...because;</p>
              <p>1. My Chinese colleagues are far more intelligence and political than whan we Singaporean are. They turn everycorner to find the shortest way for enrichment.</p>
              <p>2. They growth up in the most competitive enviironment and will defend their rights (or wrongs) when threatened. This is ok when evey human being will do likewise but you can never imagine a very very trival issue  will often spike a roar. As foreigner it best to keep away from trouble least you are 'localised' enough to deal with it.</p>
              <p>3. It is much more easy to communicate with Singaporean than local cause you need patience to spend hours listening and communicating to get to the real issue. Chinese colleagues talk only of the real issue after hours spend in communication or dinning.</p>
              <p>4. If you are working far in the North China, prepared for the sub zero degree cold where voice freeze and water become ice in second. You are locked in the prison of your home after work in winter.</p>
              <p>5. If you enjoy the ease of friendship in Singapore when we can coffee under the moon and dine in round or sqaure table, Chinese still pratice formality of sitting arrangements according to seniority. If you happend to be sitted at the edge of the table last in the ranking, you will be bore to dead keeping your mouth shut.</p>
              <p>6. When you decide to go on shopping be sure you know the price least your end up for lowest quality and highest price.</p>
              <p>7. If you tend to be kind hearted do practice some charity but often you find out why Chinese dont donate because it end up in the black hole where the money is never being probably accounted for.</p>
              <p>8. If you wish to think a dollar is nothing than you will be surprise that you pay many of the same dollar for correction because it is normal for work to be done sub-standard or wrong so that you pay to make it right.</p>
              <p>9. Dont preach 'professional' unless you keep the last dollar in your pocket until the work in done to your satisfaction.</p>
              <p>10. Dont believe communist is dead when your colleague still believe the party words are the most authoritative. The party secretary is more powerful that the CEO in the company.</p>
              <p>11. Forget your Singporean pride when you have no relationship to get you around. Everythings will become a roadblock even to get your house gas or phone working.</p>
              <p>12. Dont ever say anything that insult the local nationality because after the 60th year parade, China will rise to become once again the No 1 for everything of the world.</p>
              <p>and many more.....</p>

              <p><em></em></p>
              <p>Aren't our Singaporean's environment as competitive, with the import of India's Indian, China's Chinese and people from SE Asian? I had a class of 25 students, only 5 were Singaporeans, the rest were high-flyers from the region and beyond. Are you implying that Singapore, with it's multi-racial composition, trivial issue can never spark into a roar?  </p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>So? In Rome, do what the Roman does! </p>
              <p> </p>

              <p><em></em></p>
              <p>Singaporean not Chinese? 78% are still Chinese. Seniority is still observed in Chinese household, and may I add, the Indian and Malay households as well.</p>

              <p>Charity is between you and your God. Don't do it or do it because the Chinese are blah blah...</p>

              <p>That is why we call them emerging economies and not matured economies!</p>

              <p>Follow this advice anywhere in the world, not just in China! </p>

              <p>I have some points to make about the above.</p>
              <ol>
              <li>I have an uncle who likes to say that we are inferior than the Northerners because our ancestors cannot make it in China and thus had to leave China to come to Singapore to find a better life. I find that remark very unacceptable, as it is precisely only those who want to make life better for themselves, who are willing to overcome uncertainties to make a change. People who dare to uproot themselves are mostly intelligent and capable in their own right</li>
              <li>I do not agree that Chinese from China are smarter than us. I have personally defeated many Chinese before, and in my profession, in my domain, the Chinese cannot match me at all. It will take them decades to reach to where I am today. Today, I dare to say that any PRC who face me in my domain will be very worried.</li>
              <li>China will not be the No. 1 for everything in the world for the following reasons - a - No proper morals in business. b - Quality, c - Communism. d - complacency. If you are truly in China, you will know what I mean.</li>
              <li>I am proud of being a Singaporean. We represent quality, efficiency and system. True, PRCs can drop their morals to make a quick buck, but its all about using your qualities to your best advantage.</li>
              </ol>
              <p>as an Expat myself, I am very surprised by the way you speak of yourself (and the English...), as if you are an inferior person relative to the locals. I truly wonder if you are really in China, but I shall give you the benefit of the doubt.</p>

              <p>One must be insane to say anything that insult the local nationality - whether there is any grand anniversary parade or not.</p>
              <p>China will be No 1 only when they can find continuous and successive lines of good leaders similar to President Hu and Premier Wen - and with each successive leadership team paying attention to grow a modern, efficient, dedicated, incorruptible and loyal Civil Service throughout every province that will submit itself and support the Central Government in every way.</p>
              <p>At the present stage, the provincial governments that are thriving economically can get distracted by new found wealth and the good life, and forget their political and social responsibilities - and succumb to corruption.</p>
              <p>Such provinces are those that are furthest from the Central Government in Beijing.</p>
              <p>Grand parades and huge celebrations of anniversaries will not help China to advance - but economic progress, sound political practices that give the Citizens a voice and control over the future of the Country will surely help China to grow.</p>
