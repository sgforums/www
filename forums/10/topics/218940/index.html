            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote> Quote from "matagandhi" posted at youngpap And 66.6% of the voters chose the PAP. I am not saying that all the 33.3% who voted for the opposition are ungrateful people, but end of they day, we must still respect the wish of the majority.<br>and liked we said before<br>if you removed the grc bullies<br>you would not even get 66%<br>so don't be ungrateful to the citizens</blockquote>Good point!!! if PAP is to compete fairly without resorting to defamation suits against opposition candidates of potential we would have a more vibrant political process today to help us become more competitive socially culturally and economically.<br><br>However political oppositions were regularly sued for defamation for innuendos made in the heat of electioneering and were deprived of opportunities to stand for election as single candidates by the engineered GRC blockade and electoral boundary redrawing.<br><br>Without such below-the-belt questionable methodology it will be doubtful if it could secure even 40% of the votes.<br><br>This topic is about who should be grateful to who - ministers and MPs who should be grateful to the people or the other way round.<br><br>Yes, people were grateful to the founding father for their contributions in building the nation from scratch in 1960s. But since the 1970s when the first generation leaders began to promote elitism and their own glory and rewarding themselves with the highest salaries and rewards against the wishes of the people, the later batches of MPs and Ministers have not been performing up to the expectation of the masses.<br><br>If these MPs and Ministers have half the quality as expected they should have helped to correct some of the major policy errors such as high-cost tax-and-recover and corporatisation policies which resulted in losses of economic competitiveness and technology start-ups<br><br>So objectively based on facts and numbers, have the later-year MPs and Ministers done a good job since 1970s for which the people should be grateful<br><br>So many talented scholars were put up to be MPs and Ministers since 1970s but they seem to come and go receiving million-dollar salaries and good lifelong retirement golden eggs but have they solved or help solve the high cost and 20 major policy errors as pointed out in various feedbacks.<br><br>People who committed suicides by jumping the MRT tracks could have caused chaotic street demonstrations. But they were patient and tolerated the non-performing MPs and ministers who were receiving all the million-dollar salaries without solving problems or proving their worth through performance over 20 years and were still being given so many chances since 1970s.<br><br>So it may be asked : who should be indeed grateful to who.</div>
