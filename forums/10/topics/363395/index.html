              <p><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Temasek's direction under new management</strong></span><br> <br> FinanceAsia.com, 9 Jun 2009, By Sameera Anand  <br> <em><strong><br> Nomura research on Temasek reckons changes are likely under incoming
              CEO Charles Goodyear and comments on the firm's returns on its
              financial sector investments.</strong></em><br> <br> Charles Goodyear is slated to take over as chief executive officer of
              Temasek from Ho Ching on October 1. This has prompted Nomura to review
              the Singapore-based investment firm's track record and strategies under
              Ching, and to draw inferences from Goodyear's background as to how he
              will manage the firm. Its conclusions were published in a research
              report last week.<br> <br> The analysis of Temasek is what Nomura terms an anchor report, in which
              it examines the key themes and value drivers upon which it is basing
              sector views and stock recommendations. <span style="color: red;"><strong>Temasek did not talk to Nomura for the report.</strong></span><br> <br> Temasek has succeeded in geographically diversifying its portfolio, Nomura commented, with S<span style="color: red;"><strong>ingapore now accounting for one-third of its exposure, down from 50% five years ago</strong></span>. However, despite the diversification, Nomura estimated the portfolio was down 23% by May 2009 compared to March 2008.<br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>Nomura questioned whether Temasek is over-exposed
              to the financial sector, as its exposure to the sector has doubled to
              40% in 2008 from 21% in 2004.</strong></span> Given that <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>a significant portion of the investments in financials are held by Fullerton Financial Holdings, </strong></span></span>Nomura
              speculated that Goodyear could consider an initial public offering of
              Fullerton. Nomura has suggested that Temasek might create a special
              purpose vehicle to allow other investors to co-invest alongside
              Temasek. This would enable Temasek to continue to invest in attractive
              opportunities without significantly increasing its financial exposure,
              while other investors could tap into Fullerton's operational expertise.<br> <br> Goodyear's past track record led Nomura to suggest that Temasek could
              gear up the balance sheet as the cheapest form of raising financing, a
              strategy he adopted at BHP Billiton. As is now widely predicted,<span style="color: red;"><strong> Goodyear is also likely to increase investing in natural resources assets</strong></span>, given his own familiarity with the sector. Under Goodyear's stewardship, <span style="color: red;"><strong>Temasek could also enhance its focus on China,</strong></span> either through expanding existing representative offices or by making
              further investments in local private equity funds. Nomura also
              suggested that under Goodyear <span style="color: red;"><strong>Temasek could play a more active role in Temasek-linked companies.<br> </strong></span> <br> "We think Temasek's performance over the <span style="color: red;"><strong>tenure of [Ho Ching's] term has been</strong></span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>respectable</strong></span></span>,"
              wrote Nomura, referring to the increase in the portfolio value to S$185
              billion ($127 billion) in March 2008, from S$90 billion in 2004.<br> <br> Temasek measures total shareholder return (TSR) by market value and by
              shareholder funds. During its 34-year history, Temasek's TSR by market
              value has been 18%, but Nomura noted that <span style="color: red;"><strong>its performance has weakened in recent years, with one-year TSR by market value falling to 7% as of March 2008.</strong></span> Nomura suggested Temasek could see a further dip in TSR in the fiscal
              year to March 2009 due to losses on the Merrill Lynch investment and
              the worsening of the financial crisis, though it added that these may
              be cushioned by the sales of three Singapore power generating companies
              during the course of the year.<br> <br> Nomura analysed in detail Temasek's "unprecedented loss" from the
              investment in Merrill Lynch, terming the firm's decision to exit the
              resultant stake in Bank of America in the first quarter of calendar
              2009 as surprising. Nomura referred to street estimates that Temasek
              lost between $2.3 billion and $4.6 billion. It fielded the criticism
              that <span style="color: red;"><strong>Temasek realised the paper loss in an untimely manner, just as the overall market was recovering,</strong></span> by highlighting that Temasek freed up capital and sectoral limits to increase its stake in China Construction Bank.<br> <br> Among the Singapore companies in its portfolio, <span style="color: red;"><strong>DBS
              Group Holdings, Singapore Airlines, ST Engineering and Neptune Orient
              Lines are likely to be strategic investments for Temasek</strong></span> which it will continue to own, said Nomura. Its holdings in SMRT
              Corporation, SembCorp Industries, Singapore Telecom and StarHub could
              be trimmed, while <span style="color: red;"><strong>PSA International, Mapletree Investments, Mediacorp, Changi Airport and Fullerton are potential IPO candidates.</strong></span><br> <br> A merger between DBS and Standard Chartered does not seem likely in the
              near future, Nomura said, as it is complicated by domicile, legal and
              regulatory jurisdiction, and accountability. But Nomura suggested that
              in the longer run it is an idea worth exploring as it would be in
              Singapore's best interest to have a regional financial powerhouse.<br> <br> ------------------------<br> <span style="color: navy;"><strong>More at <a href="http://singaporenewsalternative.blogspot.com/">Singapore News Alternative</a>:</strong><br> <br> 1.
