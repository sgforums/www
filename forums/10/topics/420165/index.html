              What's really behind the restriction on Thaipusam?      
              Wednesday, 12 January 2011  
              Teoh Tian Jing
              
              Could the new Thaipusam regulations be a knee-jerk response to the gang-related street violence in recent months? The announcement of the restrictions by the Hindu Endowments Board (HEB) seems to suggest so.
              
              
              Under the new rules, no singing or music is allowed in the procession, and portable music equipment are banned as well. The 2011 guidelines states that "shouting and other forms of unruly behavior is prohibited; participants shall not paint their faces or bodies or wear any form of disguise".
              
              
              Is shouting considered unruly behaviour? If it is, what do we do about people screaming (often vulgarity) during a football match? And if painting one's face is prohibited, then those who paint their faces during National Day Parades should be disallowed too. What about disguise? Are we also going to ban the lion dance and the bighead doll that accompanies the lion? What about the guy in the Tua Pek Kong costume giving out ang pows?
              
              This is the problem with Singapore. The Government makes rules that arbitrarily discriminate against certain sections of the community. This creates resentment among the people.
              
              When the authorities should be relaxing rules to allow for more spontaneity and expression, it does the opposite and enforces even more conformity in our society.
              
              Singaporeans are, by and large, a tolerant people when it comes to religious and ethnic ceremonies. Hungry Ghost Festival getais, deity processions, Malay weddings, and Chinese funerals have been taking place frequently in our midst and for many decades.
              
              So it seemed more than a little strange that one of the reasons cited was that "residents of new homes along the processions 4km route" had complained about the Thaipusam festival. The procession courses through parts of Orchard Road and Tank Road which means that it does not affect Singaporean heartlanders. So who are the real complainants? Are they Singaporeans?
              
              What about the road closures? Are the complaints because of the inconvenience caused by the closure of the roads? If that's the case, then what about the road closures for the F1 race and National Day parades which occur for several days and weekends. The Thaipusam festival occurs only for one day in a year.
              
              The pervasive social control the government wields on Singapore society applies not only to religious issues. In 1987, then Prime Minister and current Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew said: "If we had not intervened on very personal matters - who your neighbour is, how you live, the noise you make, how you spit, or what language you use. We decide what is right. Never mind what the people think."
              
              The potential for this resentment may not be evident now as the PAP continues to take a heavy-handed authoritarian approach on social issues against segments of the population. But there are indications that resentment is building up, and the PAP may find itself falling from its authoritarian grace simply because the people have had enough.
              
              The PAP deflects political responsibility by getting the government-appointed HEB to announce the restrictions. It doesn't hide anything.
              
              If the new rules are a reaction to the recent gang violence, then it is overkill. Does the police have evidence that Thaipusam festivities are related to violence?
              
              The ban on drums, body painting and music removes the traditional and religious elements of Thaipusam. It will only disappoint those seeking religious solace as they take part in this annual event. 
              
              The PAP champions religious tolerance among Singaporeans. It does not seem to practice what it preaches.

              <p>judging from various youtube videos (my knowledge of thaipusam is limited), drums, body painting &amp; music seems to be common during thaipusam</p>
              <p>this restriction seems equivalent to banning drums and lion dance costumes for the chinese</p>

              <p>Every year my family and friends (non-Hindus) enjoy watching the Thaipussam procession and celebrations along Serangoon road. It is heartwarming that charitable Hindus even provide drinks and snacks to onlookers celebrating with them. The rhythmic sounds of drums are part and parcel of the holy event. In Japan, there are countless street processions celebrated throughout the year with gongs and drums adding to the atmosphere and festivity. Such events are great tourist attractions. Similarly, Singapore could definitely benefit from such a event as a tourist attraction as well.</p>
              <p>Curtailing this event by banning music along the route is too drastic. Singapore is a multi-cultural and multi-religious society. Is such a measure not indicative of religious intolerance? It is surprising that the authorities took such quick action to curb a holy festival that is celebrated and enjoyed by many Singaporeans. Is this not hypocritical?</p>

              <blockquote>
              <p>Under the new rules, no singing or music is allowed in the
                                      procession, and portable music equipment are banned as well. The
                                      2011 guidelines states that “shouting and other forms of unruly
                                      behavior is prohibited; participants shall not paint their faces or
                                      bodies or wear any form of disguise”.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>if there's no singing or music, then the poccession will be silent. no paint or disguise means that thaipusam will be reduced to a group of half naked indian men with extensive body piercings walking down the streets in silence.  wtf is that?</p>
              <p>thaipusam is worth watching as compared to pointless celebrations such as chingay. wtf is chingay all about?</p>
              <p>it does not celebrate anything, yet no restrictions are placed on it.</p>

              <p>ar?? anti PAP rally?? no lah, why so sensitive, we are just open for discussion, and some point taken, you can close road here and there for F1, you cannot do it for a cultural activity in singapore?? And with  2.4 litre car I am driving while paying thousand over road tax, you close the city road for days just to have your F1 zooming away?? whereas thaipusam is just short 1/2 day or more , and you restrict their movement and expression??</p>
              <p>So far, did thaipusam in singapore created any problem of riot or mass fighting?? I think we all go happily and went home happily, either particpants or sightseeing, no problem at all. Frankly, I love PAP, they created a good business enviroment for me to earn a good living here, but they should take care on youth slashing each other than a mere enjoyable Thaipusam for all.</p>
              <p>And if Thaipusam  cannot shout or paint or behavor in a happy manner, ask them to make NDP a funneral pocession better. No fly over, no face painting, no shouting, no majulah Singapura.</p>
