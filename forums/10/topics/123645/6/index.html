No policy shifts have been announced yet.<br><br>Chen has to seek reconciliation ``because that is what the majority of people in Taiwan want,'' said Chen Yu-chun, who teaches U.S. and Chinese studies at the Chinese Culture University in Taipei. ``Without integration with China, Taiwan's economy may be ruined in five years.''<br><br>Chen said he will propose setting up a communication channel with China, Taiwan's China News Agency said, citing comments Chen made today on a visit to the Marshall Islands. The report didn't elaborate or say if the plan will be contained in a message Chen said he's sending to Chinese leaders this week.<br><br>`Taiwan's Nixon'<br><br>``Chen may want to be Taiwan's Nixon,'' Philip Yang, professor of political science at National Taiwan University said of the possibility of a Chen visit to China. ``Chen wants to get the initiative back on China and may not exclude the possibility of improving ties on non-political issues.''<br><br>Chen, 54, is visiting the Marshall Islands and two other small Pacific Ocean nations that are among the 25 countries in the world still maintaining diplomatic ties with Taiwan. The visit coincides with the tail-end of Lien weeklong trip to China, the highest-ranking Taiwan politician to visit the mainland since both sides split in 1949.<br><br>Both men are considered lame ducks in Taiwan politics. Chen, who won by 30,000 of 13 million votes cast in the 2004 election, can't run again when his current term expires in 2008. Lien at 68 is expected to step aside as his party's standard- bearer after losing two presidential elections.<br><br>``Both sides are masters of position and repositioning,'' said Robert Broadfoot, managing director of Political &amp; Economic Risk Consultancy Ltd. in Hong Kong. ``It's a new move on this chess board. The Nationalists are moving one of back pieces and that may force Chen to move a back piece. Ninety percent of what these politicians do is for their domestic audience.''<br><br>Go-Between<br><br>Chen, whose ruling Democratic Progressive Party has run afoul of China with its calls for Taiwan independence, said yesterday he will send a message to China's leaders when a second opposition leader, People First Party leader James Soong, visits China for the first time this week. He didn't disclose what the message will convey.<br><br>Chen's offer in 2000 to hold a summit with Chinese leaders was snubbed because he refused to endorse the ``one-China'' policy. The president said yesterday that China must deal with him, as the island's elected leader, if it wants to normalize relations.<br><br>Chen's newest initiative came as Lien's trip to China has been grabbing the media limelight in Taiwan and winning public support in opinion polls. The image of Lien's walking down a red carpet in Beijing's Great Hall of the People on April 29 to shake hands with Chinese President Hu Jintao probably will stand out as a major event in modern Chinese history.<br><br>``China has become the world's factory and the world's market,'' Lien told reporters in Shanghai today on the last leg of his trip. ``We must face this reality. The world's major countries have entered China to grab market share and opportunity.''<br><br>Growth Spurt<br><br>China is the world's fastest-expanding major economy. Growth of 9.5 percent in 2004 and in the first quarter was the fastest in eight years.<br><br>Taiwan businesses haven't been slow the grasp the opportunities that lie across 90 miles of waterway. They already have more than $100 billion invested in China, the island's biggest trading partner and largest export market.<br><br>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the world's biggest contract chipmaker, and other Taiwan technology companies are seeking wider access to China, where labor costs are cheaper, customers are closer and overseas rivals are expanding. Taiwan businessmen want the government to accelerate the approval process that vets their investments in China.<br><br>Chen's government slowed those approvals in the first quarter, in retaliation for China's enacting a law authorizing military force if the island declares separate statehood. Taiwan's corporate investment in China in the first quarter fell for the first time in five years, dropping 6.6 percent to $1.21 billion.<br><br>Dividing Issue<br><br>The issue of sovereignty over Taiwan has split the two sides since 1949, when Nationalist troops lost a civil war to Mao Zedong's Communist forces and fled to the island. China claims Taiwan in a renegade province that must be reunited with the mainland.<br><br>Two newspaper polls published in Taipei over the weekend showed the public supports reconciliation.<br><br>A United Daily News survey, conducted on April 29 after Hu met Lien, found 56 percent of 859 respondents believe the talks will foster cross-Strait peace. Thirty-one percent said they feel tensions with China are easing, the highest percentage in seven years, the Taipei-based paper said. The poll had a three percent margin of error.<br><br>Chen may have public support for peace overtures but selling it to his party, which rose to prominence as the champion of an independent Taiwan, may be difficult.<br><br>``The president has made a U-turn on China policy,'' Democratic Progressive lawmaker said in a television interview. ``If the president has new ideas, he has to convince his colleagues in the party. He can't just go ahead and do it.''<br><br>To contact the reporter on this story:<br>Koh Chin Ling in Shanghai at  at ckoh2@bloomberg.net<br>Yu-huay Sun in Taipei at  at ysun7@bloomberg.net</div>

Goodman<br><br>SHANGHAI, May 3 -- The leader of Taiwan's opposition Nationalist Party, wrapping up a historic visit to mainland China, said he had achieved a "fundamental consensus" with the country's Communist Party leadership to end hostilities that have enveloped the Taiwan Strait for more than half a century.<br><br>Lien Chan, head of the Nationalist Party, or Kuomintang, which ruled China until it fled to Taiwan in 1949 to escape victorious Communist forces, said Tuesday in an interview with The Washington Post that the channel he opened puts pressure on Taiwan's pro-independence president to seek a compromise with China. Lien, 68, also said his eight-day visit had unleashed a process of engagement that holds out the promise of peace, stability and increased trade.<br><br>Chinese President Hu Jintao, right, meets with Taiwanese opposition leader Lien Chan, the first Nationalist Party figure to visit the mainland since 1949.

"Isn't this the time for dialogue? Isn't this the general wishes of the people around the world?"<br><br>Lien's tour, which ended after a visit to this city, marked the first time that a Nationalist leader had stepped on mainland Chinese soil since the defeat of the Kuomintang leader Chiang Kai-shek at the hands of the Communists, who have governed since. He visited the former Nationalist capital in Nanjing and his birthplace in the city of Xian.<br><br>In a moment televised live on both sides of the strait, Lien shook hands Friday with President Hu Jintao, who controls a military that still points hundreds of missiles at Taiwan. Lien and Hu then unveiled a communique in which their two parties -- former sworn enemies -- vowed to seek a formal end to hostilities and increase economic ties.<br><br>On Monday in Shanghai, China's gleaming commercial capital, Lien met with Taiwanese businesspeople responsible for some of the island's estimated $70 billion in mainland investments, promising to try to forge a common market.<br><br>But as Lien departed on Tuesday, he confronted questions about whether the good feelings surrounding his visit could be parlayed into a harmonious future. It was unclear whether his trip had sufficiently altered politics on Taiwan to clear the way for talks between President Chen Shui-bian and leaders in Beijing.<br><br>Lien declined in the interview to offer an opinion on whether Taiwan should reunify with China, saying the Nationalists favor leaving the question to future generations. "We as a party have to follow the main current of Taiwan, and the maintenance of status quo commands the support of the majority," he said.<br><br>In a clear sign of the effect of Lien's visit, the Taiwanese president on Tuesday invited Hu to visit the island. China rejected the invitation but signaled a desire to continue engagement with Taiwan, announcing that it would lift restrictions on mainland tourists visiting the island and scrap tariffs on shipments of certain fruits. China also promised to deliver a pair of giant pandas to Taiwan as a goodwill gesture.<br><br>But China also underscored that a major stumbling block between the two sides remained in force: At a news conference in Beijing, Maj. Gen. Wang Zaixi, vice chairman of China's policymaking Taiwan Affairs Office, said Communist leaders would not engage in talks with Taiwan's government until it acknowledged that the island is part of China. Chen has steadfastly rejected that condition, asserting that it would violate Taiwan's sovereignty.<br><br>Lien's visit was read widely as an attempt to capitalize on growing impatience among Taiwan's citizens with the government's stance toward China. Even before Tuesday's flurry of overtures, the visit forced Chen to alter his approach: On Sunday, after the communique was issued, Chen told reporters that he was willing to hold official talks with China aimed at formal reconciliation.<br><br>In Tuesday's interview, Lien praised Chen for holding open the possibility of cross-strait talks. "I think he showed some goodwill," Lien said. But he also challenged the notion that realizing the goals of the communique depended on Chen's assent, pointing to China's scrapping of tariffs and travel restrictions as evidence. "Some can be done unilaterally, and some can be done by people, by the private sector," he said.<br><br>Recent public opinion polls in Taiwan have shown that a majority of people approved of Lien's visit and the prospect of improved relations with China. Still, Lien and his party face the risk that Chen and Taiwan independence activists could paint his visit as a sign that he has compromised the island's sovereignty for political gain.<br><br>"It's a democratic society," Lien said, dismissing such concerns. "You've got to have voices from different perspectives."<br><br>Chinese President Hu Jintao, right, meets with Taiwanese opposition leader Lien Chan, the first Nationalist Party figure to visit the mainland since 1949. (By Claro Cortes Iv -- Reuters)<br>_____Free E-mail Newsletters_____<br><br>Â• Today's Headlines &amp; Columnists<br>See a Sample  |  Sign Up Now<br>Â• Breaking News Alerts<br>See a Sample  |  Sign Up Now<br><br>The communique he struck with China reaffirms a 1992 agreement between the two sides that they both acknowledge that the mainland and Taiwan are part of "one China," while agreeing to disagree about what that means. That understanding disintegrated in 1999, as then-President Lee Teng-hui characterized his dealings with China as "a special state-to-state relationship." Relations have been at a stalemate since then.<br><br>Lien described his journey here as personal as much as political. He spent his first eight years in mainland China before his father, a Nationalist official, took him back to his native Taiwan at the end of World War II as the vanquished Japanese surrendered the island. Once the Communists took power, the Taiwan-mainland divide was sealed. On his visit to Xian, Lien visited the tomb of his grandmother for the first time in 60 years, voicing an apology to her for the long absence. He spoke in both the Taiwanese dialect and Mandarin, the Chinese national language.<br><br>In Beijing, he said he was touched by a personal overture from Hu, who gave him letters that Lien's father had sent to the Nationalist government in Nanjing in 1914 seeking official Chinese citizenship at a time when Taiwan was separated from China and ruled by Japan.<br><br>Lien's visit to Shanghai may have presented the most vivid reminder of how much has changed. On Monday, he met with one of China's principal negotiators with Taiwan, Wang Daohan, inside the old Jinjiang Hotel, a marble-and-brick building where in 1972 President Richard M. Nixon signed the Shanghai Communique, setting in motion the process under which the United States transferred diplomatic recognition of China from the Nationalists on Taiwan to the Communists in Beijing.<br><br>Six decades had passed since Lien lived in Shanghai. In those days, the city was confined to the west bank of the Huangpu River, while the east bank, Pudong, was a muddy fishing village. Today, Pudong is the center of the city's financial district, a riot of soaring towers of glass and steel. This was the scene visible from the 28th-story hotel suite in which Lien sat for the interview.<br><br>He did not, however, show much interest in the past. "History is history, and you can do nothing about it," he said. "But the future is something that you can do something about."<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The following discussion is related to the Carnegie Foundation link posted earlier and is of similar interest.<br><br><blockquote><br>RE:Interesting: CCP wants to soften its rule, either a little or a lot - but full democracy unlikely 5/5/2005 10:52:05 PM<br><br>Â”No Western (EU and US) style democracy, but further softening of the PartyÂ’s rule Â– into a worst a lighter-handed authoritarian sytem (but without formal checks and balances), and at best a system with internal checks and balances formalized. DonÂ’t know their time frame, but these experts seem to be saying within the next ten years.Â”<br><br>According to Joseph Fewsmith, there is cautious experimentation in open elections within villages and some townships. Although open elections are now still largely confined to the lower levels, if successful, similar elections will probably be introduced to the higher echelons of power. Also Bruce Dickson points to the move by Hu Jintao-Wen Jiabao away from elitism towards more people-oriented policies and at the same time, emphasizing transparency and accountability. Elizabeth Perry also pointed to the increasing social pressure for political reforms. Therefore, I am a little more optimistic and believe that within the next 10 yrs the lower end outcome will be some form of formalized, authoritarian system and hopefully, the better outcome would be wider and more open elections, albeit IMO, still within one-party rule.<br><br>Â”The only problem is: will it be enough? What if, before the further changes can proceed, there were to be a shock? Mass demonstrations versus corrupt officials, most likely? (Students seem intent on studies, workers on working, and people donÂ’t seem all fired up about religious freedom). Â“<br><br>It was MacFarquhar who suggested that only a massive shock can change what he terms as the elements of high-level bureaucratic trap, in short, Mao cult, the party, the communist creed and lastly the police/military powers. Basically, he believes that Hu-Wen will not be able to carry out radical reforms and that fundamental change can only happen through this massive shock. IMO, any massive shock is unlikely to happen internally but may be from an external event. It could be the Taiwan issue should pro-independence forces get the upper hand and events spin out of control. This is a scenario that is not in anybodyÂ’s interest and I believe the US and others will exert maximum effort to avoid this situation.<br><br>Â”Political fragmentation of or civil war seem remote (laughably remote, it seems to this layman), but if there were to be a shock, could a renewed jockeying for power within the government, and consequent radicalization of ChinaÂ’s policies, occur? At the very least, ChinaÂ’s non-institutional government bureaucracy would then be in disarray, until they sort things out (and that could take a while).Â”<br><br>Assuming there will be a massive internal shock, perhaps in the form of another Tiananmen-type incident, and assuming the worst, ie the political and government systems collapsing in disarray, the consequences will be pretty ugly. Not only will their internal economy be massively impacted, also the world economic system will suffer serious disruption. In this event, there is probably little that countries outside PRC could do except try to exercise some form of damage control.<br><br>In the event, a more realistic scenario could be what Cheng Li described as two steps forward, one step back (he wasnÂ’t talking about line-dancing!!). There would be temporary set back but eventually, things will return to some form of stability and equilibrium.<br></blockquote></div>

We have the spectacle of the country's opposition trying to act as its government in negotiating Taiwan's future with China's communist leadership. In doing so, it is circumventing the democratic process of an elected presidency which returned President Chen Shui-bian (Â’Ã‚Â�Â…Â�G) to power, and blurring the important distinction between China's communist dictatorship and Taiwan's democracy. Taiwan's distinct identity is largely shaped by its democratic system.<br>Which, in effect, means that no single political party has an entitlement to govern indefinitely. The entitlement comes from the popular choice of the people. If this choice were to appear irregular or rigged, there are appeal channels to contest this. And once these are exhausted, the finality of the decision is accepted and respected by all sides of the political spectrum. The country then gets behind the government of the day. Unfortunately, this is not happening in Taiwan at the present time.<br><br>Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan's (Â˜AÂ�D) China visit has created an anomaly of sorts. It suggests a historical continuity between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, marred only by the political feud of a bygone era between the communists and the KMT. The visit had the appearance of the return of the prodigal son, with an implied message of happy days to come. The television images of Lien's visit, and his meeting with Chinese President Hu Jintao (ÂŒÃ“Â‹Ã‘ÂŸÂ·), indicated some act of great reconciliation, though it is hard to pinpoint what it was.<br><br>Beijing got enough mileage out of it though. The passage of its "Anti-Secession" Law had dented its image, costing it the lifting of the EU arms embargo. But Lien's visit and the ensuing bonhomie seemingly made Taiwan's elected government ineffective.<br><br>It's clear that Chen is worried by the turn of events, with Beijing trying to manipulate Taiwan's politics to its advantage. Having failed to dissuade the opposition leaders from their ill-advised China trips, Chen is now trying to co-opt this new development as part of Taiwan's political process. For instance, he said Lien had not "overstepped the boundary" during his talks with communist leaders.<br><br>In any case, according to Chen, "No matter which Taiwanese party or individuals China chooses to talk to, it ultimately has to approach the leader elected by the Taiwanese people and the government of Taiwan." He seems keen to use People First Party Chairman James Soong (Â‘vÂ‘^Ã Ã¯) to establish some sort of contact with the Beijing leadership.<br><br>He wants to establish his government's relevance and efficacy in cross-strait affairs, and to avoid letting the opposition call the shots. The opposition, in any case, is not talking of handing over Taiwan to China in the near future. What they seem to be doing is to accept the principle of "one China," with Taiwan's eventual unification relegated to a longer time frame. In other words: to freeze the status quo over the medium or long term.<br><br>As Lien said in Beijing, "The two sides of the Strait must maintain the status quo." But this shouldn't be "static" or "passive," with both sides trying to "seek things in common from our differences and to accumulate goodwill." His vague formulation basically means that unification will happen eventually as China and Taiwan widen their common ground.<br><br>The question is: Will this be acceptable to the people of Taiwan? Judging by Chen's nervous and shifting response to the opposition leaders' China visits, he seems to think that they might win political mileage at home by appearing to be make some headway with Beijing. He is, therefore, trying not to appear completely negative about the visits, and is equally keen to start a dialogue by even co-opting the opposition into the process.<br><br>Chen is, of course, right to point out that ultimately Beijing has to "approach the leader elected by the Taiwanese people and the government of Taiwan" for any worthwhile progress in cross-strait relations to occur.<br><br>The point, therefore, is: How serious is China about entertaining the opposition's idea of eventual unification in a time frame of, say, 50 years?<br><br>Having waited for over 50 years to take over Taiwan, China's communist leadership seems rather in a hurry to finish the job. Indeed, their internal political compulsions of creating a legitimacy of sorts as champions of China's nationalism do not brook much delay. The Anti-Secession Law is an example of this.<br><br>What that means is that Beijing is playing politics with Taiwan's future, with the witting or unwitting cooperation of the country's opposition forces. They are trying to create the impression that only the opposition, with its newfound capacity to deal with China, can deliver and win popular appeal.<br><br>As a result of Lien's visit, Beijing is willing to accommodate the economic interests of special constituencies like farmers. In this way, it will seek to erode some of the ruling party's political support base. It would hope that this will increasingly make Chen's government ineffective and directionless, and forced to be reactive.<br><br>It would appear that Chen is already acting reactively by purportedly sending a message through Soong for Hu. He has also separately called for the setting up of a "cross-strait military and security mutual trust mechanism as soon as possible." Chen has also invited Hu to visit Taiwan.<br><br>The problem is that Beijing isn't listening because it seems to have put Chen on the defensive by playing politics with Taiwan. And he is unlikely to win this political game of competitive China wooing, because Beijing distrusts him. They find the opposition in Taiwan more responsive. He may, therefore, be well-advised to maintain and reinforce his political line of promoting Taiwan's own identity. It may be painful in the short run, but in the medium and long term it will better serve Taiwan's interests.<br><br>In any case, the opposition might find, when they sit down to discuss Taiwan's future, that Beijing is unlikely to wait much longer for the island's incorporation into China.<br><br>Sushil Seth is a freelance writer based in Sydney<br></div>

Peaceful re-unification.<br>US may have strategic interests in Taiwan. But if itÂ’s the choice of China AND Taiwan, I donÂ’t see how US can find any good reasons/excuses to interfere.Â”<br><br>The US probably does not view (and perhaps does not want) peaceful reunification as likely proposition within the near or even mid-term future. The security interest of the US atm lies in containment as long as CCP in its present form remains a threat. Hence, likely scenario is continued US support of TaiwanÂ’s autonomy under the TR Act. Taiwan is part of the chain for containment and will be supported with arms sales sufficient to maintain status-quo.<br><br>Politically, with the DPP in control there is no chance of reunification. Even in the event KMT/PFP regain power from Chen Suipian, reunification would still be a long way off. As I see it, the Taiwanese ppl are unlikely to accept reunification until the PRC becomes substantially more democratic. The vision of one country two systems ala HK is not going to be acceptable to the Taiwanese.<br><br>Â”2. Taiwan declares independence and China responds with war.<br>Whether this will happen is totally dependent on the political will of US.Â”<br><br>IMO, to say that declaration of independence is totally dependent on the US is unfair and does not give sufficient credit to the Taiwanese ppl. I believe the Taiwanese ppl are informed and rational and realize that to unilaterally declare independence is completely against their interest with disastrous consequences. The US also knows that any declaration of independence will destabilise the situation and ultimately be against their interest and that of their allies.<br><br>However, having said that, neither do the Taiwanese ppl want reunification under the present circumstances. Hence IMV, the scenario of unilateral declaration of independence is pretty far out. Nevertheless, I agree there is a small but significant risk that pro-independent forces may dominate the agenda and push towards independence. If this happens, there will be immediate reaction from Beijing and alarm bells will ring in Washington, followed by steps to reign them in.<br><br>Â”3. China attacks and invades Taiwan by surprise.Â”<br><br>This possibility is even further off the mark as they know that there is no way the PLA can invade without news leaking out and preparations being seen long before sufficient forces are built up.<br><br>Â”Taiwan is a pawn in the grand US-China strategic rivalry gameÂ…Â….<br><br>A wise and confident Chinese leadership should clearly choose to promote the first outcome (easy and peaceful victory), and deter/prepare for the second (no options but fight). Time is on their side. That seems to be what they are doing, rubbing shoulders with the opposition parties of Taiwan and building advanced conventional and nuclear weaponry to counter US.Â”<br><br>The superior strategy according to Suntze is to win without fighting; a strategy I imagine the CCP must be studiously applying. The CCP knows that economic growth comes before military strength and is unlikely to repeat the mistakes of the Soviets. If they are able to sustain economic growth, it is a matter of time before their economy will rival and perhaps surpass that of the US. Their military will also expand and will also be a formidable rival to the US in time to come. No doubt this eventuality is viewed in US and also in the region by many with concern and discomfort.<br><br>Â”If the current trend of Chinese and US economical development continues, US may find it beneficial in the long run to emphasize peaceful reunification and reduce the rhetoric of defending Taiwan militarily.Â”<br><br>In the long run, the security interest of the US and that of many countries around the region lies in nudging PRC towards more integration with the rest of the world and in strengthening its human rights and democratic reforms. The CCP probably shares some of these views with exception that power should remain in their hands. If stability is maintained in the region, the medium term should see the PRC moving in this direction. It is harder to predict what will happen in the longer term. It is possible that PRC may find it necessary and justifiable to move towards a multi-party political system, due firstly to internal pressures for greater democracy and secondly to make reunification with Taiwan more acceptable.<br><br>That admittedly, is some way off.<br></blockquote></div>

It was a slightly cooler stage than the red-hot phase the two countries had been in for more than a month. Yet to the dismay of China, the increasingly assertive Tokyo seems reluctant to move. Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi expressed Â“deep remorseÂ” for his countryÂ’s World War II aggression. But his apology came just hours after Japanese lawmakers visited the Yasukuni shrine. China and Japan has entered a new cycle of confrontation.<br><br>JapanÂ’s latest moves indicate that it intends to shift to the right. Once again, the whole affair has renewed an argument over the cliche of Â“A rearmed Japan-a myth or reality?Â” The latest development is reminiscent of JapanÂ’s 1999 confirmation of its flag and hymn. At that time, JapanÂ’s leftists saw the confirmation of the Â“HinomaruÂ” and Â“KimigayoÂ” as a step on the way toward militarization. Japanese officials are now contemplating the prospect of changing JapanÂ’s constitution to annul Article 9, in which Japan renounces the sovereign right to wage war. Former U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell told Japanese officials last August that <span style="color: red;">Tokyo would need to revise Article 9 if the country were to attain a permanent United Nations Security Council seat.</span><br><br>Japan had clung desperately to the Â“Yoshida doctrine,Â” a deal that relieves it from the responsibility and expense of rearming itself and let it focus on fostering its economy. Yet the disturbing state of affairs in and around Japan is compelling it to change the status quo. Currently, there are three factors in TokyoÂ’s decision to switch its course: ChinaÂ’s looming as the worldÂ’s next superpower, the Washington-Pyongyang nuclear standoff, as well as JapanÂ’s long-moribund economy. Specifically, JapanÂ’s sick economy is fanning the flames of chauvinism. The rise in jingoism bolstered JapanÂ’s long-dormant desire to become a Â‘normalÂ’ nation.<br><br>The most important element in JapanÂ’s shift in course is WashingtonÂ’s tacit approval of JapanÂ’s high-profile efforts to develop its own military capability. The Bush administration is making stepped-up efforts to address North KoreaÂ’s threats and ChinaÂ’s rise. Washington perceives its close ally South KoreaÂ’s intransigence. Thus Washington is playing the Japan card. Japan is emerging as the U.S.Â’s Â“deputy sheriff in the Pacific.Â”<br><br>Yet WashingtonÂ’s silent consent to JapanÂ’s military build-up could well boomerang against it. As Japan is preoccupied with developing its own independent military capabilities, it might pay less attention to its alliance with the United States. Within the depths of the Pentagon and the U.S. intelligence community, one hears an argument. It goes like this: There are two rising powers in Asia. The two rising powers are China and Japan. <span style="color: red;">In the long run, a strong Japan might slip out of Uncle SamÂ’s grasp. WashingtonÂ’s hopes for teaming up with Japan to contain the Middle Kingdom may then evaporate.</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><a href="http://www.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/geted.pl5?eo20050511a1.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/geted.pl5?eo20050511a1.htm</a><br><br>Irking Russia and China,<br>Japan's new foreign policy<br><br>By DAVID WALL<br>Special to The Japan Times<br><br>David Wall is an associate fellow at Chatham House.<br><br>The Japan Times: May 11, 2005<br>(C) All rights reserved<br><br>LONDON -- As Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi has traveled about and made his speeches in recent months, it is possible to trace his perception of a new foreign policy for Japan.<br>The new focus in Japan's foreign policy seems to have started last Sept. 2 when Koizumi took a boat ride around the Northern Territories, the four islands (also known as the southern Kurils) that the Russians occupied at the end of World War II. Disputing claims of sovereignty over them have prevented the two countries from signing a peace agreement 60 years after the end of the war.<br><br>When Koizumi went around the islands, he declared them to be Japanese territory. He held off from actually going ashore, but his declaration was sufficient to seriously damage Japan's relations with Russia.<br><br>Koizumi had thought that by offering billions of dollars of Japanese tax-payers' money to help Russia build pipelines to exploit its gas deposits in Siberia, he could ensure that those pipelines would bypass China and deliver the gas to ports north of Vladivostok, convenient for shipping to Japan.<br><br>Russia has now announced that it will probably build a pipeline into China first. This has produced some spluttering in Tokyo among politicians who thought that the pipeline was in the bag. They should reread the anti-Russia nationalist speech that Koizumi made as he traveled around the islands.<br><br>In December, Japan announced that its commitment to work with the United States on developing antimissile defense technology was aimed at the threat from China. Until then, public discussion had made North Korea the fantasy threat to justify joining America's Theater Missile Defense program -- not the real existence of hundreds of nuclear armed missiles in China capable of reaching all of Japan.<br><br>In February the Japanese government further upset the Chinese by agreeing with the U.S. that Taiwan was a "common security issue" in which the U.S.-Japan military alliance had an interest doing "whatever it takes" to defend Taiwan, as U.S. President George W. Bush put it. Although this was known to be the case for some time, it was the first time that the Japanese government had agreed to have it stated so publicly and so baldly.<br><br>In the last six months, Koizumi has had several other significant summit meetings. In November he met with President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo of the Philippines and promised her that Japan would press ahead with plans for a bilateral free-trade agreement.<br><br>Later that month he met Vietnamese Prime Minister Phai Van Thai in Hanoi and said that even though Japan was now in financial difficulties it would still increase aid to Vietnam and support its application to join the World Trade Organization.<br><br>In India, Koizumi followed in the footsteps of Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao, who had signed an agreement with India's Premier Manmohan Singh to establish "strategic partnership for peace and prosperity." Singh said to Wen as he left that "we have started to create new history together."<br><br>Koizumi and Singh signed an eight-point plan setting up a "strategic and cooperative partnership." India's media reaction was to describe Koizumi's visit as "Japan's PM in India to strengthen ties amid rift with China."<br><br>In Pakistan, where the Chinese and Pakistani premiers had strengthened their economic and military ties through an "all-weather partnership of friendship, cooperation and good neighborly relations" a few days earlier, Koizumi held discussions on a wide range of bilateral issues. He trumped the Chinese offers of friendship with a promise to restart the soft loan aid program that Japan stopped after Pakistan tested its nuclear weapons in 1998.<br><br>Upon hearing that, Pakistani President Shaukat Aziz said this meant that Japan would regain its "position as Pakistan's principal development partner."<br><br>With Taiwan, Vietnam, India and Pakistan, a pattern emerges. Having gotten up Russia's nose with his trip to the southern Kurils, Koizumi has moved on to the Chinese, who have been, as you might imagine, irritated by these "containment activities."<br><br>After Pakistan, Koizumi traveled to Europe and pressed the European Union to "proactively approach Japan and East Asia," as this "should lead to the world's stability and prosperity." He explained by telling the Europeans that Japan does not want the EU to end its embargo on arms sales to China.<br><br>He also made it clear that he expects EU support for Japan's bid for a permanent seat on the U.N. Security Council. This would be against the strongly expressed wish of China; China has a veto on such decisions in the U.N., as does Russia.<br><br>In Europe, Koizumi has pressed the EU to locate the new $10 billion nuclear fusion research station in Japan rather than in France. ITER is a massive new research project designed to generate electricity from the sort of nuclear fusion that powers the sun. The project will create about 10,000 jobs.<br><br>Japan is lobbying hard for ITER to be built in Japan. ITER is being financed by Japan, the U.S., South Korea, the EU, Russia and China. Russia and China have said they are against the project being located in Japan. I wonder why.</div>

'Taiwan independence' is a motive to separate Taiwan from the mainland," he said.<br><br>But Taiwanese people's sense of Taiwan identity has sometimes been "manipulated" by the pro-independence politicians for their own agenda, he added.<br><br>He stressed that "the sense of Taiwan identity" is not equal to "Taiwan independence."<br><br>But Soong also implicitly rejected Chinese threats to attack the island that Beijing claims as its territory. He said peace is the "common desire" of people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait.<br><br>"The PFP will form a strategic partnership with the Kuomintang (KMT), that is, we need to effectively handle together 'Taiwan independence' and anything else that might lead to war or disaster in Taiwan," Soong told students.<br><br>China and Taiwan have no official relations and high-level contacts are rare.<br><br>Despite a lack of official ties, trade and indirect travel across the Taiwan Strait is booming. Taiwanese companies have invested more than US$100 billion (euro70 billion) in the mainland.<br><br>He said the mainland could learn from Taiwan's economic development, which has maintained annual incomes between US$12,000 and US$14,000 (euro9,300-euro11,000) per person.<br><br>By contrast, annual incomes in China's booming cities average about US$1,000 (euro700) per person, according to the government.<br><br>"We should make China the manufacturing center for the world and also the most prosperous market in the whole world -- not a battlefield," Soong said in comments that were punctuated by frequent applause.<br><br>Citing a special report in the Newsweek of the United States, Soong said, "This is the Chinese century...The whole world is now waiting for the huge dragon, China, to take off. ... Are we Chinese people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait ready?"<br><br>Soong arrived in Beijing Tuesday saying he was "filled with hopes for peace" and warning war should not be contemplated.<br><br>"Several days ago when I was in Nanjing, an old man came up to me ... and said 'Mr. Soong we don't want war' -- this shows that people across the (Taiwan) Straits have the common wish for peace," he said in his speech.<br><br>Soong is scheduled to meet President Hu Jintao today for the culmination of what he has termed a nine-day "bridge building" trip.<br><br>Tsinghua University is the alma mater of Chinese President Hu and several other leaders. Taiwan has a prestigious university bearing the identical name in Hsinchu.<br><br>Soong's comments at the university in Beijing drew a backlash from the Presidential Office and the Cabinet, which clarified that his denouncement of Taiwan independence represented only his personal stance.<br><br>President Chen Shui-bian already lashed out at Soong earlier this week for vowing to oppose independence from the mainland.<br><br>Claiming that every Taiwan citizen enjoys freedom of speech, a spokesman for the Presidential Office pointed to a 10-point consensus reached between Soong and Chen in late February to buttress its disapproval of Soong's comments at Tsinghua when he said Taiwan independence is a "dead alley" that is not workable for the country's future.<br><br>The spokesman stressed that Soong was stating only his personal position, because the sixth point contained in the Chen-Soong consensus issued Feb. 24 states clearly that any change to the status quo between Taiwan and China must be approved by the 23 million people of Taiwan and that no option for future Taiwan-China ties will be ruled out.<br><br>Speaking after a weekly Cabinet meeting, Executive Yuan spokesman Cho Jung-tai argued that Soong should not impose his party's political stance on the rest of the Taiwan people, referring to Soong's remarks that the sense of Taiwan identity is not tantamount to Taiwan independence.<br><br>Cho said that the government welcomes efforts by Taiwan's political figures to disseminate Taiwan's democratic and pluralistic values and new thinking to the Chinese people, but added that Taiwan's "equal distribution of wealth" notion is a far cry from the "owned by all" concept promoted by the Chinese communists.<br><br>Leaders of Chen's Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and political ally Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) also criticized Soong's remarks.<br><br>DPP Chairman Su Tseng-chang said Soong can oppose Taiwan independence but should not exclude it from Taiwan people's choices.<br><br>TSU Legislator Liao Ben-yen criticized Soong for kowtowing to Beijing and twisting the "Taiwan consciousness."<br><br>However, leaders of the opposition "pan-blue" alliance praised Soong's remarks, which resembled the statements made by KMT Chairman Lien in a separate speech at the Peking University.<br><br>The successive trips by Lien and Soong to the mainland appear to have worked in their favor, with a poll in a major Taiwan newspaper showing the popularity rating of Chen falling to 39 percent from 44 percent in February.<br><br>In contrast, the popularity of Lien surged to 47 percent from 31 percent, according to the China Times survey of 1,002 people on May 9-10.<br><br>Lien last month became the first KMT leader to set foot on the mainland since the end of the civil war in 1949.<br><br>During his visit, Lien met Hu and jointly pledged to oppose independence for Taiwan and push for greater cross-strait economic and civil cooperation.<br><br>The poll showed Soong's approval rating rose to 35 percent from 29 percent.<br><br>Beijing leaders are extremely distrustful of Chen, who won elections in 2000 and 2004 on a platform stressing Taiwan's independent identity and denouncing China's missile build-up targeting the island.<br></div>

He said he hoped the US government would adhere to the one-China policy, abide by the three Sino-US joint communiques and support the dialogues and exchanges across the Taiwan Straits.<br><br>Cao said the China-US relations are of great importance. He said the two governments have had effective negotiations and cooperation on fighting terrorism as well as on trade and regionalsecurity, which have "further cemented the foundation of the bilateral relations and also contributed to the world peace and stability."<br><br>Kissinger suggested that the US and China "build a new framework of cooperation" and make joint efforts to further the bilateral ties.<br><br>Kissinger, an 82-year-old foreign policy expert, arrived here on a goodwill visit to China at the invitation of China Institute for International Strategic Studies.

He added that "with efforts on both sides," there may be a decision on lifting the ban "in these six weeks or out of these six weeks."<br><br>The proposed new treaty that EU and Chinese officials announced Wednesday would replace the current treaty between the EU and China, which was signed in 1985 and "simply doesn't reflect any more the whole breadth or scope of this partnership," said Benita Ferrero-Waldner, the European commissioner for external relations.<br><br>The agreement will replace the current treaty between the EU and China, which was signed in 1985 and "simply doesn't reflect anymore the whole breadth or scope of this partnership," Ferrero-Waldner said.<br><br>New ties will grow from trade and economics into such areas as technological research, environmental questions and overall political and diplomatic considerations.<br><br>The China-EU agreement will be a measure of the two sides' growing international weight, Ferrero-Waldner said.<br><br>"We are both emerging global players," she told a press briefing in Beijing, "and therefore our relationship is not only bilateral, but also international, about a relationship that is a global one. We are deeply committed to going on and strengthening and deepening this partnership, which we see as a formidable opportunity."<br><br>The announcement of new treaty negotiations comes at a difficult time in European-Chinese relations over the arms embargo.<br><br>Relations also have been riled by the EU's decision to begin an investigation that may choke off China's growing exports of garments to Europe.<br><br>But the EU's "troika" of foreign policy leaders said they hoped their two-day visit to Beijing to mark the 30th anniversary of China-EU diplomatic relations would help defuse these disputes and advance the two sides' "strategic partnership."<br><br>The three EU leaders are Ferrero-Waldner, who coordinates EU foreign policy, Asselborn; and Christopher Hum, ambassador to China from Britain, which holds the next presidency.<br><br>Ferrero-Waldner said the EU was committed to solving these disputes through dialogue with China.<br><br>S said they would not derail growing ties between China and Europe. "Our objective is to find a solution without recourse to safeguard measures," she said of the looming garment dispute.<br><br>She was referring to special World Trade Organization rules that can be used to choke off the flow of exports in extraordinary circumstances.<br><br>In Brussels, however, several EU member countries called on the organization to speed up and expand the investigation into Chinese garment exports. France, Spain, Italy, Belgium, Greece and Portugal supported the request, Agence France-Presse reported.<br><br>The EU trade commissioner, Peter Mandelson, in April opened an inquiry to examine whether China's surging garment exports were threatening European manufacturers to the point that export restrictions are justified.<br><br>China's garment exports to Europe of some types of clothing grew by over 500 percent in the first months of this year compared to the same time last year.<br><br>While welcoming the EU delegation, Chinese diplomats said they were unhappy with the EU's postponement of lifting the arms ban and rejected linking of a decision on that issue to improvements in China's human rights, and also objected to any caps on exports.<br><br>"Linking the lifting of the arms embargo to human rights is unreasonable and unhelpful," said China's foreign minister, Li Zhaoxing, at a joint press briefing with the EU officials. He said that by "imposing" its human rights standards on other countries, the EU was "itself flouting human rights."<br><br>"We oppose linking the question of lifting the ban to human rights," said Liu Jianchao, a Chinese foreign spokesman, at a press briefing on Tuesday. "China will continue to improve its human rights, but that should by no means be relevant to the lifting of the arms of the arms embargo."<br><br>Ferrero-Waldner also denied that the EU had made any explicit demands for human rights improvements in China before the ban was lifted. But she said China would "help" its case by demonstrating better treatment of its citizens, especially by ratifying the UN Covenant on Civic and Political Rights.<br><br>China signed that covenant in 1998 but has so far failed to ratify it, which would oblige China to bring many of its laws into line with the covenant.<br><br>"We need to have to persuade our public opinion, for instance also our European Parliament, that China is making concrete steps to improve human rights," she said. "China also needs to help us to turn the page."<br><br>Another member of the EU delegation said it would also seek the release of political prisoners jailed during China's 1989 crackdown, loosening of restrictions on China's press, and also an undertaking from China to overhaul its "labor-re-education camps" that allow for imprisonment without trial.<br><br>China has also said it will "resolutely oppose" any caps the EU or United States places on China's garment exports. China's garment exports to Europe would be allowed to grow "at a normal speed," said Ferrero-Waldner.<br><br>But the EU would also act to stop what she called "serious market disruption."<br><br>But EU officials sought to reach beyond these disputes and show that China and the EU were now important partners on the international stage.<br><br>"We should not let the arms embargo overshadow our relationship," said Ferrero-Waldner.</div>

Yet the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) leadership under President Hu Jintao needs to offer Taiwan's people a lot more than pandas to persuade them that the recent "smile offensive" is little more than old-style united front tactics. And while Taiwan President Chen Shui-bian seems to be on the defensive, the wily pro-separatist politician still has cards left to battle the apparent united front put up by the CCP and the Kuomintang (KMT or Nationalist Party).<br><br>It is without doubt that the historic handshake between CCP General Secretary Hu and KMT Chairman Lien Chan late last month has at least temporarily swept aside some negative repercussions of the Anti-Secession Law (ASL) that was hastily passed by the National People's Congress last March. The ASL, which authorizes the People's Liberation Army (PLA) to use force against Taiwan in case of the latter's formal secession from the mainland, has alienated even members of the KMT and the other major opposition party, the People's First Party (PFP). The statute is also a main reason why the European Union has held up the lifting of the 16-year-old embargo on the sales of arms to China.<br><br>The Lien tour Â– plus PFP Chairman James Soong's forthcoming visit to Beijing Â– has provided the Hu leadership with a golden opportunity to focus on the more benign aspects of Beijing's reunification game plan. Even as Hu, also Chairman of the policy-setting Central Military Commission, has significantly boosted the PLA budget, the new supremo has repeated previous leaders' pledges that Beijing "pins its hope of reunification on all sectors of the Taiwan people." At a closed-door meeting on Taiwan issues last autumn, Hu also noted that "we must show Taiwan's people the concrete benefits they can get through reunification." Apart from the pandas, Hu has offered Lien, the KMT, and especially Taiwan commercial interests goodies galore. They include reduction of tariffs for the produce of Taiwan's farmers, permission for more mainlanders to go to Taiwan as tourists, and the possible conclusion of some form of a Closer Economic Partnership Agreement that had been established between the mainland and Hong Kong.<br><br>And it is likely that Beijing will give away more dispensations, particularly business benefits, during the visit of Soong, who used to be a stalwart KMT politician until he broke away to form his own party in 2000. After all, an estimated 1 million Taiwan bosses and technicians live and work on the mainland. And Taiwan's corporate community has put tremendous pressure on President Chen to sue for peace with Beijing Â– or at least to refrain from provocative gestures such as threatening to revise the Taiwan Constitution to reflect the island's "statehood status." Earlier this year, Chen was shocked when Hsu Wen-long, the head of the massive Chi-Mei conglomerate Â– and a keen supporter of the DPP Â– suddenly shifted gears by declaring his support for the one-China policy.<br><br>So far, Beijing's time-tested united front tactics seem to have scored initial success. Most opinion polls in Taiwan show that about 55 percent of the population thought Lien had done well on the mainland and that his trip had resulted in the reduction of cross-Strait tension. However, it is important to note that Taiwan is not Hong Kong, whose business community is also extra eager to seek the blessings of CCP authorities. So far, the Hu leadership has yet to demonstrate to Taiwan's people that Beijing is not merely going after PR effects.<br><br>Take for example, the crucial issue of the conclusion of a short- to medium-term peace treaty between the mainland and Taiwan. The joint statement issued by Hu and Chan noted that both sides would study the possibility of such a non-belligerence accord. It is obvious, however, that Beijing has been but play-acting on this issue. A peace pact would violate the CCP leadership's long-standing stance that it will never forego the right to use force against Taiwan. Moreover, any such agreement would go against the spirit of the just-enacted ASL. And in a press conference after Lien's visit, Vice-Chief of Beijing's Taiwan Affairs Office, Wang Zaixi noted that "under the one-China principle, anything can be discussed, including the issue of missiles." Wang was apparently referring to earlier speculation that Beijing might agree to move away some of the approximately 600 missiles in Fujian and Jiangxi Provinces that are targeting Taiwan. It is common military knowledge, however, that the PLA's missiles are highly mobile; and that there are missiles aplenty in other provinces capable of hitting the "renegade province."<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"><br>CONTINUED IN NEXT POST</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It is true, of course, that Beijing's high-decibel united front and propaganda offensive has had some effect in marginalizing Chen, whose popularity rating recently slipped to 34 percent according to the United Daily News, a Taiwan paper. However, the peculiar circumstances under which the historic Hu-Lien tete-a-tete took place have left Chen with ample ammunition to fire back at both the CCP and the KMT. The official Chinese media has made much of the fact that the CCP and KMT are about to embark on their third round of cooperation (the first two being short-lived and acrimonious alliances mainly to fight the invading Japanese Imperial Army). It is assumed then, that the target of the third CCP-KMT alliance is the DPP, and there are unconfirmed rumors that the Hu leadership has vowed to help the successor of 68-year-old Lien Â– who is due to step down soon Â– recapture the Presidential Palace in the 2008 polls. Pundits in Taipei said it would be a no-brainer for Chen to zero in on the fact that Lien Â– who had lost twice in presidential elections Â– was but "selling out Taiwan" for the partisan interests of the KMT.<br><br>It is noteworthy that in the joint Hu-Lien statement, both sides vowed to carry on the tradition of "party-to-party talks" to solve cross-Strait problems. Perhaps overexcited by the VIP treatment he had received in Beijing, Lien did not mention the fact that the fate of Taiwan must be decided by all of its 23 million residents. And it would be difficult for Lien Â– or his successors Â– to argue that Taiwan's opposition party is a competent authority to discuss the island's fate with the CCP.<br><br>While the visits of Lien and Soong have contributed to the relaxation of cross-Straits tension at least in the short run, the long-term development of mainland-Taiwan ties hinges on interaction among the three major parties: the CCP, the DPP's Chen and the United States. President Hu has a vested interest in maintaining a relatively cordial cross-Straits atmosphere at least until 2008, when presidential elections are due in Taiwan and Beijing will be holding the Summer Olympics. The CCP stands to garner a bonanza of good will across all of Taiwan's sectors if it were willing to lower the threshold regarding requirements for DPP cadres visiting the mainland. The TAO reiterated last week that DPP members were welcome on the mainland provided that they would recognize the "1992 consensus" (usually explained as "one China, howsoever interpreted") and give up the pro-independence clause in the DPP's charter.<br><br>However, much as Chen might want formal dialogue with Beijing Â– a China trip would substantially lift his political standing in Taiwan Â– it might be politically suicidal for him to accede to the CCP's preconditions. The DPP leader has never accepted the "one China principle." And he has already been subjected to intense fire from more doctrinaire pro-independence elements on the island for allegedly "caving in" to the mainland's united front tactics by, for example, giving his blessings to Lien's China tour. Chen, however, is anxiously grooming a successor for the 2008 polls. And to win that crucial election, the DPP has to reposition itself closer to the mainstream of Taiwan public opinion, which wants peace Â– and more communication with Beijing authorities.<br><br>Given Washington's immense clout in the region, the George W. Bush administration may have what it takes to inject the kind of momentum that could make a Hu-Chen tete-a-tete possible. After the Hu-Lien meeting, the State Department called upon Beijing to consider talking to Taiwan's ruling party also. And Washington had reportedly urged Chen not to lay obstacles in the way of the China visits of Lien and Soong. While it would be against U.S. interests for Chinese reunification to take place too soon Â– particularly one that is attained at the expense of the wishes and autonomy of Taiwan's people Â– it is to Washington's advantage that peace be maintained in the Strait. And direct communication between Hu and Chen Â– and their successors Â– would at least ensure a state of non-belligerence throughout "reunification talks" that are expected to last a decade or so.<br><br>However, the big challenge is that neither Beijing nor Taipei trusts Washington enough for it to play the role of honest broker. Consumed with the obsession that Bush is waging an anti-China containment policy, the Hu leadership is extra wary of Taiwan-related suggestions coming from the U.S. And Chen is paranoid about the possibility Â– remote as it seems Â– of Washington selling out Taiwan because of the "pro-China" inclinations of the growing American corporate community that is doing business with the PRC.<br><br>Willy Wo-Lap Lam is a Senior Fellow at The Jamestown Foundation as well as a Hong Kong-based journalist and analyst.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>boy in blue, thks for these informative post; I find the article on Kissinger's visit particularly interesting.<br><br>There is underlying optimism in KissingerÂ’s statement about the US government welcoming dialogue between CCP and TaiwanÂ’s opposition parties. It firstly highlights the fact that dialogue is a positive move towards reducing cross-strait tensions and secondly underlines the preference of the US (provided his views reflect that of the administration) for a peaceful resolution.<br><br>So far, Hu-Wen have made their moves in a rational and strategic manner, more so than their immediate predecessors.  TheyÂ’re probably busy implementing a strategy of winning without fighting. The latest move is the invitation of the KMT and the PFP thereby cutting the ground from under the DPP.<br><br>They're probably experts at Go!!<br><br></div>
