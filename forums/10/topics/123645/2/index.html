Aren't there plenty of e.g. of countries fighting tooth and nail when useful resources are found in dubious territories?<br><br>7) some Chinese have said to me that Taiwan and China both are Chinese countries, Chinese should unite. But does uniting means all becoming one nation? EU is not just one nation, it is a nation of nations.

It is well known that Chinese Govt. make things difficult for Taiwan firms doing businss in China if they support President Chen or Taiwan independence and China still advocates that politics and economics be separated. Back when Lee Teng Hui was president, he was the only one who dared to shout back and take tough stances against China and US or anyone else.

When the situation turned tense, the US lobbied for Chen to tone down. For all the sabre rattling, I see China working towards halting seperatism than working on reunification at the present.<br><br>What is the Chinese feeling you are talking about?

Singapore was part of the Malaysian Federation and was ejected out. Its founding as an independent country is recognised by the Malaysian government. </blockquote></div></blockquote>The point I was trying to make was not the events before and leading to the separation.<br><br>The point I am trying to make is that ever since Singapore left the Federation, and succeeded rather than failed, there are elements in Malaysia and Johor who felt cheated - who felt that Singapore belonged to Malaysia simply based on the historical links with the former Johor Sultanate.<br><br>If these sentiments gain prominence again one day, do you think that it is fair to expect Singaporeans to be absorbed into Malaysia based on the fact that we were once a part of Johor? Would you think that Singaporeans can accept the loss of their rights simply because many many more people in Malaysia wants us to join them (if)?<br><br><strong></strong><blockquote><strong></strong><div class="quote_from"><strong>Do you believe the Americans would choose course of actions that will not benefit them? Even treaty like the Kyoto Protocol has no US participation because they believe it does not benefit them. You are entitled to your belief.<br><br>The American threatened but never fire one single shot to stop the communists from crossing over to Taiwan. Communists were land fighter and even today they are no good at naval or amphibious warfare. Americans were never in, so there is no pulling out. War will only break out if Taiwan declares independence, not when "If America was to pull out completely now".</strong></div></blockquote>Americans are being driven by their interests - that's the same for every other country. They are neither the first, the last, or the only country that pursues their interests - while talking big from moral high ground.<br><br>To be fair to the American's, the KMT under Chiang was a spectacular failure. If not for the repeated support of the Americans, the KMT might have folded long ago. What did the American's owe Chiang - whose corruption and ineptitude was legendary?

The Malayan Communists had no change to do much damage. But we need to change with times, China is hardly the communist country with the original ideology. Is the stand-off at the Taiwan Straits a check on Communist advancement??? Hardly.</blockquote></div>I am sure there are many in Malaysia who would challenge the above. Neverthelessly, the MCP was significant because it was near. The impact could be felt, all the way to the infiltration of communist elements into Singapore, and the resulting riots and disruptions that were caused.<br><br><strong>[quote]Taiwanese ruling parties and the media in Taiwan have made a mockery of democracy. Many Taiwanese are thus migrating to US, Australia, Singapore and now China. Do we know what the common Taiwanese feel?   You can't question if children should be united with their parents based on the benefits they were likely to gain.   </strong>In what way did the ruling party and the Taiwanese media make a mockery of democracy? Please elaborate.<br><br>Many Singaporeans emigrate too. And Americans too. So how did you reach the conclusion that a large portion of the Taiwanese emigration was a result of the political system in Taiwan being dysfunctional ?<br><br>How did you reach the conclusion that the common Taiwanese look upon China as their parent country? How did you get the sense that the common Taiwanese support unification, if half of them votes for separatist Ah Bian?<br></div>

Pan-Green lost the Parliamentary polls to Pan-Blue, indicating to them that the people do not want them to do things 100% their way, that a stronger opposition is desired to check and balance the Govt. and that the Govt. should be consultative and inclusive. Ah Bian took that implication, that is why he backed down. I believe any other politicians will have to hear the people's call. That is also why he started extending olive branches to China. I cited Lee as example to contrast how different is Taiwan's Govt. adopts a softer image now because I feel that a softer image for the Taiwan Govt. will not work well when it comes to dealing with China. And even with U.S, I think now there is a tendency in the Taiwan Govt. to consult or 'report' to U.S too much.

Is it any fault that Taiwan Govt. and Taiwanese wanting their future to be decided by themselves? Taiwan plays both sides because they have to. With the world nowadays, every nation involved in global affairs will have to play multi-sides, China does that too, warming up ties with U.S yet maintaining and even improving friendship with Russia and North Korea, U.S maintaining relations with India yet selling missiles to Pakistan. Singapore, above table maintain very warm relations with China but underneath, the economical and other relations with Taiwan are all still there. My point is, nations play it this way out of necessity and interest.</strong></div>

The communists Chinese never invaded Taiwan for two reasons, firstly they were tied down in their support for the north Korea in the Korean war, secondly, they were good only fighting on land, they did not have any strategies or means to launch an amphibious assault. Of course, presence of the Americans 7th fleet was a contributing factor but not the only factor "sufficient that they did leave Formosa alone".<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from"></div><div class="quote_body">I am sure there are many in Malaysia who would challenge the above. Neverthelessly, the MCP was significant because it was near. The impact could be felt, all the way to the infiltration of communist elements into Singapore, and the resulting riots and disruptions that were caused.<br><br></div></blockquote>War with the MCP was closer to the Malaysian and rightly they should feel greater impact. But in terms of bloodshed and destruction, are we not seeing more of that in the Korean war and Vietnam war?  does it means the millions who died in these two wars became insignificant just because it is not near to us? I wonder how many in Malaysia would challenge that.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from"></div><div class="quote_body">In what way did the ruling party and the Taiwanese media make a mockery of democracy? Please elaborate.<br><br>Many Singaporeans emigrate too. And Americans too. So how did you reach the conclusion that a large portion of the Taiwanese emigration was a result of the political system in Taiwan being dysfunctional ?<br><br>How did you reach the conclusion that the common Taiwanese look upon China as their parent country? How did you get the sense that the common Taiwanese support unification, if half of them votes for separatist Ah Bian?<br><br></div></blockquote>Read the Taiwanese new papers, watch the Taiwanese TV programs, past and present, if you conclude that this is democracy at its best and it is something we can emulate, it is up to you.<br><br>Why do Singaporean emigrate? because pressure too great, children can't catch up with chinese lesson...... why do americans emigrate? I don't know, i have not met any americans who emigrate. Why do Taiwanese emigrate? before ah bian, they emigrate to get better education but mostly to USA and Canada. Now they emigrate because they fear that with the way ah bian is governing taiwan, there will soon be war, so they emigrate even to singapore!!<br><br>do you have any taiwanese friends, are they ben shen or wai shen? do you watch any taiwanese programs? mix with the taiwanese and you will know better. No even the Taiwanese believe that ah bian has the majority support!!!<br></div>

Taiwanese, or citizens of ROC are friends of all free Chinese all over the world. You have support of Chinese all over the world until Taiwan is split into green and blue, north and south, wai sheng and ben sheng. Taiwan became prosperous and is where it is today because of the wai sheng ren and the system handed down by Jiang Jing Guo. The situation today does not speak well of the Taiwanese government in the way they treat the wai sheng ren and overseas Chinese understands very well !!<br><br>Today , China and Taiwan are very inter dependent economically, culturally and even in entertainment. Standard of livings between the two are closer now if not the same. Other than politics, it is not difficult to merge Taiwan with mainland China.  And looking at it, Chinese Communists is not what it was in Mao era and is continuing to change. Given time and will, I am sure Taiwan and China can be united amicably. Just make sure that the outsiders like USA and Japan do not hun shui mo yu, make a mess of the situation for their own benefits.</div>

Does these people not have a right to reject reunification with China?<br><br>I think that reunification cannot happen before the Taiwanese have strong, clear reasons to rejoin China. This is because this joining, if and when it happens, is likely to be permanent. Once in, Taiwan most probably cannot leave without another war.<br><br>Like I mentioned earlier, no sane man would give up something he have for nothing. In the same line, while the Taiwanese might like closer links with China, with less restrictions / regulations - would they be willing to give up their political rights in exchange?<br><br>As for the US, I think that part of their Taiwanese strategy, is to use this issue as leverage over China. At the same time, sale of arms are lucrative deals that stimulate the American arms industry. All in all, the American involvement in the Taiwanese Straits is largely beneficial - so long as the equation does not escalate into chaos and war. With American economic interests in China growing, and the US attention tied up with Iraqi and the unstable North Korea, the last thing they need is a war with China at this moment.<br><br>Hence I believe that the US supports the status quo, rather than Taiwanese independence.<br><br>Taiwan democracy... what is democracy? While there are many definitions, to me the bottom line is the <strong>choice of the people</strong>. Choice of different parties with different political paths, choice of media that offers different views. And let the people be make the decision of what they want, support and believe.<br><br>What do we have in Singapore? One party view? One party controlled press?

            <div class='col-md body'>I think in that respect, the taiwanese kid is referring to his nationality.  I think you might have confused the difference between ethnicity and nationality.  Like I can be a chinese yet be not from china.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by bumbleb:</div><div class="quote_body"></div></blockquote>No disagreement with your view on the US position. It is clear that US interest iis purely based on their own interests. If it is a matter of ideology or freedom, they would not have recognised PRC and kicked out ROC in the 70s.<br><br>The issue here is whether Taiwan should be independent ? It should be clear that rejecting reunification does not equal to declaring independence! It can also mean status quo. Since mainland China is not pressing for an immediate reunification, there is no question about "rejecting reunification".<br><br>It is clear, if less than half of the 23 millions want independence, then constitutionally, democratically, they cannot declare independence!!  That is the reason why ah bian is trying all tricks to get the majority to agree on a referendum to change constitution.<br><br>Ideally, everybody should be free to do whatever he wants but in a group, you submit to the majority, that is civilisation. It is a historical fact that Taiwan is part of China so the minority in Taiwan will have to submit to the majority in Taiwan, and the majority in China as well!! And China is saying that taiwan is part of the 1.3 billion chinese, so 23 millions chinese in Taiwan also cannot decide to let Taiwan become independence. In the same way, 80 millions chinese in Guangdong cannot declare Guangdong independent!! It sounds harsh but isn't that the reality?<br><br>We know that declaration of Taiwan equals war with China so we should not encourage the minority Taiwanese to work towards independence. Besides, most Taiwanese know that when war breaks out, those who felt strongly about independence, Lee Teng Hui, Jin Mei Ling,....would be ready to flee to Japan and US.<br><br>Singapore is by no means an example of a democratic country but is the Taiwanese democracy a model we should follow? do you think Chiam See Tong can declare Potong Pasir independence so that his people can have greater freedom?<br></div>
