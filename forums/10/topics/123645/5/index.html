KMT and CCP meeting is nothing new.  Just that Lien as Chairman is going over to Meet Hu. When the Leaders of the Two Ruling Parties on either sides of the Straits meet, that will be Historic.<br><br>The "Red Carpet" is just games played by the PRC. The CCP used to hate the KMT and the KMT used to hate the CCP equally before the Year 2000. Now they got a common adversary. The KMT after having lost twice had no place to turn.You did not see them making such "wonderful" gestures when they were in power for 50+ years. They were staunch Anti PRC and staunch Anti Communist.<br><br>The PRC on the other hand is having fun trying to reduce Chen's influence by inviting the Opposition Leadership into the PRC and giving them First Class treatment that they dont get at home.<br><br>This has got nothing to do with the US.The Taiwanese people will not unify under the CCP by accepting  the One China Policy.<br><br>Everyone calls for the return to the 1992 consensus, yet everyone only follows the Interpretation of the OCP as stated by the PRC, No one follows the Intepretation of the OCP as stated by the ROC. You first have to accept both Intpretations openly eofore you can move forward ,That will be difficult as the two interpretations are as different as the two sides of a coin.<br><br>"The "1992 Consensus" refers to an agreement reached by the two sides in 1992 in Hong Kong, in which each side agreed to its own interpretation of the one-China principle.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Blueray:</div><div class="quote_body">I have been living in China for 3 years. For those of you who question China's communism, it is of a progressive kind. Their system very cleverly combines the merits of both capitalism and communism. China is a one party nation while Taiwan is a democracy but yet there are lots of Taiwanese who have decided that China is a better place to live and are emigrating to the mainland in large numbers. In fact China is already the 4th hottest destination for emigrating Taiwanese. Here are the related articles:<br>http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A14284-2001Apr27?language=printer<br>http://english.people.com.cn/200207/07/eng20020707_99237.shtml<br><br>Back in 1992, China and Taiwan have already reached a consensus that they will both accept the one-china policy (which is the mainland and Taiwan are part of one China.) But Lee Teng Hui and pro independence Taiwanese politicians went back on their words later and of course Beijing is angry with Taiwan.<br>Taiwanese constitution states very clearly that both the mainland and Taiwan are part of one China and it is illegal to carry out seperatist activities... what Chen shui bian is doing now is actually violating taiwan's constitution.<br>China is now the largest importer of Taiwanese goods and Taiwan has a very huge trade surplus with China. if Taiwan insists on independence, their economy will suffer terribly.<br></div></blockquote>Here is something you must have read in the news papers last year:Sept 2004.<br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>C P C vows to uphold Marxism as guiding ideology </strong></span>.<br>http://www.beijingportal.com.cn/7838/2004/09/27/207@2297535.htm<br><br>How many of the Taiwanese "immigrants" Have sold out their Holdings here and moved to the PRC with their families and given up their Passports?? They are not moving there because they hate Taiwan or Love the PRC,It's just business.  People are only moving part of their business.Most of them still have the Head Offices here in Taiwan and the RnD Depts are also here.<br><br>Japanese,Koreans ,Singaporeans have also done the same in droves . Not blaming Ah Bian for that too  are you??<br><br>Taiwan's trade surplus if not really accurate.Taiwan ships out raw material and components to the PRC. <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Taiwan is not shipping finished goods for the PRC market. </strong></span>It is assembled there and shipped out of the PRC to a third country WITHOUT it coming back here for reshipment therefore showing a surplus. <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>The difference is shown elsewhere in the PRC books as an export figure for the PRC</strong></span>. Taiwanese factories employ more than 12 million Mainlanders.<br><br>I mentioned the consensus in another post.<br><br>The ROC constitution is outdated , created by the KMT , that reallly has to be changed in order to reflect the current situation. Read the 1991 ammendment to the Constitution: Everyone conveniently seems to forget to read that when talking about the ROC constitution.<br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>"In the 1991 constitutional amendment, Article 10 of the Additional Articles (now Article 11) limits the area covered by the Constitution to that of the Taiwan area, and recognizes the legitimacy of the rule of the People's Republic of China on the Chinese mainland."</strong></span><br><br>The ROC is not guilty of trying to Separate!!! <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>The PRC separated from the ROC  in 1949 when the changed the name of the terrority they held from the R O C to the P R C</strong></span>.  After all the R O C Govt was still a functioning Govt  all the way up to 1972 when people switched recognition from ROC to the Separatist State known as the PRC. Is that not correct????</div>

They told me that nowadays it is difficult to find work in Taiwan that they have to look elsewhere for work. Most of them told me that unless things change in Taiwan they plan to stay in the mainland for good.  In fact there is a sharp increase in the number of Taiwanese buying houses in the mainland. Under Ah Bian's rule, Taiwanese unemployment rate, crime rate have indeed soared rapidly. Read this:<br><br>http://www.taiwanheadlines.gov.tw/20010510/20010510o1.html<br><br>More and more Taiwanese are losing confidence in the current administration and are migrating elsewhere. Here's the related article:<br><br>http://atimes.com/atimes/China/FF30Ad04.html<br><br>Money will always be a key driving factor of migration but there are many people who have migrated to China simply bcos they like the country.
