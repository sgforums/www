Then all the info listed below was nonsense?<br><br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_status_of_Taiwan<br><br>Political status of Taiwan<br>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.<br><br>Taiwan Strait Area<br><br>The de jure political status of Taiwan is controversial due to questions about whether Taiwan should remain the Republic of China, become part of the People's Republic of China, or become an independent Republic of Taiwan. Currently, it is a de facto independent state with a government based on representative democracy. The official name of the state is the Republic of China. Different groups have different concepts of what the current formal political situation is. See also Taiwan independence and Chinese reunification.<br><br>In addition, it can be confusing because of the different parties and the effort by many groups to deal with the controversy through a policy of deliberate ambiguity. The political solution that is acceptable to most of the current groups is the status quo: that is, to leave Taiwan's status the way that it is as a de facto independent state without making a formal declaration of independence. This is acceptable in large part because it does not define the legal status or future status of Taiwan, leaving each group to interpret the situation in a way that is politically acceptable to its members.<br><br>Position of other countries and international organizations<br><br>The United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and Japan recognize that there is one China and that the People's Republic of China is the sole legitimate government of China. However, the US and Japan acknowledge rather than recognize the PRC position that Taiwan is part of China. In the case of Canada and the UK, the bilateral written agreement stated that the two respective parties take note of Beijing's position, but the word support was never used. Although the Chinese media claims that the United States opposes Taiwanese independence, the United States currently does not support (contrast that to the word oppose) either reunification or independence. The US does support both sides of the Taiwan Strait to resolve their differences peacefully. All this ambiguity has resulted in the United States constantly walking on a diplomatic tightrope with regards to the China/Taiwan issue.<br><br>Most major countries have policies toward this issue that use very careful language which is deliberately ambiguous. Under strong pressure from PRC, international organizations also have different policies toward this issue. In some cases (such as the UN and the World Health Organization) the ROC has been completely shut out while in others, such as the World Trade Organization (WTO) and International Olympic Committee (IOC) the government on Taiwan has a special name--"Chinese Taipei" in the case of APEC and the IOC, and the "Separate customs territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kimmen, and Matsu" in the case of WTO. The ISO 3166 directory of names of countries and territories registers Taiwan (TW) separately from China (CN), but lists Taiwan as a "province of China".<br><br>IS THERE A QUESTION OF TAIWAN IN INTERNATIONAL LAW?<br><br>BY LEOPOLDO LOVELACE, JR<br><br>Leopoldo Lovelace, Jr. is a research scholar at the Mershon Center for International Security &amp; Public Policy Studies and a Lecturing Professor of International Studies at the Ohio State University. You can reach him via lovelace.12@osu.edu.<br><br>Summary: Professor Lovelace examines the competing claims of sovereignty over Taiwan between the PeopleÂ’s Republic of China and the Republic of China on the basis of international law. While he argues that international law itself does not unequivocally support the claim of either party, it does provide a strong basis against an armed conflict to resolve the issue.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I am Singaporean and the interests of Singapore comes above those of China or Taiwan. I agree with George Yeo that regional security is most important for us and that will be threatened by any move towards Taiwanese independence. I do not support Taiwan independence and hope the Chinese government will not listen to some members of her trigger-happy population.<br><br>I do suspect that US and Japan have ulterior motives with their subtle support for Taiwanese independence. The united economic powess of technologically advanced Taiwan and the cheap labour market of China will threaten them. They don't want a strong China and certainly not a reunited China.<br><br>I think instead of supporting Taiwan or China, we should focus on nations like USA who are adding oil to the fire. Stop the US support for Taiwanese nationalists. As for China, they will get Taiwan back in time. There is absolutely no need to resort to military violence. As China becomes stronger economically and militarily, Taiwan will re-consider its position. And why not? China is already opening up very quickly...in time China will become closer to a socialist state rather than a communist regime (which it is not in all but name). Authoritarian yes, communist? Don't make me laugh....<br><br>And so there is no need to rush missiles to Taiwan. Just concentrate on becoming a world superpower. China can afford to wait. Taiwan is not going anywhere...<br><br></div>

Glad you are aware that Lian Zhan is meeting Hu Jintao which is a very positive move for reconciliation between the two, and Taiwan Solidarity Union, founded by Lee Teng Hui, a strong advocate of Taiwan independence, is "ren zei zuo fu" in paying respect at the war shrine. It is this brand of Taiwan independence that we are against.<br><br>Why ROC  "has to ask nations with diplomatic ties to forego the relation once they forge ties with China" ? it is the same as PRC asking nations to forego the relation once they forge ties with ROC. Both PRC and ROC claims to be the sole representative of China, mainland, taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao included. One nation, many system is what PRC is advocating. Whatever it is, lets hope both sides give each other time to resolve the differences. There is only political difference, mind you, chinese from both sides are finding it at home whichever side they are.</div>

China has a long way to go in many areas, especially the  political reform necessary for reconciliation with Taiwan. I am hoping that at least the "shan tong" can proceed so that the people between the two places can travel, do business and live together. Let political reconciliation takes its time. China will change and Taiwan will change.</div>

In fact, my friends on both sides are friends among themselves.<br><br>I am against Republic of Taiwan as an independent country, for it will certainly lead both sides to war.  I used to look at ROC as the true rep of Chinese.

At this moment, or for the next 10 years, I do not think it is the right time for both sides to be united. There is a lot the PRC needs to do about their international credibility, human rights, etc.  It is heartening to see that the people from both sides have already mixed around without any problem. there are also smaller gap in their standard of livings.

Regarding democratisation in PRC, I agree there is some sign of the leadership wanting to push for greater political reform and accountability, especially after Hu took over from Jiang. However, CCP's vision of reform may be limited to, for eg, open election of village leaders and greater leeway for the media to act in a watchdog role, etc. IMO, they are unlikely to go down the path towards multiparty election anytime soon. A fundamental difference in the political systems may be one issue that will divide the mainland from Taiwan.<br><br>I accept there is increasing economic ties between the two sides. However, I am not so sure about the emotional or psychological factors, as you term it. One factor in particular may be the push for a Taiwanese identity by some politicians. This particularly appeals to young ppl to whom blood tie with the mainlanders is less meaningful. If PRC want to reunite peacefully, it is vital to avoid alienating the Taiwanese ppl and do more to promote exchanges at all levels. As you say, exchanges are growing but PRC may not be wise by only seeking to play the game with the Lien Chan and Soong.<br><br>On the absence of referendum in the reunification of Germany, I believe the East German govt was in a state of near collapse and the East Germans themselves were all trying to get across to the west. So IMO, a referendum would simply not be possible; besides, there is no questioning the preference of the East Germans to reunite.<br><br>Regarding the interest of outside parties, I agree they may not view reunification positively. The US and Japan have gone on record to identify PRC as a threat and will try to use the Taiwan issue to contain China. Whether they will overtly seek to divide remains to be seen.<br><br>What will happen in the next 10 years? I believe much depends on how PRC (and perhaps to a lesser extent other parties) plays its hand.<br><br></div>
