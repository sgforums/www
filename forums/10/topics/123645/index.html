            <div class='col-md body'>Chinese from the mainland went to Taiwan as early as the 500Â’s, before that there were only aboriginals. The Dutch occupied the Taiwanese port in 1624 but in 1661 they were kicked out by the Ming Dynasty. Taiwan was included in the map of China under Qing Dynasty in 1683. China was forced to give Taiwan to Japan under the humiliating Ma Guan Treaty after it lost the first Sino Japanese war in 1895, in the same way Hong Kong was given to the Brit after China lost the opium war. Taiwan was back to China after Japan was defeated in 1945.<br><br>Taiwan is part of China without any doubt, from a historical point of view. PRC wants to regain control of Taiwan from the ROC, just like the Qing Dynasty did with the Ming Dynasty. This is the way all Chinese see it!!<br><br>Taiwan if part of China regardless of ideologies, after all, China is not that kind of communist countries like the old USSR, or North Korea. Over 1 million Taiwanese are living and working in China. Direct flights between the cities in Taiwan and China went on without any problem until the politician said no. Political ideologies have not changed the lives of the people, at least the majority of them. Are the Chinese in Taiwan better off than those in mainland ? Obviously no. In both places there are poor people and rich people, whether communist, socialist, democratic or whatever. I can't deny that there are more political jokes in Taiwan than anywhere else in the world, especiall the 319 incident.<br><br>America would certainly want to be involved in the cross straits affairs, in order to get the most benefits out for themselves, for the interest of the people in Taiwan nor China!! That you can take it to the bank, and Japan is but a political stooge of the Yankees.<br><br>War will be inevitable if historical facts are ignored, if the will of the people are disregarded, and if foreign interference is allowed.<br><br>Give both sides the time to loosen the historical baggage, work on the common interests of the people on both sides of the Straits and keep all politicians and foreigners out of the picture, China and Taiwan will be united naturally, and this will be for the benefits of the people on both sides.<br><br>Do China wants the China towns in the world? The question is, what do china towns in the world have to offer to China?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I guess it really depends on the Taiwanese.. here are my views<br><br>1) If they want a Taiwan state, they must be ready to fight the war to defend their clause, and they have to win. Losing will mean Taiwan becoming part of China.<br><br>2) Taiwan has never, in the last 1 or 2 decades, advocated war to solve the differences between herself and China.<br><br>3) China, however, returned by stating that it will not give up the use of force on Taiwan and continues, to this day, to increase the number of missiles pointed at Taiwan (abt 700 RIGHT THIS MOMENT) and continues to expand its military.<br><br>4) China entices Taiwan businesspeople to invest there with the econimical rewards due to the huge market there, and on the other hand, continues to place missiles to point at Taiwan, re-stating the so called 'One China' policy, restating it will not give up the use of force and even enacted an anti-Secession Law.<br><br>5) Taiwan's democracy did not come easy, would you believe a govt. like China's which plays things two ways (entice Taiwan businesses and continues to threaten with military) that it will gurantee that Taiwan gets a high degree of autonomy after unification?<br><br>6) China claims Taiwan as part of its territory when PRC has never ever governed or set foot on Taiwan. China talks about 'national sovereignty and territorial integrity' when citing reason to take Taiwan. BS. If Taiwan today is underdeveloped and not in the strategic position that it is, will China bother?<br><br>7) some Chinese have said to me that Taiwan and China both are Chinese countries, Chinese should unite. But does uniting means all becoming one nation? EU is not just one nation, it is a nation of nations. And if all Chinese should unite into one country, Singapore and China should merge since it is about 3/4 Chinese?<br><br>8 ) China has a choice with war. Singapore FM George Yeo once said in UN that any move towards Taiwan independence will lead to regional instability and troubles. That view is skewed because ultimately who holds the button to launch the missiles, China does. So does China have a choice?<br><br>9) Taiwanese have to see it clear now, that China has no intention, or less intention to negotiate with Taiwan unless Taiwan recognises that itself is a part of China. So if they want the democracy and freedom in Taiwan now, they must be ready to defend it.<br><br>If Taiwan softens, China will take it for granted. Look at what happened when President Chen tried to extend olive branches, China just will not budge, missiles keep increasing, military keep expanding, not giving up use of force and now Anti- Secession Law. Taiwan should not back down anymore and should really review its China policy, especially on allowing businesses to invest in China. It is well known that Chinese Govt. make things difficult for Taiwan firms doing businss in China if they support President Chen or Taiwan independence and China still advocates that politics and economics be separated. Back when Lee Teng Hui was president, he was the only one who dared to shout back and take tough stances against China and US or anyone else. He was sometimes crude and undiplmoatic, but that, unfortunately, is the only way to deal with China.<br><br>okok typed alot hahaha comment comment!!</div>

War will only break out if Taiwan declares independence, not when "If America was to pull out completely now".<br><br>Bloodshed and destruction as a result of the clashes of the ideologies are better seen during the Korean war and the vietnam war. The Malayan Communists had no change to do much damage. But we need to change with times, China is hardly the communist country with the original ideology. Is the stand-off at the Taiwan Straits a check on Communist advancement??? Hardly.<br><br>Taiwanese ruling parties and the media in Taiwan have made a mockery of democracy. Many Taiwanese are thus migrating to US, Australia, Singapore and now China. Do we know what the common Taiwanese feel?   You can't question if children should be united with their parents based on the benefits they were likely to gain.<br></div>
