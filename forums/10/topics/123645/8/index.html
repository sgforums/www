The total area of HK is barely 400 sq miles of islands, its clear from the beginning that the majority of the land-mass coastal cities are outset to take over it ever since the 80s under programme of modernizations begun under Mao but accelerated in the late 70s, the financial crisis merely accelerated the process.</div></blockquote>HongKong has weathered the storm well despite having to face so many changes in such a short time. It is barely 8 years since HongKong was handed back to China. It will take a much longer time to really judge whether 1C2S is a success or failure. After all, it took more than 130 years for the British to develop HK from a backwater fishing village to the asian financial center we know of today.<br></div>

The whole idea of Hongkonger should govern hongkong is superfluous, until they have proved they could had been better, if not it is better for them to support the policy from Party Central Committee, it could had even better without Hongkoner to step in. More and more business are immigrating to Shenzhen from Hongkong, as a matter of fact about 6million transmigrants out of 3/4 total population in Shenzhen are inhere less than a year, its clear from the part Shenzhen are de facto playing an role of regional hub. HK as an important source of investment for the developing Chinese economy seem no longer practicably. I believe HK as an island never appeared on history once until the Brtish arrived and began expansion as a strategic port, problem that area was so remote from the past.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well what I can say is this:<br><br>The future of Taiwan depends on Taiwanese, they must have the realisation that they decide the country's future, whether to unify with China, remain status quo or create a new nation on Taiwan.<br><br>The fact that Taiwanese are mostly ethnically Chinese is not the issue. American Whites and British Whites are ethnically whites, correct me if I'm wrong, but they are living in different nations as well. If China and Taiwan should be unified just because both nations are predominantly Chinese, then why not count Singapore in as well? I think ethnic and nationhood are 2 separate issues.<br><br>Just because China is big does not give her the right to fire missiles or use non-peaceful means  on Taiwan, under any circumstances.<br><br>Taiwan does not belong to China. When Taiwan was sececced from China to Japan during the Qing dynasty, it was given to Japan forever. From that point in time, Taiwan and China are already completely separated. When Japan surrendered in 1945, Taiwan was given to the Allied Forces, and General Chiang Kai Shek that time received Taiwan as the chief commander of the Allied Forces in Asia if I'm not wrong, not as the president or leader of China.<br><br>Taiwanese and Taiwanese politicians and govt. must be visionary when dealing with China, they must also be morally courageous. Democracy is the best weapon against missiles.<br><br>People all over the world should not merely look at the Taiwan-China issue from a historical, pragmatic, $$ and cents point of view. They should also see it morally and ethically, from a democracy's point of view. Let's face it, democracy is the only political system so far in human history to be widely, genuinely and consistently accepted by all of us.<br><br>Leaders in Taiwan and in many parts of the world have to be more idealistic. Call me crazy, but everything starts with an idea, with a dream. If you can't dream, then you can only follow orders. If you're merely a do-er, then you can only follow directions.<br><br>Statesmen and leaders of the world, especially in an increasingly wealthy and practical world of ours, must also be able preserve and to further promote the good principles of rightiousness, moral courage, honesty, peace and democracy.<br><br>My 2 cents' worth  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br></div>
