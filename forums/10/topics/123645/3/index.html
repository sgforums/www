They consider themselves citizens of Republic of China. There are people who favour independence or reunification but they are just the minorities.  In the first place most Taiwanese don't even want to touch this independence and reunification issue.<br>Under Chen Shuibian's rule, Taiwanese economy is getting from bad to worse. Their unemployment rate, suicide rate, crime rate have hit a record high. Ah Bian's incompetence is clear for all to see. In fact, many Taiwanese are fed up with their current government and are emigrating overseas in large numbers. Mainland China has become the 4th favourite destination for emigrating Taiwanese!</div>

It is clear that US interest iis purely based on their own interests. If it is a matter of ideology or freedom, they would not have recognised PRC and kicked out ROC in the 70s.<br><br>The issue here is whether Taiwan should be independent ? It should be clear that rejecting reunification does not equal to declaring independence! It can also mean status quo. Since mainland China is not pressing for an immediate reunification, there is no question about "rejecting reunification".<br><br>It is clear, if less than half of the 23 millions want independence, then constitutionally, democratically, they cannot declare independence!!  That is the reason why ah bian is trying all tricks to get the majority to agree on a referendum to change constitution. </div></blockquote>I believe that for changes to a country's constitution, a simple majority is usually insufficient in most countries. Any changes to a countryÂ’s constitution are a major event, and usually requires a significant majority in the parliament to push through.<br><br>For Chen to succeed, he will need much more support than he currently have. One way to guess his strategy is that by egging China into aggression, he can attempt to fan the nationalistic sentiments of the population to gain supporters from the opposite side.<br><br>But given the recent developments, it is possible that his separatist stance might be partly a political ploy to gain votes from the nationalists. Already he seems to be switching gear into mending the fences.<br><br><strong></strong><blockquote><strong></strong><div class="quote_from"><strong>Ideally, everybody should be free to do whatever he wants but in a group, you submit to the majority, that is civilisation. It is a historical fact that Taiwan is part of China so the minority in Taiwan will have to submit to the majority in Taiwan, and the majority in China as well!! And China is saying that taiwan is part of the 1.3 billion chinese, so 23 millions chinese in Taiwan also cannot decide to let Taiwan become independence. In the same way, 80 millions chinese in Guangdong cannot declare Guangdong independent!! It sounds harsh but isn't that the reality?<br><br>We know that declaration of Taiwan equals war with China so we should not encourage the minority Taiwanese to work towards independence. Besides, most Taiwanese know that when war breaks out, those who felt strongly about independence, Lee Teng Hui, Jin Mei Ling,....would be ready to flee to Japan and US. </strong>[/quote]<br><br>Historically, China was made of many, many individual and independent states. Even after reunification, China was split again during the Song dynasty. At which point of time do we draw the map as the real China?<br><br>Like the example I brought up earlier about Singapore and Johor, historical linkages by themselves are scant and questionable justifications to force unification if there are no willingness on the ground.<br><br>Like Singapore from Johor/Malayisa, Taiwan has been separated from China for many years, a separation that is not only political but administrative as well. Taiwan has already been separated from China, functioning by all purposes as an independent state since the close of WWII. By all accounts there is a formation of a Taiwanese identity, rather than a view of the Taiwanese as Chinese citizens on a seperate island.<br><br>When there's sufficient split around social, political or religious differences, sometimes it is better that there be a split. Just take a look at Pakistan/India, or the price that Indonesia and Philippines are paying for trying to keep Acheh and Mindanao respectively.<br><br>Forcing a unification is likely to end up in sorrow. Even a voluntary unification is not guaranteed sucess.<br></div><div class="quote_body">[quote]Singapore is by no means an example of a democratic country but is the Taiwanese democracy a model we should follow? do you think Chiam See Tong can declare Potong Pasir independence so that his people can have greater freedom?<br></div></blockquote>Personally, I think that while the Taiwanese political arena might not be of your taste, the basic choices that are fundamental to a democracy are there.<br><br>Yes, their politics can be messy - to the extent of brawling in the parliament, but all those are the peculiarities of their society. At least the people and the parliament seems to passionate about their country, and quite a lot less apathetic than the equivalent here. What is more important? The style or the substance?<br><br>Rather than talking about Guangdong or Potong Pasir splitting away, why not talk about Tibet?<br><br>Isn't Tibet historically an independant entity, with a completely different culture and identity from the rest of China; something which remained true long after their annexation by China.<br><br>Why should Tibet be part of China simply because they were conquered at some point in their history?</div>

Many Taiwanese chose to support the DPP bcos the KMT have become corrupted over the years and Taiwanese felt they need a new fresh government.

There are Taiwanese who favour reunification or independence but they are the minority.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from"></div><div class="quote_body">I think that reunification cannot happen before the Taiwanese have strong, clear reasons to rejoin China.

Their unemployment rate, crime rate, suicide rate have soared rapidly. Many Taiwanese who supported the DPP in the past are realising the harsh reality that the DPP is even more corrupted and inept than the KMT. More and more Taiwanese are fed up with their current government and are leaving Taiwan for China in large numbers. They are more than willing to give up what they have in Taiwan in exchange for a new life in the mainland. In fact Mainland China is already the 4th favourite destination for emigrating Taiwanese.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, as a Hokkien myself, I seriously doubt taiwanese wanted independent, I guess its just the politics different betwen each party, Tibet was part of China, infact I don't see how could Tibet being separated from China. Taiwan was not separated from China, but rather a political legacy of KMT, it was taken over by KMT from Japanese in the 1940s, remained very much untouch with CPP until recently.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The issue of whether Taiwan is part of China is one of sovereignty and territorial integrity. No government will easily relinquish their basic national interest, when push comes to shove on this matter.  Historically, there is little argument that Taiwan did belong to China over a long period of time and  most nations have accepted that Taiwan is part of China.<br><br>For the people of PRC, they believe Taiwan belongs to them. However, for some Taiwanese, (especially those from the earlier generation from the mainland) they believe that PRC belongs to them!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> If over a period of time when Taiwan evolves its own way of life, then the argument based on historical sovereignty weakens. That is one of the reason why it is in PRC's interest to integrate the economy and culture of Taiwan as closely as possible with theirs in order to forestall eventual separation.<br><br>The issue of reunification or otherwise is a separate matter which IMO should be decided by both the peoples of PRC and Taiwan and should not be forced in order to avoid bloodshed and widespread disruption. The best scenario to emerge would be peaceful reunification or separation by mutual consent.<br><br>Reunification could be brought about when the economic, cultural and political way of life of both the PRC and Taiwan becomes more similar. For their economy and culture to become more similar is perhaps just a matter of time as more people travel and live between the two lands. It is much more difficult for their political systems to become more similar. This can only happen if and when PRC makes deep reforms and democratise their political systems. Will this happen and if so, when? Probably yes. As more and more of their citizens improves themselves economically and become more vocal about their rights, it will be necessary for their government to take account of their views. When that happens, reunification might then make good sense.<br><br>From the pov of the US, Japan and S Korea, reunification might not be in their national interest, but that is a separate story. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

Germany was one country during the war and was divided by the Russian and American after the war. Korea was occupied by Japan and was also divided by the russian and the american after the war. Both sides formed their own government and claimed to represent the whole country. In the end, the UN decided to recognise both sides because during the cold war, the world was divided into two camps. East and West Germany had since reunited but North and South Korea remain at war with each other.<br><br>Korea, existed as one country since 1392 when General Yi founded the Yi Dynasty, and were occupied by the Japanese since 1910 and now divided by the superpowers.

Then ROC was driven to Taiwan in 1949 by the communists but they remained the sole representation of the whole China, mainland and Taiwan, in the United Nation, even after Mao founded PRC in 1949. PRC was only recognised by the communists states but not the world.<br><br>During this period, ROC in Taiwan was creating economic miracles while PRC was involved in cultural revolution and other rubbish, it was that time that China should join ROC in Taiwan.<br><br>But, in 1971, the UN admitted PRC IN PLACE of ROC in Taiwan, and in USA established diplomatic relationship with PRC and DROPPED ROC.<br><br>And the situation reversed, PRC is now making great economic progress while ROC is involved in all kinds of demonstrations and rubbish. It is no wonder why many from Taiwan are migrating to China.<br><br>At no time, was Republic of Taiwan ever appear and Taiwan remains a province of China.<br><br>China was split between PRC and ROC because of the civil war. The scenario is quite different from north and south korea.</div>

Yeah I agree with what you said. sometimes politicians in Taiwan have to be blamed too. I think both sides are at fault sometimes.. But what has to admitted is that this issue is no simple issue.. and efforts to resolve it and the differences between the two sides should be commended.

There are so many overseas Chinese other than those in china and taiwan. Like chinese in singapore they are ethnic chinese but not by nationality. Among them there are so many who understand chinese history and geography and are against independence though empathize with ROC, why label those against taiwan independence as PRC agent?? go read the history of china and find out the truth yourself.<br><br>Why we can't say because "Even Uncle Sam won't dare say it with such certain terms"? Why must we follow uncle sam? Taiwan became officially known as part of china when Qing dynasty drove out the dutch in 1683. Uncle Sam got its independence only in 1776!! Between 1683 and 1776 the europeans migrants were taking land from the native indians to form colonies, killing all the indians along the way. Finally, the colonies defeated the British and then formed the United States. why do you think the american have a better say about the history of China???<br><br></div>
