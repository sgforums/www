ON the surface it seems contradictory, but the intended meaning, is to evoke negative feelings from the one reading it. Therefore, small kid, when i said i dun give a damn shit about u, i meant, it to make me feel better in criticising u... understand? u are really a small little brat, stupid, racist, what other characters do u have other than these? idiotic? moronic? under-achiever? talk-only-no-action? rebellious? watever shit, i dun give a damn *hint, hint - refer to my explanation*, u piece of shit!<br></div>

As for the topic, it actually seems rather offensive and illogical, to consider the land owned by a particular race.  As stated, my PoV is that nobody owns the land.  The land is simply temporarily in possesion of those who develop it.<br><br>In anycase, Sinking Singapore ain't gonna be easy either since she is sitting on solid granite. And is Singapore really insignificant?  It depends really on the context.  Insignificant in size, yes.  But insignificant in regional trade? No.   Insignificant in terms of military power? Not really.<br><br>As for kangkang's posts, I guess you are right in some sense.  But may I remind you, malays in Singapore also played a part in building this country.  They are still our countrymen. =)</div>

Terrorism is only the product of the enemy's operation, but it is not what he does.  He seeks to confuse and manipulate the minds of people like you and me, and use us against ourselves.

U FUCKING RACIST! If u have got balls, show them, man! call ur nick YourFather, but u tok, like a small little cheebye girl. Is it that all u can say about malays? hey, by the way, i am not a malay, ok? i dun give a damn about bumiputra shit, or whatever shit... i just wanted to see how "racially harmonious Singapore really is" afterall...<br><br>well, from this small forum, obviously, Singapore is NOT. Only the garmen wants us to think it is. U fucking chinese racists! i never had any of the malay forum posters, say bad things about the chinese, but you motherfuckers one by one, had to say bad stuffs about them. Argh, all along i knew, it was just a gimmick the chinese and LKY used to pacify the malays, into thinking, we should live harmoniously, but on the outside, these bastards are thinking of some other things! FUCKING CHEEBYE! so wat if you have a private land?? big fucking deal, u think? dun worrylah, Singapore will no longer be wat it used to be, man. When that time comes, i want to see, whether you motherfuckers want to stay in Singapore, or migrate back to ur motherland - CHINA, where it seems, to be more 'economically viable'. Pussies!<br><br>Pieces of shit. RACISTS! A very simple forum topic like "Is it a Malay Land?" can give me so much insights on the chinese of Singapore. If LKY and GCT would to read these, they would be damn surprised to note that their own motherfarkers are the ones being RACISTS!!!!!<br><br>whether the sultan lazy or not, it's not my prob. He want to womanize, be an alcoholic, suck cock or watver shit, i dun give a damn. But one thing for sure, you ppl are fucking RACISTS. in front of them, you smile, make them ur frens, behind them, that is, when you hide behind the monitor consoles, you all backstab them... CHEEBYE!!!!<br><br>Eh, hope you racists burn in hell! yah, before u all retaliate and say i burn in hell, watever!<br><br>RACISTS! COWARDS! CHEEBYE! MOTHERFUCKERS!

Can't discipline u is it? If u can behave like a wild monkey, then why can't the human give u some up-to-down screwing sessions?<br><br>So u can show me vulgarities. How ah..? I very scare u know? But what can your stupid vulgarities do? Is that a way to defend yourself? So u r trying a counter-offensive strategy, but had u ever been able to defend yourself in the 1st place? At 1st u try to act like a noisy kid, then when ppl point out your silly act, u denied &amp; attack back. Son, if u want to attack back, make sure that u are able to defend your own ass first! If not, then u think others will listen to what u say?? No!  That just make u look like a dog which is barking...ya, barking some meaningless noise. Although people can hear the noise, u think they will think highly of u, just because that u can bark like nothing else?? So, to act like a dog, or behave like a human, it's up to u.<br><br>So u think i'm old?? Great! Coz u are WRONG!! Well, that proved another thing - u just don't understand a lot of thing. So u think it must be an old people to use the word "my son"? Ok, ever heard of people saying "my dear" or "oh, my poor child" ?? So u think that the people who say the previous 2 phares are talking to their lover or thier child?<br><br>Good, thanks for showing me that u are wrong. I'm actually quite young, maybe even younger than u (but i'm not as naive as u). I need not reveal my age, but that just show your stupidity.<br><br>That's all for now, i'll be back to show u some more of your silly acts.[/B][/QUOTE]<br><br>eh fuck face! i reply fast because this stupid forum keeps emailing me when idiots like urself post something... and i am using cable... don't talk like u very clever like that lah asshole... so much talk, one fuck cheebye thing also don't have...<br><br>eh fuck off... i dun give a shit of wat u say... just becos u say so much u i think i care? eh... fuck off... i am sick and tired of this forum, and the postings... i want to go play some other things liao... yah, i am a monkey, a kid, a watever fuck u want to say, i couldn't care less....

            <div class='col-md body'>er, let us refrain from the personal attacks and maybe get back to topic.<br><br>Sang Nila Utama, as I recall, was a prince of the Majapahit empire, centred in Palembang but originating from India. So, technically, he is Indian and not Malay. That is not to say that he is the original occupant of Singapore. If any group could claim to be the original occupants of Singapore or in fact Malaysia, then the group would be the Orang Asli, which is accorded such status by the Malaysian Government. The Malays that occupy the Peninsular and Singapore originally were actually immigrants from the islands that currently form Indonesia and not indigenous to said lands.<br><br>The Chinese and Indians on Singapore immigrated to the island during British rule and not as a result of LKY's rule.<br><br>If anyone wants to dispute these ideas, please do it with facts and not personal attacks as such only go into making the attacker look ignorant.</div>

Heard of Sang Nila Utama? since when, we learn Chinese from southern china or Orang Utan all these? make no sense u know. If u were to ask a historian, he/she would confirm that Singapore's first HUMAN civilization was from the malay-origins.<br><br>** historians are constantly learning about pass histories as time goes on... through discoveries and excavations and explorations. the part that 32,000 years ago... south east asia was a land of the chinese was noted by australian archaeologist through archaelogical findings. not because tripwire says it is so.<br><br>**perhaps another few hundred years later... archaeologist might find older proof of ancient society of singapore which may or may not be of malay origin.<br><br>**the key thing here is to understand the fickleness of basing a territorial claim base on historical basis.<br><br>**my example was to note the stupidity of claimming a land base on historical record without proper legal basis... i do not claim that singapore was once a malay land or chinese land or even an orang utan land. i had thought that you will have enough IQ to see my meanings.<br><br>it's true that, history to u means nothing. And it serves as lesson to us. And yes, the lesson is for the malays to learn that, in the past, Singapore belonged to them, but because they were 'taken advantaged of', now the land seems to be a land of the chinese, everything chinese. Don't say it is a Singaporean land, loads of rubbish! Tell me then, where singaporeans come from? Chinese from China, Indians from India, Eurasians, from Europe, and malays??? they are not from anywhere, they are the natives hello!... so the lesson to learn is be careful the next time you allow someone to stay over your land, the next thing u know, they would snatch it away from you, and made it theirs, and call it theirs, without u even not knowing it....<br><br>** chinese, malays, indians or even europeans... wat are they?? are they not the same human being?? or is one race more righteous or more equal than the other when it comes to land and property distribution?? your words carries a tone of racism.<br><br>** No man lives alone... no races lives alone on this planet in isolation... either you can learn to live with your neighbours or you can go to war with your neighbours. its your choice.<br><br>** The chinese are now the predominant race in singapore... whether it is by fate or by destiny or even by human choice... Singapore is now run by a mix of people whom with the blessing of the God has felt it in their common interest to forge a common path of peace, prosperity and progress across different races , language or religion. If the GOD thinks otherwise and if GOD is racist. then perhaps one day singaporeans will be punish by GOD for loving their neighbours of different skin color... BUT that will be blasepheme... understandable... i believe that you dont think GOD is racist right??<br><br>** Along this difficult path... there will be ups and downs... there have been racial riots in singapore... student rebellions and even military mutiny on such a small land over the 200 years of recorded history.... hopefully man will learn the ignorance of the past and forge a better future ahead... no doubt... there will be other ups and downs in the future... to live is to struggle against the odds of nature and against racist people such as .....you??<br><br>duh!... silly topic, ah... forget it, i am not going to go into this liao, it is so obvious wat is the truth. thanks anyway.</div></blockquote>One man's truth is another man's lies. many man think that they are righteous... many man thinks that they are fighting for GOD... many man thinks that they are on the RIGHT side... little do they know... its all a pack of lies.<br><br>even among the righteous, among the faithful and the religious, there are fools.... who grows old, knowledgeable, but non the wiser from a five year old kid.....</div>

But let me quote or rather use some words which our dear PM Goh said in the forum with the Mendaki Youths (came out in Sunday Times). He said that, he knew many banks in Singapore, which employs entirely chinese, but becos of the goverment's effort for racial inter-mixing, these banks started to employ other races. So u see, he made a good pt. In the first place, Chinese are already excluding malays from whatever opportunity there is. So, those malays who excel, or becomes successful is because of their own hard work, and most of them, are self-employed, never working under someone. That is why, when you were talking abt entrepeneur, it is true they can be as successful as any other, but that's because the marginalisation is not there. Who would marginalise the person himself (he's the boss remember?)<br><br>as for fatimah, she was from a rich family right from Arab. So she's not really a good example. And furthermore ur examples are those back in the 30's 40' 50', when the chinese were not sure who they are, or in fact, nobody in singapore knew they were singaporeans, they thot they were native chinese, indians from india and so on.<br><br>well, i can say is, look at the Army. Malays or rather muslims are marginalised openly, anyone did anything about it? no.. garmen kept it silent, or silent anyone who brought up such issues, just like fateha.com which brought up the tudung issue. well, i dunno anymore, this whole thing is making me re-decide whether afterall our racial harmony is not really harmony in the truest sense. It was forced into us. So can u imagine is the force is removed, riots will be everywhere. The way garmen is doing things regarding the racial harmony is not rite. They should educate the people about diversity, and learn to accept diversity, and not tolerate our differences.<br><br>the bottomline is, if u do not know who the malays, indians or chinese are, you will never know their positions. I know the positions of all races. My best friend is a chinese, in fact, most of my frens are chinese. I play soccer with my very good malay friends, and i am mixed blood with indian origin, chinese, etc. so overall, i somehow can get a bigger picture of how each race view each other races.<br><br>well, thanks anyway tripwire. Never meant to upset u. It would not be my interest to offend someone with good intentions, like urself. Thanks!<br></div>
