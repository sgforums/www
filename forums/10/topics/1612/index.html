            <div class='col-md body'>I recently have these comments made by a group of people. They were stating that Singapore is a malay land, and the chinese came and 'politely' took over the land. And malays, being the kind of people they are, which is hospitable, they allowed the chinese, the indians to come over, and in fact, they made frens out of these foreigners.<br><br>some chinese and indians believe that malays are lazy, or watever, but the fact is, to them, this land, belongs to the Malays.<br><br>whether, the chinese or the indians want to justify that, this land was developed, and the fact that Singapore is as successful as it is today kudos to the hardworking chinese and indians, the fact remains that, the land belongs to the Malay. The chinese took over the land that was never their.<br><br>furthermore, this absurdness in a country run by chinese, mostly populated by chinese, can be evident from Amercans believing the Singapore is situated near China. Duh... it is the Malay Peninsula for Pete's sake.<br><br>anyway, i am not a malay, nor a chinese, nor an indian, nor a eurasion, i am a mixed blood singaporean (chinese, malay and indian), but the point i want to make is, why is it, that the minorities, esp. the malays feel as if this land is chinese land?<br><br>chinese signs everywhere, chinese this and chinese that. So was just wondering, why no one ever brought it up? it is politically unsound to bring such an issue up, and yah, wait a minute, the parliament is so "chinese" that i don't think they would bring this up, for all u know the ISA (LKY's original creation) would be used against the one who brought this up, like they say, the truth hurts, but well, i need to know the truth, speak up... anyone?<br></div>

And then, he use the racial harmony idealism to make other minorities feel that this move is ok. by right it is certainly not ok. The truth is this land belongs to the malays, and malays being the patient people they are allowed foreigners to come in and call this place home. But, at first glance, ppl thot, singapore is a chinese country. well, it's not, at least in history. Hmmm.... why didn't the malays make noise... guess, it's their nature to just live harmoniously. but the chinese being the majority, they act as if sometimes they owe this land. by right not really, they are just immigrants. the only true home for the chinese, is China. but well, what the hack, it is already in our system (after being brain washed) that Singapore is our home. yah rite...</div>

If history can be used to claim ownership over a property without legal backing... then i can, by historical record of ownership of all my previous properties... such as cars, flats and condos....,things which i own in the past, NOW seek ownership over those same properties on historical basis and kick the present owners out. wont that be wrong???<br><br>Secondly... Singapore was in fact granted independence from malaysia, a malay nation with a malay head and with a malay..... blah blah blah.... thus legally, singapore is now owned by singaporeans.<br><br>So... from a historical point of view, singapore was formally occupied and ruled by malays...<br><br>However, the same historical records shows the change in ownership over time in proper legal procedure. BUT make no mistake here.... Singapore now belongs to singaporeans on legal documents, signed and recognised around the world.... The historical part merely acts as witness to that change, but does not in any way partake in that change.<br><br>Another problem with the use of historical records for basis of claim is .... TIME.<br><br>for example..... 10 years ago... singapore is owned by singaporeans.... that make singaporeans owner of present day singapore..<br><br>50 years ago... singapore is owned by the british as a colony... so that would make the brits the owner of present day singapore.<br><br>200 years ago... singapore is owned by a group of malay fisherman... so that would make the malays the owner of present day singapore.<br><br>32000 years ago.... singapore is owned by chinese from southern china... so that would make the chinese the owner of present day singapore...<br><br>1,000,000 years ago... singapore was owned by the orang utan... so that would make the orang utan the owner of present day singapore....<br><br>wat if tomolo some archaeologist found a chinese artifact dating more then 4000 years ago in singapore.... r we then gonna say that singapore was previously owned by china???? and that the malays are the ursurper of a land once belong to chinese???<br><br>SO.... as can be seen... historical.... cannot be used as judgement of who owns a land without legal support.</div>

Heard of Sang Nila Utama? since when, we learn Chinese from southern china or Orang Utan all these? make no sense u know. If u were to ask a historian, he/she would confirm that Singapore's first HUMAN civilization was from the malay-origins.<br><br>it's true that, history to u means nothing. And it serves as lesson to us. And yes, the lesson is for the malays to learn that, in the past, Singapore belonged to them, but because they were 'taken advantaged of', now the land seems to be a land of the chinese, everything chinese. Don't say it is a Singaporean land, loads of rubbish! Tell me then, where singaporeans come from? Chinese from China, Indians from India, Eurasians, from Europe, and malays??? they are not from anywhere, they are the natives hello!... so the lesson to learn is be careful the next time you allow someone to stay over your land, the next thing u know, they would snatch it away from you, and made it theirs, and call it theirs, without u even not knowing it....<br><br>duh!... silly topic, ah... forget it, i am not going to go into this liao, it is so obvious wat is the truth. thanks anyway.</div>

By defending those who i presumely "criticised" doesn't mean you are correct either. Hey, this is a forum, i can post any views i have, even if it on the postings ppl made. Why? u think forum is Singapore is it? whereby we cannot have freedom of speech and expression? i say wat u want, and u say wat u want... understand? yah, so wat if i whine, and i am immatured? it is ur view, and i have my own views about other postings, and these ppl have their views on the topics. So u mean, i am suppose to passively accept anything anyone has to say, like urself? wake up... unless u are a kid, u would listen to ur mom, and does as she told u so. this is an adult world, i can think for my own, and i can shout as loud as i want to, but hello! i wasn't shouting, wat makes u think i was shouting??? this is forum full of words, dun tell me you can hear the words screaming out to u, if yes, i advise you seek psychological help, u really need one.<br><br>as to ur description of my behaviour, i have this to say "WATEVER!" i dun give a damn. You are just an anonymous person posting something in this forum, and u expect me to take what u say seriously?? puhleezz... give me a break...<br><br>it seems that i have some attitude problem, according to u? hey, this is a forum. if u dun know the purpose of a forum, then it is ur problem, dun assume someone has an attitude problem just becos he/she expresses his views in such a manner, and wat makes u an expert on the Right &amp; Wrong of Forum Postings? You some kind of professor in this? hey, get lost... i will do as i like, i dun need a bloody asshole like u to tell me wat to do.<br><br>words can be interpreted in many ways, you chose to interpret the words i used as me being anti-social, and anti-nation, that's ur problem.... seriously i am not. i just wanted to make use of this forum to waste my time, like doing nonsensical things like this: finding out what nonsensical ppl like urselves have to say about such an issue.<br><br>wat makes u think this is a sensitive issue? r u dat sensitive? isn't Singapore racially and religiously harmonious? so why worry, unless wat i have mention is not the truth.<br><br>so beat it, boy! dun pester me, becos i shall not waste the opportunity to fuck u upside down in this forum to relief my angst, and stress in work, so feel free to provide me a scapegoat i could use!<br><br>does this answer ur doubts about why i am behaving like this?
