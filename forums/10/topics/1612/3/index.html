(and yes, they are malays...)<br><br>ok, if i offended u wrongly, i am sorry. It may seem i didn't want to accept other ppls view pts, but i was making my own views on those views as well, but ppl preferred to attack me personally, calling me a kid, bla bla bla...<br><br>ok, fine. I admit it first, i used vulgarity, not because i am vulgar, or anything, just to let the readers sense the anger i have, which in fact, i dun have any, just wanted to bring out the flavour, that's all<br><br>ok? so for those who are offended by my postings, i am sorry. that's all i have for u guys now.<br><br>Thanks!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by sure_or_not?:</div><div class="quote_body">well, wat u have said is really true. But let me quote or rather use some words which our dear PM Goh said in the forum with the Mendaki Youths (came out in Sunday Times). He said that, he knew many banks in Singapore, which employs entirely chinese, but becos of the goverment's effort for racial inter-mixing, these banks started to employ other races. So u see, he made a good pt. In the first place, Chinese are already excluding malays from whatever opportunity there is.<br><br>*** not really true... the problems lies not in the malays being marginalised... the problems lies in the animalistic behaviour of human being...<br><br>*** the truth is... at least from my viewpoint... is that... humans are a frail lot... constantly fearful of being isolated and getting eliminated by a larger or stronger force... so... they constantly seek to be with those of their own 'kind' either by nationality, religion, races, language, location, ideology, age, skill, profession, educational background, sex and many many other possibility....<br><br>*** the bottom line is to be with a group... to be 'protected' per se from other groups... whom they believe might do them harm out of competing interest or resoucres... but also, in order for a grouping to be successful... they need a common focus point.. a common enemy so to speak.. to maintain group loyalty and cohesion.... since if there is no threat... there is no need to be part of a group.<br><br>*** so... take me for an example... my company has alot of people from a huge diversity of background... as a result.. the company becomes fragmented along racial, language, sex, rank, vocational, nationality and educational qualification line... the myanmar chinese dont mix with malaysian chinese, the muslims dont mix with other religions, the indians are practically isolated and poor me is osctracised because my qualification is too high for the many O and Poly grads....<br><br>*** so the problem is in the mindset... that is why some company dont want to employ malays, they fear the company might be fragmented... other company who though employ malays, may not want to promote them into high position for fear that these malays in high position might promote only malays within the company out of racial biasesness which may be in against the company interest. so... its kind of hard to see the end of all these type of discrimination... but its not merely faced by malays... its a situation that is faced by EVERYONE!<br><br>So, those malays who excel, or becomes successful is because of their own hard work, and most of them, are self-employed, never working under someone. That is why, when you were talking abt entrepeneur, it is true they can be as successful as any other, but that's because the marginalisation is not there. Who would marginalise the person himself (he's the boss remember?)<br><br>*** dead wrong... u see.. to be a successful entrepreneur... first u must dump that stupid mindset i stated above... only by seeing everything is dollars and cents... can an entrepreneur succeed...<br><br>*** an entrepreneur in singapore... be you malay, chinese or any other races... in order to survive in this competitive world... u need to exploit your religion, race and language to your economic advantage while at the same time... attempts to do buissness with others of different race, language and blah blah blah.... in short.. u need to rise above the animalistic feelings and cut across the entire spectrum of the society... those entrepreneur who cannot... ends up not so the successful... those who can... will reach the sky....<br><br>*** a malay singaporean buissnessman must learn to survive in the chinese sea of singapore.... and when they step from singapore... they must learn to live in a world where the white man rules the waves...<br><br>as for fatimah, she was from a rich family right from Arab. So she's not really a good example. And furthermore ur examples are those back in the 30's 40' 50', when the chinese were not sure who they are, or in fact, nobody in singapore knew they were singaporeans, they thot they were native chinese, indians from india and so on.<br><br>*** it doesnt matter wat is the nationality of those entrepreneur... what really matters is their character... how they fought and won the days despite the odds... against them.<br><br>well, i can say is, look at the Army. Malays or rather muslims are marginalised openly, anyone did anything about it? no.. garmen kept it silent, or silent anyone who brought up such issues, just like fateha.com which brought up the tudung issue. well, i dunno anymore, this whole thing is making me re-decide whether afterall our racial harmony is not really harmony in the truest sense.<br><br>*** I think... the reason why malays are not allow to hold high position in SAF is because of fear... the fear that malays in the SAF might end up unwittingly as spies for malaysia...<br><br>*** In history... there has been numerous records where one nations make us of another nations citizen as sources of military intelligience.... such spies are recruited base on either because they share common races, language or religion. in military terms... these spies are known as 'neighbourly spy' they are not paid..and such networks are very easy to maintain. this is once again due to the animalistic behavour i stated above... the malays being a minority in singapore... expectedly looks towards malaysia for sense of protection or security.<br><br>It was forced into us. So can u imagine is the force is removed, riots will be everywhere. The way garmen is doing things regarding the racial harmony is not rite. They should educate the people about diversity, and learn to accept diversity, and not tolerate our differences.<br><br>*** i think ... the govt do understand... unfortunately practicallity and a cautious approached requires them to act what they feel is in the best interest of the country... it may not be ideal.. but such actions usually carries the least risk.<br><br>the bottomline is, if u do not know who the malays, indians or chinese are, you will never know their positions. I know the positions of all races. My best friend is a chinese, in fact, most of my frens are chinese. I play soccer with my very good malay friends, and i am mixed blood with indian origin, chinese, etc. so overall, i somehow can get a bigger picture of how each race view each other races.<br><br>*** I dont even know myself... much less my neighbour... i dont even trust myself... much less trust my friends... and even if i know and trust all those around me... my calculations tells me that there is at least another 3 million plus singaporeans i have never and will probably never met in my life. so... until them... i am sorry to say... i will still lock my door at night. u may know your malay friend... but do u know all the hundreds of thoudsands of malay singaporeans???<br><br>well, thanks anyway tripwire. Never meant to upset u. It would not be my interest to offend someone with good intentions, like urself. Thanks!</div></blockquote>non taken......</div>
