So?<br></div></blockquote>Obviously you didn't get what I said. You don't need to lecture me on rates - I know what they are - maybe better than you.<br><br>Like I said earlier, Australia is a continent island. Australia makes a great hideout for some criminals because of its vastness. Geographical factor does impact on crime rates. Larger the population - of course crimes will happen more because of the opportunity and the land mass ( more hiding places). It is a random event ,not a set event where you can use a set scale. Crime also happens on other factors. Just because Singapore has low crime rate doesn't mean that if you implant the Singaporean government in Australia - Australia will have a low crime rate as well.<br><br>So differing factors but does that mean that Australia is worse than Singapore ? No.  In Singapore , there is always a crowd somewhere because it is a tiny country . It is mainly urban - streets are well lighted everywhere , easier for police to patrol , unlike Australia where there can be 20km square of the area of wilderness and one small town with maybe 4-5 police men.  Some rural areas - the next neighbour can be 5 km down the street even  for farmers.<br><br>Low crime also doesn't mean no crime. Crime happens on opportunity.<br><br>America is divided into north and south. If you are referring to USA ...you must have flunk geography in terms of continents and size .</div>

You don't need to lecture me on rates - I know what they are - maybe better than you.<br><br>Like I said earlier, Australia is a continent island. Australia makes a great hideout for some criminals because of its vastness. Geographical factor does impact on crime rates. Larger the population - of course crimes will happen more because of the opportunity and the land mass ( more hiding places). It is a random event ,not a set event where you can use a set scale. Crime also happens on other factors. Just because Singapore has low crime rate doesn't mean that if you implant the Singaporean government in Australia - Australia will have a low crime rate as well.<br><br>So differing factors but does that mean that Australia is worse than Singapore ? No.  In Singapore , there is always a crowd somewhere because it is a tiny country . It is mainly urban - streets are well lighted everywhere , easier for police to patrol , unlike Australia where there can be 20km square of the area of wilderness and one small town with maybe 4-5 police men.  Some rural areas - the next neighbour can be 5 km down the street even  for farmers.<br><br>Low crime also doesn't mean no crime.
