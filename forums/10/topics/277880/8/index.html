Same as Singaporeans. Sometimes its not just about race itself but the perceived threat to personal livelihood. Asians are viewed as recent immigrants and so are the FT that have been coming to Singapore. Same scenario even though both countries are filled with immigrants. Imagine the feelings of the Malays and Aborigines.</div>
