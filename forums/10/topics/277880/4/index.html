            <div class='col-md body'><br>Another problem with emigration to the ang moh countries.<br><br><strong>Sexual misconduct plagues US schools</strong><br><br>By MARTHA IRVINE and ROBERT TANNER, AP National Writers 1 hour, 54 minutes ago<br><br>The young teacher hung his head, avoiding eye contact. Yes, he had touched a fifth-grader's breast during recess. "I guess it was just lust of the flesh," he told his boss.<br>ADVERTISEMENT<br><br>That got Gary C. Lindsey fired from his first teaching job in Oelwein, Iowa. But it didn't end his career. He taught for decades in Illinois and Iowa, fending off at least a half-dozen more abuse accusations.<br><br>When he finally surrendered his teaching license in 2004 Â— 40 years after that first little girl came forward Â— it wasn't a principal or a state agency that ended his career. It was one persistent victim and her parents.<br><br>Lindsey's case is just a small example of a widespread problem in American schools: sexual misconduct by the very teachers who are supposed to be nurturing the nation's children.<br><br>Students in America's schools are groped. They're raped. They're pursued, seduced and think they're in love.<br><br>An Associated Press investigation found more than 2,500 cases over five years in which educators were punished for actions from bizarre to sadistic.<br><br>There are 3 million public school teachers nationwide, most devoted to their work. Yet the number of abusive educators Â— nearly three for every school day Â— speaks to a much larger problem in a system that is stacked against victims.<br><br>Most of the abuse never gets reported. Those cases reported often end with no action. Cases investigated sometimes can't be proven, and many abusers have several victims.<br><br>And no one Â— not the schools, not the courts, not the state or federal governments Â— has found a surefire way to keep molesting teachers out of classrooms.<br><br>Those are the findings of an AP investigation in which reporters sought disciplinary records in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. The result is an unprecedented national look at the scope of sex offenses by educators Â— the very definition of breach of trust.<br><br>The seven-month investigation found 2,570 educators whose teaching credentials were revoked, denied, surrendered or sanctioned from 2001 through 2005 following allegations of sexual misconduct.<br><br>Young people were the victims in at least 1,801 of the cases, and more than 80 percent of those were students. At least half the educators who were punished by their states also were convicted of crimes related to their misconduct.<br><br>The findings draw obvious comparisons to sex abuse scandals in other institutions, among them the Roman Catholic Church. A review by America's Catholic bishops found that about 4,400 of 110,000 priests were accused of molesting minors from 1950 through 2002.<br><br>Clergy abuse is part of the national consciousness after a string of highly publicized cases. But until now, there's been little sense of the extent of educator abuse.<br><br>Beyond the horror of individual crimes, the larger shame is that the institutions that govern education have only sporadically addressed a problem that's been apparent for years.<br><br>"From my own experience Â— this could get me in trouble Â— I think every single school district in the nation has at least one perpetrator. At least one," says Mary Jo McGrath, a California lawyer who has spent 30 years investigating abuse and misconduct in schools. "It doesn't matter if it's urban or rural or suburban."<br><br>One report mandated by Congress estimated that as many as 4.5 million students, out of roughly 50 million in American schools, are subject to sexual misconduct by an employee of a school sometime between kindergarten and 12th grade. That figure includes verbal harassment that's sexual in nature.<br><br>Jennah Bramow, one of Lindsey's accusers in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, wonders why there isn't more outrage.<br><br>"You're supposed to be able to send your kids to school knowing that they're going to be safe," says Bramow, now 20. While other victims accepted settlement deals and signed confidentiality agreements, she sued her city's schools for failing to protect her and others from Lindsey Â— and won. Only then was Lindsey's teaching license finally revoked.<br><br>As an 8-year-old elementary-school student, Bramow told how Lindsey forced her hand on what she called his "pee-pee."<br><br>"How did you know it was his pee-pee?" an interviewer at St. Luke's Child Protection Center in Cedar Rapids asked Jennah in a videotape, taken in 1995.<br><br>"'Cause I felt something?" said Jennah, then a fidgety girl with long, dark hair.<br><br>"How did it feel?" the investigator asked.<br><br>"Bumpy," Jennah replied. She drew a picture that showed how Lindsey made her touch him on the zipper area of his pants.</div>

So what's the problem?<br><br>Of course, with a <strong>high school education and no skill,</strong> what do you expect? Cheh ....you think our O levels that fantastic meh - must give you high paying job because you have Singaporean O levels...hello ...there are alot of people with Masters and PhD in Australia. In Singapore, it will pretty much be the same thing . If your friend has a high school education and tradeskill, i.e. plumber , electrician etc , he won't work as a dishwasher. If I am not wrong, your friend is probably just a student on a student working visa , harder to get jobs since the companies have to find either permanent residents OR Australian citizens to do the job before looking for foreigners.<br><br>Yes the world is globalising. Singapore has to remain competitive by controlling wages of the skilled workers. Other developed countries remain competitive by offering higher wages so they attract the young skilled workers. <strong>It goes both ways.</strong> People come , people go. Do you think the "foreign talents" Singapore attracted are interested in Singapore? Get real - it's for the money.<br><br>And frankly I find that the part about local girls have more ease to migrate  by finding caucasian husbands is hilarious - you think so easy ah ?  I am a girl who migrated on a skillset they need - no caucasian boyfriends or husbands to help me through.<br><br>Those who cannot make it into or IN Australia will of course whine about racism and being a second class citizen. That's their problem. Alot of asians I see here are quite ok - surviving decently with nice houses.<br><br>Up to you if you want to take a risk and go out of Singapore or not.<br></div>
