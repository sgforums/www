If you say its lousy, then why so many people are visting this tiny red dot?<br><br>And just because you are living in Australia that doesnÂ’t make you are more knowledgeable person.

Ah Gazelle Gazelle , you are so funny when you get stirred.<br><br>I left Singapore because it did nothing for my career. True that and I won't deny it. I hate that my own home country doesn't give a damn while my adopted home country nurtures me even though I am just an asian migrant. Funny since you like to call my adopted country racist when it is actually giving me opportunities instead of suppressing me.<br><br>Did I say free education? I said free healthcare. Do not go twisting my words. My education is now free because I am sponsored by an agency. So there you go.<br><br>Singapore -....you guys need tourists right for the tourism industry? It is and will always be my homeland, no matter what . Do you think I want to see Singapore go down in the gutters? No. I still tell my australian and american friends to visit Singapore instead of hongkong . Cheap food cheap shopping, great holiday destination.<br><br>The reason why you are so fed up is because you really have no right to criticise when you only went there for a holiday or read some media crap. One thing you have to learn is that Australian media is not like Singaporean media- they can sensationalize things . Free speech.<br><br></div>

Easy right? then do it loh...<br></div></blockquote>HAHAHAHA . And you call yourself an <span style="font-style: italic;">executive or a sales manager</span> or whatever.<br><br>I worked as a cashier which earned me around 800 dollars-900 dollars back per month  then in a japanese department store then  I did freelance webprogramming around 20 in 2 years....3rd year I reduced in poly because of the finals.  I am just presenting to you a nice estimate of what happens to my money plus I did not include my own savings.<br><br>1/2 to 2/3rds of my salary went to parents.<br>So count that 400*5*12 on average (we have not even factor in public holidays I had to work while I was a cashier) = 24000+ freelance web programming 25000 = $ 49000.<br>Cumulative share buying by my parents- remember Australia money = Singapore money at one stage - don't ask me what stocks they got but I know they bought foreign shares at that stage- I don't know and I didn't care because they told me I had to pay for my "rent" in their place until I became 22 years old. Then they open the books and show me.<br><br>PLUS when I returned to Singapore - they also took half of my salary again for 2-3 years - 700*3*12 = 25200 in total. University study in Australia - paid by University scholarship and my part-time work which I got from university - about my full tuition fee .  My survival fees in Australia was 24k including rent - so my dad advanced the money while my money was locked up in shares.<br><br>Now let's calculate 49000+25200 -24000= 50200- approximate without  counting cumulative profits from the shares they held in my name since I was 15. Do the math yourself. Holding the right shares for 8 years can double up . That is where I got my deposit for my apartment and the bank is very willing to consider mortgaging  . That is easily to half the value of my apartment. That is not counting money I saved myself.<br><br>Do everyone have to be a nightclub hostess to save that much? No.  I don't splash it on fancy second hand audis .<br><br>So what if I was a bloody nurse? Do I really need a fancy title ? They pay damn well for nurses because they have a shortage. Casuals pay 1.5 times more. Public holidays - they pay 1.5 to double or triple up for christmas. Weekends are 1.5 times  plus night shift allowances.  So if you work casual on weekend which lands on public holidays the pay can easily go up to 3 times or 3.5 times the hourly rate plus nightshift allowance is also doubled up . You think Australia pay their nurses like Singapore - just one set salary? Wrong.<br><br>CBD dumpshack? Hahha if you like to think so.<strong> Banks don't lend money if it  is too risky for them and they cannot recover the costs . I am surprised a so-called experienced person like you won't know about that simple fact. </strong> It is small like a 3 room HDB flat . It was new when I got it. So what? Still a piece of asset - has its own value when I rent it out after my sibling moves out. <strong>I never said it was a penthouse or a mansion.</strong><br><br>I am no longer a nurse. If I was , I would be in Melbourne. You could ask the admin to find out where my ip is rooted in mostly . I will have a melbourne connection ip because of my apartment there and I do fly back about 6 times or more per year from Canberra.  Why should I lie when I know sgforumners irl in melbourne who can take apart my words easily?<br></div>

The ones who ask daddy for handouts if they want to go partying or do drugs/alcohol . Alot of young students get mixed up with illicit drugs or alcohol bingeing. That I am not denying.<br><br>My friends who fairly recently migrated to Melbourne - no troubles so far, they just grumble about the taxes and rentals  being high when they first came . Now they settled in. One or two want to go back home because they want be with family. Got one who did complain about the way her colleagues treated her - but I think she is starting to fit in so no more complaints.<br><br>I did have trouble before because of work politics and different work culture. I learnt the way of diplomacy in order to survive  politics and I am now ok. There will be always problems in Australia - it is not  always smoothsailing . It is how much determination and persistance you want to put in.  I just pick myself up and move on. Fall again - pick up and move on. Fall again- pick up and move on.<br><br>Actually for the record ,I worked in Australia since 2002. Last year I switched my profession after I got my masters.</div>

But as for mass "subprime"property, I will definitely stay away for now until we are clearer about the future of US$ and the US economy.<br><br>US economy seems to be caught in a terrible situation at the moment. On one hand, they are experiencing high inflation due to oil and other stuffs and but they are unable to increase the interest rate due to the subprime problem and with weakening of dollar (now at 1997 level) it will give further headach to inflation.<br><br>I am not sure if you belong to the bullish or bearish camp, but I am quite certain that things is going to get alot worst before it gets better.

When the market crashes - you go in and swoop on foreign investors who mortgaged at 80% . Recession , job security and people coping with the losses as well as the bank calling in payments - will make it easier to swoop for cheaper property prices.</div>
