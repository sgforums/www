Once again get your facts straight and check the dictionary on the definition of racism. Don't play race cards with me - I am not caucasian.<br><br>I did not start a personal attack - I made a reference to your behaviour. Who ever heard of someone insisting Australia was racist for the next few posts and calling the Australian politicians who have not done anything to you names?<br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Daddy!!:</div><div class="quote_body">ok then, who the bas.tards are John and Kevin ?</div></blockquote>So the fact remains is that you are actually making racist comments under the pretext of discussion. Let me reference it for you - take a look at what you said ( I bolded it for you) .<br><blockquote>Originally posted by Daddy!!:<br><br>i guess america is much more "mixed" in race and open while <strong>australia is dominated by whites and closed. </strong> what the hell, still talking along racial lines in politics NOW ??    Which country huh ?  i am shocked that with current exchange in information and education, such thoughts exist in english speaking commonwealth countries.  </blockquote>You should thank me for calling you a troll. If you seriously do not know who the prime minister of Australia is and went on sprouting nonsense - then you shamed the Singaporean education system. So take the trolling part in well regard that I don't think of you as a moron.</div>
