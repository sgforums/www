Much more so than a few years back. Its like everybody I see on the streets, 50% I would say are outsiders. You have got to be really dishonest to say you have not noticed them. And worst of all is that employers prefer hiring PRs due to the fact that they do not have to attend annual reservist. Furthermore, the rising inflation means skyrocketing prices are coming. It might not be much now but just imagine 10 years down the road. Who knows Singapore might still be Singapore then.<br><br>Add to that the irreversable effects of global warming and we have one major problem to deal with in the future. Rising temperatures &amp; sea levels, more deseases, a booming nation caused by lowering birth rates and thus higher taxes. Now, all those above doesn't sound ideal. I don't picture myself living in Singapore in the future. I just cannot imagine brining out my son or daughter in such a place! No way that is going to happen! As soon-to-be-parents, we are advised not to be selfish. Bring up your children in a better environment free from the selfish acts of human beings and their so-called modernisation activities! All those benefit no one in the long run! Yes, the rich gets richer but they all forgot one thing. Just like Yin &amp; Yang, there has to be a balance in this world. Once the balance is out, everything falls apart. Which is what is happening now. Remember, sometimes the best things in life really is for free.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

Of course its a waste of time, but what's done is done.....no point griping, move on and emigrate is what I always say...just throw that discharge letter away...afterall, if there are so many keen to imigrate to Sillypore from India and China, let their children form the future army....as long as its not your kids right?

This has been verified by the government when it keeps asking Singaporeans to go be global entrepreneurs. If you are a university graduate and yet want to be a sanitary specialist in Singapore, be my guest.<br>b)An untalented person may still be a qualified professional which is much wanted by another country.

May be I started life earlier, being older than some of you, may be my investment policy was right, I bought property instead of stock and shares, ..<br><br>and I definitely din't save up to migrate, thinking that it is brighter out there, to me, where I build where I want to be, my future is brighter because I work on it ....<br><br>I work hard, and my wife work with me as a family so we can pool our resources together to buy house, my parents was kind to let use live with them when we were tight on cash. We went on holidays only as extension of business trip, ....I came a long way to own a house for rent.<br><br>The rental we collected since 1998 was not even enough to pay for a fraction of the interest instalment, it is only since the beginning of this year that thing was turning for the better. Compared to rentals in other major cities such as HK, Tokyo, Seoul, Beijing, Shanghai, Mumbai, ... rentals in Singapore is still cheap, not to mention New York or London; in terms of return on investment, buying property for rent is still only slightly better than putting your money in FD. What is "high rentals"?  and who is demanding? If there is no demand in the market for rented properties, there would be no higher rental, the landlord don't and cannot demand.<br><br>The reality is this, more FT would come in if rentals were cheap, and if rentals are cheap, more FT would be able to accept cheaper salary, and kick out more locals. If you are screwed, you are screwed, whichever way you look at it.<br><br>and watch out, if anybody think they are screwed, they are probably screwing themselves.<br><br>I am on my side, I don't screw around.</div>
