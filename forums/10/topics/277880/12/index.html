So that makes the Malays the ethnic people who inhabit the geograpgical region that has the earliest historical connection - they are therefore indigenous aka native to the area. [b]Comprende?</strong><br><br>Hey if you want to criticise, fine with me . But fact is there- they are considered indigenous aka native to Singapore really by that definitional term. Are you laying claim for the Singaporean Chinese as the indigenous natives? Try Australia - they have ancient chinese burial grounds in broome too. See if you can argue your logic there.<br><br>As well for the Singapore's constitution, <strong>all races are equal in constitution</strong> as well. So ask yourself <strong>why are there HDB quotas for how many Singaporean chinese and how many Singaporean malays and Singaporean indians can be in allocated flats</strong>? If it is <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">absolute equality in truth</span></strong>, there should not be a quota allocated even not for the reason of making sure social integration happens.<br><br>And I can safely tell you - racism happens on the grassroots level, even in Singapore. In Singapore there are some blacksheep in the majority who thinks the other races are 'lower' than they are . Ever heard of people making fun of how some other person of a different ethnicity smells?  Heard of the expression "ah pu nei nei", "ki ling" and "mangali"? Yup pretty much heard people using it in Singapore. Those slangs are the equivalent of "chink" (chinese) and "wog" (greek,italians, arabs of darker complexions)  in Australia. Even in this forum , you have occasional idiots slinging mud on another race or people with a certain religion.<br><br>In Australia, asians don't make the majority so some Singaporean chinese think that it is all racist compared to their Singapore . Well look at it this way....racism happens everywhere to the minority groups whether one likes it or not because some pathetic loser human being decides that a different appearance should acquire some insults.<br><br>Oh wait...I am not supposed to know <span style="font-style: italic;">EVEN that much </span>about a country I left and the country I now adopted as my home.....HAHAHAHAHAH. Shall I bring up the history of the racial riots which still make some older Singaporeans of Chinese ethnicity bitter against the  Malays  and vice versa? After the riots, that was when the Singaporean pledge was penned down to support unity and equality. The Sedition Act just made some blacksheep individuals go underground with their racist attitudes in Singapore. If Singapore was truly equal in terms of the attitudes towards all ethnicities and all religion, you don't need the Sedition Act at all. <span style="font-style: italic;">Try harder with your insults ...after all ...we all studied the same state sanctioned history books in Singapore. How could I not know? </span><br>[/b]</blockquote>Hi, could you please provide me with evidence that Singapore pratice racial quotas when it comes to HDB flat allocation? I would really like to know more...<br><br>It is true that racism is everywhere in this world. But not a single race can be as racist as the White supremacists. Decades after hitler's death, his legacy still lives on in many white man dominated countries under different group names and variable beliefs about Racial purity and the White men's burden issue.<br>Are you based in Australia? Have u not heard of the Australian Nationalist Movement, pauline hanson and the occasion racial motivated crimes? As an Asian living in Australia, you will definetely at some point of time get racial abuse hurled at you. I have experienced a few myself.<br>I have stayed in Australia for prolonged periods and i've met plenty of wonderful and friendly caucasians. It's just those rednecks who always blame the colored immigrants for stealing their jobs, when they themselves are not efficient enough and therefore displaced. They like to tell us to "go back to your country", and they fail to realise that when immigrants come to Australia, we pay taxes, and generate additional supply and demand which all contribute to their economic growth.<br>You generalise Singaporean chinese as primarily racist. This is not true in general.  I have plenty of malay friends and i really enjoy hanging out with my malay buddies. I have also yet to see any racial motivated groups or crimes in Singapore.<br><br>Please do not portray the Australian government in such high regard when it comes to aborigines issues. Since day one, they have been voting against the UN's declaration for aboriginal rights along side with Canada and the US. The affirmative actions these countries offer their indigenous people are mostly to compensate them for the past mis-treatment and also to make themselves look good to the world.<br><br>Lastly, i would like to find out from you in what ways are our history textbook state sanctioned?<br><br>Please advise with evidence.<br></div>

HDB policies promote the mixing of households of different races and income groups in our estates. There are<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> racial quotas</span> to ensure a balanced mix of households of different ethnic groups in each HDB block. Each precinct is built with flats of different sizes so that households of different income and social profiles live together. Common spaces and shared facilities such as playgrounds and fitness corners facilitate interaction among neighbours. Residents participate in managing their own HDB estate through local Town Councils, CitizensÂ’ Consultative Committees or ResidentsÂ’ Committees</blockquote>HDB racial quota ^ there you go,  out of the government's mouth. Evidence presented<br><br>I did not generalise Singaporean Chinese as racist . Do not put words into my mouth. <strong>There is racism everywhere because of morons and racism is usually shown by the majority if you did not get my point in the first place .</strong> White supremacy tends to be over publicised since it happens in western countries with a caucasian majority and their media <span style="font-style: italic;">do love </span>sensationalism.<br><br>If you bring in Hitler and white supremacy being the all time bad boy,  well you might as well bring in Japan in the Japanese war where they massacred the chinese, the Chinese in the occupation of Tibet, the Israelis in the persecution of palestinians ( depending on which side you are), the African americans versus the Korean-american community in the Rodney King riots , the Australians versus the aborigines in colonial past ....Oh ...how about the bumiputra policy of Malaysia, the ethnic cleaning of chinese in Indonesia. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Each ethnicity have their own idiots who commit racist atrocities - who is anyone to say who is better or worst? Racism in any form commited by any one by any ethnicity is still racism.</span><br><br>As for going back to one's own country, I am pretty sure that there is a thread with "<span style="font-style: italic;">Chinese hooligans in Singapore</span>" lurking around this forum category. Foreigners are always discriminated everywhere - they are viewed as job snatchers. Australia is not the only place with idiots - there are obviously some in Singapore too!<br><br>Another point - equality cannot exists if there is affirmative action. It effectively disincludes another qualified applicant if they belong to another group of people. Even asians and caucasian applicants will get rejected by affirmative actions towards african americans or indigenous people of that land. So it is another nice form of discrimination in its own little way.<br><br>With Sedition Act and a fine police force - do you expect people to go rioting again like the racial riots of 1964 and 1969? However there are acts of some morons on the grassroots level which is like white racists on the grassroots level. For example ,in a few of the forum threads where they specifically insult an ethnic group. To deny it doesn't happen is making the matter worse.<br><br>I am not portraying the Australian Government in high regard. I am merely stating the facts of the matter. Each country have their problems -<strong> Singapore and Australia are not perfect</strong>.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Of course in Singapore , the Singaporean asian majority feels comfortable . Like in Australia, the caucasian majority feels comfortable. Go to a place where you are a minority group and you feel the effects of racism on you.  Go back to where you are part of a majority group , you won't see racism against you. That is why some Singaporeans feel more comfortable in Singapore and think racism does not exist - in the comfort of the majority group. Of course, some are frogs in the well , some are not. The frogs in the well tend to croak louder. </span><br><br>As for the last part, definition of sanction = "approved: established by authority; given authoritative approval"<br><br>http://nsinte1.moe.edu.sg/project/db/atl/db_puatl.nsf/AboutATL/Intranet%20About%20ATL?OpenDocument<br><blockquote>The Approved Textbook List (ATL) for Primary and Secondary schools has been drawn up primarily to assist principals, heads of departments, level heads and subject heads who have to select suitable texts for their students. The books in the list have been approved by the Ministry of Education for use in schools. Schools should use as basic texts only those books which have been listed here.</blockquote>Evidence ^ once again.<br><br>MOE approved textbooks = state sanctioned textbooks if you take the definitional term of sanctioning and apply it to authoritative approval. There you go. If it was not sanctioned - then the words will be " Schools may use as these books which have been listed here" <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-style: italic;">NOT </span></span></strong>" Schools<strong> should</strong> use as basic texts only those books which have been listed here."  That implies in itself there is no other choice but to  use the given approved textbooks.<br><br>Are you happy with the evidence cited now?<br><br>Anyways as a final word, you will be surprised that racism seldom exist when you have money ....elitism does .....when you have money, the world is color blind. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Facts of life.</div>
