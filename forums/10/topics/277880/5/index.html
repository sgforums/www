In Australia, like what u said when the Australian economy is not doing well, those local Australian will be prejudiced<br><br>against migrant who are most likely to be from the Asian region. In Spore, the local Chinese seemed to have heavy prejudiced against the PRC nationals who are of the same ancestral background. Not only that, some of the locals also have prejudiced against the those foreign professional for not serving NS.</div>

HK people smart, buy houses n when<br><br>want to migrate to other countries, they sold their flat n bought big houses in US or Canada. The local also started to learn like HK, buy HDB n later sold it when they planned to migrate to other developed countries. Anyway US is a nice place to live in, 50 states to choose from n to our liking.</div>

In Primary and Secondary school in Singapore, I heard racist comments about other ethnic races.  Face it - racism is everywhere- majority rules and my ethnicity aka chinese just happens to be the majority in Singapore . In Australia, it is the caucasians. I believe in respecting others as you want yourself to be respected. Your type of racism is related to whether the media wants to keep quiet or expose it . In the world, money just happens to overrule racism.<br><br>Pauline Hanson appeals to the rednecks, not the educated - only idiots will follow a woman who says "Please explain" when somebody ask her about xenophobia.<br><br>As for me, I don't really care. I got sponsorship from a state government in Australia to do further study and I competed fairly against all applicants. It is all about opportunity and skills. If it was about skin color , it would automatically go to a caucasian , not me.<br><br>You are one to talk when you don't live overseas at all. It is just like the frog in the well croaking.</div>

And hor, I believe not so long ago I have already shown you that Australian governmet collect more income tax than what they spend on your so call "free" health care and education...and not to forget that Australian are living on foreign debt and guess who is funding the borrowing? hard workers like you loh!!<br><br><span style="color: red;">HAHHAHAHA. If you would like to think so.  </span><br><br>If you cant tell me how much the govenment spend in paying the ministers, then why do you say they need to increase Singapore population to 6m to justify their salary?<br><br><span style="color: red;">Common sense. There is no natural resources in Singapore. I didn't say that they are justifying their salary. As far as I know, they do not need to justify - they just pay themselves . I am only saying it is a means to sustain their salary. Big Difference.</span><br><br>It doesnt matter if you are a nurse or a surgeon<br><br><span style="color: red;">As long as you have a skill in demand, does it really matter? Your point?</span><br><br>Of course lah, most Singaporeans are not so lucky...our parents cant afford to give us money to buy CBD apartment overseas...wah CBD leh...what is that? must be very expensive right? but hor Singaporeans are not as heavily taxed as australian lah and our mortgage loan is only 3 over %....I read from some journal that Australia crime rate is among the highest in developed countries. is this correct?<br><br><span style="color: red;"> Who say all of us have parents who gave us money to buy overseas apartments? My money was invested by my parents - still my money hor when it went into the apartment. Worked since 15...I am not so spoilt as some kids who just stretch out the hands and ask for pocket money.<br><br>Ya lor , some of us cannot act so rich by showing off the second Audi in Singapore or the 0.something percent of a property we "own" in whatever coast even though they say that Australia is so racist....why even bother investing then?<br><br>Don't act stupid and shame Singaporean education. CBD = central business district- even a secondary school kid knows it.  Yah not taxed as heavily in Singapore but what to say when the pay after tax in Australia is actually still two to three times more than Singapore's salary? </span><br></div></blockquote></div>

I recalled he just said that he went to Australia for a holiday and his stupid fiasco picking up some first class ticket stub to show everyone he went first class to Europe.<br><br>That is the trouble when people decide after a 2 week holiday without giving due consideration.<br><br>I stayed in Australia overseas for my degree after poly. Decided to go back to Singapore because evidently I thought it was home ,although my university offered me a scholarship to continue my studies.  Returned to Australia eventually after I got permanent residency - have not regretted since. I only regret listening to and actually believing in Singaporean propanganda about being a second class citizen in another country for that period of my life when I return to Singapore.</div>

Singaporeans are knowledgeable and well traveled enough to know that the reason you get them" free" is because you are paying taxes through your nose unless you are a beach bum living on welfare.<br><br>And just because your career didnÂ’t take off in Singapore that doesnÂ’t mean that Singapore is a lousy country. If you say its lousy, then why so many people are visting this tiny red dot?<br><br>And just because you are living in Australia that doesnÂ’t make you are more knowledgeable person. If you want to promote australia, please come out with something new lah...and not the usually free education welfare etc..we already know it is not free.<br><br></div>
