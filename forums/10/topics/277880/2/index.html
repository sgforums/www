Learn how to screw back the capitalist system and you are genuinely free of location.  You are forever screw.ed if you keep thinking you are screw.ed and doing nothing about it.<br><br>If you think the government screw you, do you attempt to screw back at the government?  (Yes/No)<br><br>If you think someone screw.ed you, will you try to screw him back ? (Yes/No)<br><br>The answer is no for both.

There are numerous hardships, difficulties and challenges, but for the sake of your family and your future, u might want to think of this path.</div></blockquote>Yup....I agree with you....I have had my share of hardship and culture shocks, but it sure is well worth teh effort...everyone knows how cushy a life we all have had in Sillypore and it makes one a better person by exploring the outside world.....you do not need to emigrate but just to work and live in another country for a few years makes you a better person....<br><br>I am enjoying the fruits of emigration.....Majulah my new country</div>

In every other vibrant city, you need money to enjoy it. I like cities, why not stay in a city i was born in, where my friends and family are and the jokes we share are priceless. Maybe as i grow older i may find city living less affordable and may choose to live in someplace more rural.</div>
