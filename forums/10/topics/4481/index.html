            <div class='col-md body'>yes, education is important today because of the evolution of professions or ways to carve out a living.<br><br>in the past, the reason our forefathers were able to do without much education and still attain wealth was because of mercantilism. trade and business did not require a specific education per se. observation, apprentiship and a reasonable amount of intelligence sufficed. even today, the engagement of mercantilism on a small scale does not require formal education. (think hawkers, retail traders etc.)<br><br>the advancement in various fields, i.e. finance, social sciences, medicine, science etc. require specific education in order to participate in them. even business or multi-national companies - a more advance version of mercantilism - requires formal education because of the complexities that global trading involves. being exposed to these fields means developing the competence to contribute to them. as raw mercantilism fades, intelligence alone will not account for much without specialised knowledge.<br><br>also life-enhancing knowledge like computer skills, advanced literacy and knowledge of global trends - all of which were not THAT important during our forefathers' time - require education.<br><br>cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Education is impt but not that impt. But bcos of how the education system works and the craze of a piece of paper, education is made much more impt than it really is.<br><br>If u are in knowledge based jobs, education will be more impt than in other fields.<br><br>Anyway whether a person will carve out a career depends not only on education, many other qualities are needed. Certificates are going to very impt if u intended to work in the civil sector cos somehow the govt places more emphasis on the paper rather than the ability of the person. My tutors have been advising me to take scholarships cos my future will be safeguarded as i will be guaranteed a job on return and even if i turn to be a flop, at least i still got a job. But i still decided not to take a scholarship.<br><br>If u are confident of ur own ability, try to start ur own business urself  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> dun place so much emphasis on education aspect alone, there are many other factors.

            <div class='col-md body'>All in all, I think that as time goes on, we see the automation of all the more common and repetitive tasks. The value of humans in such areas is lowered drastically as inventions (including computers and processes) can do the work more efficiently. Human resources become necessary only for the "frontlines", where the changes are occuring.<br><br>I would like to raise an issue at this point. As we know, higher education is still a luxury in many societies, and what happens most of the time is the need to provide the uneducated masses with a job keeps wages low, and stunts technological improvment in the progress. There has been no move to make educators rich, specifically, but I have the feeling that societies can jumpstart themselves out of the cycle if academics and economics can somehow be welded more tightly. It is somehow related to the "copy problem", how information is the root cause of progress because it does not obey conservation laws, but yet stunting progress by putting restrictions on duplication is the only way to make people innovate.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Knowledge is power.  Our government has stressed to us on many occasions that our economy is knowledge-based.  But how do you learn and gather knowledge except through education?  I agree with Chief that the important thing is whether our education system is effective.  An education system that only emphasise on academic results will only produce a bunch of nerds.  In fact, our government has been studying (again?!) other countries' education system and try to incorporate the nurturing of creative and independent thinking into our education system.  However, I have left school for too long to notice the changes.<br><br>---------------------------------------------<br>I didn't know that Chief is the Sex God<br><br>[This message has been edited by Ivan (edited 24 April 2000).]</div>

Also, education only encourages braindrain, so it may hurt the country more because its money invested is wasted! Over-education also causes job certification problems where jobs are taken up by people with better and better qualifications, not because it is required by the job, but because so many educated are unemployed and they settle for lower and lower jobs... Talk about spoiling the market - you have to study like hell just to take a menial job...<br><br>And with regards to the main question in this topic, I agree that education is important because our economy has changed. And with typical Singaporean kiasu-ness, even becoming an artist or drama actor, u need paper qualifications!! (well, looks like everybody else has stated that - no-brainer ~ <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> )<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yups, education is impt but wat sort of education and how we acquire it is another qn! Education in Singapore is IMPT bcos our society is based on "paper-qualification" here! Yes, thru education, we acquire knowledge but is it only thru education that we can acquire knowledge? How about experience?<br><br>I rem that back in Perth, I learn Science by going out to the fields and forest to seek for the little insects or plants but here in Singapore, my friends learn Science thru books! Both ways can acquire knowledge but has the Singapore education system failed us? Such that we only wanna gain education thru books? Is that IMPT? How about the FUN of learning and also the experience of going thru it? *PONDERS*<br><br>------------------<br>=================================<br>Do Pixies like a rainy day?<br>A-piping through the dell?<br>The Pixies must enjoy the rain;<br>Thats when they weave their spell.<br>Rain drops, rain drops<br>Play a Pixie-tune<br>=================================</div>
