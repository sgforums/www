              <p>yesh.....these extremists have many times over forgotten that it is forbidden for a muslim to transgress and hurt others......</p>
              <p>well the world is full of uncertainty anyways....wot if these extremists aren't really "muslims" they are just using islam as a veil to cover their true identity which is a world wide reorganisation organisation..........hmmmmm.........</p>
              <p>to a certain extent i do see the truth in certain reasons regarding the twin tower incident.......like how it would cost more to modernise the twin tower rather than demolishing it and building a new one........etc.....hmmm.....</p>

              <p>anyway the topic is straying. i dun intend this to be a
              religious debate:</p>
              <p>i wanted to discuss the issue of eating together. of gelling
              together as one people of singapore.</p>
              <p>and my original proposition was: wat's wrong with allowing halal
              food canteens, if it allows all of us to sit together?</p>
              <p>thats was all</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>you still don't get it do you.... by having halal food canteens, you are imposing your values on a set of people who do not subscribe to your values... you are taking away the option for people to choose....</p>
              <p>let's say i impose a rule that all our muslim brothers and sisters have to sit together with their chinese and indian bethren while eating in a non-halal setting, wouldn't you similarly make noise?</p>

              <p>TS is doing the same thing when he quote old text form bible to support him, but keep quite (or maybe donno) other text that dont support him.</p>

              <p>These days, pigs no longer eat shit and swill. They eat grains and kept very clean and nothing like those stinking dirty animals you see in the past.</p>

              <p>I duno, they seem to avoid any place that sell alcohol like a plague. It is
              worse that pork. Doesn’t really matter, just narrow down the selection.</p>
              <p>But back to the topic of this thread, I find that there is no need to fix
              what that isn’t broken, esp. one not even requested or asked. But then again,
              it is no different from the banning of chewing gum. Enforcing ones believes at
              the cost of non believers’ freedom and right doesn’t justify anything religious but rather more of a dictatorship. People do all sort of funny things, selfish or
              self impose wish in the name or religion. I wonder why is he a principle in the 1st place. I wouldnt allow my kids to study there even if they pay me for it.</p>

              <p>In Singapore we must balance mutual respect and tolerance of the practices of different people so that people can co-exist peacefully, this I agree, but this must again be balance with the integration of all sections of our society into the mainstream. Apartheid is not desirable. Although that is inherent in some cultures. Effort must be made to draw them away from exclusionism into intergation, for peaceful coexistence.</p>

              <p>Other people may like long beard. As long as it is not impose on everyone, that is okay with me. Sikh people keep long hair. Han people's traditional practice was to keep long hair also. This practice was lost under the manchu Qing regime who wanted to destroy the chinese identity so as to subjugate the chinese realm.</p>

              <p>The book of Leviticus is from the Old Testament, the Jewish Torah. The Jews too do not take pork and also non-kosher (non-halal) food.</p>

              <p><em>And He said, " Are you also still without understanding? Do you not see that whatever goes into the mouth passes into the stomach, and so passess on? But what comes out of the mouth proceeds from the heart, and this defiles  a man. For out of the heart comes evil thoughts, murder, adultery, fornication, theft, false witness, slander. These are what defile a man; but to eat with unwashed hands does not defile a man."</em></p>

              Those bloggers who suggested boycotting all Halal eating outlets are just as idiotic as the principal! Luckily we only have just those few idiots.
