              <p>You may be fine with eating halal food or paying more for halal food. Others may not.</p>
              <p>Let's say if a significant minority of Singaporeans become vegetarian, and are afraid of cross-contamination with meat as well as cannot tolerate the smell of meat, should we then ban meat?</p>
              <p>I also fail to see how discussing an issue is divisive, unless your opinion is all differences in opinion are, by definition, divisive.</p>

              <p>good for you, a lot of people won't .... it's not really the issue of eating pork, I won't die if  I  don't eat pork (hmmm ... maybe ...) .... but I feel that the accomodation has to be both ways ... what is wrong with sitting down together as a group and you eat what you will, I eat what I like ? ... it's often not the case ... as if even sharing a table with pork eaters will defile them .... it creates a sort of us-vs-them atmosphere you know ...</p>
              <p>the funny thing is, many of my muslim friends of other extractions overseas, pakistanis and arabs for example, have no qualms about their choice of eating venues and diets at all, they'd happily eat at any resturants or fastfood joints with you, so long as they themselves don't eat pork, they don't mind me scuffling down a rack of ribs at the same table, at the same resturant ....</p>

              <p>Hi,<br><br>I think its immaterial to argue about eating beef and whether it is seasonal or not.<br><br>I'm a non-muslim and i know that my religion does not allow me to eat beef.<br><br>But it is not that strict. We can still eat at the same food courts as people who eat beef.<br><br>However, the Muslims cant as they are much stricter with rgds to this laws. That is why i agree with the author. I don;t see the harm of doing away with certain items that are not halal. Which is more important to u? Friendship or your plate of charsiew?</p>

              <p>Friendship or charsiew? That is such a simplistic view of the issue.<br><br>To begin with, that's "friendship with conditions". The condition being, I can't eat pork, so you aren't allowed to as well.<br><br>I'm all for religious freedom, but freedom cuts both ways. Just as you are allowed to practice what you believe in, I should be allowed to live as I deem fit too, as long as it doesn't infringe on someone else's rights.<br><br>The simple example of Burger King's Turkey bacon is a great example of infringing on someone's rights.<br><br>I don't believe any one religious group or another should have that right to impose their religious restrictions on everyone else like that.<br><br>Some people are vegetarian. Does that mean all meat products should be replaced with vegi substitues?</p>

              <p>I believe Muslims are also allowed to eat in the same food court as people who eat pork.<br><br>How is that different from not eating beef in a foodcourt that serves beef?<br><br>Let me be clear now, I am 100% against boycotting Halal foodcourts. I'm not even against Islam in any way or form.<br><br>I just do not see why if other religious groups can be, and has to be, tolerant and not impose their beef/all meat products/etc restrictions on everyone else, the Muslim religion is allowed to impose their restrictions on the rest of us like this.</p>
