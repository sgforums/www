              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>They Died for Lack of a Head Scarf</strong></span></p>
              <p><span>By Mona Eltahawy<br> <br> Tuesday, March 19, 2002; Page A21 </span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The fire was a tragedy that could have struck anywhere. Fifteen
              girls between ages 13 and 17 were trampled to death and 52 others were
              hurt when a blaze swept through their school.</p>
              <p>Parents and
              journalists angrily demanded the resignation of education officials
              they accused of incompetence and corruption. There was plenty to be
              angry about. Some 800 schoolgirls were crammed into a building designed
              for only 250. The main gate to the school was locked. There were no
              emergency exits, no fire alarms and no fire extinguishers in the
              building.</p>
              <p>But another far more sinister detail in this particular tragedy shows that it could not have happened anywhere but Saudi Arabia.</p>
              <p>Firefighters
              told the Saudi press that morality police forced girls to stay inside
              the burning building because they were not wearing the head scarves and
              black cloaks known as abayas that women must wear in public in that
              kingdom. One Saudi paper said the morality police stopped men who tried
              to help the girls escape the building, saying, "It is sinful to
              approach them."</p>
              <p>Girls died because zealots at the gate would rather see them burn than appear in public dressed inappropriately.</p>
              <p>Who
              are these men who would choose a scarf and an abaya over a girl's life?
              The morality police, or mutawwai'in as they are known in Arabic, are
              officers of the Kafkaesque-sounding Committee for the Promotion of
              Virtue and the Prevention of Vice. The State Department describes the
              committee in its annual human rights report as a "semiautonomous agency
              that enforces adherence to Islamic norms by monitoring public behavior."</p>
              <p>What
              kind of virtue is it to allow girls to die in a fire because of what
              they were not wearing? Whose Islam is it that allows these men to
              dilute the faith I and millions of others cherish for its teachings of
              compassion and justice to nothing more than a dress code and sexual
              segregation? I grew up learning God is merciful and that faith was
              based on choice -- you could not force actions on anyone in the name of
              religion.</p>
              <p>For anyone who has not been to Saudi Arabia, the best
              way to describe the mutawwai'in is as the godfathers of the Taliban. It
              is the ideology of the mutawwai'in -- based on the puritanical Wahabi
              school of Islam prevalent in Saudi Arabia -- that gave birth to the
              Taliban and the misery they unleashed on the people of Afghanistan.</p>
              <p>The
              only difference is that the Taliban ran a lawless country for a few
              years until the military might of the United States brought its rule to
              an end as punishment for its support of a terrorist network.</p>
              <p>Where
              are the international outcries over the mutawwai'in's treatment of
              women in Saudi Arabia? Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International
              have both demanded investigations into the mutawwai'in's reported
              hampering of rescue efforts. But many reports published by both
              watchdogs, as well as those issued annually by the State Department
              that highlight the fear and intimidation that surround the mutawwai'in,
              have fallen on deaf ears in the past.</p>
              <p>The mutawwai'in have the
              power to detain for up to 24 hours anyone they believe has committed a
              "crime of vice." When I lived in Saudi Arabia for six years as a
              teenager, I watched with dismay as they distilled the teachings of
              Islam into rudimentary lessons in terrorizing a populace.</p>
              <p>One day, in a mall, I didn't see the morality police coming. I usually pulled on a scarf when I saw them approach.</p>
              <p>"Why
              isn't your daughter covered properly?" the mutawwa asked. "Don't you
              know that it is your duty as a Muslim father to make sure your daughter
              is properly covered?"</p>
              <p>"My daughter is an adult and you know you
              cannot force your adult children to do anything," my father bravely
              replied. "You can only advise."</p>
              <p>Angered by my father's attempt to
              debate him, the mutawwa turned to look at my brother who at the time
              wore a popular short-back-and-sides haircut. "And why does your son cut
              his hair like the infidels?" the mutawwa shot back.</p>
              <p>From this
              point on the conversation descended into a surreal battle of wills that
              ended with the mutawwa ordering the policemen around him to take my
              father and brother into custody. One of the policemen talked him out of
              it.</p>
              <p>To its credit, the Saudi press has roundly condemned the
              mutawwai'in in the aftermath of the fire. Such public criticism of the
              morality police was previously unheard of.</p>
              <p>Crown Prince Abdullah
              has vowed to bring to justice anyone found responsible for the fire. In
              the kingdom, the prince has a reputation for honesty and fairness. That
              reputation can only be enhanced if his calls for justice extend to the
              feared mutawwai'in. Bringing to justice anyone who obstructs rescue
              efforts is the true virtue.</p>

              <p>Can the air we breathe contaminate halal food?</p>
              <p>In other words, there is no sure way to ascertain that the food is halal. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/ccmathteam.com/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"></p>
