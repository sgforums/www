              <p>when u eat non-halal food, by right muslims are not allowed to sit at the same table.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>do refer to the link above. this is due to concerns over cross contamination and the smell of pork.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>that is why i bring up the question. which is more important to you, eating pork, and being able to sit with ur muslim friends.</p>

              <p>seriously, pork is more important...</p>
              <p>but if my friends have serious objections to it, then probably i can avoid pork while with them...</p>

              <p>Well I think having a choice is important.</p>
              <p>In a place which has halal and non-halal food, I can choose to eat halal food with my muslim friends.</p>
              <p>If non-halal food is banned, that choice is taken away from me.</p>
              <p>I do think it's understandable why people want to boycott halal only restaurants. They are afraid that their ability to choose non-halal food will be taken away from them.</p>

              <p>it's the lack of choice.... as you say, there is give and take among friends...</p>
              <p>but when u take away the choice, then it is basically forcing the other party's point of view upon yourself.... and nobody likes that... hence, the uproar...</p>

              <p>I thought the issue here is that our Muslim friends DO have objections due to the possibility of cross contamination and smell. So there is a problem sharing a table with them if we are eating pork.</p>
              <p>But anyway, saying that Muslims have to objections to us eating non-Halal food in front of them, and saying that out of consideration we don't eat non-Halal food in front of them, is contradictory. Eating non-Halal food in front of a Muslim becomes a consideration only because there are objections.</p>
              <p>What so bad about having just Halal food in the canteen is that it takes away choice. It takes the values of one community of people and imposes it on another.</p>
