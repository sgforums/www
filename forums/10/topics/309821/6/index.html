              <p>That is nonsense. Who are you to say that muslims cannot sit on the same table with their friends when they are eating non halal food? The smell of pork causes contamination? If thats the case are you suggesting that muslims cannot work in the wet market as well? Or should I take your logic further and say that muslima shld not stay at areas located near to wet market or non hala eateries?</p>

              <p><br>the quran followed the jewish's torah.. which disallow eating shellfish and pork as there were no refrigeration concept then and chance of food poisoning is extremely high. just like the ostracization of the lepers, to prevent infection to others.</p>

              <h1 style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 6px;">NIGERIA: RESCUE OF GIRLS IGNITES ISLAMIC RAMPAGE</h1>
              <h3 style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 6px;">Six churches gutted after recovery of Christians teenagers from Muslim kidnappers.</h3>
              <p><strong>NINGI, Nigeria, May 19 </strong>(Compass Direct News) –
              Islamists under the auspices of a paramilitary force last week
              destroyed six churches to protest a police rescue of two teenage
              Christian girls kidnapped by Muslims in this Bauchi state town. Police
              recovered the two Christian girls, Mary Chikwodi Okoye, 15, and Uche
              Edward, 14, on May 12 after Muslims in Ningi kidnapped them three weeks
              ago in an attempt to expand Islam by marrying them to Muslim men.
              Police took the two girls, who had been under foster care, to safety in
              southeastern Nigeria where their biological parents live. The
              kidnappers had taken the girls to Wudil town in Kano state. Following
              the rescue of the girls, Muslims under the Hisbah Command, a
              paramilitary arm of Kano state’s Sharia Commission, went on a rampage
              on Tuesday (May 13), attacking Christians and setting fire to the
              churches. Joseph Abdu, pastor of the Deeper Life church, told Compass
              that damages to his church property amounted to about 13 million naira
              (US$112,857) – and that his congregation had shrunk to 40 people from
              the 130 who attended before the attack. Muslims have kidnapped at least
              13 Christian girls in the town, Christian sources said.</p>

              <p>To the TS,</p>
              <p>There are many many things that divide people in this world.</p>
              <p>Example1, religions.</p>
              <p>There are some from one religion who would not or could not be allowed to marry someone of another religion.</p>
              <p>I cannot say this is bad or good. Just saying the facts.</p>
              <p>Example2, race.</p>
              <p>Due to racial practise, people are generally only allowed to marry someone from the same race.</p>
              <p>Example3, culture.</p>
              <p>Some parents from one culture forbid their son's / daughters from marrying or marrying to people from other culture.</p>
              <p>Example4, class/social status.</p>
              <p>self-explanatory.</p>
              <p>so no need be so shocked. there are many things that divide the society.</p>

              <p>Before we sling more mud, so rem, the more you sling, the more your own hands get dirty also.</p>
              <p>bottomline, we are a multi-racial country and I am proud of that.</p>
              <p>The fact that I can eat with my malay friends, and they don't mind me eating what I enjoy, speak volumes. In addition, I only use the utensils from the halal store to eat halal food. if I were to eat something else, I use another set of utensils.</p>
              <p>Why so much effort? Just simple common sense and respect.</p>
              <p>I believe what the principal did was out of line and it was corrected. So let's put a full stop there.</p>
              <p>Given how tense the situation is, I believe most mature people will know how to look at the bigger picture.</p>
              <p>TS, I believe you do have your points too, but since we are in this society, let's just be sensitive to people's needs.  Trust me, you won't lose an arm or leg. In turn, you may get to enjoy some great food and company.</p>

              <p>Personally I don't mind having halal food in school. It is still food.</p>
              <p>If I want pork, I can always go outside the canteen and eat in other eatery or non-halal food outlet elsewhere.</p>
              <p>I think, if we want others to be sensitive to our beliefs, we should first be sensitive to other people's beliefs.</p>

              <p>Perhaps you can find it in the hadiths.</p>
              <p>You should ask your fellow muslims where they get the notion that they can't touch pork and how pork can contaminate other food when it is put in the fridge.</p>
              <p>Can the air we breathe contaminate halal food?</p>
              <p>In other words, there is no sure way to ascertain that the food is halal. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/ccmathteam.com/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"></p>

              <p>That's misleading. Since muslims divide the people as muslims and infidels, the infedels are still much greater in number.</p>
