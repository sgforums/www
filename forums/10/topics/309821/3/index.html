              <p>Friendship or charsiew? That is such a simplistic view of the issue.<br><br>To begin with, that's "friendship with conditions".

              <p>I believe Muslims are also allowed to eat in the same food court as people who eat pork.<br><br>How is that different from not eating beef in a foodcourt that serves beef?<br><br>Let me be clear now, I am 100% against boycotting Halal foodcourts.
