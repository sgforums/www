              <p>why Muslims dun eat pork?</p>
              <p>Firstly, Allah has forbidden us from eating <strong style="color: black; background-color: #99ff99;">pork</strong>. Why? Because the pig is an animal that is disgusting and dirty. <strong style="color: black; background-color: #99ff99;">Pork</strong> is the root cause of numerous illnesses. The JE virus that had spread in our neighbouring countries started from two bacteria that had been mixed in the body of a pig. These bacteria had then become a germ that is dangerous to the human body. The bird flu virus in Hongkong also originated from the pig. Allah has warned us about the pig. And Allah has warned us about eating the meat of a pig. Clearly Allah forbids us from eating <strong style="color: black; background-color: #99ff99;">pork</strong> because He loves us. He made it haram for us because He knows it is bad for us.</p>

              <p>right on deino. sometimes it boils down to individual logic and
              common sense. hence, there've been many cases whereby we muslims
              find ourselves in a predicament on whether it is right or wrong.
              the term "was-was" applies. so if you are "was-was" or in simple
              translation "wary" about the food, in this example, then you
              shouldn't be eating it.</p>

              <p>yeah...i think the problem with some or many muslims out there is that they aren't living through the times i guess......</p>
              <p>they have forgotten about science.....if i'm not wrong muhammad did say something about reading which did prove been the caused of the golden age for islam during the dark times for europe at that point.....hmmmm.....</p>
              <p>if i'm not wrong too, being too was-was is also forbidden.....</p>

              <p><br>Bible also got say nothing created by God can be said dirty.  Bible got say many things.</p>
              <p>You know how JI can go and kill people?  They listen to other people who only read one or two line from Koran that help them support what they want to do and forget all the other part that go against what they want.</p>
              <p>Which religion got tell you to go and kill?  Got tell you to go out and make other people do what you think right.  If they dont listen, you must force?  If really got such religion you better check if started by God or the OTHER guy.</p>
