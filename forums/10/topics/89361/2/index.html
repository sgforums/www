Please don't allow yourself the pleasure to elevate yourself to be some holy person who says "I forgive you".<br><br>As for your comments about me being young, well all i can say is judging from what u've said so far, maturity may not necessary come with age. Bringing age into question seems to indicate that you feel that wisdom comes with getting older. Well other than getting ppl to give up seats to u, i guess there could be a few other perks. Hm...have u tot of getting the Senior Citizen concession card? At least it shows that the govt still remembers oldies like u.<br><br>As for me commenting on your upbringing, i guess it's the same old notion that the truth always hurts. Did i hurt a raw nerve? Do i need to seek your forgiveness? Hm...i don't think so. It's alright to be foolish, but it's not alright to be in denial.</div>
