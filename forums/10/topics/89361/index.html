Elegant and refined, he will make an excellent premier in the future.</div>

We are all entitled the same way... not any little, not any more...<br><br>I sure hope whatever you've been saying here has been very healthy suggestions to the government, then why don't you explore on the possibility of flaunting your talents at GRCs. Don't do it here....<br><br>Wonder why you're going into every post to comment whats being said... Was it anything about you? Or was my so-called COCK up your arse that you'll be so disturbed?<br><br>Whatever happened to upbringing, if your was good, wouldn't your folks have taught you never to say things bad about another... or was your lacking too? my empathy...<br><br></div>
