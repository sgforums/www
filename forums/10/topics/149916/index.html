What happen to them. they need to travel in out everyday.They cost of the bridge is going to go up tremendously. who is gonna cover that? are the port authority subside us as they reap lots of profit from it? NO...<br><br>Imagine the high bridges, those pity walker gonna climb the bridge like a hill.<br><br>What about then the causeway was dismantle?<br>How are they going to go through by tuas???? Imagine the bus and lorry going motocycle and car through at tuas... i takes 4 times the times and there is no MRT at TUAS, no proper bus station and bus stop there???? Somemore imagine the 2 little lane at tuas... the Jam will be 5 to 6 times the time.<br><br>What is the purpose to build a new bridge without solving the JAM problem? Its already 6 lane at causeway. Are they gonna build a 8 laner Bridge?<br><br>Who suffer and who reap profits?<br>Is it justificable?<br><br>Things are already good there why destroy it? SOlving the Jam problem is by building a more bigger custom complex at JB and expand the Police check at spore and double the amount of Immigration booth.<br><br>If the bridge is not mean for big big ship what is the purpose to build it? Why waste so much $$$ for some small boat to crossover as the strait is shallow?<br>I have driven from Taman Perling to the opposite of Tuas and it took 20 minutes of distance. And i also stuck before on the 2nd bridge for 1 hours after paying 4 times the cost of causeway. Another 20 minutes are need to travel from JB donwtown to Taman Perling. Is it worth? spend so many times, so many petrol and still stuck in the Jam(only 2 lane each side with few custom booth).<br><br>PTP(JB Port) is belong to a Arab merchant who got lots of project from m'sia government.<br>Is it justtificable to make him richer with the cost of both spore and malaysian government $$$ and also burden the citizen?<br>He susgested the idea, so i think PTP shall pay and bear the cost right?<br><br>The fees wont be the same same at RM2.4 and S$1.2 with the excess paid by that PTP for each motorist travel in and out. The new cost will be some 4 to 5 times higher as the second link which was build years back is already so expensive and almost 3x the toll charges.<br><br>What about pollution, oil spill?<br><br>Are any of the CENTRAL and FEDERAL ppl think of that? Economics are already not doing good yet they wanna burden the ppl. Do they think of their poor Johorean where hundred of thousand of ppl travel in and out everyday. The causeway is the median to their rice bowl. And thousand of sporean who were dispatch to work in Johor for those factory and offices?<br><br>Let both side minister travel at working hours like 5am to 9am and 5pm to 8pm. Let them stuck in the traffics of motorcycles, busses, walking ppl, lorries, cars and also custom.<br><br>And it also proposed an open up bridge for ships to go through.
