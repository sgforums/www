              <p>When I was young I used to think that it was good to be a singaporean. We are protected from natural disasters, we have a efficient police force and low crime rates in singapore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But after reading all those posts by lackeys and dogs of the PAP, I really pity Singaporeans.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1. Dogs of PAP say that Singaporeans are pampered and spolit, foreigners are willing to take hardship.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Can you imagine Singapore guys serve 2 years ns, get called every year to go back to reservaist while foreigners never do anything for our country and we are called pampered and spoilt?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is no wonder so many singaporeans want to chao keng in ns. They serve ns to protect our country and they are being labelled as pampered and spolit.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And for those dogs of the PAP, since you like the foreigners so much, when there is a war, go and ask your foreigners to protect you than.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. Dogs of the PAP blame Singaporeans for demanding a higher salary than foreigners.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>First your corrupted PAP raise all prices in singapore to finance their corruption. So with rising prices and we have to supprot our wife, kids, parents and pay for our housing loan so we now request for a higher salary.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So whose fault is it? Yes it is the fault of your corrupted PAP party who raise prices who forces us singaporeans to demand for more salary while the foreigners that you dogs of the PAP like so much can demand for a lower salary because they are just here to work for a few years to save enough money so they can go back to their country</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3. Dogs of the PAP says that their master have done a good job in developing our country from nothing to become a prosperous country.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Don't always tell me about what the PAP have done in the past. I want to know what the PAP can do for us in the future. Yes I want to know my future not the past.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And the only thing the PAP can do for us in the future is to raise prices to finance their own corruption.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We don't need such a corrupted PAP goverment.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>4. Dogs of the PAP says that other than the PAP nobody else is capable of ruling Singapore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>By saying that, you have just insulted all Singaporeans. We have enough smart Singaporeans to be able to form a new government once the corrupted PAP is overthrowed.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>5. Dogs of the PAP ask us to migrate if we are not happy staying in Singapore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We don't need you to tell us that. There are alot of Singaporeans migrating already. There are alot of places in the world which are much better than Singapore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>By the way, do you know that your master who is the corrupted PAP leaders whom you like so much wants Singaporeans to stay and not to migrate?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In yesterday news, Goh Chok Tong says that too many Singaporeans are migrating and they have to think fo ways to make Singaporeans stay.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You dogs of the PAP got the guts to ask Singaporeans to migrate. You must learn to eb an obedient dog and listen to everything that your master says ok.</p>

              <p>1. Dogs of PAP say that Singaporeans are pampered and spolit, foreigners are willing to take hardship.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Can you imagine Singapore guys serve 2 years ns, get called every year to go back to reservaist while foreigners never do anything for our country and we are called pampered and spoilt?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is no wonder so many singaporeans want to chao keng in ns. They serve ns to protect our country and they are being labelled as pampered and spolit.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And for those dogs of the PAP, since you like the foreigners so much, when there is a war, go and ask your foreigners to protect you than.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. Dogs of the PAP blame Singaporeans for demanding a higher salary than foreigners.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>First your corrupted PAP raise all prices in singapore to finance their corruption. So with rising prices and we have to supprot our wife, kids, parents and pay for our housing loan so we now request for a higher salary.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So whose fault is it? Yes it is the fault of your corrupted PAP party who raise prices who forces us singaporeans to demand for more salary while the foreigners that you dogs of the PAP like so much can demand for a lower salary because they are just here to work for a few years to save enough money so they can go back to their country</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3. Dogs of the PAP says that their master have done a good job in developing our country from nothing to become a prosperous country.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Don't always tell me about what the PAP have done in the past. I want to know what the PAP can do for us in the future. Yes I want to know my future not the past.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And the only thing the PAP can do for us in the future is to raise prices to finance their own corruption.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We don't need such a corrupted PAP goverment.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>4. Dogs of the PAP says that other than the PAP nobody else is capable of ruling Singapore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>By saying that, you have just insulted all Singaporeans. We have enough smart Singaporeans to be able to form a new government once the corrupted PAP is overthrowed.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>5. Dogs of the PAP ask us to migrate if we are not happy staying in Singapore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We don't need you to tell us that. There are alot of Singaporeans migrating already. There are alot of places in the world which are much better than Singapore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>By the way, do you know that your master who is the corrupted PAP leaders whom you like so much wants Singaporeans to stay and not to migrate?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In yesterday news, Goh Chok Tong says that too many Singaporeans are migrating and they have to think fo ways to make Singaporeans stay.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You dogs of the PAP got the guts to ask Singaporeans to migrate. You must learn to eb an obedient dog and listen to everything that your master says ok.</p>
