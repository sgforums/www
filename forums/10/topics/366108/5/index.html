              <p><br>10K a month. You can invest half of the money and be even richer. You don't need to think much about CPF at all.</p>

              <p><br>Of course you're right.  But then who complains about too much money?  On the other hand, many people who earns 10k a month lives 15k a month lifestyle.  At the end of the day, they are still in debt.  Many Singaporeans under 40 these days are living beyond their means.  If not for CPF, they can't even afford roof over their heads.  But then they forgot, CPF is meant for old age and medical bills.  Everyone will be old one day and everyone will be sick one day.  Unless you get run over by a bus before then but that's a different story.  The government realise this but we are in too deep to reverse so they are not doing anything drastic.  In 20 years time, there will be many people trying to dump their HDB to cash out.  Who do you think is going to buy those flats?  Today's kids?  HDB?  Be prepared for more foreigners coming in.</p>
              <p>10k a month is nice if one is prudent.  It can be a liability if one is spends foolishly.</p>

              <p><br>You're on the right track.  Properties, shares, FD, unit trusts, .....  Investing = saving.  Just have to be disciplined and not greedy.  There is no easy money.  Work hard, be prudent, save and be patient.  There is no short cuts.  Buy toto regularly, that may help.</p>

              <p>I beg to differ.  I believe Singapore will be worse off if we close our door to foreigners.  Foreign labour allows many Singaporeans to be freed up to take up higher value added jobs.  Of course in time of economic recession, there is a disconnection because people lose their jobs and starts blaming the foreigners.  Foreigners lose their jobs too.  Many are just sent home.  Their complaints will not be heard.  US which is the biggest destination for migrants, economic and otherwise, also suffers fallout from the current recession.  They may be tighter now on their migrant intake for a while but I'm sure when the economy improves they will continue to welcome migrants.  They know the value of migrants.  The benefited immensely from contribution of migrants.  Singapore is different because of it's limited space but it can still benefit from contribution of foreigners if managed wisely.</p>
              <p>FYI, many factories in Koreas are using workers from the Philippines, China and South Asian countries.  You don't see these foreigners if you only move around in Seoul.  Taiwan is also a big destination for Filipino domestic maids.  These countries knows the benefit of using foreign labour for low value added jobs to remain competitive.</p>

              <p>I am not saying Foreigner workers are not good, I also employ foreign maids and workers, yes it does help our economy, i am suggesting that the govt should look for inward as there are about 20% of lower educated singaporeans still needed to find a job with a sustainable salary but it is difficult due to the growing cheap labour, and to those with U degree, they hv to face the FT.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>At the end of the day, the govt must then question themselves why there is a slow down in birthrates.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I visited the hyundai plants in korea and mitsui electronic plant in Japan, when there is many jobs, yes, foreigners are welcome, but not so many, and when jobs is less, foreigners is first to go, their contract of services is not as wonderful as ours, there is not limit of 2 work permits, and they are not allow to roam anyhow, discipline is one of the strict factor in controlling their foreigners, and when the Koreans and taiwaness goes on strike, the foreigners better be gone. For you info, hyundai got no foreigners at all, one foreigner in only, the whole industry goes on strike.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Perhaps you should know that i am part taiwanese, the pinoy maids are only second rate in compare to local nanny maids, it is because they cannot get local taiwanese nannies, they had no choice but go for pinoys. I was brought up by taiwan maid from Alishan.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I add on to say that perhaps, these east developed countries had sufficient citizens to take over the jobs whereas we are getting lesser, their political background is totally different from us, unions and labour can anytime rules the country by wining votes, and if the have a policy of 1 local and 3 foreigners in their country, the street will be protest and down goes the govt.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Dependency on foreigners is good, but over dependency can be dangerous as singapore is already at the expense of MNC and later if at the expense of foreigner workers, local singaporeans will be gone.</p>

              <p>The key words to the debate on FT is "Foreign labour allows many Singaporeans to be freed up to take up higher value added jobs." not to take the jobs from our polygrad, fresh U grad, and even the ITE grads.</p>
              <p>The point to angel's message, which I agree wholeheartedly, is that "you need to balance the social and economy as a whole, swaying oneside toward economy growth while forsaking social entity can be diseaster. " you can't compare US's immigration policy without considering the safety net that its government are providing to its people.</p>
              <p>A country cannot be run like a corporation, with its leaders compared to CEO, and citizens like employees. In this modern era, employees are useful to the company only for what they can contribute, at the cheapest costs, or the company would bring in cheaper staff, or move to cheaper areas. It is difficult to tell the employee to be loyal to the company, or the country and get pay cut for the company's survival, while the CEO, the leaders write their own pay cheque and bonus, regardless of how the employees are feeling.</p>
              <p>"the society is shaped by it ruler," more so in Singapore than in any other country, because of our diversity in races and religion. angel does have some quotable quotes, I guess when she thinks with her skirt on.</p>

              <p><br> there are 1.5 million local singaporeans at the workforce
              from the 90s 1.8 million, and the foreigners including the PR had
              increased from 500,000 to 1.2 million, heavy industries previously
              allow to employ 1 local is to 3 foreigners, now is 1 is to 5
              foreigners, you employ a local supervisor, you can get 5
              foreigners. 1.5+1.2= 2.5 millions working for an economy that is
              getting gloomy.</p>
