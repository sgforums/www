              <p>no joke, domestic maid are not cover by employment act, there is
              no act to protect them, this lead to expliotation by
              both employers and agencies. And due to their naiveness and
              lower education, they are  easy prey for slavery.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I do not understand why asian employers way of treating maid is
              so much different from our western counterparts. If you give option
              to any maid to choose either a westerner employer or an asian
              one,..i bet they go to the westerner. Becos the westerner knows how
              to respect human basic and employees rights, most maid working
              under them work as per normal a singaporean worker work. Same as my
              maid, i only allow her to work from 8 to 5pm, Saturday half day and
              sunday off. Anything more i will paid her more. But she also told
              me her colleagues work ng for a typical singaporeans have to work
              all days non stop..really pity them.</p>

Without entreprenuers like her, Singapore will be starved of entertainment, and lonely men may even turn rabid when devoid of female company, even if it is paid companionship.

              <p>...The kind of a car a person drove was, until very recently, one of
              the best guides to middle-class status, since a car to the middle
              classes was a status symbol, while to the other classes it was a means
              of getting somewhere. Oversized Oldsmobiles, Cadillacs, and Lincoln
              Continentals are still middle-class cars, but in recent years, with the
              weakening of the middle-class outlook, almost anyone might be found
              driving a Volkswagen.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Another good evidence of class may be seen in the
              treatment given to servants (or those who work in one's home)</strong></span></span>: the
              lower classes treat these as equals,<span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> the middle classes treat them as
              inferiors,</strong></span></span> while aristocrats treat them as equals or even superiors...</p>
              <p>The working class in the United States is much
              smaller than we might assume, since most American workers are seeking
              to rise socially, to help their children to rise socially, and are
              considerably concerned with status symbols. Such people, even if
              laborers, are not working class, but are rather petty bourgeoisie.</p>
              <p>The
              real working class are rather relaxed, have present rather than future
              preference, generally worry very little about their status in the eyes
              of the world, enjoy their ordinary lives, including food, sex, and
              leisure, and have little desire to change their jobs or positions. They
              are generally relaxed, have a taste for broad humor, are natural,
              direct, and friendly, without large basic insecurities of personality.</p>
              <p>The world depression, by destroying their jobs and economic security,
              much reduced this group, which was always proportionately smaller in
              America, the land of aspiration for everyone, than in Europe...</p>
              <p>...The second most numerous group in the United
              States is the petty bourgeoisie, including<span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> millions of persons who
              regard themselves as middle class and are under all the middle-class
              anxieties and pressures, but often earn less money than unionized
              laborers. </strong></span></span></p>
              <p>As a result of these things, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>they are often very insecure,
              envious, filled with hatreds, and are generally the chief recruits for

              different or which refuses to conform to middle-class values.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p>Made up
              of <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>clerks, shopkeepers, and vast numbers of office workers in business,

              <p>I dont want to come into you and xtreyier..but i do think civil servant can be define as 'people serving' people. the people is whoever is living in Singapore. Their work is to contribute and assist the people living in Singapore.That why they are called Civil Servant.I do understand your gudge and i hope that u can think more rationale, Servant is a big word, our ministers and MP, People working in the jails,police, Armed Forces, ICA,President are all civil servants..but they arent those who go to your house and clean up the rubbish in your house. Of couse i have to agreed that bad eggs do exist in the civil service, but can you name me an organisation without bad eggs.</p>
