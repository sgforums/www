              <p>lets just say you are a singaporean ( and i am a foriegn
              person working here)....does it look good to tax you (well u know
              there is the GST here )..use your tax money to finance my sons
              scolarship to come here to study..how would you feel??? i for one
              would be quite pleased.</p>
              <p>just assume again you are a middle class singaporean
              worker paying for your HDB home loans...etc etc..seems to you
              the money is never enough to keep the bills at bay..your boss is
              eying on cheaper foriegn talents and (you knowing full well that
              these people will not last long in the job and will fly after
              offered a higher pay) while at the same time the economic storm
              looms directly ahead of the company you work in..and to add salt to
              the wound, you might be included in the list of people to get
              "axed" in favour for foriegn talent because of their cheaper salary
              but substandard job performance, how would you feel?</p>
              <p>lastly what would you do if your investigation leads to the
              ruling party that has allow employers to go through the "loopholes"
              of the system?</p>
              <p>I would appericate your sincere reply..and i will be
              waiting for it.</p>

              <p>Hi there.. I am glad that people like you exist.. Seriously, I don't mind arguing with a sensible person and losing or what. At the end of the day, both gain some knowledge in any case..</p>
              <p>To take your first case, about using tax paid by locals to fund scholarships for foreigners. First and foremost, the public had decided to appoint a particular party to rule the country. Which means the majority of the decisions taken by the ruling party are supported by the citizens and hence they had put the party in power. The citizens had decided that the party had a level head and is capable of taking decisions on their behalf. Which means that they are indirect supporters of the majority of the decisions taken by the ruling party.</p>
              <p>In this case, fact is, I pay GST as well. Means I am in a way funding your children's studies fully knowing that you are a foreigner. Yes, there will be people (including myself) displeased with that. Who made the decision to use tax to fund scholarships? The ruling party. Who put the ruling party in power? The people. Who can change this? The people. So I will have to take action to make any changes to this. The public has to do something.</p>
              <p>As for the second scenario, I would like to get some facts cleared first. I am referring to the real life situations and experiences in my working life so far. I have clearly noticed that (mostly) foreigners tend to stay longer in their jobs rather than their local counterparts. I have also clearly noticed that (mostly) foreigners deliver same level of performance as their local counterparts, if not they are sometimes many times better than their local counterparts.</p>
              <p>In any case, I will use your hypothetical conditions for this. Just go back to your para again and remove the word Singaporean and replace the word HDB by the word housing. Notice my point? It is the same situation worldwide. Every single country, to some extent, is facing a similar issue. Take States, Canada, Europe, Australia and many others. All are having same issue. Singapore, in fact is better.</p>
              <p>Take GST/VAT for example. Singapore is 7%. Australia is 10%. China is 17%, Europe ranges from 17% to 25%. Canada is 5%.</p>
              <p>I wouldn't go into income tax, but rest assured, Singapore is again one of the lowest You can get more information from this site: http://www.worldwide-tax.com/</p>
              <p>You have to constantly improve yourself. You have to give the boss a strong reason for him to keep you. Foreigners are not "God" like. They have limitations too. You can take up extra certifications and language skills. Of which, I am doing both. It takes hard work and effort of course. I have to sacrifice my personal time and study. But its for my survival and also for my struggle to get higher in the ladder. If I feel sad and depressed then there is nothing wrong with the Government. Its my own doing.

              <p>Hi there.. I am glad that people like you exist.. Seriously, I don't mind arguing with a sensible person and losing or what. At the end of the day, both gain some knowledge in any case..</p>
              <p>To take your first case, about using tax paid by locals to fund scholarships for foreigners. First and foremost, the public had decided to appoint a particular party to rule the country. Which means the majority of the decisions taken by the ruling party are supported by the citizens and hence they had put the party in power. The citizens had decided that the party had a level head and is capable of taking decisions on their behalf. Which means that they are indirect supporters of the majority of the decisions taken by the ruling party.</p>
              <p>In this case, fact is, I pay GST as well. Means I am in a way funding your children's studies fully knowing that you are a foreigner. Yes, there will be people (including myself) displeased with that. Who made the decision to use tax to fund scholarships? The ruling party. Who put the ruling party in power? The people. Who can change this? The people. So I will have to take action to make any changes to this. The public has to do something.</p>
              <p>As for the second scenario, I would like to get some facts cleared first. I am referring to the real life situations and experiences in my working life so far. I have clearly noticed that (mostly) foreigners tend to stay longer in their jobs rather than their local counterparts. I have also clearly noticed that (mostly) foreigners deliver same level of performance as their local counterparts, if not they are sometimes many times better than their local counterparts.</p>
              <p>In any case, I will use your hypothetical conditions for this. Just go back to your para again and remove the word Singaporean and replace the word HDB by the word housing. Notice my point? It is the same situation worldwide. Every single country, to some extent, is facing a similar issue. Take States, Canada, Europe, Australia and many others. All are having same issue. Singapore, in fact is better.</p>
              <p>Take GST/VAT for example. Singapore is 7%. Australia is 10%. China is 17%, Europe ranges from 17% to 25%. Canada is 5%.</p>
              <p>I wouldn't go into income tax, but rest assured, Singapore is again one of the lowest You can get more information from this site: http://www.worldwide-tax.com/</p>
              <p>You have to constantly improve yourself. You have to give the boss a strong reason for him to keep you. Foreigners are not "God" like. They have limitations too. You can take up extra certifications and language skills. Of which, I am doing both. It takes hard work and effort of course. I have to sacrifice my personal time and study. But its for my survival and also for my struggle to get higher in the ladder. If I feel sad and depressed then there is nothing wrong with the Government. Its my own doing. The only person who can truly make you happy is yourself.</p>

              <p>Then again, walkovers are aplenty. Ever since mega-GRCs was implemented, no opposition has won a GRC, and that's a fact. And that's what make many people unhappy, because it seems like this is stifling the opposition in our 'democracy'.</p>
              <p>The original purpose of the GRC is good, to have representation for the minorities race. But do we really need mega 5-men 6-men GRCs for that? With GRCs, many entered base on merits of their mentors, and not themselves.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The other reason why people are unhappy is because the guys spend 2 years in army. Put yourself in the shoes of a Singaporean male, and you can see that during uni studies, your foreign classmate peers or 1 year junior is now your senior... 2 years of youth sacrificed while your non-singaporean peers advanced ahead in society?</p>

              <p>Other than that, I'm not too bothered... Because<br>1) I have made long-lasting valuable friendships in army<br>2) I sacrifice lots of personal time to catch up for the 2 years lost by working a 2nd full-time job (working 7 days a week, 8am to 10+ pm)</p>

              <p>@coolgeek84</p>
              <p>first and formost i have to disagree with your first point..true..it is the people who choose the govt,but in my case, i am unfortunate in a way that i had no chance of choosing due to "walkovers" in my area.</p>
              <p>secondly:</p>
              <p>as eagle would have put it..try to see thru the eyes of why we resent, not how we resent, in the past i was also a pro-pap supporter..why you ask now the change, the reason does not lie in me..but in the change of the system  and the people that has used to take care of singaporeans are either retired, or dead..if you are interested you can look into the wiki for maybe 3 people, notably ong teng cheong- former MP of toa payoh( used to be called kim keat at that time) and also the previous president and the deeds he's done..this is one person that will always remind me of what it means to be a singaporean at the very roots, other notable people are goh keng swee and lastly the man who held the state treasury firm, richard hu.</p>
              <p>these are the people who know what we wnet thru and felt..unlike the present system where it is "sweet as honey in the mouth but turned sour in the tummy". to be honest in 2006 when LHL was pm, i thought there was going to be a change for the better, since his popular vote was not that good, however as time goes by till now..each implementation has what i put in " 1 step forward but 3 steps backward" sceneario.</p>
              <p>i resent foriegners not due to the cause that i like it..but because it has been IMHO implemented at bad time where the economy is not like the 80s where a recessions span is once every 10 years here, now it seems the occurance span  less than 10 years, e.g 1986, 1997 was in norm, but in 2001 incident and recent finance crisis has shown it less than the 10 year cycle. 1997 to 2001 is just a span of 4 years, while 2001 to 2008 is a span of 7 years thus have proven that this times of economy unstability is very apperent.</p>
              <p>i also have some resentment in the systems since they leave loopholes to allow bosses to abuse the system.by the way your true life experiance are also in opposite to my true life experiance..you seen your share of the " good foriegners" , i too have my share..but i have also seem more "ugly" foriegners in their sub stanbdard work..so i know roughtly what their agenda is here,however you must spare a thought for the people here..1 of you take a job is equal one of us denied that job..all the more worst in times like these which you 'll unknowingly gather more hate and resentment just because you got it but we don't.</p>
              <p>i hope you understand my meaning and apologize if i am too long winded here.</p>
