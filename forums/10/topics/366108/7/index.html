              <p>maybe Singapore will soon become like HK; HDBs might one day be bought as investments to rent to lower income group because they cannot afford to buy one.</p>

              <p><br>Leasehold means you rent the place for 99 years.  Instead of paying monthly rent, you pay everything upfront.  Clever isn't it.  In the short term it's ok but not for passing down to your children.  I don't think there is any case of leasehold property hitting 99 years so we don't know what will happen.  Anyway, for most HDB, government will demolish and rebuild long before that.  Technically, you don't have to worry about 99 years old HDB.  Private properties is probably different.  Perhaps some developer may come along and enbloc.  Then he pays the government to top up to 99 years again before selling on the market.</p>

              <p>We couldn't make this stuff up: this man, Reishee Sowa of Puerto Aventuras, Mexico, apparently grew tired of trying to live self-sufficiently on dry land, and did what any of us would have done. He built his own island out of used pop bottles. 250,000 of them, plus some construction leftovers and bags of leaves, make up "his island," though he's quick to point out that it's technically not an island by traditional standards. "You see not even the president is allowed his own island in Mexico," he says, "but technically I don’t have an island, I have an eco space-creating ship."</p>

              <p>Granted, the idea may seem a bit wacky to some of you dear readers, and though it's not entirely practical on a global scale for each person to have their own island, we do admire his ingenuity and innovative spirit. Our earth is two-thirds water, after all.</p>
              <p><img class="left" src="http://i.treehugger.com/files/bottle-island2.jpg" alt="bottle-island2.jpg" width="252" height="189">But seriously, Reishee Sowa has done something pretty incredible, and he really has a passion for a better world. "We are being faced with a population explosion and maybe building islands is the answer. This island is an example of something that could be built worldwide. You could be totally self sufficient with it. All is as natural as possible. I catch rain water for showers, the toilet naturally composts, and</p>

              <p> you can’t afford to buy your own tropical island paradise, why not build your own? That is exactly what Richie Sowa did back in 1998, from over a quarter-million plastic bottles. His Spiral Island, destroyed years later by a hurricane, sported a two-story house, solar oven, self-composting toilet and multiple beaches. Better yet, he has started building another one! His ultimate goal? To build the island bigger and bigger and finally float out to sea, traveling the world from the comfort of his own private</p>
              <p>An environmentalist to the core, Sowa is also an artist and a musician. More than just the universal dream of an island retreat, Spiral Island is also his vision for <a title="Spiral Island Sustainable Living" href="http://www.treehugger.com/files/2005/11/tired_of_living.php"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #800080;">low-impact sustainable living</span></span></a>. The next version of the island will be built to withstand more treacherous weather than the first and will also be located in a more sheltered part of Mexico’s waters.</p>
              <p>The Above Ripley’s Believe-it-or-Not video is a great introduction to the island, which conjures images of Gilligan-done-right. Spiral island is able to exist and move about in Mexico in part because it is classified as a ship, not an island, like an atoll out of WaterWorld (only much much cooler). On September 7, 2007 the new <a title="Spiral Islanders dot Com" href="http://www.spiralislanders.com/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Spiral Islander social network utility</span></span></a> was opened to the public to allow visitors, Spiral Islanders and friends of Richie Sowa to connect and communicate about the history of Spiral Island and to learn more and discuss Richie Sowa’s new Spiral Island.

              Shall not bore with long paragraphs for two simple truths shall suffice:
              
              1. The government is NOT the PAP. PAP is the current ruling party, they form majority of the government, but they are not the government. So if you want to call civil servants and public servants dogs, at least call them right. Dogs of the government, not the PAP. Assuming they are even dogs, that is, which brings me to my next point.
              
              2. The government is not everything. It is because you, the whiners, have made them the bad guys for everything, that is why they have become everything. Some of you guys might, at this point, label me as a dog ( remember, it is dog of the government). But I cannot be bothered and am going for lunch now.

              <p><br>Of course you're right.  But then who complains about too much money?  On the other hand, many people who earns 10k a month lives 15k a month lifestyle.  At the end of the day, they are still in debt.  Many Singaporeans under 40 these days are living beyond their means.  If not for CPF, they can't even afford roof over their heads.  But then they forgot, CPF is meant for old age and medical bills.  Everyone will be old one day and everyone will be sick one day.  Unless you get run over by a bus before then but that's a different story.  The government realise this but we are in too deep to reverse so they are not doing anything drastic.  In 20 years time, there will be many people trying to dump their HDB to cash out.  Who do you think is going to buy those flats?  Today's kids?  HDB?  Be prepared for more foreigners coming in.</p>
              <p>10k a month is nice if one is prudent.  It can be a liability if one is spends foolishly.</p>

              <p>You are right. Most people with 10K a month usually spend 10K a month too. Good habits with money need to start at a young age. Once you have the habit of spending, it really difficult to change otherwise. Not impossible, but really difficult.</p>

              <p>Even 100k a month is a liability if one spends foolishly. One needs to be able to identify between needs and wants.</p>
              <p>Thing is... many people are saying the same things nowadays... This includes MLMers and Insurance agents/consultants that are out to earn your money to 'advise' you.... Then again, are you able to do it, with many necessary bills to pay? You can earn 5k a month, but you can spend 2.5k on bills, 1k on food, and 1k to give your parents... In the end you are left with nothing... Bills get more and more and you grow older and older...</p>
              <p>So when you are young, it's best to work harder and smarter to earn more as well. Invest prudently in long term defensive dividend stocks and assets so that they can help "subsidize" your bills and improve your monthly cashflow.</p>
              <p>Work hard, work smart. Take action, not complain. This applies to both students in school and working adults in life.</p>

              <p>5k is nothing today, and 10k or so called 5 figures will only encourage dreaming of first class living, it is ok to spend what you earn, given what you deserve to be after all the years of hard and smart working, buy some private property is one the way to increase your asset when and if money become paperless or investment, even in prudent or AAA class failed miserably.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The only problem arise is when a big spenders of 30k paid suddenly lost his/her job, with over committment in installment products and assets, living a lavish life and refuse to forgo it to eat at hawker centre or live a 4 room HDB flat, face is also a factor especially in the chinese community. That alone may push him/her to the limit.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What i am trying to say is that everyone of us must prepare for failure, we got the best toys when young, enter the good school and  score good grades in school, good in games, good in knowledges, good in working, good in getting high pays and almost everything but when things turn sour, most of us cannot handle it, even the govt, they are at shock situation when the economy dive down becos gaining and winning is always on the mind of Singaporeans, that is something we must learn to change</p>
