              <p>I have to take issue on your term for those working in the civil service as 'servants'.</p>
              <p>No doubt their responsibility is to serve our society, but they are not 'servants' in the sense of the word as it would suggest - a master/labourer relationship.</p>
              <p>These 'servants' as you call it, are our fellow citizens in our society where ALL ARE EQUAL. They need not bow to anyone nor do we need to bow to them. We ARE NOT their masters, that we can dictate and demand them to do our bidding at our whims and fancies as we would do to our foreign maids.</p>
              <p>They are us, our equals, pay taxes just like anyone of us, with the ability to discern whom to vote for or against for the sake of themselves and their next generations.</p>
              <p>The only difference between them and us citizens is ONLY the higher responsibility that they had to undertake, to help in the administration of our nation, based on the result of our collective majority vote on whom should be the head administrator of our country, whom has the mandate of the people to decide on policies and the authority to define and demand the varied tasks expected from the civil service.</p>
              <p>My point - Civil service are not foreign maids to be at your personal beck and order. They too are our equals and should be praised if they had done well, respected if they performed admirably on behalf of us all,  or ostracized if they had done wrong and proven so in a court of law.</p>

              <p>Hi Eagle,</p>
              <p>I dont want to come into you and xtreyier..but i do think civil servant can be define as 'people serving' people. the people is whoever is living in Singapore. Their work is to contribute and assist the people living in Singapore.That why they are called Civil Servant.I do understand your gudge and i hope that u can think more rationale, Servant is a big word, our ministers and MP, People working in the jails,police, Armed Forces, ICA,President are all civil servants..but they arent those who go to your house and clean up the rubbish in your house. Of couse i have to agreed that bad eggs do exist in the civil service, but can you name me an organisation without bad eggs.</p>
              <p>kindly give some respect to our civil servants..</p>

                                  organisation without bad eggs.</p>
              <p>kindly give some respect to our civil servants..</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1st, which sentence did I not give respect to our civil servants? Pardon me if I gave you that impression. Pls kindly point out and I will amend it. Thanks. Also, I don't have much complains or grudges, so I don't really understand what you meant by you understand my grudges. Do kindly clear my misunderstandings as well :D</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2nd, even those who clean up rubbish around the estate are unsung heroes and to be respected. And they are actually much more polite than most Singaporeans.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3rd, even foreign maids are to be respected. His sentence of "We ARE NOT their masters, that we can dictate
                                                          and demand them to do our bidding at our whims and fancies <strong>as we
                                                          would do to our foreign maids</strong>" really shows his attitude and nature.</p>
              <p>Maids are here to do their job as maids, not do biddings at their employer's whims and fancies. It's totally wrong. He has no respect for maids that come here. He also gives the impression that he's just a little kid who commands his maid to pour water for him, help him change clothes, carry his schoolbag for him to and from school...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In short, xtreyier has used a very very wrong analogy (with foreign maids).</p>

              <p>Even if people claim that grads will be earning more after 10
              years of working, what about the rest of the technicians, kopitiam
              workers, cleaners, garden "specialist", dishwasher, clerks, sales
              assistant etc?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If HDB is priced out for the majority of the lower income
              earners, this will become a social issue not just an economic one.

              <p>I do not understand why asian employers way of treating maid is so much different from our western counterparts. If you give option to any maid to choose either a westerner employer or an asian one,..i bet they go to the westerner. Becos the westerner knows how to respect human basic and employees rights, most maid working under them work as per normal a singaporean worker work. Same as my maid, i only allow her to work from 8 to 5pm, Saturday half day and sunday off. Anything more i will paid her more. But she also told me her colleagues work ng for a typical singaporeans have to work all days non stop..really pity them.</p>

              <p><br>damn, but i know some maid are also damn lazy one,..actually the master is ok, it is usually the wife or so call madams, most got some phycho problem with maid, the way they scold the maid is so terrible, it only encourage her childrens to do the same to the maid.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you think you maid is no good, give her a chance, counsel her, if still cannot, send her back to agency and get a new one, maid are not people for you to scold, pinch and torture, they are to serve you and you paid them for their services, no different from hotel services.</p>
