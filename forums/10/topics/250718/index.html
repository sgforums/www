Monopoly can be profitable yes, but you can earn so much more with free markets and enrich the common people as well - making it in their best interests to contribute to singapore.  This will lead to a benevolent cycle of retaining local talents and eventually progressing to attracting talents from around the world.<br><br>A simple analogy based on your question:<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bread and Butter Issue</span></strong><br>If party X holds a monopoly and only supports the 1 % who are rich and powerful, it is only the rich and powerful who will want to stay and contribute to Singapore.*<br><br>In other words, the remaining 99% who are not rich and powerful will want to leave to other places which recognise their talents - this is in their own self interests.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Human Element</span></strong><br>Another facet of the problem is that humans have feelings.    Thus even tho party X supports the 1% rich and powerful, there may be talents within this 1% that feel party X is not being just and fair.  These talents with that 1% may also leave to other places as this too is in their self interests - not for monetary gain, but rather the satisfaction that comes with intangible rewards.<br><br></div>

But rather how the PAP can progress to a new level in terms of talent, capabilities, and values to win the support of the people.<br><br>To do this it will be necessary to redefine the criteria by which the government defines meritocracy and promotes civil servants.  Are we giving everyone a fair chance to achieve what their natural born talents allows them to do?  Should we include values as one of the criteria in our performance evaluations?  What are the kind of talents that we desire - is it only excellence in academica? Or can it be of a more practical level, talents that are able to progress singapore no matter how humble the background.<br><br></div>
