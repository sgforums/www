              <p>Obviously we are trying to upgrade to be at the top.

              <p>Obviously we are trying to upgrade to be at the top. But theres a limit to the expansion of Singapore as compared with China or US for instance, they got plenty of space, big population.<br><br>Anyway i think LKY has no reason in doing us harm, afterall he brought independence to our little red dot, and the current status we have.</p>
