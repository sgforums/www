            <div class='col-md body'>I don't agree with job hopping if it can be helped. The fact is in job hopping too much, you tend to pick up on only very basic experience that are not very useful. Most jobs that are looking for experience are talking about the perm type. Besides, there is always the chance that you end up taking what comes along and become a wandereing generality in the long run.

You may say they can "get things done faster" like migrate but so what, they still have to work it out there.

Why in financial sector? Never think before hand or just follow the crowd? Some of your batch sometime get better pay, here it show when you hop you get better pays.<br>From your 1st reply, I see that you dun plan or you dun try to achieve what ever you plan and here you talking about moving out of this position? How? All are excuses like criticism, can not pay for education, no degree? Learn to let go of the "comfort zone" you are in now? If you had read about Rich Dad Poor Dad I think you will know, If not try read up, we may not be able to use all that is written, but at least you will know and see thing better.<br><br>Let me tell you. Today I just finish my new assignment. Day rate at $180. Which degree holder you know of get a $180 day rate? From my side none. My assignment range from $135 to $220 per/day depend on the projects scope and I am still looking around today but at the same time ppl are looking out for me as well. As said before I am on my own now. Why ppl are looking out for me as well? I build my contacts everywhere I go, I made myself known to everyone of what I can do... You say you want to move out of "this" Are you moving, cause I am moving and I am near to the EXIT soon and not just say say.<br>Talking about migrate? How? when you are in the same coy doing the routine <strong>JOB</strong><br>Me without anything, no Degree, no Dip, not even O but tons of experience (thank myself for hopping) so how for me to migrate? E~Z as long I got an assignment oversea for long period say 1 year or more (anyway I dun want to stay here just like you) for me to get a PR is like A.B.C. why? After 1 year just pay the TAX there. It just where I want to go from there on.<br><br>Think about it. Why more ppl are hopping now. They are force to and not do it willingly as to achieve what they want or I should say they oni see what's now for them. that why not matter how many hop they had made they are still in sq 1. You want out you make a move and you plan for the next. Needless to say, my plan next is to get an oversea assignment.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree planning is important but quite useless. When you tell employers your intentions to work and study at the same time, they will tell you to "get lost" in the current market. Like you said experience is important but in the current market, companies out there don't give freshie chance. I went for a lot of interviews already so I know. The companies here got slave mentality. Expect you to OT. So many jobs they prefer degree holder too.<br><br>As for my friends it cannot be helped, they need the money and thats why any job comes along must grab. How can afford to choose to choose a job to advance their position.<br><br>I got relatives overseas. And I still think its better there. House cheaper, land cheaper, people nicer. Take our top "civil servants" for example. So many got backup house overseas. How come so many of their sons and daughters go there to study somemore??? Also I don't like it when the govt calls those that migrate quitters. People got their own freedom to choose. They encourage outsourcing so I don't see a problem if locals decide to outsource themselves to people who give them better benefits.<br><br>I read the book you mentioned before. But I don't think its good anyway. States the obvious but doesn't tell you exactly how to get there. I agree the govt don't own us a living but neither do i own them my life and soul.</div>

Tell employer you want to study for what, night class do not distubed your work hours ok. Just go, plan and carry it out, you dun need some other ppl approval to upgrade, unless you are asking them to pay for you.<br>Next company want you to do OT?<br><br>Local company Yes. Local bosses like to see ppl work till late. Pay is good I dun mind, pay peanuts get monkey. That why most local company are doing monkey business.<br><br>How many job perfer degree? How many? In what field, what scope, all this are excuses from the boss and ppl like you. I, me and i say again Joshua1975 can do a degree holder job scope but can he a degree holder do mine?<br><br>For your friends???

The book is for you to think and do it yourself, who can tell you how to get rich when you yourself do not want to work on it?... <span style="color: darkblue;">till now... (I used to be like that), you are the type whom what the garment want the ppl to be, to complain but </span><span style="color: red;">not moving, no action</span> <span style="color: darkblue;">and carry on what you do best on your job.</span>for the garment, for your boss, but <span style="color: darkblue;"> all this you think you are doing for daily survivor???</span><br><br>I am no one to tell you of what to do and not to do. It up to you of how much you want to, Just like the book, it <span style="color: red;">show you the obvious, but how you going to get there, it your call. </span>no one is the same, whatever work for him may not work for me just like me, things work out fro me but may not for you.</div>
