              <p>This is like setting up a sgforum with a 'Speakers' Corner' - and allow everyone to let off steam, and their moderators will have the power to make some of the more strident views to be locked up and also disappear when found to be too embarrassing.</p>
              <p>FireIce in this Speakers' Corner will be seen to be much kinder.</p>
              <p>At least in this Speakers' Corner - we can hope that Jason has covered all his corners to ensure that the Singapore Government will not be able to force him to reveal the ISP of any participants - by setting the ownership of this sgforum in the USA.</p>

              <p>I ever sent feedback to the government controlled website but my message must had been filtered and did not appear at all.    Have been hearing people sending letters to Straits Times about the way the govt runs the country, their letters were rejected.   If you people want your feedback to be accepted write in or post message to praise the PAP, I guarantee sure they will accept it.</p>
              <p>Our Pay and Pay gahmen is running Singapore like a business.  They are the top management, we are all their slaves and workers.   Whatever they say they expect us to accept it and not question.   They adopt a talk down style.  So what is the point to encourage people to communicate with them, it is a waste of our time, money and effort to give feedback in their website.   Pap unlike the Taiwan govt who encourage his ministers to reach down to the common people,  PAP are kings and queens and we people are just tools, machines, resources for them to make money, ha ha ha.</p>
              <p>The ruling party never fails to wayang wayang and they think we are fools to believe them.</p>

              <p>What to say, what to do, they are hopeless.   Don't vote for them.   They are very problematic.    Especially the oldest member of PAP is so full of problems that many want him dead.   They regard themselves as perfect, more perfect than the common people.   They subject the common people to their oppression, tyranny.   I am sick and tired of their wayang and hope people of Singapore will be bold enough to put a stop to their wayang.</p>

              <p>I ever sent feedback to the government controlled website but my message must had been filtered and did not appear at all.    Have been hearing people sending letters to Straits Times about the way the govt runs the country, their letters were rejected.   If you people want your feedback to be accepted write in or post message to praise the PAP, I guarantee sure they will accept it.</p>
              <p>Our Pay and Pay gahmen is running Singapore like a business.  They are the top management, we are all their slaves and workers.   Whatever they say they expect us to accept it and not question.   They adopt a talk down style.  So what is the point to encourage people to communicate with them, it is a waste of our time, money and effort to give feedback in their website.   Pap unlike the Taiwan govt who encourage his ministers to reach down to the common people,  PAP are kings and queens and we people are just tools, machines, resources for them to make money, ha ha ha.</p>
              <p>The ruling party never fails to wayang wayang and they think we are fools to believe them.</p>

              <p>Dear opposition parties,</p>
              <p>I sincerely hope that you will run in full force in the future elections. Even though you may not win in all constituents, I hope that you can run in as many zone as possible as this will give singaporeans in more areas a choice in voting and force the PAP to buck up. I will certainly vote for the opposition if given the chance. Moreover, I believe a larger proportion of votes for the opposition will force the PAP to sit up and focus more on the people sentiments and opinions. I do not expect the opposition to do miracles in one term as I understand your plight after being oppressed, sued, jailed, bunkrupted.... by the PAP. What i rather hope is that the opposition can give the people a chance to vote for them and that the people of singapore be willing to vote for them to give the PAP a wake up call.</p>
              <p>Thanks.</p>

              <p>I will vote for opposition too if I am eligible to vote.    I don't care who the opposition is, I just want to vote opposition.   Voting PAP is asking for continuity in travelling the dead end road.</p>
