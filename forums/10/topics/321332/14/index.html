              <p>Hi everyone,</p>
              <p>I have heard all the replies to Dimitri the Wanderer and it seems that most Singaporeans are doubtful that he is earning that much money a month.  As a fellow Singapore working in Bristol for an Aerospace Manufacturer for almost 3 years, I feel that I could shed some light on this subject.</p>
              <p>According to Dimitri, he claims to have earn quite a lot of money in a single year.  I suspect this consist of his salary as well as bonuses combined.  It's very expensive living in London so most of the city workers tend to have very high salaries.  Although I am just an engineer working in the UK, my classmates have all left engineering to work in banks in london.  The starting salary for fresh graduates out of University in the UK working in London for a bank is about S$150K to S$180K a year excluding bonuses.  I hope this figure gives you an idea of how things are in the UK.</p>
              <p>As an engineer myself, I would just say that it's difficult for me to return to Singapore to work one day.  After working just 3 years since leaving Uni, I am getting a five figure salary a month and much higher than what a normal engineer is getting in Singapore.  It is no surprise now why there are no more engineers left in Singapore and I can't see why a Singaporean studying overseas will want to return to Singapore to work for less money.  Competition is fierce in the UK for skilled people and the companies in UK are mostly MNC which compete for international contracts and businesses.  So it really boils down to nature of the business and the market that you are satisfying. </p>

              <p>Wow! 5 figure salary! $150,000. UK!  in Financial Mgt. Would engineering be the same, although you didnt say so, still 5 figures as you claimed?</p>
              <p>But hang on a second! Let's work some figures.</p>
              <p>$150,000 less 23% tax would be $115,500 balanced, or $9,625/mth.</p>
              <p>Rental of one bedroom flat( don't even think to  buy one! Beyond most working class reach!)           = est $5,000</p>
              <p>Less Municipal tax ( property tax) = est $   500</p>
              <p>Food ( steaks cost a bomb)          = <span style="text-decoration: underline;">est $1,000</span></p>
              <p>Sub total                                   = est $6,500</p>
              <p>Balance of salary                        = est $3,125/mth</p>
              <p>Car, petrol, parking, electricity      =   ????</p>
              <p>Without car, electricity, entertainment costs, you are already down to <strong>$3,125.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Let's compare a Spore engineer here - $6,000/mth</p>
              <p>Tax 8.5% = balance of $65,880 or $5,490/mth</p>
              <p>HDB 5 rm flat    =$1,000/mth and ( own the flat for 99years)</p>
              <p>Town council     = $  120</p>

              <p>Balance of salary=<strong>$3,870/mth</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Spore engineer may earn lesser, but at the end of day, who is better off and have more money in the pocket? You claim to be an engineer, I dont wish to doubt you, but have you work your figures properly???</p>
              <p>And to rub it in, paying taxes and contributing to UK as a PR is better than contributing to our society, who had offered you the opportunity since birth to excel?</p>

              <p>Its obvious you know nuts apart from what you see. Just like those people who keep putting down bangla's. Do more research on China russia and the states. Find out about oil in south africa. China's economy is 2nd largest in the world</p>

              <p>It may be a better deal to go and work overseas on an expat's package. That way, it's double the pay, and 50% less the risk (coz company shd take care of ur welfare.. somewhat) &amp; come back home with higher value in CV and to company.</p>

              <p>Hi there,</p>
              <p>Just to respond to my earlier email.  Engineers don't get as much as those in finance, law or any of the city workers in London.  In fact most engineers are based outside London because our salary isn't high enough to warrant a lavish lifestyle, especially in London.  That is why most grads from engineering courses tend to switch to finance because it pays better than engineering companies.</p>
              <p>I know there are some doubts over the fact that most aerospace engineers get a five figure salary a month and I shall explain in detail no worries.  Most of us engineers in UK, regardless of where you come from originally, as long as you are qualified can work as a contractor (minimum 3-5 years working experience).  The hourly rate for a contractor is between 25 pounds to 40 pounds an hour depending on your contract.  You can check the internet for the rates of aerospace designers and engineers.  Given the major shortage of engineers in UK, all engineers tend to be on contracting until they are about 50 where either they retire or take up a high post such as a Chief Engineer.</p>
              <p>On average, most engineers work an average of 50 hours a week which works out to £5,625 a month based on £25/hour (minimum).  As a contractor, we pay no tax until April every year.  We have accountants who manage our salaries and invest the excess into equities.  The accountants do not declare the full extent of our salaries so engineers do not pay the 40% tax on our yearly income.  In fact, contracting is like owning your own business where the money comes in and gets redistributed in your office (home).  By the time you declare your salary for taxation, instead of £67,500 a year salary, you only declare £18,000 because the money was shown to be reinvested in your car, expenses at home and company savings.  The taxation on a £18K salary is also about 25% which is still high no doubt.  I hope this gives a better idea of how engineers operate in Europe.</p>

              <p>xtreyier,</p>
              <p>You are right in saying that the living expenses in the UK can be quite high.  With all due respect, I have to disagree the list of expenses that you quoted in your reply. </p>
              <p>I suspect that you a quoting a rental of a flat in London not Bristol.  Rental of a flat in Bristol is S$1500 a month and $2500 for a 4 bedroom house.  However I wouldn't recommend renting because in the UK, it was possible to get a mortgage for just a 3% deposit on a house.  It's 10% deposit now given the impact the credit crunch that affected markets worldwide.  In the UK, I feel that it would be appropriate to buy a property as well since the mortgage repayments tend to be equivalent to monthly rentals.</p>
              <p>Similarly, I have to say that I am living quite a frugal lifestyle in UK.  There is no need to spend excessive money if you appreciate the simple things in life.  I would feel that once again the numbers you have quoted apply more for someone who lives in London than outside London.  But then again, if you get paid ridiculous money especially in Investment Banking in London, there is nothing wrong using your bonus to pay for a ferrari in cash. </p>

              <p>There's little point giving engineering much more time in SG; we are very easily replaced by getting cheaper foreigners over, given our close proximity with China and India. There's little complaints because it is a rational thing for companies to do so.</p>
              <p>And although govt jobs give higher remuneration for engineering jobs currently as compared to the private sector, it's still insufficient.</p>
              <p>Being me, I'm exploring alternatives currently, and I'm making sure that such an alternative is harder for foreigners to come compete because Singaporeans will have a slight advantage. The remuneration could easily be higher than what an engineer with first class honours would earn just by doing it part-time.</p>

              <p>Wow! 5 figure salary! $150,000. UK!  in Financial Mgt. Would engineering be the same, although you didnt say so, still 5 figures as you claimed?</p>
              <p>But hang on a second! Let's work some figures.</p>
              <p>$150,000 less 23% tax would be $115,500 balanced, or $9,625/mth.</p>
              <p>Rental of one bedroom flat( don't even think to  buy one! Beyond most working class reach!)           = est $5,000</p>
              <p>Less Municipal tax ( property tax) = est $   500</p>
              <p>Food ( steaks cost a bomb)          = <span style="text-decoration: underline;">est $1,000</span></p>
              <p>Sub total                                   = est $6,500</p>
              <p>Balance of salary                        = est $3,125/mth</p>
              <p>Car, petrol, parking, electricity      =   ????</p>
              <p>Without car, electricity, entertainment costs, you are already down to <strong>$3,125.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Let's compare a Spore engineer here - $6,000/mth</p>
              <p>Tax 8.5% = balance of $65,880 or $5,490/mth</p>
              <p>HDB 5 rm flat    =$1,000/mth and ( own the flat for 99years)</p>
              <p>Town council     = $  120</p>
              <p>Food                 <span style="text-decoration: underline;">=$  500</span></p>
              <p>Sub total           =$1,620</p>
              <p>Balance of salary=<strong>$3,870/mth</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Spore engineer may earn lesser, but at the end of day, who is better off and have more money in the pocket? You claim to be an engineer, I dont wish to doubt you, but have you work your figures properly???</p>
              <p>And to rub it in, paying taxes and contributing to UK as a PR is better than contributing to our society, who had offered you the opportunity since birth to excel?</p>
