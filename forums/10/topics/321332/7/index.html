              <p>You are free to call them beggars if thats how you are

              can also be classified as freeloader of society.
              Havent you read stories about people on welfare spending their

              <p>Jojo i have to agree with you on the point you stated it's not a sane place to live beyond 50. I mean i hear from my relatives and family that people at 80+ are still working day &amp; night. It's really a pretty much tough life out in Singapore.</p>

              <p>personally, i am disheartened with the changes here in the last 3 years. i have always maintained to my better half that i would like to remain here. we are doing ok. however, she is quite adamant of leaving due to the `stifling' education system our kids are going thru'.  so, we decided to move out this nov after the school term ends.</p>
              <p>i will stay on for another few months to fulfill personal obligations but unfortunately the `push' factors is overwhelming. will things be better on the other side? who knows but i guess it is up to us to make the best of it. </p>
              <p>so, 4 more bites the dust.</p>
