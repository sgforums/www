              <p>OT,</p>
              <p>the other day, i was queueing up at mr bean to buy `tau huay'. in front of me was a couple of filipina guys. the girl at the service counter was also a pinoy. they started chatting with the girl while waiting for their drinks to be served. after they took their drinks and wanted to pay, the girl at the counter refused to accept the money, saying that it's ok. then she rattled off some tagalogs and the 2 guys left without paying, actually slightly embarrassed.</p>
              <p>with this kind of partial treatment and `clique mentality', our service level &amp; business is going down the drain. </p>

              <p>How accurate is the figure on STs, I really doubt.    Time and again I hear people around me saying if possible they want to migrate.   There are people with children residing overseas and are getting their parents to join them.    Some are on scholarship overseas and plan to work and stay permanently there.   Few I know of are preparing to study overseas and plan not to return to Singapore after their study.   Sad to see more leaving.  </p>
              <p>I just spoke to a PR cleaner and she says she is planning to apply for PR and  does not mind becoming a Singapore citizen and she does not know very well how the gahmen in Singapore works.    I told her about our ruling party and after that she says she rather earn $$$ and return to China and going to stay on already.    I have met many from China who told me they are not interested to make Singapore their country but just want to earn big bucks here and get lost.</p>

              parents to join them.    Some are on scholarship
              overseas and plan to work and stay permanently there.  
              Few I know of are preparing to study overseas and plan not to
              return to Singapore after their study.   Sad to see more
              leaving.  </p>
              <p>I just spoke to a PR cleaner and she says she is planning to
              apply for PR and  does not mind becoming a Singapore
              citizen and she does not know very well how the gahmen in
              Singapore works.    I told her about our ruling
              party and after that she says she rather earn $$$ and return to
              China and going to stay on already.    I have met
              many from China who told me they are not interested to make
              Singapore their country but just want to earn big bucks here and
              get lost.</p>

              <p>That is so darn true. Go talk a walk around our local universities and I bet you feel as though your in china. First we spend TAXPAYER's money on these chinese scholars. Secondly, these scholars compete for spots at our local universities, its no wonder A lvl students who average Bs &amp; Cs get majorly screwed by either not getting the course of their choice or not getting a spot totally. It doesn't help that university school fees are rising and guess what else increases at the same time? Subsidies by the government? NOPE wrong answer. Try more prc students, that would be more accurate. </p>

              <p>If they want to give scholarship, they might as well make it free for everyone.</p>
              <p>Foreigners come and study no need money. Local SG student have to pay. what kind of logic is that ?</p>
              <p>When every student student gets free tuition, then they can hand pick foreign students to take up classes if there are unfilled seats. That way nobardie will complain.</p>
