              <p>dont be too happy about the FTs replacing sporeans in SG.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i have seen many ex-SG FTs here in oz that have benefited from SG's extreme generosity;</p>
              <p>- one HKer had completed her PhD in SG with full scholarship and is here working.</p>
              <p>- a HK couple that had stayed in SG for 10+ years is here working in the law firm. sold their condo in SG and made heaps.</p>
              <p>- a HK colleague that had stayed in SG for 7+ years and taught in SG polytechnic.</p>
              <p>- many others too.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>my PRC colleague who was educated in RJC and NUS with full FREE scholarship, had moved to the USA for work and will be most likely be there permanently.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>anothe PRC ex-colleague, exclaimed to me that the SG passport is just a paper for him to move in and out. and he has daughters which he doesnt worry about NS.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>loyalty to the SG? from these FTs? most are there for the benefits and will leave when they had enjoyed them.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>where their loyalty to SG? why not put the original benefits to the singaporeans instead?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>if everything in SG is just purely based on $$$ figures and tax to be extracted from, then sadly, SG cannot function as a society. it has lost its humane touch and compassion.</p>

              <p>i hope Lionnoisy wont fall sick, grow old or be jobless, coz the reality will start to hit u when u fall into one of the 3 categories.</p>

              <p>anothe PRC ex-colleague, exclaimed to me that the SG passport is just a paper for him to move in and out. and he has daughters which he doesnt worry about NS.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>loyalty to the SG? from these FTs? most are there for the benefits and will leave when they had enjoyed them.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>where their loyalty to SG? why not put the original benefits to the singaporeans instead?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>if everything in SG is just purely based on $$$ figures and tax to be extracted from, then sadly, SG cannot function as a society. it has lost its humane touch and compassion.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i hope Lionnoisy wont fall sick, grow old or be jobless, coz the reality will start to hit u when u fall into one of the 3 categories.</p>

              <p>math and science - SG wins</p>
              <p>english - OZ wins.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>the students here are quite vocal, so standing infront of the whole class and give a speech. they arent that stressed up, tuition are not heard of. there is no exams for pri 4 below i guess.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>but the pace of study will pick up in high school, projects after projects, i saw my colleagues' teens are stressed out by their assignment, but still they are no where near the stress level SG students are experiencing.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>im not sure about the uni but it is open for all to study.</p>

              <p>If due to financial difficulties like serious medical needs of loved ones or ownself can use the cpf completely, then would that not be great? Afterall, life is more precious than money? why still keep the money when you are dead and not use it to cure oneself allowing oneself better quality of life or extend one's life or make living with disease easier?</p>
              <p>If can take out all cpf to settle loans, would that not be great? or better to be hacked to death by ah long or sent to become a pros?</p>
              <p>Or is it better to make 20 year loan from banks to allow them to earn interest from you? Pay and Pay? Good feeling or not? Shiok or not? But got money in cpf, if can use this, no need pay and pay right?</p>
