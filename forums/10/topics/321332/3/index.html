              <p>How accurate is the figure on STs, I really doubt.    Time and again I hear people around me saying if possible they want to migrate.   There are people with children residing overseas and are getting their parents to join them.    Some are on scholarship overseas and plan to work and stay permanently there.   Few I know of are preparing to study overseas and plan not to return to Singapore after their study.   Sad to see more leaving.  </p>
              <p>I just spoke to a PR cleaner and she says she is planning to apply for PR and  does not mind becoming a Singapore citizen and she does not know very well how the gahmen in Singapore works.    I told her about our ruling party and after that she says she rather earn $$$ and return to China and going to stay on already.    I have met many from China who told me they are not interested to make Singapore their country but just want to earn big bucks here and get lost.</p>

              <p>Civilgoh, this is the solution that our million dollar salaried ministers think of to solve our "brain drain" issue. "Singaporeans born and bred here want to leave? Let them leave" they will say. They have prcs to take over us! That is why unversity fees are rising with no inkling of stopping whereas these people get to be here on scholarships. It gets more ridiculous and infuriating the more you think about it.</p>
              <p>Midillusionz, I don't think the media has the balls nor intergrity to publish anything on these boards. BUT they can plaster James Gomez all over because of a stupid form.</p>
