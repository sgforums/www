              <p><br>I agreed that nobody can stop them, parents, MP also cannot stop. I read that the govt subsidized $20000 for a local graduate in their study in local university.</p>
              <p>Poly graduates definitely need to upgrade so to earn higher salary. Somehow govt need to do something to stop the brain drain. This country got 150000 locals migrated to all part of the world already.</p>

              <p>Australian salaries are pegged to inflation and living costs plus union pressures(if I am not wrong), not what you like to think. Houses have increased significantly in prices due to population increase but not as expensive as the 99 year lease ones in Singapore.</p>
              <p>There is no way to avoid meeting racists . Some are quiet about being racist. You just have to treat everyone like how you like to be treated and hope that they do the same for you.</p>

              <p>Hi everyone,</p>
              <p>I have heard all the replies to Dimitri the Wanderer and it seems that most Singaporeans are doubtful that he is earning that much money a month.  As a fellow Singapore working in Bristol for an Aerospace Manufacturer for almost 3 years, I feel that I could shed some light on this subject.</p>
              <p>According to Dimitri, he claims to have earn quite a lot of money in a single year.  I suspect this consist of his salary as well as bonuses combined.  It's very expensive living in London so most of the city workers tend to have very high salaries.  Although I am just an engineer working in the UK, my classmates have all left engineering to work in banks in london.  The starting salary for fresh graduates out of University in the UK working in London for a bank is about S$150K to S$180K a year excluding bonuses.  I hope this figure gives you an idea of how things are in the UK.</p>
              <p>As an engineer myself, I would just say that it's difficult for me to return to Singapore to work one day.  After working just 3 years since leaving Uni, I am getting a five figure salary a month and much higher than what a normal engineer is getting in Singapore.  It is no surprise now why there are no more engineers left in Singapore and I can't see why a Singaporean studying overseas will want to return to Singapore to work for less money.  Competition is fierce in the UK for skilled people and the companies in UK are mostly MNC which compete for international contracts and businesses.  So it really boils down to nature of the business and the market that you are satisfying. </p>
              <p>Danny from Bristol </p>
