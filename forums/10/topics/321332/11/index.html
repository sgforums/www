              <p>I don't think Singapore is a hot destination for people. Most Chinese see Singapore as more of a stepping stone: a place where they can learn English in an environment where most people can speak Mandarin, so that they can later move to the USA and take up citizenship there. Some people say that the Chinese who come here are actually the worse ones. Apparently, the best go to the US, the second-tier stay in China and only the lousy ones come here.</p>
              <p>As for Singaporeans migrating overseas, as a Singaporean living in Australia, I must say that life here is very stressful unlike in Australia. Over in Australia, the minimum annual leave is 28 days. In Singapore, it's only 7 days. In Australia, road sweepers and cleaners can afford a holiday in France or England. In Singapore, the same type of people will be lucky to even visit Bangkok once in their lifetime. In addition, in Singapore, you are always pressed to meet tight deadlines at work while in Australia, you can have all the time in the world to finish your work as taking things slow is part of the Australian culture. And of course, Australian bosses are generally more family friendly than Singaporean bosses. Just look at the number of Singaporean women who have been sidelined in the company just because they get pregnant. While I currently do not plan to give up my Singapore citizenship, and I have already served my NS, I think that we still have a long way to go if we want to convince more locals to stay.</p>

              <p>I don't think Singapore is a hot destination for people. Most Chinese see Singapore as more of a stepping stone: a place where they can learn English in an environment where most people can speak Mandarin, so that they can later move to the USA and take up citizenship there. Some people say that the Chinese who come here are actually the worse ones. Apparently, the best go to the US, the second-tier stay in China and only the lousy ones come here.</p>
              <p>As for Singaporeans migrating overseas, as a Singaporean living in Australia, I must say that life here is very stressful unlike in Australia. Over in Australia, the minimum annual leave is 28 days. In Singapore, it's only 7 days. In Australia, road sweepers and cleaners can afford a holiday in France or England. In Singapore, the same type of people will be lucky to even visit Bangkok once in their lifetime. In addition, in Singapore, you are always pressed to meet tight deadlines at work while in Australia, you can have all the time in the world to finish your work as taking things slow is part of the Australian culture. And of course, Australian bosses are generally more family friendly than Singaporean bosses. Just look at the number of Singaporean women who have been sidelined in the company just because they get pregnant. While I currently do not plan to give up my Singapore citizenship, and I have already served my NS, I think that we still have a long way to go if we want to convince more locals to stay.</p>

This is especially true for the immigrants from the Indian continent. Singapore is to them a Chinese dominant society after all. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">like the indians, the mainland Chinese moved to countries all over the whole, not just USA. Chinese in the US, Canada, UK don't have to speak english if they have relatives or friends there. They don't have to come here to learn english to migrate. And Singapore can't accept all the PRC who want to migrate, we can choose who we want because there are more applicants than we can accept. We feel the heat.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Some people say that the Chinese who come here are actually the worse ones. Apparently, the best go to the US, the second-tier stay in China and only the lousy ones come here.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Hehe, who are the some people? Who are the best and who are the worse? It is simplistic to think that the PRC only migrate to US, Singapore or stay at home. Ever read the news about some illegal PRC migrants bound for UK were suffocated to death in containers? The PRC are everywhere in the world. Why would the lousy ones want to come here and endure higher costs of living, need to speak english, 'suffer' under a government that is worse than the communists?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">As for Singaporeans migrating overseas, as a Singaporean living in Australia, I must say that life here is very stressful unlike in Australia.

In Singapore, the same type of people will be lucky to even visit Bangkok once in their lifetime.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">again, I agree with you on the stressful lifestyle in Singapore. But Australian road sweepers can cleaners can afford a holiday in France or England? hmmm....another simple statement. Check with the somebody who told you such story how they made it. I have no doubt they can do it. But I do know of Singaporean, working as cleaner, who visit Bangkok once every two month! not once in their life time. There are also many old Chinese Singaporean, retired clerks, are visiting China twice a year. They are with the Teochew tour group led by the TCS actor Chen Shu Cheng. How they made it?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">in Singapore, you are always pressed to meet tight deadlines at work while in Australia, you can have all the time in the world to finish your work as taking things slow is part of the Australian culture.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Again, this I agree. I lost my credit card in Sydney, and it took them bloody 7 working days to have a replacement ready for collection. Whereas in Singapore, they returned to me the next day, delivered to my house. dammn...this is why I had the habit of leaving my card around.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">While I currently do not plan to give up my Singapore citizenship, </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">This again is wisest statement of all, for your own good. Just one more, help make the changes you want singapore to be. Don't just stand around downunder waiting for changes.</span></p>

              <p>In my NUS class, there was this one person who claimed that his final goal is to work in the US. Some preferred to go back to China.</p>
              <p>But there are still a few who would still prefer to stay in Singapore, but none of these few that I know got any first class honours from our so called world acclaimed university.</p>
              <p>Seriously, from personal experience, those foreigners in NUS are not exactly so good that they snatch up all the As. There's quite a substantial number of Singaproeans graduating with first class honours. The only notable thing about these PRC scholars is that they are extremely hardworking. I believe their study time is easily twice to thrice of mine.</p>
