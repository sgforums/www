              <p>Yep, I agree.. our gahmen refuse to give the common folks their money at 55.  Yet they don't come up with a discrimination law to protect these group of people.</p>
              <p>They want people like your mom and many more senior folks to eat grass. Because these are the likely group of people to NOT make the minimum sum anyway.</p>
              <p>That is why dude.. work hard.. and move out.</p>
              <p>Singapore is not longer a place for sane human to live beyond 50 ( unless you are rich).</p>

              <p>You are free to call them beggars if thats how you are being taught to do. On the same note, people living on welfare can also be classified as freeloader of society.

              <p>personally, i am disheartened with the changes here in the last 3 years. i have always maintained to my better half that i would like to remain here. we are doing ok. however, she is quite adamant of leaving due to the `stifling' education system our kids are going thru'.  so, we decided to move out this nov after the school term ends.</p>
              <p>i will stay on for another few months to fulfill personal obligations but unfortunately the `push' factors is overwhelming. will things be better on the other side? who knows but i guess it is up to us to make the best of it. </p>
