            <div class='col-md body'>HK has the backing of rich affluent china businessmen in supporting the market. If you have been tracking the HK property trend, you would notice that the HK property artifically high price was mainly due to the creative work of the HK people who tried to "push" the property values during the property boom era before 1997. Many of these HK people came to Sinagpore and created some mini property bubble in 1994-1995, which eventually forced the gov to clamp down these speculative activities by introducing the 20% cash downpayment for private property.<br><br>HK property after the dot.com burst, was in a mess. Many HK properties has becoming a negative assets for the owners. Despite the HK property price has been adjusting in the past 3 years, their HK property average price is still more expensive than Sg due to the inflow of capital from mainland chinese.<br><br></div>
