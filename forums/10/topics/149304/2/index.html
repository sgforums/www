The fact that they pay in pounds already makes it 3 times more.<br><br>Besides, although they pay workers more, they rake in more cash too because of their general cost of living and larger population / demand..<br><br>And just one question, how do you think foreign companies / MNCs prospered despite paying their workers way more than what the average company pays in Singapore?

By the way, if HK is a closer proximate of SG, so are the big cities in developed countries where "land is scarce and the population density is high, blah blah blah". Now, why then are the cost of housing in these cities not as high as SG's?<br><br>I don't agree about all developed countires being the same. Firstly, people get paid MORE in developed countries like US and Australia. Yes, their taxes are higher but the extra money they get balances their books..<br><br>Anyone who says their housing is more expensive compared to SG's must be kidding.

But have you ever wondered what the 2<br>biggest financial handcuffs of the avarege Singaporean are?<br><br>Answer: a) The House and b) The Car.<br>These are essentially fixed illiquid assets which cannot be easily taken<br>off-shore. And these are also the two biggest items on the average Singaporeans<br>list of expenses. They provide a stable income/revenue stream for the bloated<br>coffers of the government bureucracy and also physically shackles citizens to<br>this island.<br><br>The following commentary by Robert Schwartz, chief economist for a strategic<br>research unit in Australia, was written as part of a Singapore Studies project.<br>For more information on the project and other articles, please visit JGNews at<br>www.jamesgomeznews.com<br><br>Read on and discover how and why the PAP Government financially handcuffs the<br>average Singaporean.<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------<br>Singaporean spending not central to Singapore economy<br>by Robert Schwartz, 20 Jan 2005<br><br>Writing about Singapore's economic outlook is boring.<br>It's not that there is nothing to say, it's that there<br>is nothing to say about Singapore itself. A pertinent<br>discussion of Singapore's near term prospects for the<br>first half of 2005 has to start with the effects of<br>the tsunami. This then would segue over to the actions<br>of America's Federal Reserve Bank, which in turn would<br>be followed by a pithy, yet substantive, look at the<br>global electronics cycle.<br><br>Where do the people of Singapore fit into this<br>analysis? Hopefully as readers of this piece, but<br>that's about as far as it goes.<br><br>In 2001, the Ministry of Trade and Industry published<br>a paper that looked at the four primary, long term<br>drivers of Singapore's economy. The number one<br>influence was growth in the United States. Number<br>two? Growth in the economies of Indonesia and<br>Malaysia. Third was global semiconductor sales. And<br>rounding out the top four was domestic construction.<br><br>But wait, you might say, what about Singaporeans' love<br>of shopping? Certainly that has to count for<br>something? You're right it does. The problem is that<br>Singaporeans love of shopping is usually done<br>someplace other than Singapore. The fastest growing<br>component of private consumption over the past decade<br>or so has been Resident Expenditure Abroad.<br><br>Of the spending done in Singapore, the fastest growing<br>type of retailer (by far) has been motor vehicle<br>dealers. From 1997 to the third quarter of 2004,<br>dealership sales had increased by a total of nearly<br>260%, not including the effects of inflation. The<br>next fastest growing category was supermarkets, which<br>grew by a total of nearly 32%. Overall, non-motor<br>vehicle retail turnover grew, excluding inflation, by<br>a total of 7.1% from 1997 through September 2004.<br><br>The key to Singapore's retail sector is not the<br>average Singaporean. The key to retail in Singapore<br>is the overseas visitor. If you want to get a handle<br>on how well the sector is doing, look at the growth in<br>visitor numbers. These have traditionally led the<br>retail numbers.<br><br>So again, where does this leave the people of<br>Singapore? In their government housing units voting<br>for the PAP every so often and that's about it. As<br>far as making the economy move forward, the average<br>Singaporean is a non-event. And as such has little<br>say in the political environment. No economic clout =<br>no political constituency = no audible political<br>voice.<br><br>The consumer's share of Singapore's economy is around<br>42%. This compares to about 55% in Japan, a country<br>notorious for saving, and close to 70% in the United<br>States. It is not coincidental that the average<br>American, who is such a vital part of the US economy,<br>has such a central role in the political sphere.<br><br>In fact, the average consumer in the United States has<br>more power over the direction of the Singapore economy<br>than does the average Singaporean. It is the<br>continually increased spending on ever more<br>gadget-filled electronics equipment or on a new<br>lifestyle drug done by a typical American that drives<br>the sales which drive Singapore's production.<br><br>To be fair to the government, it knows that any money<br>spent on boosting the consumption of average<br>Singaporeans is money that will very quickly find its<br>way to foreign shores. As such, the PAP has decided<br>that it would prefer not to spend its hard-earned tax<br>revenues boosting the local economies of Batam, Johore<br>or Bangkok.<br><br>This is also why the government's interest in the<br>domestic consumer economy is limited to construction.<br>This is a section of the economy that can't be taken<br>out of the country. The problem here is that by the<br>mid-1990s the residential property was way ahead of<br>the average Singaporean in terms of price,<br>affordability and location. As a result, the property<br>sector took a serious dive. Furthermore, neither the<br>public nor private housing markets have come close to<br>hitting the highs reached in 1996/1997.<br><br>The problem with this emphasis on property is that it<br>has handcuffed many Singaporeans. A typical private<br>residence bought between the beginning of 1994 and the<br>beginning of 1998 has, at best, not appreciated. At<br>worst, this homeowner could have held onto this asset<br>for over a decade and have it being worth less today<br>than when it was purchased. This means that a<br>Singaporean family could been paying off a mortgage<br>that was higher than the value of the property itself.<br>This negative equity is extremely depressing, both<br>economically and psychologically.<br><br>Alright, so where does this leave us? Talking about<br>things far from Singapore's borders. And, quite<br>frankly, it's a bit boring, not to mention impolite,<br>to talk about other people's lives instead of your<br>own. But when your lives don't count for much,<br>economically, there just isn't much point to a conversation.<br><br></div>
