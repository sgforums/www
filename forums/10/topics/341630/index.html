Guys look we voted for the government U take ownership of the government WHOM U GUYS CHOSE and be responsible for it suck it up and take these things into consideration instead of blaming the government we have for every bad thing we have suffered and not even thanking them for the good things they have provided for us. Guys its called thinking and looking at it in a bigger perspective den looking at it in tat small perspective where all u guys wanna be great and rich while in this recession where every country is affected. Have u guys seen japan's answer? look at their drive and their passion to be the number 1 country out of the recession. They are pouring out everything they have but its only a gamble its not a sure win if they lose out japan might be gone so aren't u guys lucky we have such good leaders who are not reckless like those in japan?</p></div>

              <p>The leaders of Singapore is unlike the past, when they keep telling you what to do and what not to do. Today, they tried to remove this spoonfeed culture of the past, they wanted singaporeans to be globally involved and the mindset of a global citizen. The influence of higher education and wiser mentality set a different scenarios of leadership and citizenship relationship.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The govt expect us to ride the crisis out together rather than they telling you what to do and what to expect, the global impact is something beyong our leader and individual control. It is true that we may no longer listen to them and they may no longer whipping us to carry out task becos both are exposed and accessed to global knowledges such as internet, books etc etc. Even a professor can be corrected by a student if he teaches the wrong concept.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The concept today focus on learning and struggling together, no more iron rice bowl nor spoon feeding ya.</p>

              <p>ok i'm not realli sure about wat u guys are thinking or what u guys have heard but look people there is a recession now and the reason why u guys were getting bonuses in the past were becasue we were doing well as a country and as the name says BONUSES its only a BONUS its something extra that you earn due to the boosting economy during those times but now that our economy is down because of the US isn't it better to cancel the bonuses den to take people's jobs and leave thousands of people jobless cuz of the recession and cause many people to lose their families as a result? Isn't it better to be juz like : people having pay cuts (where they still can deposit in their bank and earn off the interests rates) instead of people losing their jobs and in the process losing all their money they earned in the past including compounded interests where it would be a lose lose situation for both US CITIZENS and the government whom we hate so much? Guys look we voted for the government U take ownership of the government WHOM U GUYS CHOSE and be responsible for it suck it up and take these things into consideration instead of blaming the government we have for every bad thing we have suffered and not even thanking them for the good things they have provided for us. Guys its called thinking and looking at it in a bigger perspective den looking at it in tat small perspective where all u guys wanna be great and rich while in this recession where every country is affected. Have u guys seen japan's answer? look at their drive and their passion to be the number 1 country out of the recession. They are pouring out everything they have but its only a gamble its not a sure win if they lose out japan might be gone so aren't u guys lucky we have such good leaders who are not reckless like those in japan?</p>
