              <div class="articleAuthorName">
              <p><em>Despite the problems of the ruble and the weak
                  oil price in recent months for the Russian economy, the Russian
                  Government is pursuing a very active foreign policy strategy. Its
                  elements focus on countering the continuing NATO encirclement policy of
                  Washington, with often clever diplomatic initiatives on its Eurasian
                  periphery. Taking advantage of the cool relations between Washington
                  and longtime NATO ally, Turkey, Moscow has now invited Turkish
                  President Abdullah Gul to a four day state visit to discuss a wide
                  array of economic and political cooperation issues.</em> <br><br>In
                  addition to opening to Turkey, a vital transit route for natural gas to
                  western Europe, Russia is also working to firm an economic space with
                  Belarus and other former Soviet republics to firm its alliances. Moscow
                  delivered a major blow to the US military encirclement strategy in
                  Central Asia when it succeeded earlier this month in convincing
                  Kyrgystan, with the help of major financial aid, to cancel US military
                  airbase rights at Manas, a major blow to US escalation plans in
                  Afghanistan.</p>
              <p>In short, Moscow is demonstrating it is far from out of the new Great Game for influence over Eurasia.</p>
              <strong>
              <p>Warmer Turkish relations</p>
              </strong>
              <p>The Government of Prime Minister Recep Erdogan has
                  shown increasing impatience with not only Washington policies in the
                  Middle East, but also the refusal of the European Union to seriously
                  consider Turkey’s bid to join the EU. In the situation, it’s natural
                  that Turkey would seek some counterweight to what had been since the
                  Cold War overwhelming US influence in Turkish politics. Russia’s Putin
                  and Medvedev have no problem opening such a dialogue, much to
                  Washington’s dismay.</p>
              <p>Turkish President Abdullah Gul paid a four-day visit
                  to the Russian Federation from February 12 to 15, where he met with
                  Russian president Dmitry Medvedev, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, and
                  also travelled to Kazan, the capital of Tatarstan, where he discussed
                  joint investments. Gul was accompanied by his state minister
                  responsible for foreign trade, and Minister of Energy, as well as a
                  large delegation of Turkish businessmen. Foreign Minister Ali Babacan
                  joined the delegation.</p>
              <strong> </strong>
              <p><strong>Visit to Tatarstan </strong></p>
              <p><strong>The fact that Gul’s Moscow visit also included a stop in Tatarstan, </strong>the
                  largest autonomous republic in Russian Federation whose population
                  mainly consists of Muslim Tatar Turks, is a sign how much relations
                  between Ankara and Moscow have improved in recent months as Turkey has
                  cooled to Washington foreign policy. In previous years, Moscow was
                  convinced that Turkey was trying to establish Pan-Turanism in the
                  Caucasus and Central Asia and inside the Russian Federation, a huge
                  concern in Moscow. Today clearly Turkish relations with Turk entities
                  inside the Russian Federation are not considered suspicious as it was
                  once, confirming a new mood of mutual trust.</p>
              <p>Russia elevated Gul's trip from the previously
                  announced status of an ‘official visit’ to a ‘state visit,’ the highest
                  level of state protocol, indicating the value Moscow now attaches to
                  Turkey. Gul and Medvedev signed a joint declaration announcing their
                  commitment to deepening mutual friendship and multi-dimensional
                  cooperation. The declaration mirrors a previous ‘Joint Declaration on
                  the Intensification of Friendship and Multidimensional Partnership,’
                  signed during a 2004 visit by then-President Putin.</p>
              <p>Turkish-Russian economic ties have greatly expanded
                  over the past decade, with trade volume reaching $32 billion in 2008,
                  making Russia Turkey's number one partner. Given this background,
                  bilateral economic ties were a major item on Gul's agenda and both
                  leaders expressed their satisfaction with the growing commerce between
                  their countries.</p>
              <p>Cooperation in energy is the major area. Turkey's
                  gas and oil imports from Russia account for most of the trade volume.
                  Russian press reports indicate that the two sides are interested in
                  improving cooperation in energy transportation lines carrying Russian
                  gas to European markets through Turkey, the project known as Blue
                  Stream-2. Previously Ankara had been cool to the proposal. The recent
                  completion of the Russian Blue Stream gas pipeline under Black Sea
                  increased Turkey’s dependence on Russian natural gas from 66 percent up
                  to 80 percent. Furthermore, Russia is beginning to see Turkey as a
                  transit country for its energy resources rather than simply an export
                  market, the significance of Blue Stream 2.</p>
              <p>Russia is also eager to play a major part in
                  Turkey's attempts to diversify its energy sources. A Russian-led
                  consortium won the tender for the construction of Turkey's first
                  nuclear plant recently, but as the price offered for electricity was
                  above world prices, the future of the project, awaiting parliamentary
                  approval, remains unclear. Prior to Gul's Moscow trip, the Russian
                  consortium submitted a revised offer, reducing the price by 30 percent.
                  If this revision is found legal under the tender rules, the positive
                  mood during Gul's trip may indicate the Turkish government is ready to
                  give the go-ahead for the project.</p>
              <p>Russia’s market also plays a major role for Turkish
                  overseas investments and exports. Russia is one of the main customers
                  for Turkish construction firms and a major destination for Turkish
                  exports. Similarly, millions of Russian tourists bring significant
                  revenues to Turkey every year.</p>
              <p>Importantly, Turkey and Russia may start to use the
                  Turkish lira and the Russian ruble in foreign trade, which could
                  increase Turkish exports to Russia, as well as weakening dependence on
                  dollar mediation.</p>
              <strong>
              <p>Post-Cold War tensions reduced</p>
              </strong>
              <p>However the main message of Gul's visit was the fact
                  of the development of stronger political ties between the two. Both
                  leaders repeated the position that, as the two major powers in the
                  area, cooperation between Russia and Turkey was essential to regional
                  peace and stability. That marked a dramatic change from the early
                  1990’s after the collapse of the Soviet Union when Washington
                  encouraged Ankara to move into historically Ottoman regions of the
                  former Soviet Union to counter Russia’s influence.</p>
              <p>In the 1990’s in sharp contrast to the tranquillity
                  of the Cold War era, talk of regional rivalries, revived ‘Great Games’
                  in Eurasia, confrontations in the Caucasus and Central Asia were
                  common. Turkey was becoming once more Russia’s natural geopolitical
                  rival as in the 19<sup>th</sup> Century. Turkey’s quasi-alliance with
                  Ukraine, Azerbaijan, and Georgia until recently led Moscow to view
                  Turkey as a formidable rival. The regional military balance developed
                  in favor of Turkey in Black Sea and the Southern Caucasus. After the
                  disintegration of the USSR, the Black Sea became a de facto ‘NATO
                  lake.’ As Russia and Ukraine argued over the division of the Black Sea
                  fleet and status of Sevastopol, the Black Sea became an area for NATO’S
                  Partnership for Peace exercises.</p>
              <p>By contrast, at the end of the latest Moscow visit,
                  Gul declared, ‘Russia and Turkey are neighboring countries that are
                  developing their relations on the basis of mutual confidence. I hope
                  this visit will in turn give a new character to our relations.’ Russia
                  praised Turkey's diplomatic initiatives in the region.</p>
              <p>Medvedev commended Turkey's actions during the
                  Russian-Georgian war last summer and Turkey's subsequent proposal for
                  the establishment of a Caucasus Stability and Cooperation Platform
                  (CSCP). The Russian President said the Georgia crisis had shown their
                  ability to deal with such problems on their own without the involvement
                  of outside powers, meaning Washington. Turkey had proposed the CSCP,
                  bypassing Washington and not seeking transatlantic consensus on Russia.
                  Since then, Turkey has indicated its intent to follow a more
                  independent foreign policy.</p>
              <p>The Russian aim is to use its economic resources to
                  counter the growing NATO encirclement, made severe by the Washington
                  decision to place missile and radar bases in Poland and the Czech
                  Republic aimed at Moscow. To date the Obama Administration has
                  indicated it will continue the Bush ‘missile defense’ policy.
                  Washington also just agreed to place US Patriot missiles in Poland,
                  clearly not aimed at Germany, but at Russia.</p>
              <p>Following Gul's visit, some press in Turkey
                  described Turkish-Russian relations as a ‘strategic partnership,’ a
                  label traditionally used for Turkish-American relations. Following
                  Gül’s visit, Medyedev will go to Turkey to follow up the issues with
                  concrete cooperation proposals. The Turkish-Russian cooperation is a
                  further indication of how the once overwhelming US influence in Eurasia
                  has been eroded by the events of recent US foreign policy in the
                  region.</p>
              <p>Washington is waking up to find it confronted with Sir Halford Mackinder’s ‘worst nightmare.’ Mackinder, the ‘father’ of 20<sup>th</sup> Century British geopolitics, stressed the importance of Britain (and
                  after 1945 USA) preventing strategic cooperation among the great powers
                  of Eurasia.  </p>
