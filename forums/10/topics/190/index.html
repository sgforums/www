I understand how you feel. I would also be as angry as you if i hear these shit about my country. I'm a Singaporean but i don't have any special hatred for Malaysia anymore. (last time got)<br>I understand how you feel but you got to understand that the Singapore Armed Forces is indeed superior to the Malaysian Armed Forces. This is recognised by countries all around the world. Even if the United States offers to upgrade the 8 RMAF F/A18D into F standard and also offer to help form a complete squadron, it would be useless against our specially configured F16D 'Spine', which is superior to the RMAf F/A18 in terms of numbers and capability.<br><br>What i really think is that the Singapore and Malaysian government should work side by side, hand in hand and fight against terrorism. We are related geographically and historically and we should be great allies! Terrorism is not very active in SEA but they are out there! Look at Channelnewsasia and you guys will understand how wide Osama's link is; around the globe! Take a look at the terrorist attack on U.S WTC towers... it came unsuspected, unpredicted. Its so sudden. We must not say that it won't happen to Singapore, it MAY. If terrorist activities is being spotted up north into Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia in the south or Philippines, Singapore can play a major role, if we form an Alliance. our large inventory of UAV, RF5S can be used as reccon platforms. With our well units like the Guards Battalions (FIBUA), Commandoes (long-term reccon and sabbotage attack in jungle), our strike aircrafts meerging with the Malaysian soldiers, F/A18 strike aircrafts, it can be a powerful assault force rite. If we join with Thailand, it can be even more deadly, coz we conducted many exercises with them. Theres a bond between us.<br><br>Sincerely, this is what i feel. The FPDA is weak ( I think ). A new alliance is needed e.g Singapore, Malaysia, thailand, brunei and Philippines. Maybe our government is thinking about this right now...Hee....<br>Your comments pls.<br></div>
