I would also be as angry as you if i hear these shit about my country. I'm a Singaporean but i don't have any special hatred for Malaysia anymore. (last time got)<br>I understand how you feel but you got to understand that the Singapore Armed Forces is indeed superior to the Malaysian Armed Forces. This is recognised by countries all around the world. Even if the United States offers to upgrade the 8 RMAF F/A18D into F standard and also offer to help form a complete squadron, it would be useless against our specially configured F16D 'Spine', which is superior to the RMAf F/A18 in terms of numbers and capability.<br><br>What i really think is that the Singapore and Malaysian government should work side by side, hand in hand and fight against terrorism. We are related geographically and historically and we should be great allies! Terrorism is not very active in SEA but they are out there! Look at Channelnewsasia and you guys will understand how wide Osama's link is; around the globe! Take a look at the terrorist attack on U.S WTC towers... it came unsuspected, unpredicted. Its so sudden. We must not say that it won't happen to Singapore, it MAY. If terrorist activities is being spotted up north into Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia in the south or Philippines, Singapore can play a major role, if we form an Alliance. our large inventory of UAV, RF5S can be used as reccon platforms. With our well units like the Guards Battalions (FIBUA), Commandoes (long-term reccon and sabbotage attack in jungle), our strike aircrafts meerging with the Malaysian soldiers, F/A18 strike aircrafts, it can be a powerful assault force rite. If we join with Thailand, it can be even more deadly, coz we conducted many exercises with them. Theres a bond between us.<br><br>Sincerely, this is what i feel. The FPDA is weak ( I think ). A new alliance is needed e.g Singapore, Malaysia, thailand, brunei and Philippines. Maybe our government is thinking about this right now...Hee....<br>Your comments pls.   </div></blockquote>Guards are not only well-versed in FIBUA. It doesn't matter whether it's putra jaya, the idiotic twin towers or any bloody kampong. We'll destroy, conquer and wiring up all the c4s in these malaysian buildings.............</div>

Cause if so, I sincerely hope you wun get elected into goverment. ( No offense meant )<br><br>If countries go to war, just because can't talk peacefully, then there would be countless conflicts oredi.<br><br>War is *NOT* a game, real people *DIE*. It is not a glorified matter, as shown in the movies. For eg. We cannot agree with our friends up north on a number of issues, e.g. CIQ, water etc.....but does that mean we take our M16 and resolve the issue with bullets?<br><br>Do you want your Singapore like what's India and Pakistan is going through? Not happy, whack each other with weapons?<br><br>Although SAF strive to have the ability to have a swift and decisive victory, it's meant to act as a *DETERANCE*. It's to make the other party think twice, and make sure talk stay as talk...not into war.<br><br>Yes...I will report back camp when the times comes, but hopefully the reason is not bcos of some dumb politicians can't see eye to eye.<br><br>[This message has been edited by wombat (edited 09 June 2002).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dun underestimate the PT-91. It has a very good western (French SAGEM, I think) FCS, and a powerful cannon to boot. It only lacks in the area of armour, which is not really that much of a proble, considering they face only the threat of our current 105mms.</div>

Fwah, much worse than I expected. Didn't really bother to check. sorry. But only goes to show how lousy our tank's anti-armour capability is.<br></div>

I think the SAF top brass somehow forgot that armour still has a place in jungle warfare as well as in built-up areas. Look at how the Israeli use their armour to full extend with great effectiveness. So far, only 1 of their Merkeva was blown up and that was due to a trap and some 50 kg of TNT !!!<br><br>I think some sort of 105mm armed light tank is in the pipeline (rumour has it that it will be a design from STEngg based on Bionix chassis). We just have to sit and wait.<br><br>Another thing that I have heard was that it really depends who is the chief of army at any given time. If the Chief of Army comes from the arty background (trying not to name names here...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">, then of course the arty units are going to get all the nice toys. Just look at how many new toys they have got since the late 80s till now, M72, FH88, FH2000, LH105, and now LWSPH). If the next Chief of army comes from one with armour background, I'm sure the armour units will get more and better vehicles other than the Bionix. Maybe a whole new gen of vehicle based on Terrex and a Bionix 105mm gun platform, maybe even some foreign designed tanks to replace the Centurions as well...<br><br></div>
