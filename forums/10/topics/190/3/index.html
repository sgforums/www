            <div class='col-md body'>I heard something like 20+ units. Got me real puzzled, cause there would be no sense in designing a whole new weapon and procuring it with such low numbers. You seem to suggest that there are more units involved, is that right? Could you then post a guestimate on how many you think are in service? thanks.</div>

In your post if what you suggest is correct, then there should be active units using M72S (Singapore upgraded version of the old Israeli Soltam M72 guns), but that is not the case. The arty guys who use FH88 during active service get retrained to use the M72S.<br><br>Retraining during annual reservist is nothing new. I know of guys who used to drive M113 get retained to drive the Bionix. Rifleman retained to use the new S21, etc...<br><br>Given how similar FH2000 and FH88 are, I can't see why FH2000 guys can be retained to use FH88 during their 13 years reservist.<br></div>

However, I think your number of possible guns/vehicles is abit over inflated. Even working 24x7, it could not chunk out that amount within 1-2 months.

It HAS the Longbow radar.<br><br>Given that the original FMS contract for the 8 AH-64Ds(1st order) also DID NOT contain Longbow(the radar was provided for in a separate FMS contract with the radar's manufacturer, not with Boeing, and was announced MUCH LATER that the helo order), I would not be surprised that the 12 we have on order will also have the Longbow radar, but the order has not been announced yet, considering that we've ordered the 2nd batch of 12 in Aug 2001, expect a low-profile(ie not in Straits Times) announcement in the coming months.</div>

The vehicle would have been built to handle the gun's recoil, and I think that it would be a reasonable assumption that the recalibrating problem would be minimised through design optimisation. (otherwise why put a 120mm cannon on it if the chassis cannot handle it, or the gun has to be recalibrated after every few rounds fired?)<br><br>BTW, here's some latest news on Singapore's JSF participation...<br>"The Pentagon said on Thursday it was discussing special deals to bring Israel and Singapore into development of the Joint Strike Fighter aircraft. "We have not determined exactly what the relationship is going to be," said Edward Aldridge, the Pentagon's chief weapons purchaser. "We're still in negotiations with them."<br>Aldridge said he hoped Australia would begin negotiations on joining by July 15, the deadline he has set for invited countries to declare at least their intent to join.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi guys, I just found this page:<br><br><a href="http://www.dsta.gov.sg/newsroom/2001/report/220601_jane_singapore_deconstruction_forges_ahead.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.dsta.gov.sg/newsroom/2001/report/220601_jane_singapore_deconstruction_forges_ahead.htm</a><br><br>there are a few interesting points I would like to raise from the article for discussion...<br><br>1.<br><blockquote><br>More clearly fulfilling a local requirement, Singapore bought 54 United Defense LP M109-series SPH chassis. These will be fitted with an indigenous 155mm/52-cal turret, but the programme's timetable is not known. Firepower may eventually be further strengthened by acquiring a multiple-rocket launcher system. Although Singapore has so far hesitated to introduce such a capability to the region.<br></blockquote>Is SAF arty units going for a big boost? True SP (tracked) vehicle? MLRS type weapons?<br><br>2.<br><blockquote><br>commando battalion is re-equipping with high-speed boats capable of reaching 70kt.<br></blockquote>Wow, I never knew any boats that can go 70kt. Even the Navy Seals don't have such boats. I wonder how acurrate this figure is....<br><br>3.<br><blockquote><br>The SAF says the four SjÃ¶ormen-class submarines, two of which are now in Singapore and two in Sweden, were obtained for training. The boats have operational capabilities, but originally date from the mid-1960s and are fairly small, at a displacement of 1,210 tons (dived). Industry sources say the evaluation process is still under way, but they expect this to lead to an order for substantially more sophisticated submarines before the decade ends. </blockquote>Looks like RSN may get more new subs pretty soon....<br><br>BTW, this articule was published in the Janes Defence Weekly, but reproduced in DSTA website. Interestingly, the comments made must then be right on the dot for DSTA to reproduce it.</div>
