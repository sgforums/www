IMHO, I think land based Aster-15/30 or Barak may replace the Rapier and possibly something else to replace the I-HAWKs.<br><br>As for the Israeli Phalcon thing, I think the 4 may not be us. BTW, don't you think that 2 Phalcon is a little low in number for Israeli themselves?  Singapore may purchase Phalcon, but I think we will still have to wait another couple of years to see if that is the case. Given RSAF recent upgrade of E-2C, I can't see RSAF want to spend more on an AEW system other than LALEE.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I dunno, but that was what was reported in the article. They've been facing a budget shortage in recent months, and with the mobilisation of their forces, expenditure is surely diverted from procurements. Perhaps they want a gradual replacement of their Hawkeyes?<br><br>"Given RSAF recent upgrade of E-2C, I can't see RSAF want to spend more on an AEW system other than LALEE."<br><br>Are you sure the LALEE is an AEW system. I have always thought the LALEE was a maritime surveillance or ground surveillance aircraft. Having a fully autonomous, unpiloted AEW system is a concept that has not been envisaged by any other armed force in the world. I doubt that Singapore would try something like that.</div>

However, US and Australia is working on a radar for the Global Hawk to perform AEW tasks. The same kind of radar could be carried by LALEE. The advantage of using a large UAV as AEW platform is that they are more afforable and thus more numbers could be purchased and deployed at the same time. Furthermore, the cost of losing one is not as great as losing a manned AEW platform.<br><br>In my opinion the best ROI RSAF can obtain from the Hawkeyes are to upgrade them to the 2000 standards and install CEC capabilities unto the Hawkeyes. RSAF could purchase 2 more ex-Israeli Hawkeyes to boost the number to 6 instead of 4 and thus extend the lifespan of the airframes.<br><br>LALEE could then be purchased to fulfil the maritime and  ground surveillance, with the ground surveillance having a SAR radar that can act like a miniture J-STAR.  Some LALEE could be armed with a capable phased array radar for AEW job.<br><br>I guess the alternative is to totally phased out the Hawkeyes and get something more advanced like the 767-Phalcon, or Wedgetails.<br></div>
