            <div class='col-md body'>Why do a large number of arabs and muslims think that Palestinains are the only one suffering? What about the Israelis? For a Palestinain state to exist, the arabs must recognise the existence of the State of Israel. The reason for Israel incursion is brought on by the Palestinian themselves. They want peace, first of all, they have to initate it by stopping the sucide bombing. I wonder what type of mentality these sucide bombers possess? A dead martyr is still dead, where he ends up after that is anyone guess. What matters most are the ones who are still alive. If being a martyr is really that great, one can't help wondering why the leaders of these terrorist organisation don't do it? In my opinion, IDF is not a terrorist organisation. It was forced to take such drastic step to protect her own citizen.<br><br>A thought before I end, maybe the sucide bomber organisation might want to have a taste of their own medicine. Locate their headquarters, and packed loads of C4 in there. After that just sit back and enjoy the fireworks.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm not surprise with that at all. What the MAF did in 1969 was a horribly ugly truth.<br><br>The MAF DID carry-out massacre in several Chinese village in 1969. Go &amp; ask anyone who is over 50 years old, living in KL in mid-May 1969; &amp; they will tell u plenty of encounters (or experience) regarding the massacre done by MAF.<br><br>I got relatives who are staying in KL during the massacre period (13 May 1969). According to them, there was a massacre outside a cinema. It happen that on that terrible day, there are many audience inside this cinema (that filmed chinese movies). My relatives, who always watch movies there, actually went to that cinema with the intention to buy tickets. Know what they encounter? MAF soldiers SHOOTING those chinese who run out of the cinema! Probably those chinese must have heard of gun-firing noise &amp; therefore running out of the cinema, hoping that they can run to a safety place. Unfortunate, the MAF soldiers were waiting outside &amp; fired at anyone they saw.<br><br>Since such thing can happen in the town area of KL, massacre which happened in villages or rural areas are not surprising at all.<br><br>Do some information digging, read more books, or talk to some elderly M'sian citizen, &amp; you will get plenty of reliable information.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by tripwire:</div><div class="quote_body">Got this from the news:<br><br>**If i remember correctly... it wasnt really that long ago that MAF was filmed by Aussie reporters for massacreing an entire chinese village in 1969....<br><br>** The BIG BLACK POT calling the isrealis TERRORIST!!! ahhaahaaa.......<br><br></div></blockquote></div>

This article was published in The AGE (An aussie newspaper), page 11, on 12 Feb 1992. Cameron Forbes is the author.<br>----------------------<br><br>Title : "Bloodying The Deep Waters Of Diplomacy".<br><br>IN TROPICAL Malaysia, where the rain thunders down and the vegetation rushes up towards the sky, a parang is a marvellous all-purpose tool. Heavy and flat-bladed, it hacks through small trees and jungle vines. It harvests crops. But a parang can have darker uses.<br><br>`Turtle Beach', the film based on Blanche d'Alpuget's novel, opens with the swirling violence of the 1969 race riots during which Malays, driven to a fury by perceived threats to their political dominance, took to the streets against the immigrant-descended Chinese and Indians.<br><br>Australian photo-journalist Judith Wilkes is at the centre of chaos. Buildings burn, people flee, Malays stalk and chase, and she watches with horror as a parang lops off the head of an Indian.<br><br>Later in a scene of sustained brutality at Turtle Beach itself, parangs are at work again. Judith Wilkes sits on the sand with Minou, a Vietnamese refugee, who hopes desperately that her children have joined the boat people. Nature here is beautiful; man is vile. Minou tells Judith how giant turtles which haul themselves on to the beach to lay their eggs are tormented and exploited by Malay villagers. ``Disgusting people they are,'' Minou says.<br><br>A decrepit boat, packed with refugees arrives off-shore and men, women and children leap overboard to try to make it to land. While Wilkes (played by Greta Scacchi, who asked for her role to be more active) is being heroic, along the shining sand run perhaps 40 Malays, a couple wearing the white cap that shows they have been on the Haj, the pilgrimage to Mecca. Most carry parangs.<br><br>They rush into the water in a slashing, stabbing frenzy. Eventually a contingent of Malaysian police drives them off and they leave bodies gently rocking in red water.<br><br>For Blanche d'Alpuget, `Turtle Beach' the novel is a work of art which has a moral focus and follows Tolstoy's precepts: ``Tolstoy said a work of art is new, it's clear and it has an effect for good.'' She says the moral concern of the novel is the treatment and plight of the boat people, for whom Australia must take a share of responsibility because of its role in the Vietnam war.<br><br>FOR producer Max Carroll, `Turtle Beach' the film is also an opportunity to say something about the condition of boat people and the violation of their human rights. Like d'Alpuget he has strong personal feelings about the matter.<br><br>But for the governments of Australia and Malaysia, the film, which will open across Australia on 19 March, threatens a fragile diplomatic peace. Immediately Blanche d'Alpuget saw the finished film last October, she rang the then Prime Minister, Bob Hawke (for whom she has been the preeminent biographer), and warned him he should prepare to undertake damage control.<br><br></div>

RACIAL and political tensions were already brewing prior to the 1969 general election.

A 24-year-old Chinese male was killed after he and other men in his group, who had been painting signs on the road, refused to follow police instructions and instead, put up a fierce struggle.<br><br>With the Communists spoiling for a fight by waging their campaign for an election boycot, the man's funeral on the day before the general election turned into a day-long Communist political demonstration.<br><br>The election results showed the ruling Alliance Government suffered heavy losses.<br><br>On May 12, to celebrate their unexpected election success, the Opposition parties held a victory procession in the city. The processions, some with and without police permits, went on until the next morning. That day, political tensions peaked.<br><br>Casualties from the violence totalled 196 dead, inclusive of 15 unidentifiable bodies found in the Klang River and disused mining pools. Another 439 were wounded.<br><br>Over 5,000 were prosecuted for various offences, with 21 charged for murder and 15 for murder and arson.<br><br>From the senseless violence also emerged the true heroes of May 13: the unsung heroes who either worked alone or in their respective organisations, risking life and limb to provide help and care to over 27,000 refugees trapped in 11 locations throughout the Klang Valley. Abdul Razak Ahmad writes.<br><br>Braving the riots to offer aid M.A. Malik, a businessman and Rotarian:<br><br>I WAS at the Royal Selangor Club during the afternoon of May 13, when someone reported a commotion at Lembah Pantai, which at the time was just a ramshackle collection of houses and one petrol station.<br><br>The first reports were sketchy - it seemed some people had attacked motorists passing through the area, and that a curfew had been declared. My first thought was that I had to fetch my wife, who worked as a staff nurse at the General Hospital.<br><br>Driving back to my house through Lake Gardens to Bangsar, traffic was chaotic. I reached home and called the Petaling Jaya Police Station. The OCPD, whom I knew, said he needed help to transport civilians trapped by the curfew to their homes.<br><br>I told them I would need documents to enable me to travel during curfew, so they arranged them for me.<br><br>A group of citizens including myself later organised ourselves to deliver food supplies to residential areas facing shortages, as all shops were closed at the time.<br><br>At one stage I went to Klang and met a shopkeeper who told me he had abandoned his van, which was filled with eggs, at a petrol station in Pantai Dalam. He told me I could have all the eggs if I could get his van back.<br><br>So I subsequently got a car boot's worth of eggs which I distributed to anyone I met who needed them. And for those trapped in their houses with few supplies, the eggs were a godsend.<br><br>Apart from the Red Cross car stickers and arm bands, I managed to get around town in my car during curfew by putting up a `siren' on my car roof. Actually it was just an magnetic emergency beacon, but it worked. People thought I was an official!<br><br>I managed to drive right into Kampung Baru, which was one of the worst areas hit by the violence. The mobs didn't set on me. They were grateful for the supplies I brought.<br><br>I thought I was brave, driving around town during curfew. But when I went to the General Hospital mortuary to help a family claim a member felled by the violence, I saw how bad it was.<br><br>The mortuary was just stuffed to the brim with dead bodies. It's the sort of thing you see on television happening in war-torn countries like Bosnia.<br><br>I thought I was brave. After seeing the conditions at the mortuary I realised I was wrong.<br><br>When the violence ended, I understood that a stack of letters of commendations had been issued for us by the OCPD, waiting to be signed by Selangor Menteri Besar Datuk Harun Idris.<br><br>Those letters were never signed.<br><br>Of gunfire and horrific wounds Dr B. Jagdev Singh, a member of a medical group practice who volunteered to attend to victims at the General Hospital:<br><br>I RECEIVED a call at about 12 midnight (May 14) by the Red Cross secretary-general. The Kuala Lumpur General Hospital was short of doctors, and I was asked to volunteer.<br><br>The troubles had begun at 6pm earlier that evening, and by 8pm the first wave of mainly slash-wounds and gun shot victims were streaming in.<br><br>I was stationed at the emergency ward and spent the whole night attending to the victims. What struck me was that the wounds were the type you would normally encounter during war.<br><br>One patient almost had his leg severed when someone hacked at his calf with a machete. In another case, a young boy had inadvertently peeked out of his window at home when a bullet sliced through his cheeks, smashing his jaws.<br><br>The biggest difficulty though was handling panicked relatives who were looking for missing relatives.<br><br>Nobody knew where anybody was. There was a curfew.<br><br>And since there was a curfew, some of the hospital staff had difficulty getting in.<br><br>It was fortunate that I had an armed forces background, because I managed to call a friend in the army and requested a platoon of soldiers, ambulances and a Land Rover to help collect and escort hospital staff from their homes.<br><br>At the time, University Hospital was barely in operation. The main hospital, apart from the General Hospital, was Assunta in Petaling Jaya.<br><br>I also remember receiving a call to attend to a maternity case in Kampung Pandan. An Irish nun, two nurses and myself went there, and we parked the ambulance near a field.<br><br>The houses there weren't numbered, so we had to ask around to locate the call. Suddenly shots were fired at us. The nun, who had army training, yelled at everyone to lie flat on the ground. We were scared out of our wits.<br><br>The violence really drove home the point that for a doctor like myself, the best formula would be to condemn violence of any sort. Any trouble started by a few will ultimately affect the whole spectrum of society.<br><br>A country in chaos and fear Salena Karim, a writer, who was six years old at the time:<br><br>MY parents were studying in England, but my father had come back to Malaysia before her so there was only him and me. I couldn't speak a word of Malay then.<br><br>Malaysia was a new country to me. My dad and I put up with my grandfather, who was the sub-Inspector at the Campbell (now Dang Wangi) Police Station.<br><br>My strongest memory of May 13 was standing outside my grandfather's house in the police compound and wondering why the padang in front was empty. It was very quiet.<br><br>So I went to the police station's fence and that's when I saw them - Federal Reserve Unit personnel - in their blue and red uniforms and their truncheons and their riot gear.<br><br>They were literally yelling, charging up the road in front of the station into a crowd that was moving towards the station in turn.<br><br>My grandmother yelled for me to come in, but I just stood there transfixed by the charging men in their blue and red uniforms.<br><br>My father was not home throughout this whole episode. I wrote my father's name with a question mark on a piece of paper and showed it to my grandmother.<br><br>Since she could only speak Malay and write Jawi and I could only understand and write English, it did not amount to much. My father had gone to Kampung Baru, and he got stuck there, `apprehended' by a group of persons who thought he was Chinese.<br><br>My uncle, who was living there at the time, had to extricate him.<br><br>That night I was awakened by a commotion. There was a loud pounding on the walls of my grandfather's quarters, of people trying to get in.<br><br>There were several Chinese families, some of them Chow Kit market traders, who were either made homeless from the violence or were trying to seek refuge.<br><br>My grandmother knew them all. She let them in. That night every inch of my grandfather's floor space was filled with sleeping bodies.<br><br>I had to tiptoe over them to go to the outhouse, and I saw in the compound many people who had come to seek shelter. There were many people crying.<br><br>My grandmother was crying too. She knew all these people.<br><br>Selfless dedication of Red Cross Datuk Ruby Lee, then secretary- general of the the Malaysian Red Cross Society:<br><br>ON May 13 at about 6pm, I was at the Malaysian Red Cross Society's National headquarters at 519, Jalan Belfield, attending a youth camp with about 200 Red Cross (now known as Red Crescent) Youth members. The police phoned to say that a curfew had been declared indefinitely because of the civil commotion.<br><br>There was violence and bloodshed in certain areas in Kuala Lumpur and later because of the curfew almost everyone was stranded and had no food. It was nearly 6 or 8pm and from that time onwards, Red Cross members and I spent the first three days and nights without sleep and food except for coffee, trying to harness human resources and organise immediate medical assistance and food supplies to all those caught in the civil commotion.<br><br>Our appeal by radio for Red Cross volunteers to report for duty at Malaysian Red Cross Society (MRCS) headquarters met with immediate response. Many bravely came forward in their Red Cross uniforms and reported for duty with the assistance of Armed Forces personnel. Some even brought along canned foodstuff given by their parents.<br><br>Doctors, nurses, wives from foreign missions, members from the Lions Clubs, Rotarians, Malaysian Medical Association, YWCA, and numerous other NGOs totalling over 600 persons volunteered their services.<br><br>Red Cross volunteer doctors were busy at the General Hospital together with other medical personnel whilst others were at MRCS national headquarters in Jalan Belfield, responding to emergency calls for medical aid and food.<br><br>Amidst the tension, fears and uncertainties, everyone worked without regard of their personal safety. Their sole purpose was to alleviate human suffering and save lives regardless of race, colour or creed.<br><br>Later, some were at the Chin Woo and Merdeka Stadium and the Selangor Badminton Hall attending to the evacuees and re-packing food supplies. Response from the supermarkets, sundry shops and petroleum companies (for the supply of cooking gas cylinders) was spontaneous. I have yet to receive any bills from them!<br><br>There was MRCS officer Mohd Noor Mat, who risked his life while waiting for MRCS first aider M Govindasamy who had rushed into a house to carry a badly injured woman into the waiting ambulance.<br><br>On seeing the mob advancing towards him, Mohd Noor could have driven off but he waited and shouted for "Govinda" who managed to rush out carrying the injured woman in the nick of time.<br><br>A shot missed my husband, (Datuk) Douglas Lee, who had just delivered some food supplies to a squatter area near the old airport in spite of him wearing a Red Cross arm band.<br><br>My memories of May 13 will always be with the volunteers and parents who encouraged our MRCS members to report for duty, and all those in the community who took care of one another by providing shelter and security.<br><br>Their services in the cause of humanity during such a critical time should always serve as an inspiration to all those who are finding ways to reach out to the hearts of men and women to prevent unnecessary suffering.<br><br></div>
