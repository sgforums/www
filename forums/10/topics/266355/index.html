            <div class='col-md body'>I think the main reason why Indo is going back on its' words is they have decided that they should squeeze more outta SG.....like getting SG give more free handouts .......in terms of monetary benefits .......<br><br>Well.....it never fails with the Indons ...... signs an agreement with SG....says eveything will go smoothly....than ......say that it cannot be implement due to such and such a problem .......to the Indo they blame SG for the hiccups....sigh!!<br>Just look at the agreement to fight the haze.......SG pumps in 50mil.....Indon says this year can cut as much as about half [i think, i may be wrong..hmmm  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> ], than Indon gov says ......new legislation to allow small time farmers to practice slash and burn as they are only small time farmers with small time land.... Only big plantations will be banned from slash and burn tactics...WTF!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br>Don't they know that 100 small time farmers' slash and burn methods will produce more smoke and haze than 1 big plantation??  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>Anyway.....why should the haze fund that SG pumps in go to help the big plantations?? It should go to help the small time farmers, these farmers dun have the money or expertise to switch to other land clearing methods.<br><br>Maybe what the Indo really want is some grease on their hands.....than agreements can go smoothly.........like need to grease the hole first before having smooth entry and withdrawal without any pain.....hahahaha!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br></div>
