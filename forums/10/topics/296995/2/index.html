You just can't accept the fact that you cannot compete in the real life, as I have pointed out in another thread?<br><br>So do you, since you were a child, not receive any pocket allowance from your parents at all? The difference between me and some of my friends is, I don't spend money till I have none... My friends, they spend till they have none in the bank every month -.-<br><br>Anyway, factor in a conservative estimate of 10k savings from the army. Remember, my NSF term was 2yrs 4 mths with the increased allowance structure, not the measly $240 per month for recruits in your time.<br><br>Hmmm, factor in an estimate of about $400 a month, transport and everything else you mentioned, in your calculations. This is already spending a lot per month for me.<br>And hor, don't need to be so stupid to include lodging de. Don't tell me you support the PAP so staunchly and do not stay with your parents. That would be very unfilial of you.<br><br>If you like, you can factor in an additional $200 a year from IPPT, or maybe measly average of $100 from ICT a year.<br><br>Also can factor in part-time work ($6 per hour type), say a total of $200 from last time till now<br><br>Any other factors you want to factor in.<br><br>Anyway, I would not consider the 24k debt because I'm planning to pay it with my salary (you can check out starting pay for 1st class honours). I'm talking about savings, not about accounting for that matters. Even if I have borrowed from a bank, it would still be interest free during my years in the uni.<br><br>The most important thing is to plan ahead in life. Trust me, I have planned all these since my army days, with many refinements along the way till now.<br><br>In addition, don't tell me you don't have any personal savings now... If you have personal savings, that would mean you kept money from your parents too, right?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
