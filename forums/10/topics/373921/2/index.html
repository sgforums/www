              <p>Certainly, the political arena of Japan is completely different from others, and infact, all political situation in each individual country is different, we should therefore, learn the good and evade the bad. It is like a game, whether you play the japanese, malaysian or thai version, you follow their way and culture, but if you are playing Singapore game, u need to be realistic and watch your ass. </p>

              <p>Inorder to attract top thinktank, we need to pay them corporate level paid, our policy in singapore do not believe in retirement packages, not all our ministers work until retirement, if the 1st world nation paid retirement packages, so be it, an entirely different way of wage structure, in the end of the day, it voice down to same same, but different ya</p>

              <p>ministers are given world class pay and good benefits.      It is "crime" to ministers for singaporeans not to accept low salary jobs.      It is in the agenda of the ministers that singaporeans must accept low salary jobs whereby they are required to work on jobs that required 2 to 3 staff doing it.   They  have got CDC to brainwash Singaporeans that the employment trend these days is to accept more work and get lowly paid.</p>
              <p>If they so support this trend why is it that we are not seeing ministers doing a few ministers' jobs and get lowly paid?   As leaders, they should show us good examples.</p>
              <p>Crap!</p>
