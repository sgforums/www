Teacher Dominic Chua, 30, who lives in Marine Parade, said: 'I haven't voted before, but I would like to... It reminds me that we're a democracy.'<br><br>Ms Nurzilawaty Hamid, 28, who is unemployed and lives in the opposition-held Potong Pasir, believes 'it's for our own good that we choose the better MP'.<br><br>Dr Amy Khor, mayor of Southwest Community Development Council and an MP for Hong Kah GRC, said: 'To me, these statistics show that increasingly more youths want to exercise their democratic right to vote, to be involved in choosing the Government or have a say as to who should represent them.<br><br>'This is really a healthy sign...With rising education and affluence, more would want to participate in the electoral process.'<br><br>Almost 45 per cent will be disappointed if there was a walkover in their ward. But as wharf operations supervisor Fadzil Zakaria, 29, said: 'We can't do anything about it.' Like eight in 10 young Singaporeans surveyed, he has never voted.<br><br>In the last four general elections, the number of uncontested seats have risen from 11 in 1988 to 41 in 1991, 47 in 1997 and 55 in 2001. This walkover effect on young voters is significant because since 1988, close to 500,000 young Singaporeans had turned 21 and were thus eligible to vote.<br><br>The lack of opportunity to vote for so many could be one reason for the lack of interest in local politics among youths, said Dr Terence Chong, a sociologist at the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies.<br><br>'It seems that younger citizens are split into two camps - those who are disappointed not to get to vote, and those who just don't care. If there are more walkovers, those who are disappointed will just switch off and not care anymore,' said Dr Chong.<br><br>About 55 per cent agreed with the suggestion of holding a referendum in uncontested constituencies. Television producer Wang Eng Eng, 27, said: 'No contest does not mean the people are satisfied with the choice of MPs.'<br><br>Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC MP Charles Chong is not surprised that so many favour a referendum.<br><br>'Even though there is no real option, voters want to have an element of pressure on their MPs.

            <div class='col-md body'>Try asking any person on the street and their concern would most probably fall on bread and butter issues than the balance of power in the constituency. Can both parties in the contituency get down and work out solution to tackle problems or would such a divide results in power struggle between two 'armed camps'? Can a person who gave wonderful speeches and promises during the electory period get things workout the way he wants? If the first questionary statement that I made hold truth, then the second questionary statement might faced difficulty in the course of implementation. This is one of the fallacy of <span style="font-style: italic;">democracy in constituency</span> although it did works perfectly on citizens naming their leader but failed to achieve its ultimate aim. This sadly, cannot be remove unless something can be done to the human nature vying for power. What I as a commoner can do and see, is whether government polices are at least effective or they had tried their very best in tackling bread and butter issues for its people are more paramount in my agenda. To speak a word of fairness, as far as I have observed, the imcumbent party had done a splendid job in economic issues except perhape due to the market forces of demand and supply, that is already the best they could have done so far yet at present. Social welfarism on the other hand, which has been shelved aside for so many years is what I am hoping to see in upcoming elections.<br><br>As for me, my principle remains that that it doesnt matter who hold powers. As long as the equity prevail, stability and peace reigned throughout the nation, jobs are plentiful, international trade are foster, cost of living are suppressed, welfarism given, economic stability achieved, independent judicary established, defence as well as law and order reinforced. Does it matter who holds power? I know I am open for scrutiny under such statement but I too are equally bewilded in one aspect. Assuming that the balance of works in the reversed, in a utopia world, shouldnt such a system be done away with while good men or women continued joining just one party, check and balance can still be achieve or suppress equally.<br><br>From:<br>A rational thinker <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br></div>

Not all issues need to worry about implementation lag, only probably economic issues. In fact, certain issues - say education - would benefit from a longer period of decision-making that arrives at a much better long-term result than a hastily-made decision. Also, the improvements in communciations technology make it far easier to transmit information and express opinions - barring laws which restrict freedom of speech and whistle-blowing - between various parties, most notably the people and the government, so the decision lag shortens considerably. No decision can be made instantaneously - tt would be hasty and inimical to national growth in teh long run because it does not consider all the factors.<br><br>4) It is true that one needs to give the national leaders a level of trust, but at the same time, there needs to be level of mistrust as well. This mistrust will help to provide the chance fro whistle-blowing. In the case of a bank, the customer knows that he or she can always withdraw money at any time; this knowledge of withdrawal acts as a form of security that enables the customer to trust the banker's professionalism; it acts thus as a contingency plan. Similarly, in politics, we need a contingency plan to prevent the government from brainwashing the people the way the Nazis did in 1930s Germany, to prevent the fostering of jingoism, which is already becoming apparent in our society and in the eyes of foreigners, be it Malaysians or Chinese.<br><br>5) Your proposals sound nice, but do you actually think teh government will implement them?<br><br>G_ day,<br>the pikamaster (who hopes for a contest in AMK GRC)</div>

In the same breath, however, all young singaporeans surveyed expressed "strong dislike" for the Straits Times.<br><br>The survey was conducted over the course of 10 years and all 3 million respondents were aged between 1 and 3 years of age. A Straits Times Spokeswoman said, "This reflects the high levels of illiteracy among young singaporeans. It is no wonder they hate our illutrious newspaper. They are afriad of words! In a way, this is good because it sends a wake up call to the government. This epidemic cannot be ignored anymore."<br><br>Away from the Straits Times HQ, however, the consensus was unanimous. One young fella put it like this: "Its full of lies, damned lies, and statistics!".<br><br>The lack of good, insightful and intelligent coverage of the upcoming general elections was cited by over 9/10 of respondents as the greatest factor for their dislike of the Straits Times.  The other 1/10 largely disliekd the Straits Times because there weren't enough b<strong></strong>reats on show. One well-travelled 3 year old complained, "Why can't the newspaper follow the examples of overseas tabloid like The Sun? That newspaper has a naked girl on page 3 almost everyday!"<br><br>In case the Straits Times is on the phone to its lawyers already, this correspondent would like to make clear that there is, in fact, no survey conducted. This entire article is a work of fiction and is nothing more than a lame attempt at humour.
