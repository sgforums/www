              <p>Okay, let's analyze your post:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>I see that while we are debating about terrorism and all the side incidents, we are detracted from seeing the rising scourge of an <strong>imperialistic religion</strong>. <strong>The secular world allows freedom of worship, and they flourish all over the world.</strong> And they are also quick to cry foul if they are in anyway impeded in the secular world.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><strong></strong> </p>
              <p>Imperialistic means the attitude of superiority, subordination and dominion over foreign people— a chauvinism and comportment relegating foreign people to a lesser social and or political status.</p>
              <p>So maybe we should suppress all religions right since they posses an danger towards we free men?</p>
              <p>What is a secular world?</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><strong>But where they reign supreme, they have no qualms about harrassing people of other faiths.</strong> Yes their theology allows people of other faith to practice freely, so claims the "moderates", but in reality, the reverse is practiced. You can see for yourself.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>So whose fault? The people or the religion? You seems to be confused...</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>While this debate is going on we fail to see through the facade of peace created by the moderates, and this allow the fundamentalist and militants to march on.</p>
              <p>The moderates by their wimpishness, unwittingly supports the militants.</p>
              <p><strong>Where are the street protest, when there are repeated beheading and other atrocities in the name of their god?</strong> Why is there an out cry when a stylised word "AIR" happens to resemble the word for their god? Which is of greater abomination?</p>

              <p><br>Roy, those texts were written for a time and a place of our barbaric past. Since then we had progressed far beyond that when it was written and was not meant to be mis-interpretated to 'suit all occasions'.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>These great religions sprang from the desert lands of the arab penninsula. We asians theoratically have no affinity nor would greatly identify with the mess and chaos from that past.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>1) Religion is developed to create a sense of spiritual calmness. However, the <strong>teachings must be revised to keep up to current times</strong>. <strong>Failing which, it will fail</strong> <strong>to protect its followers and allow terrorists to claim them</strong>. Thus, Islam is not the only religion already twisted by terrorists, but other religions are in danger too.</p>
              <p><strong>We have reached a point where no one religion or country is safe from terrorism</strong>.</p>
              <p><strong>We ought to help them in any way.</strong></p>
              <p>As for political, nationalistic cause, sadly to say, it's an abuse. The culprits have defiled what their ancestors taught them.</p>
              <p>2) As for the invasion of Iraq, i have to be blunt--It's all about <strong>OIL</strong>. saddam doesn't want to give it to them, america bomb the shit out of iraq and kicked saddam out of power.</p>
              <p>Needless to say, the invasion has only made the whole situation murkier than ever....no one knows what's going on...</p>

              <p><br>i don't know what's the big deal between the difference of want and need, but as who i am, i think human is only a trivial being, sometimes it's not you taking the decision, but it's how you are created, make you make the decision.</p>
              <p>People can feel contend in different way, but the ultimate goal for religion is to achieve liberation, i think none of way which can make you feel content in the secular world ,can not compare the contentness in religion term.</p>
              <p>The world is full of religion, how you can stay out of this, you may have some religious friends, you may go to temple to pray for fortune. THe novel da vince code is the best selling book, there is no way for you could stay out of this</p>

              <p>It had happened in our past, thus we must put an end to it today. And unfortunately, the ones using religion as a tool to achieve political dominance currently in our times is radical Islam, with the most body bags count of innocents specifically targeted.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Terrorists groups such as the Jap red army, baideer meinhoff, ETA, etc combined  cannot even begin to compare to the support and dammage radical islam had done to innocent humanity in undeclared war.</p>

              <p>i think both US govenment ,which represent christianity, and radical islam is trying to achieve political dominance, but US is rich, strong, so, He is the one who create the standard, to judge who is good , who is evil, that's why people tend to slam radical islam, more,</p>
              <p>I think many forumer have cite many example of US government's wrongdoing, so i don't need to cite more.</p>

              <p>For those intellectual fundamentalist religious scholars who
              wish to challenge my post, i ask that you desist in bringing
              historical twisted baggages as a defense to confuse and
              detract.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I only ask that you answer one simple question, and it will make
              your stand clear:-</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'Are we, who do not share your faith, infidels?'</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If your answer is is, then your mental moral threshold is higher
              to accept the terrorists murders as justifiable, for there is no
              crime in a village mullah inspired killing of
              'disbelievers/infidels' anytime, anyplace and anywhere, in the
              indoctrination of you in your faith.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If your answer is no, then aren't you challenging the very word
              of your deity, whom is all you have when you took that leap of
              faith to suspend logic and reason in order to believe?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you can believe that one word from an almighty can be wrong,
              then what more is there to believe in other words and
              teachings?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I know it is tough to be a moderate and stay true to religious
              beliefs. It is a moral dilema daily. Some chosed to use hypocrisy
              or be apathetic and live in delusion.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Our own lives are not important, but for the sake of others and
              the next generations to come, it is a moral dilemma and a hard
              question we MUST confront and tackle it once and for all, as we
              come to grips and attempt to make sense of the brutal tragedy
              before our eyes.</p>

              men, with honour, battle it out to settle our differences, instead
              of using cowardly brutual senseless killings of innocents in
              non-declared combat zones.</p>

              <p>what make you think that religious leaders are not doing anything? i'm sure they would not like to have their religion besmirched by some fanatics.</p>
              <p>aren't you a bit simplistic to expect changes to happen overnight?</p>

              <p><br>7 years had passed by, my dear. 7 years to correct one simple mistake - misinterpretations. In that time, a 6 year old kid would have passed his PSLE exams, a JC student would have gotten his University degree, etc..need i elaborate more?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Worse still, there had been cases of funding for these deviants of the great Islamic faith. Who had been sympathising with them? They should have been wiped out 7 years ago, yet they still exist not only in the middle east, but even in s-e asia.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is incredulous that the Islamic faith could issue international 'Fatawas' against writers or act against couples kissing in public, and yet here the deviants are flagrantly besmirching their religion, which they admitted in 911, not only continues to walk boldly, they could even get funds and support!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Lotus, you may be a kind and soft hearted person, but i am sure that when a terrorist gun is pointed at your head, for terrorism has no mercy for anyone and anyone could be a target, with the trigger ready to pulled, you will be singing a different tune.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Let's you and me appeal to the Islamic faithful to act more decisively on a global scale, even requesting they perform 'evangelical' preaching into terrorists hotspots around the world, excommunicating errant mullahs or imans, to stop this targetting of innocents. If not, it will be other humans will have to do the job, one way or another, which we must avoid and avert. </p>

              <p>1) Religion is developed to create a sense of spiritual calmness. However, the <strong>teachings must be revised to keep up to current times</strong>. <strong>Failing which, it will fail</strong> <strong>to protect its followers and allow terrorists to claim them</strong>. Thus, Islam is not the only religion already twisted by terrorists, but other religions are in danger too.</p>
              <p><strong>We have reached a point where no one religion or country is safe from terrorism</strong>.</p>
              <p><strong>We ought to help them in any way.</strong></p>
              <p>As for political, nationalistic cause, sadly to say, it's an abuse. The culprits have defiled what their ancestors taught them.</p>
              <p>2) As for the invasion of Iraq, i have to be blunt--It's all about <strong>OIL</strong>. saddam doesn't want to give it to them, america bomb the shit out of iraq and kicked saddam out of power.</p>
              <p>Needless to say, the invasion has only made the whole situation murkier than ever....no one knows what's going on...</p>

              <p>Agree with you except for the 2nd point. Best we cleared it up once and for all so that there can be no sympathising or excuses for terrorists acts.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Let us depend on facts and NOT on conspiracy theories.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Fact is, US attacked Iraq because Sadam, the expansionist despot who invaded and murdered even people of his own religion, not only Iran but kuwait as well, had used the possesion of nuclear weapons or the lack of it to threaten the rest of the world.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Despite several datelines being redrawn to ensure that there is really NO nuclear weapons with this madman, he failed and ignored every plea from every fearful leader in the world to allow inspections. There was no need to hide anything.  These are supposed nuclear warheads we are talking about, capable of wiping out a population and render the land uninhabitable for years, as well as the drift of nuclear wastes into the atmosphere destroying neighbouring lands, not a piece of seditious paper.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>US did what it had to do, to ensure there really was no nukes, even though the CIA initially said there was. Casualties were kept to a minimum, and when the war was over in days, they had wanted to go home.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What ensued was that the outlawed Al Queda seized the opportunity to enter Iraq, and turn the US fight against Sadam, which the population welcomed and waved with american flags, into a religious war, for years as a measure to keep the iraq weak, killing its govt officials and security forces,  and US confined in Iraq without linking up its armies in afghanistan. ( even now, it is attempting to make the US ally Pakistan engage in a war with india to prevent the allies from helping US. Al Queda must be bleeding now) </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There had been conspiracy theories abound, but please, conspiracy theories are only good for reading on a bored night, but not based on actual fact. While there may have been complexities, let us sort out the facts and agree upon first.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Like a jigsaw puzzle, we look for corners and straight edges first in order to unravel a puzzle. Similarly, let us get the facts straight first before we even comtemplate the complex stuff, if it even exists, just like Elvis aint dead is even now still believed.</p>

              <p>Naturally, the US didn't bring Saddam to power.</p>

              <p>Oh yeah....it was the US who sold Saddam the biochemicals to gas the Kurds.</p>

              <p>It makes me sick when people like you can deny blatant historical facts and label it as "conspiracy theories".</p>
              <p>When the US claims it is spreading freedom and democracy round the world, do you really believe it? When they prop up a narcotics state like Kosovo after some "humanitarian bombing", stir up chaos in the Middle East and continue to destabilise Latin America, it really shows how effective the MSM conditioning is.</p>
              <p>No one needs conspiracy theories, we need some straight talk instead of bullshit bold-faced lying rhetoric.</p>

              <p>Saddam tried to build nukes, but his experimental reactor got bombed by the Israelis. Rather than a rogue program, <strong>Saddam's nuclear program was built up by the French</strong> who wanted to curry favour with oil-rich Iraq.</p>
              <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osirak#Design_and_construction">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osirak#Design_and_construction</a> (Again, even Wikipedia acknowledges this "conspiracy theory" despite how I hate quoting from Wikipedia).</p>
              <p>After the Israeli bombing in 1981, Iraq, which was enbroiled in war with Iran (in which Iraq used <strong>chemical weapons from the US</strong> against the Iranians) could have hardly resurrected its nuclear program. Coupled with the 1991 mini Shock and Awe, and the 10 years+ bombing by enforcing Western warplanes, the Iraqi military was in no shape to pose a threat to the 2nd Iraq Invasion.</p>
