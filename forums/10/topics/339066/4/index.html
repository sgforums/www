              <p><br>Rokkie, you are the very kind of people with ignorance that i and others must help, regardless if you are only 10yrs old or 100 years old, instead of insulting your ignorance.Then you can maximize the result of the destruction</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>YOu will have to differentiate between wars, and terrorism.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Mankind can understand the philsophy of having to wage war inorder to have peace. It will try all means to avoid it through compromises and diplomacy, but if it is inevitable, then allow it to come to pass.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But even in war, there are rules to it and not a free for all melee. Basically, the time, date and location of warzones are officially declared.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The weak or children are moved away and kept in a safe location for both sides. There are many other rules commonly accepted thru the ages, than i can list here, read it up and you will be more familiar.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If there is a fire in a house, and you are told to get out or you sneak in and died from the fire while firemen are trying to extinguish the fire, you are a 'collateral dammage'.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Similar in wars where people gets hurt. They must stay away from combat zones, and not place their women and children there while a fight is on. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But terrorism is not war. It is undeclared, not by soveriegn states, kills and brutally slays innocent men women and children instead of combatants anytime, anyplace and anywhere. This is not acceptable to mankind who had grown civilised.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>There are many wars start without declaration, i remember in a tV serial, they said, military commandor declare war with their weapon,  war is not negotiation, you must attack them without being expected.</p>
              <p>US attack alot zone surveillance living in, as you said we should attack the combat zone, with military infrastructure, no where surveillance live.</p>
              <p>why now in iraq ,and afganistan, so many anti US atmosphere going on, because US treat all the military solider and the surveillance the same, so later the surveillance got self armed, and attack US military,</p>

              <p>I can understand what you are trying to say.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Once war is declared, armies will attempt to destroy critical infrastructures such as military installations, airport, military barracks, munition factories, etc, to deny the enemy forces a chance to retaliate, and in time, make the enemy forces quickly surrender.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This was achieved earlier in Iraq when the campaign started. There were collateral dammages, but kept minimum due to the high tech bombs which  were specifically created and guided to hit critical targets without doing much dammage to surrounding areas. Iraq gave up the fight, and a new govt was formed to lead Iraqi society.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But now, US is bogged down for years in Iraq fighting in built up areas where civilians lived. The only reason why they are doing so is because despical terrorists, cowards that they really are, chosed to hide amongst the civilians, knowing full well the dangers they pose to innocents caught in the crossfire, instead of courageously facing the US army in open ground, which these animals boast so much about.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Iraqi civilians, govt officials and civil servants had been murdered along with US soldiers. The only capable security force in Iraq is the US, and have a responsibility to the Iraqi society to keep the peace, thus they have to pursue the animals to prevent further killings.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The bigger picture that many failed to realize is that it is part of an overall strategic aim by Al Queda to keep seperate the 2 american armies in the middle east - one in Afghanistan and the other in Iraq. Should US leave Iraq, its armies will link up in Afghanistan, presentating more troops, more equipment and better logistics to battle Al Queda.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thus the real enemies in Iraq is not US, but Al Queda, for it is sending its cowards into Iraq to achieve that aim. Iraq has already an elected govt, and a tired of war society. But unfortunately for them, they are but cannon fodder to Al Queda, whom will kill anyone, muslim or non-believers, for its own survival.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'If it bleeds, it can die and can be killed' is a common army barrack philosophy when dealing with unknown beings. Al Queda, unfortunately is not a monster that bleeds.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Al Queda is an ideology monster where bullets will fail, for you cannot fight a deep rooted ideology with bullets, but with a similar weapon -  a better and more progessive ideology. Idealogy monsters are like weeds -cut the grass and another grows in its place. You will need to cut the root.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For years, the US army had failed to discern the real enemy troops under their very nose. The real soldiers are NOT the terrorists. They are but dogs to be manipulated, taught, used and then discarded when their shelf lives are over.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The REAL soldiers are not carrying weapons, but instead carries the Koran, dressed with white robes and turban, sporting a goatee.</p>
              <p>They live simple and frugal lives, and do charitable works to win over the hearts of simple folks. With the hearts opened, the soldiers than sought to corrupt their minds with 'misinterpretations' of the Koran to do the bidding of Al Queda.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For years since 911, many had attempted NOT to discuss about religion, made it a sensitive topic for fear that it may drive moderates into the arms of fundamentalists for protection.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However, for that reason, it may have done the same by our silence, with evidence of the international muslim faith turning fundamentalist, creating fundamentalist societies and seek to be governed by fundamental philosophies of the Koran.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Moderates had no support in their fight against fundamentalism. No one discusses religion actively, logically and rationally to help support the moderates change mindsets.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The moderates were alone, facing a brutal and ever ready to kill fundamental supporters. Perhaps, resulting in them surrendering, reducing them to apathy.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The only way to fight ideology is with another ideology.-a better and more honest ideology - Education of the masses through the media, no more sympathizing of terrorism, keeping the public updated on the nefarious activities of the animals, challenge the fundamental teachings against our internationally accepted standards of human rights without fear and correct misinterpretations within  public sphere. Nothing should be deemed 'sensitive' where the lives of voiceless and fearful humans are at stake, but must always remember we are all humans and share the common ground of right to believe, but it does not entail and encrouch upon others' rights to live peace too.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Cut down on Homeland security spending for bullets and bombs, but spend it on personnel to actively reach out to the poor, the uneducated and the disenchanted,  to battle for their minds. It is an ideological battle in the fight against terrorism and the battle is in the mind of humans and not in the caves of Afghanistan.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>WIth political and religious will, only then can this heinous ideology be destroyed, the way the world destroyed the ideology that Earth is flat, Aryans are a master race, Westerners are superior than squat yellow buck tooth japs, blacks are stupid and  have no hope in a white dominated society, etc, etc.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I would like to say this piece is only my 2 cents worth, but it would demean the soul searching, inspiration and cracking my brains to come out with it. I am a nobody and generally apathetic, in a site with minority viewers, and under no illusions that what i had written would ever be adopted.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But if by fortunate chance it does, and my measures are ever even remotely adopted, i would like to dedicate it to Ms Lo Hwee Yen, our first tragic casualty in the war of terrorism, and call it the 'Lo Hwee Yen Principle - fighting a deep rooted idealogy with another better and honest ideology'.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It characterised her life - from humble background but leapt into success in life thru merit, against the ideology of elitism that only the elites from birth will succeed in life. And if the measures i had outline will ever be adopted, it will also be a victory and vengence against the terrorists who brutually deprive her of a life ahead of her. It was her tragic and brutal death that compelled me start and contribute to this thread, and i will not allow my young fellow citizen's death be in vain.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But i must also add that if there are any errors, mistakes, silliness or ambiguities, they are solely mine and i am fully responsible. No one else is.</p>

              <p>We really need to burn the Koran, bomb the Kaabah and round up all people of the muslim faith. Best thing we can do is to gas them all but at least we should make them wear special identification so that we can restrict their movements and limit their breeding.</p>
              <p>I believe the amount of collateral damage can be limited because most muslims will renounce their faith if this were to occur and they will become peace-loving Christians, Buddhists of just agnostics, even better aitheist. This is the power of violence, it can turn evil moon-worshiping satanist terrorist animals to peace loving aitheist peasants who willingly tend the food production and service industries for their loving elite masters. Why if the Israelis can do it to the Palestinians, why can't we do it to our own muslim neighbours.</p>
              <p>With a UN mandate and copious amounts of newly minted dollars, I'm sure this Great Project, can be realised with minimum fuss coming from these weak (but nevertheless terroristic) muslims.

              <p>Right, those smart bombs were really smart. So smart that only 1 million civilians were killed in the second Iraq invasion (not counting those in Afghanistan). So smart that their <strong>DU fragments</strong> caused Iraqi cancer rates to skyrocket so much so that the genetic integrity of the Iraqi people is forever damaged.</p>
              <p>I'm sure that if Singapore was occupied by a foreign power, all those with some balls would be resisting against the occupiers, as with during the Japanese Occupation. As the saying goes, "One man's terrorist is another's freedom fighter". (If fire fighters fight fire and crime fighters fight crime, what do freedom fighters fight? Well, not in this context.). Iraqi resistance against the US Army is not the work of Al Qaeda. In fact, the Pentagon's own study last year admitted that <strong>Al Qaeda was non-existent during Saddam's rule</strong> (hence, no link to 9/11, if Al Qaeda was responsible for that [yeah right...]). Recently they estimated that there were only about 6000 Al Qaeda in Iraq. When you call those patriotic Iraqis "despical terrorists", it only shows how much bullshit you believe about the US's 'altruistic' and law-abiding behaviour. (I would hesitate about the "well-educated" part Stevenson)</p>
              <p>How can you call them cowards when <strong>they're defending their own homeland from an imperialistic power </strong>which is probably going to impose neo-colonialism on Iraq? The much hyped about SOFA purportedly was a mark of respect for Iraqi sovereignty. However, Iraqi sovereignty and demoracy just a charade, a sham:</p>
              <p>U.S. Would Control Profits from Iraqi Oil Exports Under Agreement- <a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=va&amp;aid=11130">http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=va&amp;aid=11130</a></p>
              <p>And you seem to have forgotten that the Afghanistan invasion was <strong>launched on a lie</strong>. That Bin Laden was responsible for 9/11. The FBI does not acknowledge Bin Laden's involvement and the war plans for the Afghanistan invasion was already on Bush's desk before 9/11. The US wanted to fuck the Taliban up over a failed oil pipeline agreement months before. Similarly, well-educated people (I assume), or I should say well-informed people, know that the <strong>WMD story is bullshit</strong>. Heck, in the 1970s, Saddam was a close ally of the US. He was even trained by the CIA before disposing of the previous president of Iraq in a coup de 'tat. If there were WMDs (chemical and biological, not nuclear), it was sold to Iraq by the US to use against Iran. Go do your homework.</p>
              <p>Therefore, the real terrorists in the world are the hijacked US government which is using force, or the threat of force to achieve political (and geopolitical) aims.</p>
              <p>You are responsible for your errors? Who else would you blame? Well, go correct them.</p>

              <p>Iran's literacy rate is far above Arab countries like Saudi Arabia, Syria or Iraq (duh..). Besides, in Iran, as Ahmadinejad said, women are better treated than in Saudi Arabia or Afghanistan. In fact, he pointed out that the Iranian finance ministry is almost fully staffed by women and he joked that the US should learn from them. This was during an interview by Code Pink. Can you say that Bush, or any political leader can claim higher moral ground? Also, Iran has a line of cars especially for women. While some may say that is discrimination, I would say its the good type of discrimination. Like men giving way for women (After you) etc. Is that oppression?</p>
              <p>As for WMDs, the IAEA has confirmed that Iran is within the NPT guidelines for enriching uranium for nuclear power generation. She has not diverted any fissile material for weapons purposes. Under the NPT, ALL nations have the right to develop nuclear power. Unlike Iran, Israel, Pakistan and India have not signed the NPT but they have nukes. Should the US invade them? Clearly, the war drums do not beat due to nuclear proliferation (hypocritical bullshit practiced by the West).</p>
              <p>Pentagon has admitted that only a fraction of the arms found in Iraq come from Iran. Instead, perhaps they can look to mercenaries like Blackwater or the US Army which illegally or not ships asssault weapons into Iraq, then cannot account for those weapons....I wonder where those weapons went.</p>
              <p>Only deluded or lying fucks can call for the invasion of Iran, especially after all the bullshit lies that took the US into Iraq.</p>
              <p>Anyway, as a pathetic attempt to stay on topic, the main state-sponsor of terrorism, as it is defined- the act or threat of violence to further political aims- is the US, in all respects, since WWII.</p>

              <p>As much as these ideologies are to blame, the blood falls unto the hands of those who use them.  We prosecute a man for murder, and not the knife or weapon.  We can only resent the weapon for being there, but at the end of it, someone is responsible for using it.</p>

              <p>Or you can blame the blind submission that we're conditioned with. This hierarchical society that places worth not on the inherent human being, but social status determined by paralysing social structures like wealth or materialism. Blindly following orders even though it makes no logical sense whatsoever, at school or at work. Germans on trial at Nuremburg said they were just following orders.</p>
              <p>In the 1960s, the Milgram Experiment was carried out and Stanley Milgram discovered that most people would continue to administer pain to another human being even if it harms and kills them just because a superior asked them to.</p>

              <p><br>Yes, the truth of "religions of peace" must be revealed.</p>
              <p>Christianity, Islam, Judaism.</p>
              <p>They all preach one similar theme, they are the true followers of faith and the rest can go to hell.</p>
              <p>Christianity:</p>
              <p>1) If you do not accept Jesus, subscrible to Christian faith and follow the bible, you will go to hell no matter how many kind deeds you done. You're a infidel.</p>
              <p>Islam:</p>
              <p>1) Similar to point 1 of Christianity</p>
              <p>Judaism:</p>
              <p>1) The Jews are the chosen people of God, enough said...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Yet, I would not choose to label a religion with the terrorist acts some of it's followers did.</p>
              <p>Religions only provide the texts written long long ago for people in the following generations to interpret, how these people choose to interpret them is solely up to them. Don't tell me that there is a fixed way of interpreting these texts because you have no idea how the ancient people interpreted them.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Can one proclaim that Christianity is a religion which promotes racism, slavery and terrorist acts and be assured that he/she wouldn't receive threats from Christians just because that what one believe?</p>
              <p>We have Christian terrorist group, Muslim terrorist group, Hindu terrorist group etc. but why we alway hear of Muslim terrorist groups?</p>
              <p>Because the media is baised or should I say the American media is baised.</p>
              <p>They choose to interpret the Quran according to their baised views, since many of Americans are Christians. Christianity and Islam have a lot of conflicts between them throughout history. </p>
              <p>They sought to protray Islam as evil, while some Islamic nations also protray Christianity as evil.</p>
              <p>With these baised views, it shouldn't be hard to figure out why there is a rising wave of hatred of Islam in Europe and elsewhere in the world.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But ultimately who is to blame for all these? We humans.</p>
              <p>We choose to believe what we want to believe no matter how educated we are.</p>

              <p>Right, those smart bombs were really smart. So smart that only 1 million civilians were killed in the second Iraq invasion (not counting those in Afghanistan). So smart that their <strong>DU fragments</strong> caused Iraqi cancer rates to skyrocket so much so that the genetic integrity of the Iraqi people is forever damaged.</p>
              <p>I'm sure that if Singapore was occupied by a foreign power, all those with some balls would be resisting against the occupiers, as with during the Japanese Occupation. As the saying goes, "One man's terrorist is another's freedom fighter". (If fire fighters fight fire and crime fighters fight crime, what do freedom fighters fight? Well, not in this context.). Iraqi resistance against the US Army is not the work of Al Qaeda. In fact, the Pentagon's own study last year admitted that <strong>Al Qaeda was non-existent during Saddam's rule</strong> (hence, no link to 9/11, if Al Qaeda was responsible for that [yeah right...]). Recently they estimated that there were only about 6000 Al Qaeda in Iraq. When you call those patriotic Iraqis "despical terrorists", it only shows how much bullshit you believe about the US's 'altruistic' and law-abiding behaviour. (I would hesitate about the "well-educated" part Stevenson)</p>
              <p>How can you call them cowards when <strong>they're defending their own homeland from an imperialistic power</strong> which is probably going to impose neo-colonialism on Iraq? The much hyped about SOFA purportedly was a mark of respect for Iraqi sovereignty. However, Iraqi sovereignty and demoracy just a charade, a sham:</p>
              <p>U.S. Would Control Profits from Iraqi Oil Exports Under Agreement- <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=va&amp;amp;aid=11130">http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=va&amp;aid=11130</a></p>
              <p>And you seem to have forgotten that the Afghanistan invasion was <strong>launched on a lie</strong>. That Bin Laden was responsible for 9/11. The FBI does not acknowledge Bin Laden's involvement and the war plans for the Afghanistan invasion was already on Bush's desk before 9/11. The US wanted to fuck the Taliban up over a failed oil pipeline agreement months before. Similarly, well-educated people (I assume), or I should say well-informed people, know that the <strong>WMD story is bullshit</strong>. Heck, in the 1970s, Saddam was a close ally of the US. He was even trained by the CIA before disposing of the previous president of Iraq in a coup de 'tat. If there were WMDs (chemical and biological, not nuclear), it was sold to Iraq by the US to use against Iran. Go do your homework.</p>
              <p>Therefore, the real terrorists in the world are the hijacked US government which is using force, or the threat of force to achieve political (and geopolitical) aims.</p>
              <p>You are responsible for your errors? Who else would you blame? Well, go correct them.</p>

              <p>Roy, that is a defeatist attitude. And frankly, I share your views. I have lived a life and if it gets snuffed out, it doesnt matter. I can afford not to care.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But when I see couples holding hands in public, the love with a hopeful shared future together, kids playing their naughty innocent  little games having fun, regardless of their nationality or religion, I ask myself why them, why are they being targetted to die hearing  a deity's name being proclaimed great?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And i wonder, why not me? I don't fear death. I am no innocent or pure human. But why them? What had these innocent people done that they should be brutually slain? Shall i turn a blind eye and remain silent?</p>

              <p>Conspiracy theories? <strong>Tell me one thing I said that was unsubstantiated</strong> (I know I didnt provide any URLs but its reality you can go check, the MSM just whitewashes it up). <strong>Just tell me, do you agree those things I said happened? If yes, then we can talk. If no, you're ironically closing off your mind to things the MSM has concealed from you, and there is nothing to talk about since you're being wilfully ignorant.</strong></p>
