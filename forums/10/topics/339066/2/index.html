              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>Many believed that poverty and lack of opportunities is the root of terrorism. It is a mistaken belief. Ideology is the cause of terrorists acts. The influencing or diversion of minds since birth towards an anti-humanity direction in life.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For 40 or more years, the world had tolerated the fundamental Islamic faith or its deviants. Despite their excesses, of preaching 'justified killings' of indifidels - meaning the rest of us who do not share their religious ideologies - , we had not been vocal or sought retribution even when we saw our loved ones cut down by them.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We still pleaded with them to be moderate instead of wiping them out even though we have the numbers, the technologies and the intelligences to do so, for we considered ourselves civilised and not barbarians.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Some of them listened, but what their public proclaminations of peaceful intent is not congruent with what they say and practise in private.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>They have continued to persist in feudal living, narrow mindedly, as we share this planet, and criticised our way of life daily. All this while of claiming peace, they had continued to train and educate its people to mass murder innocent men, women and children.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>They DO make attempts to seperate their kind living amongst us while killing others, but more often then not, they claim expediency in murdering them as well, but ensuring first their own families, friends and mullahs are not amongst us at the time of murders.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Why should one ethnic group be kept safe, and in their safety, find comfort to proclaim peace or keep apathetic distance, with a higher survival rate, while the rest of us humanity be mercilessly cut down piecemeal?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The world is sickened. 40 years and more of patience, education and pleadings had not done anything good to tame terrorism. The latest Mumbai attacks and senseless killings of our loved ones had crossed the line of patience, goodwill amongst men and sanity.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have no fear of my multicultural fellow citizens here in Spore, because our efforts to promote peaceful living had been largely successful.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have no fear that we this generation may have to pay the price for our mistake in not tackling fundamentalistic or deviant religious ideologies seriously and effectively.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I only fear that the next generation, whom are innocent, be the ones to suffer for our inactivity and apathy, and they will have to pay the price of being mercilessly cut down.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Perhaps S. Huddington's 'Clash of Civilisation' is in the end - inevitable?</p>

              <p><br>actually, i feel that all terrorists share one incorrect thinking.</p>
              <p>they conveniently blame the rest of the world for their own poverty, hardship and sufferings, instead of reflecting on themselves to find out the root causes and come out with more constructive solutions to solve their problems.</p>
              <p>if one is poor, he should think of ways of how to earn/make more money using his own efforts and hard work.</p>
              <p>if one is suffering, he should think of ways to overcome his pains and hardship.</p>
              <p>that should be the correct attitude. blaming everyone else for his own poverty, hardship and sufferings will not make his life any better, only worse.</p>
              <p>and yet, these people choose to take the " destroy oneself and destroy others" approach to make their point. that is wrong.</p>
              <p>they must realise that they are suffering because they have always been living in constant conflict with their environment ( which includes the rest of the world). that they are unable to harmonise with the rest of the bigger world, not the other way round.</p>
              <p>when a person cannot live in harmony with his own environment, he can never be happy.</p>
              <p>to add on to that, the false promises of numerous women, better lives and/or paradise after their "noble" sacrifice enbolden them to take such destructive and drastic measures.</p>
              <p>this shows that nothing is more fearful than misguided beliefs based on incorrect teachings that completely disregard other human lives, and the law of causality.</p>
              <p>that, i think, is how terrorism is born. when one's heart is dishonest and always blames others, he is easily swayed to the path of terrorism.</p>

              <p>Despite your obvious and blatant sympathy for terrorists, there must be a common ground which we can agree upon. And that ground is that there is no justification in killing innocent men, women and children whatsoever.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you cannot even accept this offered ground, then be prepared to face the wrath of a grieving and angered humanity thru your refusal and stubborness to face up to reality.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>No doubt there are many terrorist organisations in our world, but they are fragmented and loosely formed, with difficulty in cultivating recruit. They are manageable once the political will is ready to confront them headon, and treat them as murderers, nothing more, with no local sympathies.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Terrorism is nothing more than secular murders under ideologies for justification on a larger scale.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But the organisations that are deadly and brutual are the ones based on religious ideologies. Throughout 40 years, its body count lies in thousands died and wounded.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It continues to grow with abundant recruits, not because they were oppressed or denied opportunities, but because of ideology, of a better afterlife and the hypocrisy of their radical religion since birth as well as hidden sympathy or apathy by members of their religion .</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thus the need to find a honest solution to it, realistically, without sweeping anything under the carpet nor hide in apathy. The more courage we show to confront it, the more faster we will find a solution before more dies from it.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>I started this topic, with my eyes wide opened, knowing full well the minefield that i will be threading on. But i do so with utmost sincerity to seek an honest solution in order that more innocent lives not be lost.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I approached this topic, not with guns and bombs hovering over a religion's head, or even holding a gun pointed at anyone.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I entered into this topic, with my hands empty and palms facing up, walking alone with no intention of leading anyone, only to seek the answer.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I came, not to tear down anyone's religion, but to seek a clarification.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>An engineer who discovers a flaw in the construction of a building would correct the flaw, so that the building will be built straight. One leaning tower of Pisa is more than enough to make a mockery of an engineer's hubris.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I read with much gratification and accept in good faith that many moslems and Islamic head of states condemned the Mumbai butcheries, as well as other merciless acts of terrorism conducted in their religion's name.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But what scares me is - 'What were they actually condemning?'</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Are they condemning their fellow believers who only acted according to instructions and divine authorisation from the same holy book that they too had read daily, and by doing so, condemning the very word of their deity?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If the moderates believed that there are flaws in the book's instructions, as shown by their distancing from terrorism, then like an engineer, should not they remove such flaws?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>While fundamentalists will strongly and may even oppressively disagree both vocally and with actions, so as to remain 'true' to its teachings, BUT if such passages are removed, within a hundred years, a new generation will grow up respecting individual's rights to breathe and share the same space, and not deserved of death.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There will be no need to call to arms. A simple flaw misinterpreted by flawed man had been detected, with courage and goodwill with love to all mankind, the next generation will be able to live in peace.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And what S. Huddington had predictated will be averted. As well as my fellow humans of the muslim faith need not bear such brutal tragedies with anguish over the misuse of their religion, but share wholeheartedly in our sorrows of innocent men, women and children being senseless slaughtered by beasts in men skin.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But then in reality, already many would laugh at this concept. Sigh....May 'clash of civilisations' need not come to pass. The oppression of terrorism upon humanity must be removed, one way or another. The suffering is beyond compare by innocents.</p>

              <p>The Mohammedan conquest of India is probably the bloodiest story in
              history. <strong>The Islamic historians and scholars have recorded with great
              glee and pride the slaughters of Hindus</strong>, forced conversions, abduction
              of Hindu women and children to slave markets and <strong>the destruction of
              temples carried out by the warriors of Islam</strong> during 800 AD to 1700 AD.
              Millions of Hindus were converted to Islam by sword during this period.</p>
