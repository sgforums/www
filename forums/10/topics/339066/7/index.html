              <p>xtreyier, your practice of calling something a "conspiracy theory" and then running away (ignoring it) just demonstrates your intellectual cowardice despite your holier-than-thou attitude. If you accuse me of telling lies, then prove it.</p>
              <p>And whatever information I referred to can be verified on the public domain. Its not like its Top Secret/SCI.</p>

              <p>Scott Ritter (one of the chief United Nation weapons inspectors in Iraq) stated that the WMDs Saddam had in his possession all those years ago has long since turned to harmless substances. Sarin and tabun have a shelf life of five years, VX lasts a bit longer (but not much longer), and finally botulinum toxin and liquid anthrax last about three years. On March 7, 2003, Hans Blix's last report to the UN security Council prior to the US led invasion of Iraq, described Iraq as actively and proactively cooperating with UNMOVIC, though not necessarily in all areas of relevance and had been frequently uncooperative in the past, but that it was within months of resolving key remaining disarmament tasks</p>

              <p>Since the 1991 Persian Gulf War, the U.S. and UK had been engaged in a low-level attacks on Iraqi air defenses which targeted them while enforcing Iraqi no fly zones. These zones, and the attacks to enforce them, were described as illegal by the former UN Secretary General, Boutros Boutros-Ghali and the then French foreign minister, Hubert Vedrine. Other countries, notably Russia and China, also condemned the zones as a violation of Iraqi sovereignty. In mid-2002, the U.S. began more carefully selecting targets in the southern part of the country to disrupt the military command structure in Iraq and "pressure" the Iraqi Government into providing a pretext for war.</p>

              <p>Worse still, there had been cases of funding for these deviants of the great Islamic faith. Who had been sympathising with them? They should have been wiped out 7 years ago, yet they still exist not only in the middle east, but even in s-e asia.</p>

              <p>It is incredulous that the Islamic faith could issue international 'Fatawas' against writers or act against couples kissing in public, and yet here the deviants are flagrantly besmirching their religion, which they admitted in 911, not only continues to walk boldly, they could even get funds and support!</p>

              <p>Let's you and me appeal to the Islamic faithful to act more decisively on a global scale, even requesting they perform 'evangelical' preaching into terrorists hotspots around the world, excommunicating errant mullahs or imans, to stop this targetting of innocents. If not, it will be other humans will have to do the job, one way or another, which we must avoid and avert. </p>

              <p>Agree with you except for the 2nd point. Best we cleared it up once and for all so that there can be no sympathising or excuses for terrorists acts.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Let us depend on facts and NOT on conspiracy theories.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Fact is, US attacked Iraq because Sadam, the expansionist despot who invaded and murdered even people of his own religion, not only Iran but kuwait as well, had used the possesion of nuclear weapons or the lack of it to threaten the rest of the world.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Despite several datelines being redrawn to ensure that there is really NO nuclear weapons with this madman, he failed and ignored every plea from every fearful leader in the world to allow inspections. There was no need to hide anything.  These are supposed nuclear warheads we are talking about, capable of wiping out a population and render the land uninhabitable for years, as well as the drift of nuclear wastes into the atmosphere destroying neighbouring lands, not a piece of seditious paper.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>US did what it had to do, to ensure there really was no nukes, even though the CIA initially said there was. Casualties were kept to a minimum, and when the war was over in days, they had wanted to go home.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What ensued was that the outlawed Al Queda seized the opportunity to enter Iraq, and turn the US fight against Sadam, which the population welcomed and waved with american flags, into a religious war, for years as a measure to keep the iraq weak, killing its govt officials and security forces,  and US confined in Iraq without linking up its armies in afghanistan. ( even now, it is attempting to make the US ally Pakistan engage in a war with india to prevent the allies from helping US. Al Queda must be bleeding now) </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There had been conspiracy theories abound, but please, conspiracy theories are only good for reading on a bored night, but not based on actual fact. While there may have been complexities, let us sort out the facts and agree upon first.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Like a jigsaw puzzle, we look for corners and straight edges first in order to unravel a puzzle. Similarly, let us get the facts straight first before we even comtemplate the complex stuff, if it even exists, just like Elvis aint dead is even now still believed.</p>

              <p>in fact i don't know much about sadam, how he is, is he despot? i know he had invade kuwait, start the gulf war. I guess, neither you know many about him as well, maybe what you know about him ,i from a US media , kind of distorted.</p>
              <p>And about the inspection, i think sadam is a different kind of government with US, they may not be so familiar with the procedure or ways dealing with the international issue, but just like singapore, if US suspect singapore hiding Nuclear weapon, is US authorised  to search the island, many country in the world have the nuclear weapon, are they consider as a threat in the world, nuclear weapon is a threat, no matter, in which country's hand. So i guess, sadam is with a little pride, would not like to bow his head to US. As because of this his country is invaded , and he is hanged.So unfortunate.</p>
              <p>And some country would not like to open up, especially they are deemed as vulgar country, maybe some of you maybe have the same feeling with me, when you saw a woman wearing a veil, you wonder why she do that, you may think it's wierd, but in order to understand a different country, we need to know it, not discriminate,</p>

              <p>My point is that both have nukes, although they have not signed the NPT (Iran has by the way). The WMD case for Iraq is empty because the US sold Saddam biochemicals in the 1970s and 1980s and Saddam's nuclear program was built up by the French. The US invaded Iraq to control oil and because Saddam threatened USD hegemony by selling oil in Euros in 2000.</p>
              <p>For Israel, <em><strong>AIPAC</strong></em> ensures that <em>the US doesnt upset Israel</em>.</p>
              <p>Pakistan, on the other hand, is accused of the Mumbai attacks, refused to extradite terror suspects, tribal regions getting out of hand, threatening the imperialist army in Afghanistan. For a nation that was an US ally, things seem to be turning for the worse. Not that its necessarily Pakistan's fault. Could be staged just like Iraq. But I'm just saying that Pakistan could potentially be the next front on the War of Terror, I mean War on Terror.</p>
