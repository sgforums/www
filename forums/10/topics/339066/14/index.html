              <p>In the intelligence community, this is called "blowback". The US also experienced this kind of crap when the Mujahedeen they funded to fight the Soviets started to burn American flags, spawning the Islamic terrorists that the MSM regularly condemns.</p>

              <p>I used to think like that, but the more history i read up i keep getting the impression that the West is continously goading the Soviet Union rather than it being an actual clash of idealogy.</p>
              <p>Considering that Russian history hasn't exactly been translated into English, we haven't really read about their perspective of the Cold War.</p>
              <p>Language is an extremely powerful tool  to determine the perspective of a person, if the opposing party can't even speak your language well or at all, it's far easier to deny his logic.</p>

              <p>Read Antony C Sutton's work. The Soviet Union was a paper tiger which the US built up. In fact, 2/3 of the Soviet merchant fleet had engines built in the West or with stolen or acquired western designs. Stalin himself remarked that without western technological assistance, the industrialisation of the Soviet Union could not have taken place. During the Vietnam War, while western made trucks were spotten on the Ho Chin Minh trail, Kissinger authorised the upgrading of a major vehicle plant in the Soviet Union. And as WWII has shown, any automobile manufacturing plant has military capability. The examples are astonishing. Go read "The Best Enemies Money Can Buy" by Antony Sutton.</p>

              <p>Quite frankly, with a population of 142 million people(1 Jan 2008) i find it difficult to believe the Soviet Union was ever great in the first place.</p>
              <p>Like Europe after WW2 it was already badly devastated by the German army. And it has spent the Cold War building up its ability to keep its borders from the West who continously build bases and missiles targetting them. </p>
              <p>It is a military superpower because it has spent its natural resources building it and nothing else. I really can't see it becoming anything close to an economic superpower.</p>
              <p>Perhaps a more accurate way of thinking is no country China, India or Russia wishes to be opposing the West or anyone for that matter. There's just more to be gained through peaceful trade than outright war, always an extremely expensive endevour and the returns are rarely worth it.</p>
