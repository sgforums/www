              <p>You are barking up the wrong tree......</p>
              <p>If you look closely, the root cause of terrorism, is simple.</p>
              <p>The root cause is always, territorial, nationalistic, political, conflict.</p>
              <p>That is the primary reason.</p>
              <p>As you can see the Palestinian and various other middle-eastern Arab terrorists, they are basically having a land dispute. Namely, there is a dispute of a territorial, nationalistic, political, nature.</p>
              <p>The same can be said with Chechen terrorists. Again, territorial, nationalistic, political, root is the cause.</p>
              <p>They wanted to make their own country.</p>
              <p>This case, Mumbai attack, same again, these people are sympathizers and supporters of Kashmiri independence.</p>
              <p>In each and every one of these so-called terrorism cases, the root cause is always one of territorial, nationalistic, political, nature.</p>
              <p>When you look and focus on their religion or religious ideology, you are just looking at the secondary factor. It is not the primary reason. You forgot the real cause.</p>
              <p>I would like to remind you that ETA and IRA in the past, also employed terroristic tactics, and they are not Muslims at all.</p>
              <p>However there is a similarity, and always there is this similarity. ETA and IRA had a dispute of a territorial, nationalistic, political, nature.</p>
              <p>Another example, in 1970s there was a group of Japanese terrorists, forgot the name, and they were not Muslims either.</p>
              <p>So you see.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So the commonality of all these terrorism factors, is one of territorial, nationalistic, political, nature.</p>
              <p>In some cases, when the protagonists and the belligerents got so desperate, they are willing to inflict a cost and a damage to the other side, without paying due regard to proper conduct of a gentleman warfare. They resort to terroristic tactics. They are desperate, filled with hatred, pushed to corner, and dont care anymore.</p>
              <p>Some of them will use justifications of an ethnic nature or a personal nature or ideological nature, or perceiving their acts as a rightful revenge, some of them will look deep into their philosophy and religious teaching to find justification and courage.</p>
              <p>Of course, all acts of terrorism is wrong, I agree with that. There is no moral grey area in this regard. It is absolutely wrong. However when you look only at their secondary soul-searching or self psyching up by searching deep into their religious beliefs, and then you point at that, and blame that, I think you are being rather short sighted and you miss the real reason altogether.</p>
              <p>So whether they are ETA, IRA, Japanese terrorist, Kashmiri terrorist, Chechen terrorist, or all sorts of terrorist acts do not have a religion as a commonality, rather, the commonality is a conflict of a territorial, nationalistic, political, nature.</p>

              <p>The biggest error is saying everyone else is also doing it, and then not addressing the issue.</p>
              <p>Very common human trait, " Hey don't spit on to the floor"</p>
              <p>"Others are also doing it what!, so whats the problem?"</p>
              <p>What is different about this batch of terrorist is that it has the tacit support, and collusion of members of their faith. And apathy from the rest who profess abhorance for the terror acts. Where is the street protest against these "infidels" who uses the name of their religion for these abhorrent acts?</p>
              <p>ETA, IRA, the Japanese Red Army, the Bader-Meinhoff Group, these are all closed organizations, and receive no support from the population, active or tacit, tangible or intangible.</p>
              <p>Our molly coddling of this issue, for fear of greater repercussion, is actually helping Osama and his merry band to continue to go on a rampage.</p>
              <p>Oppression? Thats all bull.</p>

              <p>Mancha....actually ETA and IRA i think did have support from the population of their base, or at least partially.</p>
              <p>It's the same isnt it, in this case when terrorists sympathizers go to street and chant "death to infidels", the root cause is due to the fact that those people in the streets are connected to an issue of a territorial, nationalistic, political, dispute. They are involved in it and they have an argument. They are involved in a dispute and a conflict.</p>
              <p>But again, I find it fascinating that these territorial, nationalistic, political, conflict is not being seen as the root that it is. Rather, the manifestations of one side's terrorism and its link with their religious ideology is being seen as a root cause. It is not. It is not.</p>
              <p>There is a wide ranging group of terrorists, ETA, IRA, LTTE in Sri Lanka, all these are not Muslims but they are involved in a territorial, nationalistic, political, conflict. Since they have no capability to win in a conventional war in a proper conduct of a gentleman's warfare, they get desperate and become crazy, they go for asymmetrical warfare.</p>
              <p>The commonality is always, a conflict of a territorial, nationalistic, political, nature. And the losing side is the desperate side who would eventually turn very desperate and unleash an asymmetrical warfare. They resort to terroristic tactics.</p>
              <p>OK let's say, let's say just by coincidence, the religious leaders say "we should all embrace infidels as fellow brothers and sisters from now on" Do you really think this kind of religious exhortation will solve the problem? No, their underlying desperation and their fundamental territorial, nationalistic, political, dispute will just manifest in other ways, they will use other kinds of rallying call and their self-psyching up will just take another theme and another flavour. They can just take a secular flavour, for example along an ethnic line, so now they change from religious chants into ethnic chants.</p>
              <p>"Kill indifels" will just morph into "kill Americans".</p>
              <p>The root cause I believe, is not due to these linkages with their religious ideology. I have my own comments about this using of religious teachings to achieve a goal in a dispute of a territorial, nationalistic, political, nature, but I am not very qualified because I am not a religious scholar, and anyways there are many experts and scholars who have already made their comments. But, it is important that we understand that this religious issue notwithstanding, it is not, definitely not, the root cause of terrorism.</p>

              <p>Your linkages of acts of terror with territorial, nationalistic, political ambitions stiffens your views of terrorism. It is not wrong though.</p>
              <p>This is a new scourge, an attempt at religious imperialism gone wrong, thanks to the impatience of the fundamentalists. It is these fundamentalists who still harbour dreams of their grand scheme of world domination, who capitalise on the inherent capacity for violence and hatred in the  theology to incite impressionable believers into acts of terror. Oppression and discrimination are only justification, religion is the motivating force.</p>
              <p>Simply put, they want everyone to live their livestyle. Thats their goal. Think about it carefully.</p>

              <p>Conflating Islam and terrorism is a popular theme now amongst Zionist sympathizers but it is not a new phenomenon. Not at all. The orientalist argument have been used to justify what can be succinctly called "Imperialism" since colonial days and Imperialist forces have been guilty of nurturing radical fringe groups to use as either ideological or political boogeyman or victims since the days of British India. The same Ahmadiyya movement (headquartered in London) and other fringe muslim gnostic groups have in the past been guilty of anti-independance propaganda, preaching to adherents that life was meaningless and it was better to continue being British subjects are now being used to foster terrorism, preaching that life was meaningless and to kill innocents is divine. Looking at the ideological, political and financial base of radicalisation movements, we see distinct Western support of a dualistic worldview both based fundamentally on the same Orientalist perspective. One being the so-called bad cop the "new Islamic terror ideology" and the other being the so called good cop the "patriotic Islamophobia ideology". Both serve essentially to justify continued Zionist support, weaken internal national security and destabilize competitors to the sick Western dominance agenda. All acts of terrorism serve a political goal, who benefits in the final analysis will always be an important point to analyze. Abu Nidal, long the poster child of Palestinian terrorism, is now known to have been (he's dead now) under the employ of Mossad but back when it was popular to lambast Palestinian national aspiration as being akin to terrorism, acts of Palestinian terrorism was always blamed on Arafat, the PLO and the Palestinian national liberation movement. Same tactics are being used.</p>

              <p>Although it is also true that there are indeed some fanatical groups that carry out terrorism solely to push their agenda of setting up Islamic states.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But again, I find it fascinating that these territorial,
                                      nationalistic, political, conflict is not being seen as the root
                                      that it is.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>That is due to propaganda and politics in my opinion. Certain states won't go and admit that there are real unjust being carried out. Better to blame everything on so called irrational fanatics.</p>

              <p>You are barking up the wrong tree......</p>
              <p>If you look closely, the root cause of terrorism, is simple.</p>
              <p>The root cause is always, territorial, nationalistic, political, conflict.</p>
              <p>That is the primary reason.</p>
              <p>As you can see the Palestinian and various other middle-eastern Arab terrorists, they are basically having a land dispute. Namely, there is a dispute of a territorial, nationalistic, political, nature.</p>
              <p>The same can be said with Chechen terrorists. Again, territorial, nationalistic, political, root is the cause.</p>
              <p>They wanted to make their own country.</p>
              <p>This case, Mumbai attack, same again, these people are sympathizers and supporters of Kashmiri independence.</p>
              <p>In each and every one of these so-called terrorism cases, the root cause is always one of territorial, nationalistic, political, nature.</p>
              <p>When you look and focus on their religion or religious ideology, you are just looking at the secondary factor. It is not the primary reason. You forgot the real cause.</p>
              <p>I would like to remind you that ETA and IRA in the past, also employed terroristic tactics, and they are not Muslims at all.</p>
              <p>However there is a similarity, and always there is this similarity. ETA and IRA had a dispute of a territorial, nationalistic, political, nature.</p>
              <p>Another example, in 1970s there was a group of Japanese terrorists, forgot the name, and they were not Muslims either.</p>
              <p>So you see.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So the commonality of all these terrorism factors, is one of territorial, nationalistic, political, nature.</p>
              <p>In some cases, when the protagonists and the belligerents got so desperate, they are willing to inflict a cost and a damage to the other side, without paying due regard to proper conduct of a gentleman warfare. They resort to terroristic tactics. They are desperate, filled with hatred, pushed to corner, and dont care anymore.</p>
              <p>Some of them will use justifications of an ethnic nature or a personal nature or ideological nature, or perceiving their acts as a rightful revenge, some of them will look deep into their philosophy and religious teaching to find justification and courage.</p>
              <p>Of course, all acts of terrorism is wrong, I agree with that. There is no moral grey area in this regard. It is absolutely wrong. However when you look only at their secondary soul-searching or self psyching up by searching deep into their religious beliefs, and then you point at that, and blame that, I think you are being rather short sighted and you miss the real reason altogether.</p>
              <p>So whether they are ETA, IRA, Japanese terrorist, Kashmiri terrorist, Chechen terrorist, or all sorts of terrorist acts do not have a religion as a commonality, rather, the commonality is a conflict of a territorial, nationalistic, political, nature.</p>

              <p><br>I truly wish what you had claimed are the roots of terrorism - killing and terrorizing of innocents. Oppression, discrimination, repression with political or socialogical aims are issues of which we can always debate and obtain compromises as solutions.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Pepertrators who kill can be easily brought to justice with only a minority sympathisers, and be brought to justice. Strikes, protests, melee fights between males and riot squad or armies is an acceptable norm.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But when religion is used as a tool to achieve political ends, there can be no discussion or compromises, simply because the deity do not hold discussions or meetings! 'Talk to the holy book' is the classic answer to any queries or enquiries.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The holy book holds all the answers and solutions to any problems one faces, even if one has to suspend logic and reason in acceptance.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To challenge its teachings is to defy an all mighty supreme being. No King, President, PM or society is higher in encompassing authority than an interpretation by flawed men, at times even village idiots posing as mullahs or imans, from that book.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The masses had always been manipulated by a scheming minority of men to achieve objectives, such as small scale type like performing jobs, to high end stuff of replacing seats of power.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Religion thus is the perfect tool to manipulate simple folks, who had been taught since childhood not to defy or challenge its teachings. Worse still if  it teaches religious chauvinism, for it grant its believers life and afterlife, and only death to non-believers, a very powerful motivator to encourage killings of innocents, in the hands of evil scheming men.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>a.) You had just been fired from your dream job. You are pissed and decides to kill your boss. You storm into his office, points a pistol to his head, finger on the trigger.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>b.) Your loved ones had been murdered. Your home destroyed. Your future is ruined. Your country lay wasted. You and a group of your friends travel to the country that had caused you harm and destruction.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You see a farmhouse. Inside a family is sitting down having dinner. You storm inside and pull out your sub-machine gun and point at them. The stunned family looks at you in horror, and then in tears as they plead for you to spare their lives and deny any partaking in the destruction of your home and life.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The frightened children stares at you with their innocent tearful eyes. Your finger is on the trigger. One long burst and they would be cut down.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>c.) Same situataion as (b.), but this time, you had been told by your leaders and religious mullahs/imans that it's ok to kill them. They are only non-believers and deserved death anyway. You are helping your religion. Your finger is on the trigger, ready to unleash hell.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is easy to talk. 'Killing' is easy. Just pull the trigger. As in example (a.), most in anger or rage would only go so far - fantasize, and then laugh it off when sanity returns.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But when yopur finger is on the trigger to end another's life, most will seek a strong valid reason to do so, more so if the ones to die are innocent. Some allow their rage to overcome their natural instinct to respect life, and then to kill.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Even in war, soldiers were known to hesitate before killing another life, because we were brought up never, ever, even dream of killing another human or committing murder, no matter what they had done or whatever religion, since childhood.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thus, even in example (b.), you may but largely, will not pull that trigger.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But in (c.), its a no-brainer. You would not even hesitate one second and will even exclaim and proclaim your deity is great with glee as precious blood continues to flow from your victims.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Therefore, ideology is the root. Ideology that everyone else is an infidel and deserved of only death is evil. Remove it now, or generations will suffer. The moderate Islamic faiths must do something to their teachings now. This i plead.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>The

              <p>“If Muslims and Christians are not at peace, the world cannot be at peace,” it said.</p>

              <p>Bro, do you know the impact of quoting such things &amp; intending to send messages in a manner so as to influence, especially when the consequences are tremendously terrible? Your mindset are of no difference from the "terrorists". Are you an islamic scholar who truly understand what the sentences mean as to do what you are trying to do? Do you think the quran is just a simple storybook which you can just copy and paste sentences? How naive, misguided, &amp; foolish can you be to select &amp; copy paste certain sentences just like that?</p>

              <p>No. The case is far from settled! That slayings done in name of religion had occurred yet again is evidence that previous measures were a failure!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is not enough that the moderate muslims distance themselves from the terrorists, who had only acted with specific instructions from the same holy book. Uncomfortable as it may sound, blame me, for the cries of innocent victims compels me to state the unvanished truth, painful as it may to be accepted.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>After 911, with the presumed Islamic heads (if there were any in the first place that is recognised universally) condemnation of the terrorists attacks, I had hopes that perhaps they had realized the flaws and misinterpretations in their teachings and would correct it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But to the world's dismay, it heralded instead a return to fundamentalism. States and societies where once were modern and progress had regressed back to the basic philosophies of the holy book, with alarming calls to reject secular constitutional laws and rely on the fundamental teachings from the holy book interpretated into laws to govern societies.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The return to Islamic states is the current call from the international muslim community.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Condemnation of terror attacks on innocents committed by religious radicals continues to flow. The world is not blind. They know hypocrisy where they see it. Had the terrorists won in the ideological war instead of the moderates, after so many years?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I came not with a sword. But if hypocrisy and apathy rules in the international Islamic communities, humanity will be the ones carrying the sword, regardless of themselves turning blind, as a eye for an eye would leave the whole world blind. They will do what they have to do to protect their next generations.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But there is a chance we dont have to have our eyes blinded.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>All it needs is for the moderates in the international Islamic faith arena to unite and come out with a concrete and decisive plan to tackle the misinterpretations in the holy book, with a timeline, and make it formal, universally adopted.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Deviant imans or mullahs will be shown no mercy, hauled up and tried for the crimes they had committed on their orders, with no chance of being allowed maytredoom thru the rejection of their 'misinterpretations'.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is not enough for individual states to adopt such measures as currently the situation now. It needs to be universally recognised and accepted, espacially in the backwards and poor regions where education is low.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Fighting the ideology of religious terrorism is not a fight humanity can battle alone successfully, even though in the end we will win. The cost is too high. we value precious lives.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>This is a surgical battle that only moderates, who claim they denounce such brutal slayings done in their religion's name, will have to courageously fight. We are, afterall, despite our differences, the same race - the free human race.<br></strong></p>

              <p><br>Rokkie, you are the very kind of people with ignorance that i and others must help, regardless if you are only 10yrs old or 100 years old, instead of insulting your ignorance.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>YOu will have to differentiate between wars, and terrorism.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Mankind can understand the philsophy of having to wage war inorder to have peace. It will try all means to avoid it through compromises and diplomacy, but if it is inevitable, then allow it to come to pass.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But even in war, there are rules to it and not a free for all melee. Basically, the time, date and location of warzones are officially declared.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The weak or children are moved away and kept in a safe location for both sides. There are many other rules commonly accepted thru the ages, than i can list here, read it up and you will be more familiar.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If there is a fire in a house, and you are told to get out or you sneak in and died from the fire while firemen are trying to extinguish the fire, you are a 'collateral dammage'.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Similar in wars where people gets hurt. They must stay away from combat zones, and not place their women and children there while a fight is on. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But terrorism is not war. It is undeclared, not by soveriegn states, kills and brutally slays innocent men women and children instead of combatants anytime, anyplace and anywhere. This is not acceptable to mankind who had grown civilised.</p>
