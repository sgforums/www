              <p>Nah, not true, FC. I am very fortunate to have grown up in
              Singapore. It is the only truly multi-ethnic society i knew despite
              my travels far abroad. I grew up with them and know of no such
              ambitions.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Muslims everywhere are truly peaceful people and no
              different from us, even though according to their holy book,
              written in the 6th century when enemies surrounded them - the rest
              of the world are infidels.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Their needs and desires are similar with everyone of us. We are
              all similar human beings, as DNA had proven. They were friendly,
              and one of the most hospitable people on Earth, comparable to the
              Thais.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But their lives are now being dictated and manipulated by
              ambitious deviants who hijack their peaceful religion in order to
              attain world domination.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We are no longer living in the 6th century, and for the
              religious, had been blessed to progress into the 21st century, to
              know better the marvel and wonders of an Almighty, becoming
              closer as never before. No modern doctor is an atheist
              once he performs surgery or discovers a particular gene. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But these terrorists want nothing better than to bomb us
              back to the stone age. </p>

              <p>You yourself lamented why the Islamic community isn't doing anything to stem the violence in the Occupied Territories. Perhaps its because the violence is beget through Islam and nobody wants to admit it.</p>
              <p>Are you warped in the mind? We are similar human beings as DNA has proven? Have you noticed: <em>All</em> of us are human beings?</p>

              <p>I hate to say this, but there's actually very little precedent for tolerance in most Muslim Empires in history.</p>
              <p>Take for example:</p>
              <p>1. Christians in the caliphates were tolerated but subjected to high taxes for not converting. While some might consider this as "tolerance", it is however unequivocal discrimination.</p>
              <p>2. Zorosantrians were largely driven out of Persia; forced conversions among the conquered Persian populace was common after the conquest of Persia.</p>
              <p>3. Greek Christian boys were often rounded up in the Ottoman empire to serve the Ottoman sultan. They were converted, and conditioned to be fanatical fighters of the Sultan.</p>
              <p>That is not to say any other religion is free of blood. All religions, including Buddhism, are not immune from the excesses of the zealots.</p>

              <p>I am no longer sure what to be shocked at.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The carnage in Gaza or the thousands of 'moslems' who demostrated against Israel in the Middle-east and even Sydney.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am in support for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, with BOTH sides - Israel and Hamas to stop the violence. Nothing can be achieve except more innocents dead.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But i am shocked at the display by 'moslems' who demostrated. They are actually supporting the terrorist group Hamas! The very culprits who had blasphemed the teachings of the good Prophet Muhammad.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>They had been firing missles into Israel non stop for months and yet these moslems did nothing. But when Israel retaliated, as it rightfully should after several warnings, the moslems cry foul.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Muslims around the world had condemn terrorism done in Islam's name, but right before our eyes, these thousands of moslems had turn back on their words! And they did not even chatisizes the Hamas! What's happening?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Why are there still followers of this religion who support blasphemors? And what would be the effect on moderates? Would they fear for their lives and join in support of terrorism too?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>No, we must give our whole hearted support of the moderates, who do not enjoy the killings of innocents on both sides. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Many suscribe to the belief that religion is too sensitive, thus non-muslims must refrain from talking about it.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">But it only plays into terrorists hands, for it isolates the moderates, whom will have no one but terrorists or radicals to turn to. We must engage with moderates to help them.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The principals of engagement in religion are:-</p>
              <p><br>1. Respect each other's religion and right of worship and traditions<br>2. Find a common ground on which all religions shares - which is murder of innocents is abhorrent - even amongst atheist for they too believe in a supreme being subconciously. He is called Chance, Fate, or Destiny. The Almighty has many names. And each of us will ultimately acknowledge Him in our time.<br>3. Share with them and support them in their fight against radicals whom had hijack their religion for nefarious purposes.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Many muslims i know hate terrorism and more so done in their peaceful religions name. But if everyone of non-muslims blame them, then they will have no one else to turn to except radicals.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We must stand side by side with our fellow humans who are muslims and moderates, but <strong>they in turn, must be open and prepared to help non-muslims to change the misconcepceptions and misinterpretations to fellow faithfuls of their religion and not be a tool to terrorists.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This is the only way to kill the terrorists idealogy. Not bullets or tanks. But it must be fast, otherwise if more innocents, muslim and non-muslim die, there may be no turning back to widespread war, as envisoned by seers.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A prediction, like an economic forcast, can only come true if nothing is done to avert it. It does not take into account the human free will and its ability to turn situations around.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Many predictions of disaster in mankind's history had been averted based on human free will and the collective necessity to act. So too must we act fast now, more so by our moderate muslims as well as non-muslims.</p>

              <p>Israel's strategy was to set Hamas against Fatah and let the two annihilate off each other.</p>
              <p>That was why it sponsored Hamas in its early days as a rival against Fatah.</p>
              <p>For some reason, this type of plan always backfires.</p>
              <p>For example Britain setting Germany against Russia; also resulted in a debacle for them.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>...As a result of these attacks and a barrage of similar attacks on
                  the treaty which continued year after year, British public opinion
                  acquired a guilty conscience about the Treaty of Versailles, and was
                  quite unprepared to take any steps to enforce it by 1930.</p>
              <p>On this
                  feeling, which owed so much to the British idea of sportsmanlike
                  conduct toward a beaten opponent, was built the movement for
                  appeasement.</p>
              <p>This movement had two basic assumptions: (<em>a</em>) that reparation must be made for Britain's treatment of Germany in 1919 and (<em>b</em>)
                  that if Germany's most obvious demands, such as arms equality,
                  remilitarization of the Rhineland, and perhaps union with Austria, were
                  met, Germany would become satisfied and peaceful. The trouble with this
                  argument was that once Germany reached this point, it would be very
                  difficult to prevent Germany from going further (such as taking the
                  Sudetenland and the Polish Corridor).</p>
              <p>Accordingly, many of the
                  appeasers, when this point was reached in March 1938 went over to the
                  anti-Bolshevik or "three-bloc" point of view, while some even went into
                  the "peace at any price" group. It is likely that Chamberlain, Sir John
                  Simon, and Sir Samuel Hoare went by this road from appeasement to
                  anti-Bolshevism. At any rate, few influential people were still in the
                  appeasement group by 1939 in the sense that they believed that Germany
                  could ever be satisfied. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Once this was realized, it seemed to many that
                  the only solution was to bring Germany into contact with, or even
                  collision with, the Soviet Union...</strong></span></p>
              <p><a href="http://real-world-news.org/bk-quigley/12.html#42">http://real-world-news.org/bk-quigley/</a></p>
              <p>...And by this date, certain members of the Milner Group and of the
                  British Conservative government had reached <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>the fantastic idea that
                  they could kill two birds with one stone by setting Germany and Russia
                  against one another in Eastern Europe.</strong></span> </p>
              <p>In this way<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> they felt that the
                  two enemies would stalemate one another</strong></span>, or that Germany would become
                  satisfied with the oil of Rumania and the wheat of the Ukraine.  It
                  never occurred to anyone in a responsible position that Germany and
                  Russia might make common cause, even temporarily, against the West. 
                  Even less did it occur to them that Russia might beat Germany and thus
                  open all Central Europe to Bolshevism.</p>
              <p>In order to<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> carry out this plan of allowing Germany to drive eastward
                  against Russia</strong></span>, it was necessary to do three things:</p>
              <p>(1) to<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> liquidate
                  all the countries standing between Germany and Russia</span>; </p>
              <p>(2) to prevent
                  France from honoring her alliances with these countries;  and</p>
              <p>(3) to
                  hoodwink the English people into accepting this as a necessary, indeed,
                  the only solution to the international problem. </p>
              <p>The Chamberlain group
                  were so successful in all three of these things that they came within
                  an ace of succeeding, and failed only because of the obstinacy of the
                  Poles, the unseemly haste of Hitler, and the fact that at the eleventh
                  hour the Milner Group realized the implications of their policy and
                  tried to reverse it...</p>

              <p>"The documents received after the Munich conspiracy are particularly
              valuable. They analyze the post-Munich situation in Europe<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> and clearly
              show that Britain was trying to draw Germany and the Soviet Union into
              active hostilities</strong></span>," Sotskov emphasized in an interview with RIA
              Novosti.<br> <br> In a memo on December 21, 1938, Lavrenty Beria reported to Stalin about
              the Soviet-seized documents, which included reports of Finnish envoys
              to London, Paris, and Warsaw on Germany's eastward expansion, and the
              position of the British, French, and Polish governments on this issue.<br> <br> Thus, Finnish Ambassador in London Grippenberg reported to his Foreign
              Ministry: "I heard the opinion that German propaganda of colonies is
              false. As Britons put it, it is a smokescreen to cover the preparations
              of a plan concerning Soviet Ukraine. Hitler himself told French
              Ambassador Francois-Poncet that he was not even thinking about any
              colonies," the document reads.<br> <br> Later, on November 25,<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> Grippenberg reported his conversation with a
              British government member who assured him that Britain and France would
              not interfere in Germany's eastward expansion.</strong></span><br> <br> "<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Britain's position is as follows: let's wait until Germany and the
              U.S.S.R. get involved in a big conflict</strong></span>," the document reads...</p>

              <p>I hate to say this, but there's actually very little precedent for tolerance in most Muslim Empires in history.</p>
              <p>Take for example:</p>
              <p>1. Christians in the caliphates were tolerated but subjected to high taxes for not converting. While some might consider this as "tolerance", it is however unequivocal discrimination.</p>
              <p>2. Zorosantrians were largely driven out of Persia; forced conversions among the conquered Persian populace was common after the conquest of Persia.</p>
              <p>3. Greek Christian boys were often rounded up in the Ottoman empire to serve the Ottoman sultan. They were converted, and conditioned to be fanatical fighters of the Sultan.</p>

              <p>I won't say they're killing in the name of Buddhism like Christianity or Islam, since the religion doesn't believe in a supreme god.</p>
              <p>But like Islam they selectively take portions of the scriptures and treat it as the Truth with dealing with others. They use the controversial Buddhist idea 
                      of poa, that under certain circumstances murder could spiritually elevate 
                      both the victim and the killer</p>
              <p>I take this instance as an example that the ability to incite people to murdering others is hardly limited to any specific religion or culture. Any charismatic enough man with enough fools under him could do it.</p>

              <p>Thats why the US, together with Israel, should get serious and invade Syria, Iran and maybe Lebanon to get serious with their War on Terror. Then they can set up puppet (mickey mouse) governments to ensure that terrorism ends.</p>

              <p>In the intelligence community, this is called "blowback". The US also experienced this kind of crap when the Mujahedeen they funded to fight the Soviets started to burn American flags, spawning the Islamic terrorists that the MSM regularly condemns.</p>

                      affair. Is that correct?</p>
              <p>Brzezinski: Yes. According to the official version of history, CIA aid
                      to the Mujahadeen began during 1980, that is to say, after the Soviet
                      army invaded Afghanistan, 24 Dec 1979.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> But the reality, secretly
                      guarded until now, is completely otherwise</strong></span> Indeed, it was July 3, 1979
                      that President Carter signed the first directive for secret aid to the
                      opponents of the pro-Soviet regime in Kabul. And that very day, I wrote
                      a note to the president in which I explained to him that in my opinion
                      this aid was going to induce a Soviet military intervention.</p>
              <p class="q">Q: When the Soviets justified their intervention by asserting that they
                      intended to fight against a secret involvement of the United States in
                      Afghanistan, people didn't believe them. However, there was a basis of

                      on a war unsupportable by the government, a conflict that brought about
