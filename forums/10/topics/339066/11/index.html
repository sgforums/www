              <p>Are you aware that during the crusades, it takes 1 to 3 years for a simple no answer to reach Syria from England, at times even the message never arrives? And hardly that message would ever be told to the peasants in England?</p>
              <p>Right now, I can send my message to someone in Alaska within 0.22seconds, and have an answer back in similar time? Technologies and societies had improved and evolved far beyond the days of crusades. We can never go back to those days, unless our world is destroyed by nukes.<strong> I do not know what other hi-tech weapons will be used in world war 3, but i do know that come world war 4, we will surely be using sticks and stones!</strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">So you're assuming that just because you can send a message to someone in Alaska which is in the USA which is a developed countries within 0.22 seconds and have an answer back in similar time plus assuming you're living in a developed nation too, that all the Middle Easterners are able to do that too?</span></p>

              <p>The world can wait even another 400 years for education and eradication of islamic 'mis-interpretations'. But only if affirmative action WILL come from the Islamic faith to stop the destruction of its own religion by monsters who misinterpretate religious texts to gain recruits, funds and sympathizers for their diabolical mass murdering schemes of innocent men, women and children.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">That's why we need to help them, empower the Muslims with advanced communication technologies.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">No longer should the rural areas be isolated from the rest of the population </span><span style="color: #0000ff;">asisolation can breed ignorance that is brought down from generation to generation.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Yet, you should know that the Muslims unlike Christians don't have a figure-head equal to that of the pope. Thus unlike the Christian issue, the Muslim issue is quite tricky.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Catholics and Protestants, after centuries of bitter fighting and bombings of innocents, ended during our times, and these idealogies survived.</p>

              <p>Greetings of peace to you too, Zulkiflim.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It would be an honour and priviledge to meet a person of your calibre and understanding in the battlefield, for you understand the concept of 'noble warrior'. But let us NEVER meet under any circumstances in the battlefield, this and the generations to come.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Being able to comprehend such concepts, thus i am assured that the terrorists whom claimed affinity to your religion who slays innocents are only worth contempt in your mind and against the religious doctrines you had been taught, <strong>not worthy of any support, funds or even sympathy for their actions.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But it is not enough that you know all these, you must help ensure others understand this as well, and make them promise or even swear to help others understand this.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For too long, many heads of state had failed both religion and society to eradicate the oppression of terrorism. <span style="color: #888888;">It is up to us, the masses whom are closer to the ground, to effect such changes.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The past is past. The dead is dead. But there is much we can do for those living, and those yet to come as well as honour those whom had needlessly die in order that we remember we are humans after all. I hope you will consider my words. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Salaam</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>   Islam does not change it is people who follow it
              that make the decision.</p>
              <p>The rules of Islam is very simple,it is written specifically in
              the Quran.</p>
              <p>Aggression is allowed only when attacked and even then
              forgiveness is better if they fear Allah.</p>
              <p>So in short,we are allowed to retaliate if a person does harm,an
              eye for an eye,an arm for an arm,,and so on.</p>
              <p>But only to the person who does the harming not to others.</p>
              <p>Inshallah we will all get what we deserve,our sin are our
              own.</p>
              <p>No other can bear the other.</p>
              <p>For muslim one and all who fear allah and fear the fire,would
              seek HIS pleasure and do what is right.</p>
              <p>I shall give an example of aggression in Islam.</p>
              <p>Once 2 warriors fought,blood lust rose and they fought till one
              is overcome,but at the last moment the winner did not kill.</p>
              <p>When asked why,he simply said,if i had taken your life it is due
              to anger and not for Allah sake.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So in islam we are commanded to do the best we can for Allah and
              not for ourselves.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Those are the views of Islamic scholars. I have to quote one of them so that you can condemn the scholar.</p>
              <p>Here it goes:</p>
              <p><strong>Ibn al-Qayyim</strong> said in <strong>al-Faroosiyyah </strong>(p.18):</p>
              <p>Undoubtedly taking the initiative in fighting has a great 
                  effect in spreading Islam and bringing people into the religion of Allaah in 
                  crowds. Hence the hearts of the enemies of Islam are  filled with fear of 
                  jihad.</p>

              <p>With reference to what Zulkiflim said, i will rather not follow laws and rules blindly. The world is always changing, so will situations.</p>
              <p>Therefore, the teachings must be revised to keep up with current thinking. In that way, terrorists will not be able to get their way with innocents with their distorted perceptions. I strongly recommend this. If not, followers will become terrorists or abandon their beliefs easily.</p>
