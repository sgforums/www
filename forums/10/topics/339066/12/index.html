              <p>Those are the views of Islamic scholars. I have to quote one of

              <p><strong>Ibn al-Qayyim</strong> said in

              <p>Undoubtedly taking the initiative in fighting has a great effect
              in spreading Islam and bringing people into the religion of Allaah
              in crowds. Hence the hearts of the enemies of Islam are 
              filled with fear of jihad.</p>

              <p>With reference to what Zulkiflim said, i will rather not

              <p>Therefore, the teachings must be revised to keep up with current

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="direction: ltr; unicode-bidi: embed; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>The fact that the sword and power were means of spreading Islam is not a sources of shame for Islam, rather it is one of its strengths and virtues</strong></span>, because that makes people adhere to that which will benefit them in this world and in the Hereafter. Many people are foolish and lacking in wisdom and knowledge, and if they are left to their own devices they will remain blinded to the truth, indulging in their whims and desires. So Allaah has prescribed jihad in order to bring them back to the truth and to that which will benefit them. Undoubtedly wisdom dictates that the fool should be prevented from doing that which will harm him, and should be forced to do that which will benefit him. </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="direction: ltr; unicode-bidi: embed; text-align: justify;">Islam spread by means of proof and evidence to those who listened to the message and responded to it, <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">and it spread by means of force and the sword to those who were stubborn and arrogant</span></strong>, until they were overwhelmed and became no longer stubborn, and submitted to that reality. </p>

              <p>Zulkiflim,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is with a 'some what' gladdened heart when i read the report that terrorists in France had only planted bombs and did not set them off in shopping centres,. giving time to evacuate busy shoppers during this season of gift buying to evacuate, and did not set it off as they normally would do.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Te</span><a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20081217/wl_afp/franceattacksafghanistan"><span style="color: #ff0000;">rrorists bomb attempts in France</span></a><a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20081217/wl_afp/franceattacksafghanistan"><span style="color: #ff0000;"> </span></a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It would be stretching imagination that i had something to do with it and that Al Qaeda had been reading my posts and reacting with acts of mercy to innocents.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It would had been of some consolation to  the late Mdm Lo Hwei Yen and her loved ones that her principle had been effective - the application of 'Lo Hwei Yen' principle - changing fixed mindsets with a correct and better ideology, as seen with France's terrorists withholding pushing the button to kill thousands of innocents only buying gifts for their loved ones.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Their principle demand was that France pull out their troops in Afghanistan. France anyway had alread planned to do so. Even so should US. There is no point in keeping military troops there.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> Instead, they should send 100,000 clerics - modern religious scholars, imans and mullahs, into the villages to correct the flaws in the interpretations of the Islamic holy book. You can't fight an ideology by bullets alone.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Even Thai's PM realised this and cannot depend on their police and military to keep the peace in the restive south.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If there is great concern that only a monotheistic religion rules Earth, then lets decide it on an agreed battlefield with HONOUR. Let us disarm any advantage we have, and meet face to face, armed with only swords and spears for equality's sake. If the opposition has no trainning or time enough with it, then let's meet with only fists and loincloth to settle the religious issue.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Battles are not a numbers game anyway. The good prophet Mohammed,( blessed be his name and his mercifulness), had only 300 soldiers and yet routed 900 Meccans to win a decisive battle to gain ascendency and divine proof of his theology.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Let us then meet in the battlefield and let the Supreme Being, whom we all believed exists in different names, even athesism, decide which side would be victorious.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>At least, with such a crucial event, innocents would be spared the oppression of terrorism, and victors can claim superiority in their religion, with the defeated and their progeny surrending to a truth finally. and supporting whole heartedly the Supreme Being's divine will without question.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But before such enterprises, of which i will vie to be the first to sign up for as well as the firstman to face the first and often brutal charge, give diplomacy, negotiations and compromises a chance.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Look at the innocents, espacially the children. They may be naughty, but in their innocent ways, they know not what is tyranny and oppression as well as other societal evils. We as their forebears have a responsibility to them that they may grow up knowing freedoms - freedom from oppression, illiterarcy, povery, hunger and espacially discrimination.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The world wept when Beslan happened - the horrible massacre of 334 innocent hostages, including 186 young children, hundreds more wounded, conducted by animals whom swore fealty to a religion as they blew themselves and others up. And now, one of our own citizen had died hearing that swear again. Their deaths must not be in vain. It must end.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We can share this planet, progress and evolve till technology enable us all to leave it to inhabit other planets of our own in the Universe, as promised to a common patriach in all holy books that we mankind will be more than the stars -“Look up at the heavens and count the stars—if indeed you can count them.” Then He said to him, “So shall your offspring be.” Genesis 15:5-6</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This i plead, even on my knees, me a red-blooded republican whom will NEVER kneel before any prince or principalities. plead to you and your kind to do what is necessary to correct the flaws in your religion in order to fight terrorism,  using the 'Lo Hwei Yen Principal', not for my sake, but the innocent future generations yet to come.</p>

              <p><br> Why ask for the link? The link you've provided is even better. It
              shows that Islamic scholars and Imams are in agreement that Islam
              is spread by the sword.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/ccmathteam.com/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"></p>

              <p style="direction: ltr; unicode-bidi: embed; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>The fact that the sword and
              power were means of spreading Islam is not a sources of shame for
              Islam, rather it is one of its strengths and
              virtues</strong></span>, because that makes people adhere to that
              which will benefit them in this world and in the Hereafter. Many
              people are foolish and lacking in wisdom and knowledge, and if they
              are left to their own devices they will remain blinded to the
              truth, indulging in their whims and desires. So Allaah has
              prescribed jihad in order to bring them back to the truth and to
              that which will benefit them. Undoubtedly wisdom dictates that the
              fool should be prevented from doing that which will harm him, and
              should be forced to do that which will benefit him. </p>
              <p style="direction: ltr; unicode-bidi: embed; text-align: justify;">Islam
              spread by means of proof and evidence to those who listened to the
              message and responded to it, <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">and it spread by means of force and the sword to
              those who were stubborn and arrogant</span></strong>, until they
              were overwhelmed and became no longer stubborn, and submitted to
              that reality. </p>

              <p>Nah, not true, FC. I am very fortunate to have grown up in Singapore. It is the only truly multi-ethnic society i knew despite my travels far abroad. I grew up with them and know of no such ambitions.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Muslims everywhere are truly peaceful people and no different from us, even though according to their holy book, written in the 6th century when enemies surrounded them - the rest of the world are infidels.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Their needs and desires are similar with everyone of us. We are all similar human beings, as DNA had proven. They were friendly, and one of the most hospitable people on Earth, comparable to the Thais.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But their lives are now being dictated and manipulated by ambitious deviants who hijack their peaceful religion in order to attain world domination.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We are no longer living in the 6th century, and for the religious, had been blessed to progress into the 21st century, to know better the marvel and wonders of an Almighty, becoming closer as never before. No modern doctor is an atheist once he performs surgery or discovers a particular gene. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But these terrorists want nothing better than to bomb us back to the stone age. </p>
