              <p><br> 7 years had passed by, my dear. 7 years to correct one simple
              mistake - misinterpretations. In that time, a 6 year old kid would
              have passed his PSLE exams, a JC student would have gotten his
              University degree, etc..need i elaborate more?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Worse still, there had been cases of funding for these deviants
              of the great Islamic faith. Who had been sympathising with them?
              They should have been wiped out 7 years ago, yet they still exist
              not only in the middle east, but even in s-e asia.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is incredulous that the Islamic faith could issue
              international 'Fatawas' against writers or act against couples
              kissing in public, and yet here the deviants are flagrantly
              besmirching their religion, which they admitted in 911, not
              only continues to walk boldly, they could even get funds and
              support!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Lotus, you may be a kind and soft hearted person, but i am sure
              that when a terrorist gun is pointed at your head, for
              terrorism has no mercy for anyone and anyone could be a target,
              with the trigger ready to pulled, you will be singing a
              different tune.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Let's you and me appeal to the Islamic faithful to act more
              decisively on a global scale, even requesting they
              perform 'evangelical' preaching into terrorists hotspots
              around the world, excommunicating errant mullahs or
              imans, to stop this targetting of innocents. If
              not, it will be other humans will have to do the job, one
              way or another, which we must avoid and avert. </p>

              <p>and btw do you know that during the trial of the terrorists responsible for the bali bombing, one of the victims' family asked that the terrorists not be sentenced to death?</p>

              <p>Are you aware that during the crusades, it takes 1 to 3 years for a simple no answer to reach Syria from England, at times even the message never arrives? And hardly that message would ever be told to the peasants in England?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Right now, I can send my message to someone in Alaska within 0.22seconds, and have an answer back in similar time? Technologies and societies had improved and evolved far beyond the days of crusades. We can never go back to those days, unless our world is destroyed by nukes. I do not know what other hi-tech weapons will be used in world war 3, but i do know that come world war 4, we will surely be using sticks and stones!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> Thus we had evolved and must continue to evolve.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The world can wait even another 400 years for education and eradication of islamic 'mis-interpretations'. But only if affirmative action WILL come from the Islamic faith to stop the destruction of its own religion by monsters who misinterpretate religious texts to gain recruits, funds and sympathizers for their diabolical mass murdering schemes of innocent men, women and children.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Many religions had sprang from our world since the dawn of civilisation, and each with free will, will get tested if their idealogy can stand the test of time. Many failed.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Buddhism had its share of martial adventures during the Qing dynasty in China. It finally learnt to keep out of the secular sphere, ending its political influence in society and survived.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Catholics and Protestants, after centuries of bitter fighting and bombings of innocents, ended during our times, and these idealogies survived.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Any monk, preacher, pastor, mullah or iman will acknowledge the Supreme Being moves in mysterious ways. A message had been sent in our times - just open your eyes and see.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Will the Islamic faith pass the test to enjoy a greater following of its idealogy,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Or will they fail thru their apathy and hypocrisy - being intolerant and harsh to others, yet blind together with no action on despicable evil followers who misinterpretate their religion, and even sympathising them, these animals living amongst us who brutally murders innocent men, women and children whom are creations of an Supreme Being ALL religions acknowledges within their own ideologies?</p>

              Have all the Muslims and imams you spoke to told or given you the impression that they sympathize with the terrorists or that they did no wrong? My Muslim friends always felt very lousy whenever there was any terrorist attack. They were angry with the terrorists and at the same time worried about being indiscriminately condemned by non Muslims. I used to think that they were unduly worried but now with people like you I can really understand the pain they experienced.

              <p>Frankly speaking, if you have spent a considerable amount of time learning Islam, which I doubt you have, you will realise that a lot of 'moderate' Muslims don't make attempts to reveal the truths about Islam.</p>
              <p>Contrary to what they say, apostasy is an act that is punishable by death. In secular Malaysia, they are sent to 'rehabilitation camps' to repent. Do some research on your own. It will change your perspective about this religion of peace.</p>

              <p>Pearlie, my message is very simple.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>The Islamic faith had ALL collectively agreed that there was a 'mis-interpretation' of their holy book that any fellow head/branch member has a right to declare 'Jihad' and send its underlings to murder innocent men, women and children.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thus, they must ensure that this 'interpretation' be corrected by taking concrete steps, including going into uneducated and even hotbeds of terrorism to correct this flaw.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It's no use to be in dismay or even paying respects to the slain, because it borders upon hypocrisy. No use in returning to fundamentalism when such evil followers walks freely amongst them, destroying their own religion and yet receiving funds, recruits and sympathizers.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>While muslims may be dismayed and fear discrimination, <strong>but what about the fears of majority in society discriminated by the evil followers of a peaceful religions as well the pain suffered by loved ones of innocent victims? who will give them succor? </strong>The time for proaction on education and eradication of 'misinterpretations' has come.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>I, here, am not denouncing their religion, but plead that they uphold it. The 'mis-interpretations' must stop before more innocent dies from it.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A father whose son had murdered someone, must turn in his son to the authorities, NOT sympathise with him no matter the mitigating circumstances. A brother who had gone astry, must be brought back to the fold and have his ways corrected, NOT with sympathy or funds, but educating him and showing the benefits of civilise society.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We in Singapore had achieve great strides in promoting inter-faith dialogues. So too must the world to help the imans from backward regions to bravely counter evil manipulators such as Al Qeada and gang, to prevent them from achieving funds, recruits and international sympathizers</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>There is NO justification for the brutal slaying of innocent men, women and children in ANY relilgion nor any mitigating factors to gain funds, recruits and sympathizers.</strong></p>

              <p>There were 2 Buddhist monks walking along a path one foggy morning. At a fast flowing stream, they met a helpless young lady who wanted to cross the stream but was afraid of its unknown depth.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The junior monk nonchalently just walk across without a look to the lady, but the senior monk kindly lifted the lady and carried her across the stream and unloaded her at the other end.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The junior monk was aghast, for its scriptures was taught that a monk must not have any physical contact with females. He was angry at the senior monk for such transgressions, but dare not rebuke him out of respect for his senority, and dragged his feet, mumbling audibly to himself.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The senior monk was aware of what was wrong, stopped and queried him on the matter. With blazing hotshot fiery eyes and sputtering saliva, he accused the senior monk of his transgression.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The senior monk looked serenely at him, and with a smile, said " I had already unloaded that helpless lady a mile back at the stream side, but you on the other hand, are <span style="text-decoration: underline;">still</span> carrying that baggage in your heart all these while."</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>The junior monk nonchalently just walk across without a look to the lady, but the senior monk kindly lifted the lady and carried her across the stream and unloaded her at the other end.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The junior monk was aghast, for its scriptures was taught that a monk must not have any physical contact with females. He was angry at the senior monk for such transgressions, but dare not rebuke him out of respect for his senority, and dragged his feet, mumbling audibly to himself.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The senior monk was aware of what was wrong, stopped and queried him on the matter. With blazing hotshot fiery eyes and sputtering saliva, he accused the senior monk of his transgression.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The senior monk looked serenely at him, and with a smile, said " I had already unloaded that helpless lady a mile back at the stream side, but you on the other hand, are <span style="text-decoration: underline;">still</span> carrying that baggage in your heart all these while."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>FC, may you have the wisdom to comprehend this parable. Peace be unto you.</p>

              <p>Are you aware that during the crusades, it takes 1 to 3 years
                  for a simple no answer to reach Syria from England, at times even
                  the message never arrives? And hardly that message would ever be
                  told to the peasants in England?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Right now, I can send my message to someone in Alaska within
                  0.22seconds, and have an answer back in similar time? Technologies
                  and societies had improved and evolved far beyond the days of
                  crusades. We can never go back to those days, unless our world is
                  destroyed by nukes. I do not know what other hi-tech weapons will
                  be used in world war 3, but i do know that come world war 4, we
                  will surely be using sticks and stones!</p>

              <p>Nothing beats a straight answer like a straight answer.</p>
              <p>There is a reason people study history, so that they can perceive the true nature of society from learning about previous trends. People always try to learn from their mistake, but unfortunately, that is the last thing that society has done.</p>
              <p>As Orwell wrote "Who controls the past controls the future. Who controls the present controls the past".</p>
              <p>And I'm merely asking some basic philosophical questions and whether you knew some historical facts.</p>
              <p>Why am I so fixated on this? Because if you even refuse to acknowledge this kind of non-mainstream and establishment-challenging historical facts, then you wont even be willing to accept the likelihood of the same kind of inhumanity being perpetrated today, and less still, the willingness to approach things from an objective viewpoint. Thats why you need to rely on name calling like "conspiracy theorists" etc.</p>
