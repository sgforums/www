              <p>Many believed that poverty and lack of opportunities is the root of terrorism. It is a mistaken belief. Ideology is the cause of terrorists acts. The influencing or diversion of minds since birth towards an anti-humanity direction in life.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For 40 or more years, the world had tolerated the fundamental Islamic faith or its deviants. Despite their excesses, of preaching 'justified killings' of indifidels - meaning the rest of us who do not share their religious ideologies - , we had not been vocal or sought retribution even when we saw our loved ones cut down by them.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We still pleaded with them to be moderate instead of wiping them out even though we have the numbers, the technologies and the intelligences to do so, for we considered ourselves civilised and not barbarians.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Some of them listened, but what their public proclaminations of peaceful intent is not congruent with what they say and practise in private.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>They have continued to persist in feudal living, narrow mindedly, as we share this planet, and criticised our way of life daily. All this while of claiming peace, they had continued to train and educate its people to mass murder innocent men, women and children.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>They DO make attempts to seperate their kind living amongst us while killing others, but more often then not, they claim expediency in murdering them as well, but ensuring first their own families, friends and mullahs are not amongst us at the time of murders.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Why should one ethnic group be kept safe, and in their safety, find comfort to proclaim peace or keep apathetic distance, with a higher survival rate, while the rest of us humanity be mercilessly cut down piecemeal?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The world is sickened. 40 years and more of patience, education and pleadings had not done anything good to tame terrorism. The latest Mumbai attacks and senseless killings of our loved ones had crossed the line of patience, goodwill amongst men and sanity.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have no fear of my multicultural fellow citizens here in Spore, because our efforts to promote peaceful living had been largely successful.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have no fear that we this generation may have to pay the price for our mistake in not tackling fundamentalistic or deviant religious ideologies seriously and effectively.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I only fear that the next generation, whom are innocent, be the ones to suffer for our inactivity and apathy, and they will have to pay the price of being mercilessly cut down.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Perhaps S. Huddington's 'Clash of Civilisation' is in the end - inevitable?</p>

              <p>For those intellectual fundamentalist religious scholars who wish to challenge my post, i ask that you desist in bringing historical twisted baggages as a defense to confuse and detract.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I only ask that you answer one simple question, and it will make your stand clear:-</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'Are we, who do not share your faith, infidels?'</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If your answer is is, then your mental moral threshold is higher to accept the terrorists murders as justifiable, for there is no crime in a village mullah inspired killing of 'disbelievers/infidels' anytime, anyplace and anywhere, in the indoctrination of you in your faith.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If your answer is no, then aren't you challenging the very word of your deity, whom is all you have when you took that leap of faith to suspend logic and reason in order to believe?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you can believe that one word from an almighty can be wrong, then what more is there to believe in other words and teachings?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I know it is tough to be a moderate and stay true to religious beliefs. It is a moral dilema daily. Some chosed to use hypocrisy or be apathetic and live in delusion.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Our own lives are not important, but for the sake of others and the next generations to come, it is a moral dilemma and a hard question we MUST confront and tackle it once and for all, as we come to grips and attempt to make sense of the brutal tragedy before our eyes.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And only then, can we all live in peace and goodwill.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If not, then let us meet in a common agreed upon ground, men to men, with honour, battle it out to settle our differences, instead of using cowardly brutual senseless killings of innocents in non-declared combat zones.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The inevitable as S. Huddington had predicted, may have to come to pass.</p>

              <p>Nah i think its cause of oppression (indirectly, US foreign policy) Why, if these people were living peacefully would they sacrifice themselves for these attacks? Envy? If that were the case the africans and tibetians would have attacked too.  The reason is probably they are not happy with the country that oppressed them. (On a side note good thing Obama is deciding to change US foreign policy)</p>

              <p>It could be that India keep on kill kill kill muslims, causing some frustrated people to form terrorist groups to retaliate.</p>
              <p>You think normal people got nothing better to do than to go and carry out terrorist acts?</p>
              <p>It's because their life is already fucked up by repression.</p>

              <p><br>yeah right. And because of 'perceived repression', then it's ok to kill innocent men, women and children who had nothing to do with Kashmir or even made that decision to so call 'repress' kashmir?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Do their killings did anything to end so called 'repression'? I am telling you it just made their situation a whole lot worse.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Support freedom by all means and end oppression. But killing innocent people is abosolutely reprehensive. Worse still manipulators use religion as a tool to support wholescale slaughter of non-combatants.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There will be no sympathy. The ultimate response will be ten times worse than what they did to humans, and for generations, for orphan sons and daughters, grieving mothers and fathers,  and friends will not forgive nor forget.</p>

              <p>Terrorists are certainly warped individuals. Which human would value another's human life so low to want to end it for him? They are animals and require no sympathy.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It's with thinking like you that allow terrorists to spawn, because both you and his religion seem to agree that killing innocent men women and children for whatever hurts is justified!</p>
