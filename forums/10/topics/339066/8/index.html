              <p>And about the inspection, i think sadam is a different kind of government with US, they may not be so familiar with the procedure or ways dealing with the international issue, but just like singapore, if US suspect singapore hiding Nuclear weapon, is US authorised  to search the island, many country in the world have the nuclear weapon, are they consider as a threat in the world, nuclear weapon is a threat, no matter, in which country's hand. So i guess, sadam is with a little pride, would not like to bow his head to US. As because of this his country is invaded , and he is hanged.So unfortunate.</p>
              <p>And some country would not like to open up, especially they are deemed as vulgar country, maybe some of you maybe have the same feeling with me, when you saw a woman wearing a veil, you wonder why she do that, you may think it's wierd, but in order to understand a different country, we need to know it, not discriminate,</p>

              <p>Rokkie, you are a prime example of why terrorism cannot be won by bullets alone. The anti-terrorism battle can only be won if it is fought in the minds of the masses, with facts, reason and logic - repeated and reinforced regularly.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If not, terrorism will only gain adherents, recruits and sympathisers who had been fed with conspiracy theories and misinformation as well as mis-interpretations, more so for those whose access to information is limited to the village headmen or iman.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For simplicity sake, i will use an analogy.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Your neighboour is a bastard. He not only beats up his wife and kids, he beats up his neighbours living next door both sides to him. Despite civil actions on him, he persisted in his ways, each time promising to behave, but still continue to do the same.</p>
              <p><br>One day, others saw a big package being delivered into his house. His son revealed it was a torture rack. You as a neigbour decides to investigate, but he insists no. He admits to having a torture rack, but it is only for decorative purposes, without any metallic hooks or chains.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Knowing his background, his history, and the abuse he does to his neighbours and family, you demand he let you in to check, to ensure it is only for decorations and not a contraption in order to protect everyone in the neighbourhood as well as his innocent kids.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You gave him time to open his door, but each dateline he refuses. You fear for his kids and the neighbourhood, and cannot trust this hoodlum. You barge in, and finds out only the wooded rack remain. There were no traces of metallic chains and hooks, perhaps he had already removed them.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The issue here is not one of an owner's right to his home and the priviledge to keep others out. The issue is - what is behind the doors of a habitual human abuser. If there was no delivery of a wooden rack, you would not have barged in, but only to complain to the police about his beatings of neighbours and kids.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But with that rack, which can kill, you have to act, otherwise, you too will one day end up on it when this mad neigbour, in his bouts of insanity, places hooks and chains on it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thus, similarly, Sadam is a insane person. And no one is about to trust him not to make nukes when he had actively threatened to do so.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He is insane. Not because the media said so, but because even his own countrymen who suffered under him said so, his own countrymen who judged and decides, hanged him and said so, the kurdish neigbours who had been gassed, said so, Iran, which had a long war with him, said so, Kuwaitis, who had their oil wells burned dry, said so.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Learn to find out the facts before you commit to anything. Never trust what conspiracy theorists claim, because while the theories are not lies, they are <span style="text-decoration: underline;">neither the truth</span> - for example, if i were to drive to geylang, you can claim that i am visiting prostitutes. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But am I really visiting prostitutes? Or just to savour the great food there? Visiting geylang <span style="text-decoration: underline;">is a truth</span>, but visiting prostitute <span style="text-decoration: underline;">may or may not be a truth</span>, because you didnt see me enter a brothel.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But others will readily accept that both are truths when you tell it, for they don't know and just presume it so. There lies the danger of consipiracy theories. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">It muddles and confused issues, making something that is meant to be easy to comprehend becoming complex.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So becareful. Critically analyse info, even mine, online or libraries microfilm back copies of newspapers, OR you will end up being manipulated and used by others, espacially deviant terrorists into sympathizing them and their deeds.</p>

              <p>They just want attention? Arent there many other ways to do that besides killing people? I thought the common perception of Islamic terrorists is that they want to conquer the world for Allah.</p>

              <p>There is a misconception that  the ordinary Iraqis are worse off after the American and her allies liberated the Iraqis from Saddam's clutches.</p>
              <p>From a report in March 2007, a survey of 5,000 Iraqis indicates:</p>
              <p>One in four Iraqis has had a family member murdered. In Baghdad, the capital, one in four has had a relative
                  kidnapped and one in three said members of their family had fled abroad.</p>
              <p>But
                  when asked whether they preferred life under Saddam, the dictator who was
                  executed on 30 December 2006, or under Nouri al-Maliki, the prime minister, most
                  replied that things were better for them today.</p>
              <p>Only the Iraqis who are so desperate for disasters in Iraq are worse off today.</p>
              <p>No Iraqi will miss Saddam except those who benefited under his brutal rule.</p>

              <p>You seems to post only links to alleged US 'atrocities' in Iraq but mentioned none of the gruesome nature in which the insurgents and <strong>the Arab civilians</strong> acted.</p>
              <p> Since you mentioned blackwater indiscriminately killed civilians, I'll give just one example here, of how the Blackwater mercenaries were treated. Some civilians were not innocent as you would like to have people think. They are Sunni Arabs.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/ccmathteam.com/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>&lt;It is one of the most infamous incidents of the war in Iraq: On March
                  31, 2004, four private American security contractors get lost and
                  end up driving through the center of Falluja, a hotbed of Sunni
                  resistance to the US occupation. Shortly after entering the city, they
                  get stuck in traffic, and their small convoy is ambushed. Several armed
                  men approach the two vehicles and open fire from behind, repeatedly
                  shooting the men at point-blank range. Within moments, their bodies are
                  dragged from the vehicles and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">a crowd</span> descends on them,
              <span style="text-decoration: underline;"> tearing them to pieces</span>. Eventually, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">their corpses are chopped and
                  burned.</span> The remains of two of the men are strung up on a
                  bridge over the Euphrates River and left to dangle. The gruesome
                  image is soon beamed across the globe.&gt; </strong></span></p>

DU is a serious problem, not a conspiracy theory. 1500-2000 tons were vapourised into the air when DU bombs landed on Iraq during Shock and Awe.

              <p>This is a country at war. I dont deny the horrible things that
              the Iraqis commit against Western forces. Killing cannot be
              whitewashed by any euphemisms, even fighting against an occupying
              forces.</p>
              <p>But you seem to think that the US is a beacon of freedom
              and democracy in Iraq. DU is a serious problem, not a conspiracy
              theory. 1500-2000 tons were vapourised into the air when DU
              bombs landed on Iraq during Shock and Awe. Similar weaponry were
              used in Kosovo and spread radioactivity across Yugoslavia. Isn't
              that just like using nukes?</p>

              <p>As if the use of biological and chemical weapons on enemies - both soldiers and civilians - by Saddam's army is not serious enough to mention.</p>
              <p>It's no secret that the US has DU ammo in it's arsenal. Any country that wants to go to war with the US army must have known this.</p>

              <p>Yeah I mentioned that he used them on the Kurds and the Iranians. But who sold them to him? The US. France built Saddam's nuclear program. I'm not saying who has the higher moral ground, all parties involved are scum.</p>
              <p>Similarly, if you know that the US is using DU munitions, that spread high levels of radioactivity round the world, scarring the Iraqi population, is it even humane?</p>
              <p>We always focus on the leaders, while the ordinary people suffers.</p>
