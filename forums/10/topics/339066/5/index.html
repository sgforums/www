              <p>Its also shocking to think that people like you classify everything they are unfamiliar with as "conspiracy theories". Do you <em>know </em>everything?</p>
              <p>Assuming you know <em>half of everything</em> (what an assumption..), what are the chances that those things I posted existed in the other half of things you don't know.</p>
              <p>Its is clear to everyone that you're the one maintaining a closed mind here with your holier than thou attitude instead of considering the possibility that you might be wrong.</p>
              <p>You can say I'm propagating "outright lies". But until you actually substantiate it (oh the irony), unlike my "unsubstantiated post" (I'm sure), it'll just be assertion. You can probably spam "outright lies" on every other thread and tell people that you're just an ignorant close-minded person.</p>

              <p><br> Yes, the truth of "religions of peace" must be revealed.</p>
              <p>Christianity, Islam, Judaism.</p>
              <p>They all preach one similar theme, they are the true followers
              of faith and the rest can go to hell.</p>
              <p>Christianity:</p>
              <p>1) If you do not accept Jesus, subscrible to Christian
              faith and follow the bible, you will go to hell no matter how
              many kind deeds you done. You're a infidel.</p>
              <p>Islam:</p>
              <p>1) Similar to point 1 of Christianity</p>
              <p>Judaism:</p>
              <p>1) The Jews are the chosen people of God, enough said...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Yet, I would not choose to label a religion with the
              terrorist acts some of it's followers did.</p>
              <p>Religions only provide the texts written long long ago for
              people in the following generations to interpret,
              how these people choose to interpret them is solely up to them.
              Don't tell me that there is a fixed way of interpreting these texts
              because you have no idea how the ancient people interpreted
              them.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Can one proclaim that Christianity is a religion which
              promotes racism, slavery and terrorist acts and be assured that
              he/she wouldn't receive threats from Christians just because that
              what one believe?</p>
              <p>We have Christian terrorist group, Muslim terrorist group, Hindu
              terrorist group etc. but why we alway hear of Muslim terrorist
              groups?</p>
              <p>Because the media is baised or should I say the American media
              is baised.</p>
              <p>They choose to interpret the Quran according to their baised
              views, since many of Americans are Christians. Christianity and
              Islam have a lot of conflicts between them throughout
              history. </p>
              <p>They sought to protray Islam as evil, while some Islamic nations
              also protray Christianity as evil.</p>
              <p>With these baised views, it shouldn't be hard to figure out
              why there is a rising wave of hatred of Islam in
              Europe and elsewhere in the world.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But ultimately who is to blame for all these? We humans.</p>
              <p>We choose to believe what we want to believe no matter how
              educated we are.</p>

              <p>The truth shall prevail when the Muslims become stronger and send your country an invitation to embrace Islam. I believe every peace loving country today has a contingency plan when she receives that invitation, except you, maybe.</p>
              <p>Until then, whatever the 'moderate' Muslims preach about peace and tolerance can take a back seat.</p>

              <p>I can understand what you are trying to say.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Once war is declared, armies will attempt to destroy critical infrastructures such as military installations, airport, military barracks, munition factories, etc, to deny the enemy forces a chance to retaliate, and in time, make the enemy forces quickly surrender.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This was achieved earlier in Iraq when the campaign started. There were collateral dammages, but kept minimum due to the high tech bombs which  were specifically created and guided to hit critical targets without doing much dammage to surrounding areas. Iraq gave up the fight, and a new govt was formed to lead Iraqi society.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But now, US is bogged down for years in Iraq fighting in built up areas where civilians lived. The only reason why they are doing so is because despical terrorists, cowards that they really are, chosed to hide amongst the civilians, knowing full well the dangers they pose to innocents caught in the crossfire, instead of courageously facing the US army in open ground, which these animals boast so much about.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Iraqi civilians, govt officials and civil servants had been murdered along with US soldiers. The only capable security force in Iraq is the US, and have a responsibility to the Iraqi society to keep the peace, thus they have to pursue the animals to prevent further killings.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The bigger picture that many failed to realize is that it is part of an overall strategic aim by Al Queda to keep seperate the 2 american armies in the middle east - one in Afghanistan and the other in Iraq. Should US leave Iraq, its armies will link up in Afghanistan, presentating more troops, more equipment and better logistics to battle Al Queda.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thus the real enemies in Iraq is not US, but Al Queda, for it is sending its cowards into Iraq to achieve that aim. Iraq has already an elected govt, and a tired of war society. But unfortunately for them, they are but cannon fodder to Al Queda, whom will kill anyone, muslim or non-believers, for its own survival.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'If it bleeds, it can die and can be killed' is a common army barrack philosophy when dealing with unknown beings. Al Queda, unfortunately is not a monster that bleeds.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Al Queda is an ideology monster where bullets will fail, for you cannot fight a deep rooted ideology with bullets, but with a similar weapon -  a better and more progessive ideology. Idealogy monsters are like weeds -cut the grass and another grows in its place. You will need to cut the root.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For years, the US army had failed to discern the real enemy troops under their very nose. The real soldiers are NOT the terrorists. They are but dogs to be manipulated, taught, used and then discarded when their shelf lives are over.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The REAL soldiers are not carrying weapons, but instead carries the Koran, dressed with white robes and turban, sporting a goatee.</p>
              <p>They live simple and frugal lives, and do charitable works to win over the hearts of simple folks. With the hearts opened, the soldiers than sought to corrupt their minds with 'misinterpretations' of the Koran to do the bidding of Al Queda.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For years since 911, many had attempted NOT to discuss about religion, made it a sensitive topic for fear that it may drive moderates into the arms of fundamentalists for protection.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However, for that reason, it may have done the same by our silence, with evidence of the international muslim faith turning fundamentalist, creating fundamentalist societies and seek to be governed by fundamental philosophies of the Koran.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Moderates had no support in their fight against fundamentalism. No one discusses religion actively, logically and rationally to help support the moderates change mindsets.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The moderates were alone, facing a brutal and ever ready to kill fundamental supporters. Perhaps, resulting in them surrendering, reducing them to apathy.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The only way to fight ideology is with another ideology.-a better and more honest ideology - Education of the masses through the media, no more sympathizing of terrorism, keeping the public updated on the nefarious activities of the animals, challenge the fundamental teachings against our internationally accepted standards of human rights without fear and correct misinterpretations within  public sphere. Nothing should be deemed 'sensitive' where the lives of voiceless and fearful humans are at stake, but must always remember we are all humans and share the common ground of right to believe, but it does not entail and encrouch upon others' rights to live peace too.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Cut down on Homeland security spending for bullets and bombs, but spend it on personnel to actively reach out to the poor, the uneducated and the disenchanted,  to battle for their minds. It is an ideological battle in the fight against terrorism and the battle is in the mind of humans and not in the caves of Afghanistan.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>WIth political and religious will, only then can this heinous ideology be destroyed, the way the world destroyed the ideology that Earth is flat, Aryans are a master race, Westerners are superior than squat yellow buck tooth japs, blacks are stupid and  have no hope in a white dominated society, etc, etc.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I would like to say this piece is only my 2 cents worth, but it would demean the soul searching, inspiration and cracking my brains to come out with it. I am a nobody and generally apathetic, in a site with minority viewers, and under no illusions that what i had written would ever be adopted.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But if by fortunate chance it does, and my measures are ever even remotely adopted, i would like to dedicate it to Ms Lo Hwee Yen, our first tragic casualty in the war of terrorism, and call it the 'Lo Hwee Yen Principle - fighting a deep rooted idealogy with another better and honest ideology'.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It characterised her life - from humble background but leapt into success in life thru merit, against the ideology of elitism that only the elites from birth will succeed in life. And if the measures i had outline will ever be adopted, it will also be a victory and vengence against the terrorists who brutually deprive her of a life ahead of her. It was her tragic and brutal death that compelled me start and contribute to this thread, and i will not allow my young fellow citizen's death be in vain.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But i must also add that if there are any errors, mistakes, silliness or ambiguities, they are solely mine and i am fully responsible. No one else is.</p>

              <p>thank you for your comprehensive reply, but you know before Al queda, no one put too many attention on terrorism, i was wondering, why they attack US, there are some reason, is it?i hope maybe you could tell us the reason, </p>
              <p>then i think even the terrorist, they are human, they are religious enthusiasitics,</p>
              <p> I agree you on this, it's because the ideology difference, or religious difference, in fact these holy war have been shout out alot these days, and it can be trace back to long time ago, when crusader fighting muslim, one claim to protect the path to Jerusalem for pilgrim, but actually during the fighting, the crusader take alot of wealth from people whom they defeat, and the crusader become very rich,</p>
              <p>So it's a long story, and there are many christian country in the world, why Al queda only attack US and england, actually the christian in US is purtian christian, puritan go to America and build up country what US is today.</p>
              <p>So let's ask this question, why terrorist attack US and UK only, it's not like what you said, they kill everyone, they don't kill muslim, at least for most terrorist ,they don't kill muslim, even they have disagreement on religous issue, becasue they from different sect,</p>
              <p>They trying to figure it out, who start it, i think both party should be criticized, like US' hegemony, US is trying to establish world order, with him to be the boss, a lot of country is unhappy about it, it's not about poverty, or uncivilisation, actually Iraq and afghanistan, have much longer history than US, iraq and iran used to be the Babylon kingdom,</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>just now i compose a post, but it dissappear, sad, got to do it all over again,</p>
              <p>my english is sad, hope you could know what i am talking,</p>
              <p>The most difficult job in the world is to bridge or erase the ideology difference, as you said a better and more honest ideology, what is it, i think the most recognised better ideology is science and modernity .</p>
              <p>The terrorist, some of them also are educated, but after they finish their study, they go back to AL queda, to build weapon for them.So i think education is not gonna make the problem less.</p>
              <p>If you want to convert them from islam, i think it's impossible.</p>
              <p>Christianity or islam which is better, i think you cannot compare them like this, each of them come to world stage because history reason, how you can compare them, i once attend a christian meeting ,the speecher said something like islam is inferior, i believe this attitude is hold by most of christian, and we all know islam and christianity have deep connection, but why they cannot be equally good?</p>
              <p>i think the white people is too much get used to white is superior and dominate the world, they cannot accept something else, something looks alien.</p>
              <p>I think most of religion is exclusive, that's the reason why terrorist is so many in the world, religious people tend to be very enthusiastic about their religion, especially when there are so many people same with you, maybe there are some distortion about the Quran, but this is not only happen to islam, but to many other religion.At the beginning of the religion, the religion is open minded and tolerant, but when people is involved, people. alwasy trying to prove that my religion is better and so i am better, that's one nature of human.</p>
              <p>So if you cannot solve the exclusiveness of religion, i think you cannot help to solve the ideology difference.</p>
              <p>But now i see some hope in the conflicts, US economy is facing meltdown, and new president got to be elected, i see some change in the position of US in the world, maybe US could spare iraq, iran, and afghanistan, actually i want to one thing more here, US often want to portray, iraq ,iran as uncivilised, but actually iraq and iran, which used to be Babylon kindom ,have a much longer history than US, so it's not about who is being uncivilised, it's about who is stronger militarily and economically, than who is the boss, and who could scold other for not being civilised.</p>
              <p>Obama is black, so i think he could think twice before scolding other country for being ill behaved, and in the economical downturn, i think Asia gonna to arise, and asia's voice could be more important in the world, and hopefully Asia will be a mild role in solving terrorist activity.</p>

              <p>I see that while we are debating about terrorism and all the side incidents, we are detracted from seeing the rising scourge of an imperialistic religion. The secular world allows freedom of worship, and they flourish all over the world. And they are also quick to cry foul if they are in anyway impeded in the secular world.</p>
              <p>But where they reign supreme, they have no qualms about harrassing people of other faiths. Yes their theology allows people of other faith to practice freely, so claims the "moderates", but in reality, the reverse is practiced. You can see for yourself.</p>
              <p>While this debate is going on we fail to see through the facade of peace created by the moderates, and this allow the fundamentalist and militants to march on.</p>
              <p>The moderates by their wimpishness, unwittingly supports the militants.</p>
              <p>Where are the street protest, when there are repeated beheading and other atrocities in the name of their god? Why is there an out cry when a stylised word "AIR" happens to resemble the word for their god? Which is of greater abomination?</p>
              <p>Something is skewed about them, and we stubbonly refuse to see, because we want to be pollitically correct. Also we fear the inherent capacity for violence in them. Also we have deference to the moderates.</p>

              <p>But where they reign supreme, they have no qualms about harrassing people of other faiths. Yes their theology allows people of other faith to practice freely, so claims the "moderates", but in reality, the reverse is practiced. You can see for yourself.</p>
              <p>While this debate is going on we fail to see through the facade of peace created by the moderates, and this allow the fundamentalist and militants to march on.</p>
              <p>The moderates by their wimpishness, unwittingly supports the militants.</p>
              <p>Where are the street protest, when there are repeated beheading and other atrocities in the name of their god? Why is there an out cry when a stylised word "AIR" happens to resemble the word for their god? Which is of greater abomination?</p>
              <p>Something is skewed about them, and we stubbonly refuse to see, because we want to be pollitically correct. Also we fear the inherent capacity for violence in them. Also we have deference to the moderates.</p>

              <p><br>That's why <strong>religions</strong> can be considered one of the many roots of terrorism.</p>
              <p>We should move to suppress every religions (Christianity, Islam, Hinduism etc) on this earth thus moving us one step towards achieving peace.</p>
              <p>Do you agree with me?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyway to clear any misunderstanding, I'm not defending Islam (religion) or anything.</p>
              <p>But I feel that religions are nothing but books containing texts written by people from the past, so you can't hate a religion rather you're hating every single followers of the faith and <strong>did everyone of them did something to incur your hatred towards them as a whole</strong>?</p>

              <p><br>It also show how other religious terrorism are always side tracked when we talk about terrorism, it's always focused on one religion.</p>
              <p>Terrorism is a issue not bond by religions, cultures or nations.</p>
              <p>If you chose to see it as "belonging" to one religion, please...please open your eyes too.</p>

              <p><br>people need religion, is my answer, do you see, someone live a aimless life without a religion, that's why people need it to feel more content.</p>
