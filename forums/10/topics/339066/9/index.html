              and democracy in Iraq. DU is a serious problem, not a conspiracy
              theory. 1500-2000 tons were vapourised into the air when DU
              bombs landed on Iraq during Shock and Awe. Similar weaponry were
              used in Kosovo and spread radioactivity across Yugoslavia. Isn't

              <p>Depleted Uranium penetrators were used to kill armored targets during the war (there was little other use for it).  Lethal weapons against legit military targets.  Yes, you can criticize the Americans for using them, but many American tank crews especially loaders also paid the price for handling them.</p>
              <p>Bearing in mind, the Iraqis under Saddam Hussein deliberately used chemical weapons on non-military targets and on their own people.  Which of these 2 are more deliberate and evil?  DU on military targets or WMDs on civilian targets?</p>

              <p>Exactly. DU munitions may be very effective in destroying armoured targets but the repercussions are inhumane.</p>

              <p>FC, there you go again. I had not wanted to debate with you on DU, but your conspiracy theories are what manipulators use to sell their murder plans to recruits and sympathizing village idiot mullahs and imans who have no inkling of what physics is.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>DU has a half life of 4.5 billion years, which means it releases half its radiation in that time. I doubt if it even raises the background radiation level in several lifetimes.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The arabs and others will die more from CFC and ozone damage from their oil and gas processing plants, dumping of toxic wastes into the sea than DU ever will.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>DU happens in most of commercial products and their production anyway. Even toilet paper production uses it to analysis the thickness of the paper. Do watch your fear mongering, it is only helping terrorists gain sympathy.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Believe me, if the Al Qaeda succeeds in gaining sympathy and recruits as it had done for the past 7 years, radicalising even fundamental Islam, with regular chants of 'Death to US, Death to Jews, Death to Infidels", achieving political power and dominance as well as nuclear weapons, the free world will have to worry about nuclear winters for generations than mere DU.</p>

              <p>i TS,</p>
              <p>I do agree with you on this -&gt; "Despite your obvious and blatant sympathy for terrorists, there
                                      must be a common ground which we can agree upon. And that ground is
                                      that there is no justification in killing innocent men, women and
                                      children whatsoever." This is your strongest point thus far.</p>
              <p>Do you deny that there are also innocents that are lost/killed in the war against terrorisms on the other side? There are also peace-loving muslims that hate this war, and are killed too. Inevitably, this drives their hatred towards the people who are now in their lands, putting smart bombs down their neighbourhood and cities. And milking precious oil for their own benefits. What do you say to that?</p>
              <p>For me, when I see these terrorists, they are also people. But they are driven to insanity due to some crooked truths that are fed to them. But there are real elements of  truths inside, and hence these people are willing to die for what they believe in. Looking at history, what triggers this terrorists? We never hear of this in the 80s right? </p>
              <p>So what we are experiencing now is some so-called superpowers going to civilisations that they think they know, messed it up, then jumped sides to try to balance things. And now things get ugly, and they try to call the world to sort out their mess, is that right?</p>

There are also peace-loving muslims that hate this war, and are killed too. Inevitably, this drives their hatred towards the people who are now in their lands, putting smart bombs down their neighbourhood and cities. And milking precious oil for their own benefits. What do you say to that?</p>
              <p>For me, when I see these terrorists, they are also people. But they are driven to insanity due to some crooked truths that are fed to them. But there are real elements of  truths inside, and hence these people are willing to die for what they believe in. Looking at history, what triggers this terrorists? We never hear of this in the 80s right? </p>
              <p>So what we are experiencing now is some so-called superpowers going to civilisations that they think they know, messed it up, then jumped sides to try to balance things. And now things get ugly, and they try to call the world to sort out their mess, is that right?</p>

              <p>I absolutely agree that killing civilians is deplorable. If Islamic radicals do it, they should be punished under the Law. But if (Western) governments do it, everything is whitewashed? During WWII, the Allies firebombed Dresden and killed about 40,000 civilians even though the Germans were by all standards defeated. Thats not including the many instances of indiscriminate bombing of civilian targets. Granted, it was a war against fascism (really?), <strong>but I still dont understand why Standard Oil, IBM and others, supported IG Farden's militarist transformation of Germany</strong>. Then the US atomic-bombed Japan even though Japan was also by all means defeated. Even the 1946 US Strategic Bombing Survey concluded that the atomic bombings were unnecessary. In fact, it was a psychological tool to scare the world (and the Soviets) into submission. During the Korean War, the US bombed refugees. Have all these been conveniently ignored?</p>
              <p>When the US/NATO bombed Yugoslavia and balkanised that country, backing war criminal Hashim Thaci, was for freedom and democracy?</p>
              <p>A while ago, I posted this on another thread:</p>
              <p>"Under the the "Violent Radicalisation and Homegrown Terrorism Act", HR 1955 awaiting senate vote in the US:</p>
              <p>"The term `homegrown terrorism' means the use, planned use, or threatened use, <em><strong>of force or violence</strong></em> by a group or individual..."</p>
              <p>What is the difference between force and violence in the physical sense? Or are they supposed to mean two things?</p>
              <p>Besides the sense of physical violence, force could mean:</p>
              <p>1. Intellectual power or vigor, especially as conveyed in writing or speech.</p>
              <p>2. A capacity for affecting the mind or behavior</p>
              <p>Substituted into the definition of HR 1955, these two definitions of "force" makes HR 1955 seem designed to criminalise dissent. Now, is this too far-fetch'd a conclusion to reach?"</p>
              <p>Decades ago, governments usually called their opponents "communist". Today, the label seems to be "terrorist". In the US, the TSA has a terrorist watch-list which has surpassed 1 million and growing. Do you think that there are 1 million potential terrorists in the US? For your information, many on that list are dissidents or activists that have been criminalised for opposing the US Government. When you and other people take away from "terrorists" inherent rights of human beings, how are you morally superior to say, the people in charge of Guantanamo Bay? As important, like how HR 1955 and the PATRIOT Act show, dissent can be labelled as "terrorist" acts and punished accordingly.</p>
              <p>If there are really Islamic terrorists wrecking havoc, then I also condemn that. But not as far as to deny them humanity. Excusing all other perpetrators of barbaric acts of violence and focusing on demonised groups that the MSM puts on, is just plain idiotic.</p>
              <p>Accuse me of putting forward "conspiracy theories" all you want. The violence against US forces in Iraq is mostly resistance from the Iraqi people to the occupation. While the US invades a overwhelmingly inferior country in the name of non-existent WMDs in a blatant act of aggression, to steal its oil wealth, it can call its opponents "'terrorists" and people like you swallow that lie, and conveniently forget the inconvenient truth.</p>

              months before it was activated in July 1954</span>. The ring originally was to serve as a fifth
              column during the next war. The cable was preceded by oral instructions given by Colonel
              Benjamin Givii, head of Israel's military intelligence, to an officer headed for Cairo to
              join the ring. These instructions were:</p>

                actions should cause arrests, demonstrations, and expressions of revenge. The Israeli
                origin should be totally covered while attention should be shifted to any other possible
                factor. The purpose is to prevent economic and military aid from the West to Egypt. The
                choice of the precise objectives to be sabotaged will be left to the men on the spot, who

              <p>Poh, you another one. Spare us your historical baggages. Shall i list down terrorist acts conducted since mankind began?

              <p>And also, do tell me, what does a New Zealander have to do with the middle east that he deserved to die from terrorists' butcheries?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The issue here is :- is the specific targetting of innocent men, women and children for death justifiable or mitigating factors even acceptable?</p>

              <p>You and others can hate me all your want, but do not let my words or my perceived personality cloud your own moral judgement to help stop terrorism effectively. <strong>I am not important, but the innocent lives of others are!</strong></p>
