            <div class='col-md body'>Yo, you mudman, you want a flame war. Then I will give you one. FulcrumN, jeez, what a lousy nick? You think you are a fighter plane? In your dreams, pig. People (should be pigs ain't it) like you never learn, do you? It's pointless being jealous of singaporean. Yes, we have the money to buy new toys whenever we want. We have money to build desalination and reclaimed water plants. Before you go into the drinking our waste water bit, let me remind you that, better that than to buy it from your country and accusing us of underpaying. In this world, everything goes according to the law. Besides, we have the means to do so, what about mudland? Mudland is only dependent on what your land gives you? The day when your water and palm oil runs out, will be the day you meet your maker. We can afford to throw our money away then to give it to you, green eyed monster.<br><br>BTW, saw in a report recently, that any arms purchase in your lovely Mudland will now be paid to a certain percentage using palm oil. Pathetic isn't it? No hard cash to throw around. Just imagine, if we use agent orange on your palm tree plantation, what will happen? Hmm..hang on, agent orange needs planes to carry out, but then again we have the logistical means. And since we are now moving towards biotechnology, maybe we can create a bug for your palm trees and maybe at the same time, increase the number of pigs in your country. Oh, I forgot that's not necessary anymore, the population of pigs outnumbered your citizens. Look, pigs goes on Mudland TV very often and they wear suit. Wow, isn't that amazing! Still, a brainless pig is still a brainless pig. Can't think properly, can't talk. Tsk, tsk what a sorry sad life for you mudland pig. New Zealand have more cows than human (fact). Mudland have more pigs than human (definitely, when you see politician pigs and pigs like you oinking away.) Maybe you should consider exporting lard instead of palm oil, at least there will always be a constant supply.<br><br>I have respect for any military regardless of where it is from. But pathetic assholes like you who know next to nothing at all about their country's military comes in with a "flowery" nick goes on to say they are the best really tickles me. Like someone mentioned before, just need a sniper to take out the head. But I believe in overkill, level the damn place if we have to.<br><br>Well, ta ta for now. Now run back to your kampung and count your coconuts and do some more research before you butted in here. I will be waiting for you, dumb pig.</div>

Got typo mistake in your quote, I guess you must be very malu (my malay not good, so maybe wrong spelling). After all, we don't conduct official business in Bahasa Melayu. Amazing how our usage of english took us all over the world, while mudland pigs like you still stuck in your kampung playing marbles and picking coconuts. Hahaha!!<br><br>And if you want to pick on my nickname, it is because I am scolding pigs like you. Not that it matters to me.<br><br>Finally, maybe you should put forward JFK's quote to your mudland friends. Tsk, tsk always waiting for your govt to spoonfeed. So shameless. Hahaha, I am laughing so hard at your stupidity now.<br><br>Ciao, swine face.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Mudlander, tsk tsk, simple reply and that's all? What a pathetic showing. You wanted a flame war but your feeble attempt goes to show what kind of substance you are made of. Maybe you can't understand the English I was using. But I don't blame you after all pigs like you only know Melayu. Oooh...your melayu very omipotent. Hahaha. Face it, how many countries in the world speaks malay, not much. No wonder you are doomed to eternal damnation of stupidity. Understand? Well, to make it simpler for you, pigs like you are forever stupid.<br><br>Oh, and pig, do yourself and countryman a favour. Go stand under that coconut tree of yours in your kampung. Wait for the coconuts to drop onto your pig head. Who knows, you might get smarter from the concussion or you might just kick the bucket. And wanna know whats the differences between a bucket of shit and pigs like you? No differences.<br><br>Ok, folks, line up at the counter (*background playing fun fair music*).

You are the one who wanted a flame war, and now when you can't rebutt, you run home and cried. Pathetic Pig.<br><br>Living in New Zealand huh? Wow, what a fine example. Why leave Mud land, if it is so good to you? A bit contradictory isn't it? I don't care if you are a Mudland chinese or malay, anyone who tries to fan the flame of war and insult is an enemy. Maybe I don't know where cyberjaya is, and do I give a shit about it? Well, no I don't. Once a mud, always a mud. Tell me in simple economics term, if you have the money to pay, why consider barter trade? Why don't just sell your palm oil and get the money and use it to finance your new toys? Let me tell you why, simple, palm oil is a commodity, the value of it will rise and fall. By agreeing to barter trade, you are avoiding that and in a way is an advantage. But still it just goes to show, you have no hard cash. Besides, palm oil is harvested every year and so can delay the payment. When we pay with cash, we paid with it, no dilly dally. And we do read small prints, unlike pigs like you who don't.<br><br>We are underpaying your water. Get it straight in your head, who built the previous water treatment plant in mudland? Who underpay us for treated water? And who gets to keep the treatment plant after the treaty expire? One answer, Mudland. Underpaid, more likely we are the one who is being taken advantage of.<br><br>Finally, a pig is a pig, even if you try to be a cow in New Zealand. Well, folks there we have it, a pig with inferior complexity problem. So long maiale.</div>

Air Force, Navy or Army?<br><br>or are you one of those kids, armed with military hardware technical specifications and such - going around the internet challenging people?<br><br>The MAF is a professional regular outfit - professional enough to know the seriousness of any conflict and Malaysia's end result of war with its neighbours. Certain MAF generals and politicians already acknowleage that. I certainly hope the MAF is not that short sighted (although it sometimes appear to be), in considering regional and international matters, as well as the reasons for its neighbours' military hardware purchases.</div>
