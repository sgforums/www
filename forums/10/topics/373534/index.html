              <p><span id="intelliTXT"><strong>NATIONAL SERVICE</strong><br> <br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Introduction</span> <br> <br> National Service, or army conscription in Singapore, was first
              introduced in 1967 due to pressing issues such as national security
              after Singapore's "forced" independence in 1965. In 1971, the British
              completely pulled out of Singapore. It has been 41 years since the
              introduction of NS. <br> <br> Since then the world and Asia has changed significantly in terms of
              security and economic arrangements. But has Singapore's conscription
              policy kept up with these changes to reflect and cope with the new
              geopolitical landscape?<br> <br> First let us review the service that all able-bodied 18-year-old male
              Singaporeans have to undergo. Basic Military Training, or BMT, is the
              "boot camp" for all new recruits. This lasts for three months whereupon
              the soldier then gets posted out to other units for further specialised
              training. <br> <br> The conscripts then serve the remainder of their two-year stint
              polishing up their combat skills. Following the two years of full-time
              service, NSmen are required (for up to 40 days a year) to serve in a
              part-tme capacity until they are 50 years old for commissioned officers
              and 40 for others. <br> <br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Reduce the two-year full-time service</span><br> <br> In an age where warfare has turned to "smart" technology, is it still
              logical and necessary for Singapore to insist that its National
              Servicemen undergo 24 months months of active, full-time service? Such
              a policy is rare among countries that maintain a conscription policy.
              Below is a list of countries with periods of full-time conscript
              service: <br> <br> 1.Austria (6 months) <br> 2.Bolivia (12 months) <br> 3.Brazil (9-12 months) <br> 4.Denmark (4-12 months) <br> 5.Estonia (8-11 months) <br> 6.Finland (6-12 months) <br> 7.Germany (9 months) <br> 8.Greece (12 months) <br> 9.Guatemala (12-24 months) <br> 10.Moldavia (12 months) <br> 11.Mongolia (12 months) <br> 12.Paraguay (12-24 months) <br> 13.Poland (9-12 months) <br> 14.Serbia (6 months) <br> 15.Switzerland (18-21 weeks)<br> 16.Taiwan (12 months) <br> 17.Tunisia (12 months) <br> 18.Turkey (12 months) <br> 19.Ukraine (12 months_ <br> 20.Uzbekistan (12 months)<br> <br> From the above data, it can be seen that for all intents and purposes a
              conscript army training programme need not be as long as the one we
              have in Singapore. The more advance countries like Austria, Denmark,
              Germany, Greece, and Switzerland all have full-time services limited to
              one year and less. <br> <br> Even Taiwan, which has an identifiable enemy in the form of China,
              limits its active service to 12 months. Only countries like South Korea
              and Israel have conscription periods that are longer than Singapore's.
              These countries are, however, in a state of war.<br> <br> Given the situation in Singapore there is no reason why we cannot
              employ more efficient training methods and reduce full-time NS from the
              present two-years to twelve months or less.<br> <br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Reservist training</span><br> <br> The current period of reserve training for NS men of up to 40 years old
              is also a burden on the servicemen and, by extension, the economy. Not
              only does the serviceman have to contend with the influx of foreigners,
              they are disadvantaged in terms of employment, remuneration and
              promotion when employers compare local men who have to be away for
              weeks in anyone year with foreign workers who have no such obligation.<br> <br> The span of a serviceman's reservist training should not go beyond 30
              years of age. Men tend to settle down and start families around this
              age and job stability and carreer prospects are essential during this
              period. Unfair competition from foreign nationals would handicap local
              males and add to their already stressful lifestyles. <br> <br> In addition, the human body goes into a physical decline after the age
              of 30. To keep our military personnel in top condition, it makes little
              sense in keeping men over the age of 30 in the frontline if military
              conflict does indeed breakout. <br> <br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Increase volunteer, professional army</span><br> <br> To compensate for the decrease in the number of active and reservist
              NSmen, the Singapore Armed Forces should expand volunteer army
              recruitment to complement the reduction in the number of conscripts.<br> <br> In fact, the number of countries that have scrapped conscription are on
              the rise: Argentina (1994), Belgium (1994), Czech Republic (2004),
              France (1996), Hungary (2004), Italy (2004), Netherlands (1996), New
              Zealand (1972), Portugal (2004), and Spain (2001). <br> <br> While Singapore may not be ready to follow suit, it would be prudent
              for us to reduce NSmen in favour of a professional military outfit <br> <br> At the moment, NSmen are exploited for their services to glorify the
              PAP during National Day parades. The energy and time of these men can
              be put to more productive use than as entertainment for the PAP regime.
              <br> <br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Conscientious objectors </span><br> <br> What about people who do not believe that it is right for them to do
              military service due to moral, religious or ethical grounds? At the
              moment such conscientious objectors are charged and imprisoned for the
              length of their service. <br> <br> In some of the countries that have compulsory military service, there
              is also a provision for conscientious objectors to serve in non-combat
              roles. There is an argument that this would open the flood gates for
              men to opt for non-combat positions. Such a loophole can be plugged by
              increasing the length of active service by, say, six months. The
              experiences of other countries like Germany and Sweden have not been
              negative in this aspect where males try to avoid combat service by
              claiming to be conscientious objectors. <br> <br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tranparency and openness </span><br> <br> Obligation in Singapore seems to be a one-way street. While the
              Government holds the people accountable for their NS liabilities, the
              Ministry of Defence remains non-transparent and non-accountable in
              their dealings with the public. <br> <br> The recent deaths of National Servicemen have opened a can of worms on
              training safety. In addition, the number of training fatalities and
              injuries are not made known to the public as a matter-of-course. The
              Government which compels the people to give their lives for the country
              are obliged to be absolutely transparent with information pertaining to
              safety issues. Compensation for deaths and injuries must also be
              reviewed and revised upwards.<br> <br> The Government must also not exploit NSmen as cheap labour during major
              events such as the WB-IMF meeting or, possibly, the upcoming Youth
              Olympics. In must be remembered that the Enlistment Act was enacted for
              a specific purpose and any detraction from that purpose must be shunned.<br> <br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Conclusion</span> <br> <br> When citizens are forced to serve in the military with the possibility
              of being killed if called to war, it is imperative that the government
              is a democratic one where citizens can hold the government accountable
              for its decisions and actions. Otherwise we may end up in a situation
              where wars are waged for the ruling elite rather than for the security
              and sovereignty of the nation.<br> <br> <a href="http://forum.yoursdp.org/viewtopic.php?f=4&amp;t=3">http://forum.yoursdp.org/viewtopic.php?f=4&amp;t=3</a></span></p>

              <p>Huh? u siao or not??? today intake of army per year is only 20,000 comparing to last time 60,000 and you still want to serve less ar??</p>
              <p>Already, we are facing low birthrate and less young men, even i want to find a good bf also very hard. I suggest that to cover up the reduce of manpower, all dudes should serve 3 years instead of 2 or 2 and 1/2 years.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Dun you guys feel proud to serve the country, why do we need to compare to other countries when all demographic and geopolitical situation are completely different. Even the historical scenarios play an important role of what each country NS should be, the population is also a key determination of the length of services.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And what is wrong with NSmen reservists, most are being paid with what they earn as a civilian, it is a time for them to get together, networking, and as singaporeans, chat about their life and you guys can have your man world. In fact, it also helps our guys to tone up their body, go back to nature and when they go back to work, they feel refreshing, I know a few reservist guys who always come to my pubs for drinking and thereafter some gals, they like reservist, because it is a time they can leave their wifeys and back to be boys. When reservist come to my pub, I salute them, they protect our country, allow me to operate at a peaceful condition, and for them, it is like a free time to enjoy..no worries about wifey call, no worries abt delivery time, no worry abt target date, no worry about KPI and all those office and working stress...and also I believe the reservist had helped our young men to be strong and discipline,..you look at malaysian young men,...all weak weak and mostly got tattoo here and there, and all look like gangster ah beng. Because at the age to 18 yo, most youngster like me, as a gal, tends to be sway easily by gangsterism, discos, drugs, sex, and all other restless vices.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If a sg man is not successful in his life, dun blame the NS lost of time, that will be very lame. </p>

              <p><em><span style="color: #0000ff;">Diarrhea is loose, watery stools. A person with diarrhea typically passes stool more than three times a day. People with diarrhea may pass more than a quart of stool a day. Acute diarrhea is a common problem that usually lasts 1 or 2 days and goes away on its own without special treatment. Prolonged diarrhea persisting for more than 2 days may be a sign of a more serious problem and poses the risk of dehydration. Chronic diarrhea may be a feature of a chronic disease.</span></em></p>

              <p>Huh? u siao or not??? today intake of army per year is only
              20,000 comparing to last time 60,000 and you still want to serve
              less ar??</p>
              <p>Already, we are facing low birthrate and less young men, even i
              want to find a good bf also very hard. I suggest that to cover up
              the reduce of manpower, all dudes should serve 3 years instead of 2
              or 2 and 1/2 years.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Dun you guys feel proud to serve the country, why do we need to
              compare to other countries when all demographic and geopolitical
              situation are completely different. Even the historical scenarios
              play an important role of what each country NS should be, the
              population is also a key determination of the length of
              services.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And what is wrong with NSmen reservists, most are being paid
              with what they earn as a civilian, it is a time for them to get
              together, networking, and as singaporeans, chat about their life
              and you guys can have your man world. In fact, it also helps our
              guys to tone up their body, go back to nature and when they go back
              to work, they feel refreshing, I know a few reservist guys who
              always come to my pubs for drinking and thereafter some gals, they
              like reservist, because it is a time they can leave their wifeys
              and back to be boys. When reservist come to my pub, I salute them,
              they protect our country, allow me to operate at a peaceful
              condition, and for them, it is like a free time to enjoy..no
              worries about wifey call, no worries abt delivery time, no worry
              abt target date, no worry about KPI and all those office and
              working stress...and also I believe the reservist had helped our
              young men to be strong and discipline,..you look at malaysian young
              men,...all weak weak and mostly got tattoo here and there, and all
              look like gangster ah beng. Because at the age to 18 yo, most
              youngster like me, as a gal, tends to be sway easily by
              gangsterism, discos, drugs, sex, and all other restless vices.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If a sg man is not successful in his life, dun blame the NS lost
              of time, that will be very lame. </p>

              <p>roflmao..you have to understand wat is ns in the first place..whats there to be proud about when we are exploited by the govt to "protect the motherland" while given meager allowance..note its allowance and not even salary..its like through their loving kindness that they allow us some money while "protecting the motherland" its should had been free service kind shit..</p>
              <p>they want soldiers..they have to pay..serves them right for making things expensive all in the name of lessening the burden of the poor..</p>
              <p>i have to agree the whole PEST situation is different as is the backgnd and such..but..not willing to raise the welfare of the soldiers = lowering their morale..low morale cant win shit..most will just run or turn traitor if war ever comes..</p>
              <p>and its not the so call soldiers with no real war exp that protects the country..its the damn spf that allows u to sleep peacefully at night..</p>
