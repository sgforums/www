              <p>Hmmm.... what is your intended timeline then? Given that
              Singapore 3 oil refineries refines more oil than Thailand's 7 and
              that Singapore is increasing its capacity by 70%, it is unlikely
              that Thailand or any other oil refining country in Thailand Gulf
              Region will catch up within a short time. And since Thailand will
              need at least 10 years to build this canal, I would say Singapore's
              oil refinery will be safe from this canal by at least another 15-20
              years. In the longer run, say 50-100 years, well, it is possible.
              But if the world is still going to depend heavily on oil in 50-100
              years time, I will feel very disturbed.</p>
              <p>If mistreatment of dissidents = screwing up the country, then
              Singapore really shouldn't have prospered in the first place. After
              all, its not like we are just starting to do what we did to the
              dissidents. In contrast, Thailand and Malaysia have been more
              leient towards their opposition, especially so in the past number
              of years. Doesn't seem to me that Thailand and Malaysia is in a
              better state than Singapore.</p>

              <p>I used to worked for oil company, just share a little that I know. Singapore prospers not from oil refinery but the whole petroleum industry. In a nut shell, Singapore, as one of the busiest ports in the world, a major oil refining center, the key chemicals production and distribution center, supported by ship building and repair, financial and other auxiliary services, such as insurance, is not easy, I am not saying not possible, but not easy for any other country in the region to emulate.</p>
              <p>Besides capacities, the 3 refineries in Singapore used to be owned by 6 major oil companies, Shell, Esso, Mobil, Caltex, BP, SPC. Its efficiency enable Singapore to refine oils, from light crude from Saudi to heavy crude  from Indonesia, giving higher yields than local refineries, i.e. for every barrel, our refineries produce much more value than other refineries. We refine crude from Saudi, Indonesia...they have their refineries, but not always for the right crude, giving the right product, at the right place, the right time.</p>
              <p>Singapore can distribute refined products, from gasoline to chemical feedstocks much easier than any other refineries in the region, the chemicals plants in jurong island is a major market.</p>
              <p>Petroleum suppliers, refiners, traders, tankers owners use Singapore as a major one stop service center for their business that stretching from europe to Asia, and from Singapore, you can stretch to australia.</p>
              <p>If you miss the Suez Canal, you need to ago round the whole Africa continent. Kra Canal allows you to bypass only the Malayan pennisular, you save one day shipping time. If you spend 7 to 10 days sailing all the way from Europe or the Middle East to the Far East. How will the 1 day make any difference? especially so if you actually bypass an important rest point for refueling, repairing or even picking up or unloading some cargo.</p>
              <p>Economically, it is never favorable to build the Kra Canal.</p>
              <p>Politically, if Singapore continues to be friendly to China, Japan, ...and the oil producing countries, I believe China and Japan would prefer to handle the Singapore government than the Thai, no?</p>
              <p>to sum up, if you travel 8 hours on a higher way from Singapore to Penang, you won't want to take a 30 minutes short cut on a muddy road, to bypass KL, where you can have a good rest, good food, shopping....</p>
              <p>Kra Canal is the 30 minutes muddy short cut. Only AndrewPKYap loves going in the mud and throw mud at Singapore.</p>

                  important rest point for refueling, repairing or even picking
                  up or unloading some cargo.</p>
                  <p>Economically, it is never favorable to build the Kra Canal.</p>
                  <p>Politically, if Singapore continues to be friendly to China,
                  Japan, ...and the oil producing countries, I believe China and
                  Japan would prefer to handle the Singapore government than the
                  Thai, no?</p>
                  <p>to sum up, if you travel 8 hours on a higher way from Singapore
                  to Penang, you won't want to take a 30 minutes short cut on a muddy
                  road, to bypass KL, where you can have a good rest, good food,
                  shopping....</p>
                  <p>Kra Canal is the 30 minutes muddy short cut. Only AndrewPKYap
                  loves going in the mud and throw mud at Singapore.</p>

              <p>I wouldn't worry too much of this report. The Yankees and the general Chinese public have always been over sensitive about China's string of pearls strategy.

              <p>China's attempt to bypass Singapore is purely for security back up purpose; ie to prevent U.S. from choking its energy supply off in the event of a war.

              <p>I used to worked for oil company, just share a little that I
              know. Singapore prospers not from oil refinery but
              the whole petroleum industry. In a nut shell, Singapore, as
              one of the busiest ports in the world, a major oil refining
              center, the key chemicals production and distribution center,
              supported by ship building and repair, financial and other
              auxiliary services, such as insurance, is not easy, I am not saying
              not possible, but not easy for any other country in the region
              to emulate.</p>
              <p>Besides capacities, the 3 refineries in Singapore used to be
              owned by 6 major oil companies, Shell, Esso, Mobil, Caltex, BP,
              SPC. Its efficiency enable Singapore to refine oils, from light
              crude from Saudi to heavy crude  from Indonesia,
              giving higher yields than local refineries, i.e. for every
              barrel, our refineries produce much more value than other
              refineries. We refine crude from Saudi, Indonesia...they have
              their refineries, but not always for the right crude, giving
              the right product, at the right place, the right time.</p>
              <p>Singapore can distribute refined products, from gasoline to
              chemical feedstocks much easier than any other refineries in the
              region, the chemicals plants in jurong island is a major
              market.</p>
              <p>Petroleum suppliers, refiners, traders, tankers owners use
              Singapore as a major one stop service center for their business
              that stretching from europe to Asia, and from Singapore, you can
              stretch to australia.</p>
              <p>If you miss the Suez Canal, you need to ago round the whole
              Africa continent. Kra Canal allows you to bypass only the
              Malayan pennisular, you save one day shipping time. If
              you spend 7 to 10 days sailing all the way from Europe or the
              Middle East to the Far East. How will the 1 day make any
              difference? especially so if you actually bypass an
              important rest point for refueling, repairing or even picking
              up or unloading some cargo.</p>

              <p>refinaries business is not "the whole oil industry". What is obvious to others apparently is not obvious to you.</p>
              <p>why you think tankers don't come? if refinaries closed, the whole oil industry won't collapse, ref above. If AndrewPKYap disappeared, would the opposition in Singapore would collapse? obviously no.  Actually, I believe the opposition would have greater credibility.</p>
              <p>Those with lots of money in their pockets are not necessarily those who have no faith. Only those who are staying away from Singapore have demonstrated that they have no faith in Singapore.</p>

              <p>Tanjung Pelepas didn't cost much to build, or Malaysia didn't mind paying for white elephant. Kra Canal is of total different scale, and it is not something economically viable for Thailand to push on. That's why talk for so long.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Today Tanjung Pelepas is not a white elephant, but it falls short, very short of the orginal intention of replacing the PSA, or PSA would collapse because of PSA. Pelepas is just a local port, shuttling shipments from Malaysia to PSA, instead going via the causeway or second links, along the way, they take business away from Port Klang.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Mersk Lines retains most part of their business via PSA, Evergreen too.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>During the last seminar on regional cooperation on oil spill management, the people from Pelepas were actually counting on Singapore to provide the service in case of emergency, instead of looking for help from KL, or do it themselves.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>They can't laugh at us, but they did give a good shake up to the PSA management, led by Yeo Ning Hong.</p>

              <p><br>gasoline in the car is equally dangerous as a gas tank. a small lighted match or cigarette can turn a car into an inferno. a small spark can also light up the fume of gasoline.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is important to know what would ignite a tank of CNG or gasoline. You can sit on a bomb, but if there is no denonator, there is no worry. This I learned from combat engineer.</p>
