              <p>Modern Singapore's been around for what...140 years or more,
                  flourishing as a port for more than 140 years. Of course, since it
                  was part of the British empire no one ever raised the question:
                  will Singapore survive?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have no doubt Singapore will survive as an economic, trading,
                  and shipping hub because of various factors...but as a city-State,
                  I can't even hazard a guess.</p>

              <p>It may be true that no city-State has ever lasted more than 100
                  years. Perhaps Singapore will be an exception.</p>

              <p>It is inevitable such defeatist thoughts pervades the mind, more so during this crisis, a crisis of confidence and the lack of it.</p>
              <p><br>A country can never sink, at most submerged under water when our polar ice caps melt fully, thousands of years yet. A country is only a physical object, nothing more.</p>
              <p><br>What makes a country special is its inhabitants. Are we a barbaric tribe or tribes, prone to warfare, or a peaceful people subjecting ourselves to the might of rule of law-the hallmark of an enlightened society?</p>
              <p><br>Singapore is no Elysian fields, but so is any other country. We are flawed beings, similar with everyone else. There is no perfection, but there exists patience to seek for excellence in all we do amongst majority of our citizens.</p>
              <p><br>We, as a people, do not believe in warfare and our military exist only to ensure peace, no threat to anyone who has no intention to harm our loved ones.</p>
              <p><br>By that virtue of enlightened peace instead of dark aged barbarism alone, Singapore is far from sinking. Political policies and citizenry support over the years will be benchmark to project our society's journey into the next 50 years or more.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Scientific evolution will change, but the creatures of habit that we are will take a far longer time to evolve.</p>
              <p><br>Economics wise, and with the concept of 'creatures of habit' philosophy, those who have more will spend more, and those with less will spend less.</p>
              <p><br>Peace and meritocracy practised here will be the means to achieve higher spending power for themselves and love ones. Allevation of poverty will be a political policy, the way politics of the 60s era had eradicated slums our forefathers lived.</p>
              <p><br>Lower birth rates as well as the natural attrition rate of emigrating citizens will ensure Singapore survives, with a flat population growth rate, should ALL MNCs flee.</p>
              <p><br>A reversion back to the 60s would not mean death. It would only mean we all will have to rebuild all over again what we had lost, just as every other country on Earth would have to do should economic stimulas fail.</p>
              <p><br>Singapore sink? Think again. Those who can flee will flee, but those who cant will remain and rebuild our nation to what it once was, the way our uneducated forefathers did with a domestic economy before leaping into a strong and vibrant export economy.</p>
              <p><br>Singapore is made up of you and me. I, within the limits of my capabilities and beyond,  will not let Singapore sink. Will you?</p>

              <p>It is inevitable such defeatist thoughts pervades the mind, more so during this crisis, a crisis of confidence and the lack of it.</p>
              <p><br>A country can never sink, at most submerged under water when our polar ice caps melt fully, thousands of years yet. A country is only a physical object, nothing more.</p>
              <p><br>What makes a country special is its inhabitants. Are we a barbaric tribe or tribes, prone to warfare, or a peaceful people subjecting ourselves to the might of rule of law-the hallmark of an enlightened society?</p>
              <p><br>Singapore is no Elysian fields, but so is any other country. We are flawed beings, similar with everyone else. There is no perfection, but there exists patience to seek for excellence in all we do amongst majority of our citizens.</p>
              <p><br>We, as a people, do not believe in warfare and our military exist only to ensure peace, no threat to anyone who has no intention to harm our loved ones.</p>
              <p><br>By that virtue of enlightened peace instead of dark aged barbarism alone, Singapore is far from sinking. Political policies and citizenry support over the years will be benchmark to project our society's journey into the next 50 years or more.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Scientific evolution will change, but the creatures of habit that we are will take a far longer time to evolve.</p>
              <p><br>Economics wise, and with the concept of 'creatures of habit' philosophy, those who have more will spend more, and those with less will spend less.</p>
              <p><br>Peace and meritocracy practised here will be the means to achieve higher spending power for themselves and love ones. Allevation of poverty will be a political policy, the way politics of the 60s era had eradicated slums our forefathers lived.</p>
              <p><br>Lower birth rates as well as the natural attrition rate of emigrating citizens will ensure Singapore survives, with a flat population growth rate, should ALL MNCs flee.</p>
              <p><br>A reversion back to the 60s would not mean death. It would only mean we all will have to rebuild all over again what we had lost, just as every other country on Earth would have to do should economic stimulas fail.</p>
              <p><br>Singapore sink? Think again. Those who can flee will flee, but those who cant will remain and rebuild our nation to what it once was, the way our uneducated forefathers did with a domestic economy before leaping into a strong and vibrant export economy.</p>
              <p><br>Singapore is made up of you and me. I, within the limits of my capabilities and beyond,  will not let Singapore sink. Will you?</p>
