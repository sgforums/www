              <p>Thanks to people like you who stupidly hoard money, this is what happens. Govts have to print notes to circulate for every dollar your kind hoards up at home or safe deposits and stupidly in banks whom use to balance their lost accounts and not lend.</p>

              <p>Simply meant, loaning from future generations who will repay the debts through taxes and resource output.</p>

              <p>The root of the problem is the US economy, now in trouble due to greed, the more you are linked to them, the more you are affected.</p>
              <p>Your last sentence says many things. firstly, China's economy depended a lot on export to the US, but they can stimulate the local market to cover that shortfall, with their population, they can at least reduce the impact.</p>
              <p>other asian countries which never had too much money to invest in the US are therefore immune to the current problem.</p>
              <p>But countries like Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore, and especially Singapore, which depended so much on the US, sure kena hit, very badly.</p>
              <p>There is really no need anymore checking, any investment in the US, or investment in EU that has linked to the US, should see the capital shrink by 40% or may be half.</p>
              <p>Lesson: don't ever depend on the US like they are the lao peh; freedom, human rights blah blah... won't give anybody any compensation for the funds squandered by the greedy wall streets fat cats.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000080;">"If we are dynamic, we will attract talent, we will grow because we have more talent. When I say talent, it means people who add to the dynamism of that society. Singaporeans, if I can chose an analogy, we are the hard disk of a computer, the foreign talent are the megabytes you add to your storage capacity. So your computer never hangs because you got enormous storage capacity," said Mr Lee. </span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000080;">In response, Mr Lee said an MP is closely watched the moment he's elected into office. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000080;">And he had no qualms about paying ministers a good salary to look after a multi-billion dollar economy. <br><br>But more importantly, a bad minister mismanaging Singapore will ruin the lives of four million people. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000080;">"If you have a dud minister he cannot hold his ground, you know in Singapore, you've got to meet your constituents, you've got to meet the press, you are in Parliament right? You are not just making a speech at a mass rally …and for this generation, if you don't pay them adequately and their families suffer, they will not stay in the job long. They will be forced to pack up and go back to their private life. And you've lost experience and expertise, it's as simple as that," said Mr Lee</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000080;">On censorship Mr Lee said he is not able to predict where the boundaries will be in the years ahead, because of a changing world that is open to all influences

                                disk of a computer, the foreign talent are the megabytes you add to
                                your storage capacity. So your computer never hangs because you got

              <p>The root of the problem is the US economy, now in trouble due to greed, the more you are linked to them, the more you are affected.</p>
              <p>Your last sentence says many things. firstly, China's economy depended a lot on export to the US, but they can stimulate the local market to cover that shortfall, with their population, they can at least reduce the impact.</p>
              <p>other asian countries which never had too much money to invest in the US are therefore immune to the current problem.</p>
              <p>But countries like Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore, and especially Singapore, which depended so much on the US, sure kena hit, very badly.</p>
              <p>There is really no need anymore checking, any investment in the US, or investment in EU that has linked to the US, should see the capital shrink by 40% or may be half.</p>
              <p>Lesson: don't ever depend on the US like they are the lao peh; freedom, human rights blah blah... won't give anybody any compensation for the funds squandered by the greedy wall streets fat cats.</p>

              <p>Yes, the economic downturn/turmoil today is longer than any other recession, reason being, there is no confident in the US market anymore, even if the economic recover, peoples of the world are more cautious in the US market, maybe we will see a shift in economic powerhouse.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I see China as the next potential economic powerhouse, chinese do spend but just that their paid are not as good as their US counterpart, previouly, a GM motor worker earn more than 5 times a Chinese GM worker, today with cut and wage freezes in US, you will see a lower paid rate in US and togather with the strong RMB, it will ultimately make the chinese abit richer.</p>

The Indians, strangely enough, more of them stay here in Singapore because they want to go home to visit their families." <br><br>Mr Lee added: "We are net gainers for how long? I think in the case of China, maybe another 20, 30 years ... India, maybe longer - 50, 60 years before their infrastructure catches up. Anyway, this is not my worry anymore!"</span></strong></p>
