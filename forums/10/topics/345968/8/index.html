              <p><br>Hang on... To rule effectively, you don't need 2/3 of the seats.  Having 2/3 of the seats gives virtual passage to any bill and even a Presidential Veto can't do anything to it. </p>
              <p>That is a little too much power given to any ruling party in my opinion.  Still, even with less than 2/3, the ruling party still can rule EFFECTIVELY, just that their bills can still be subject to vetos.  But since our President hardly disapproves of any bills, a less than 2/3 majority of seats is good and effective enough. </p>

              <p>I was told by some of my friends in overseas, that singapore is going down. The Government is finding  very difficult to manage. They said singapore will be flop within 5 to 10 yrs. Singapore looks rich only from the outside poor on the inside. Because many people are suffering under poverty. You better rethink of migrating to another country like canada, Australia, UK etc because this singaporeship is sinking. Here afterwards you can find future both in china and India. And if you belong to the minority group either Malay or Indian your future is in deep trouble as you do not know mandrin.</p>
              <p>Is Singapore really going down? will we not see economic success as in the past? Are we going backwards? Can singapore survive for next 50 yrs? Can singapore government efficiently  manage singapore after LKY? Is singapore a future " Bankok" or even future "Malaysia or Indonesia".</p>

              <p>If people's words can be trusted, Singapore wouldn't have floated in the first place. 40 years ago, we had way more people who are poor, we were a successful port yes, but not really that important. Today Singapore is one of the five most important ports in the world and run one of the most import oil refinary business in the region. 40 years ago, if Singapore sinks, Singapore sinks.

              <p><br>Our gals sacrificed their courtship when the boys go to Army, the gals have to uphold the workload of the economy, and sad to say, most boys become so lame to say that only they sacrifice for the country and forgotton our gals role, for all boys, there are mothers who shed tears and caring till their boys grew up, be a soldier, be discipline, get a good career and married to the right true woman. All these are sacrification of sg woman to the country of Singapore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We gals understand the magic of failure, unlike the boys, who dun accept failure and believed in must win, must be on top, must be strong and long stuff...if singapore is to go down, for we gals, so be it, we still carry on our struggle, unlike most boys, they would rather lost their soul in pubs, drinks, smokes, nighclubs and red light districts rather than bring themselves up for further education, retraining, reskilling and re adaptation.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We gals understand that everything cannot be successful for long, we understood that in blowing balloon, it must burst eventually. And more importantly, we understand that failure is the begining of success, without down, how can you define up???</p>

              <p><br>You may be right about average Earthlings not knowing that we exist, but that doesn't mean Singapore is not important, it just mean 90% of the world population are ignorant.

In order to replace Singapore, the location has to be near us, probably in Malaysia or some parts of Indonesia. But even if they possess the location, unless they can replicate Singapore fast enough to handle all the amount of shippings, goods will be held up at the ports for a very long time. This will drive up costs by quite a lot, not to mention that a lot of the goods are perishables.</p>
              <p>Singapore is one of the 5 most important ports in the world in the busiest shipping lane. Since most of the world's commodities are shipped around the world, you cannot expect us to "sink" without the world feeling an impact. I know that a lot of pple think we are just a Pisai country or just a small red dot, but we are actually a lot more important that most of us know.</p>

              <p>Errr.....are you implying that China is treating their dissidents and opposition better than Singapore or that the Chinese are less apathetic?</p>
              <p>If that is not what you are implying....as in China is indeed treating its dissidents far worse than Singapore and that the Chinese are in general, less concerned about the fate of their own dissidents, then, in accordance to your own logic of "persecuting dissendents + more apathetic = eventual failure", why should we be worried about them?</p>
