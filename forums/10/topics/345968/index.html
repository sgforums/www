              <p>I was told by some of my friends in overseas, that singapore is going down. The Government is finding  very difficult to manage. They said singapore will be flop within 5 to 10 yrs. Singapore looks rich only from the outside poor on the inside. Because many people are suffering under poverty. You better rethink of migrating to another country like canada, Australia, UK etc because this singaporeship is sinking. Here afterwards you can find future both in china and India. And if you belong to the minority group either Malay or Indian your future is in deep trouble as you do not know mandrin.</p>
              <p>Is Singapore really going down? will we not see economic success as in the past? Are we going backwards? Can singapore survive for next 50 yrs? Can singapore government efficiently  manage singapore after LKY? Is singapore a future " Bankok" or even future "Malaysia or Indonesia".</p>
              <p>Pardon me, I am not good in either economics and business so can some knowledgable person educate me in good english because my singlish is very poor.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Below article is updated as of 09-03-2009</strong></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; line-height: normal;"><span><span>Rememeber </span>I am not pro-PAP or Anti-PAP, below are some of the factors to be discussed why Singapore will or will not sink</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; line-height: normal;"><span> </span></p>
              <p><span><span>1.<span>  </span></span></span> <span>Media is tightly controlled, so this leaves the singaporeans ignorant on the other half of the truth</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt 36pt; line-height: normal;"><span> </span></p>
              <p><span><span>2.<span>  </span></span></span> <span>If the ruling party is perfect, then Singapore will not sink. Do you think</span> <span>Singapore government will remain perfect forever?What if they </span> <span>turned out to be corrupt in the future? Are Singaporeans dared to </span> <span>oppose them and change their leaders like what Americans did to</span> <span>George Bush? Any country can still survive with an imperfect </span> <span>government not Singapore.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; line-height: normal;"><span> </span></p>
              <p><span><span>3.<span>  </span></span></span> <span>If the current PAP administration so efficient then why LKY should still be in the office? which cast doubt in minds of some that this administration can’t manage Singapore efficiently after him. It seems like LKY even though not PM still managing Singapore from behind and LHL is doing what he has been told to do.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt 36pt; line-height: normal;"><span> </span></p>
              <p><span><span>4.<span>  </span></span></span> <span>History has proven that the fall of great empires can be attributed to</span> <span>Greed, selfishness, injustice and poor administration. So we can’t be</span> <span>too complacent</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt 36pt; line-height: normal;"><span> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt 18pt; line-height: normal;"><span> </span></p>
              <p><span><span>5.<span>  </span></span></span> <span>Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia are looking for fair share of singapore’s prosperity in the region, so there is an intense competition. First of all these three are not happy with Singapore, could be political. Don’t forget some terrorist camps in Indonesia waiting to strike singapore when caught off-guard.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt 36pt; line-height: normal;"><span> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt 18pt; line-height: normal;"><span> </span></p>
              <p><span><span>6.<span>  </span></span></span> <span>I read in one of the article that LKY once said Singapore has enjoyed economic prosperity under “US UMBRELLA” but now uncle SAM is in trouble heading towards bankruptcy can he still offer protection to Singapore? There is this report <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/article5213321.ece"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #800080;">http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/article5213321.ece</span></span></a> saying US superpower status is challenged in 2025.</span></p>
              <p><span>In the past Singapore is under British protection, today US and tomorrow who?</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt 36pt;"><span> </span></p>
              <p><span><span>7.<span>  </span></span></span> <span>There were rumours saying that when Singapore tried to build even closer economic ties with china, china requested or attempted to take control over Singapore banking and finances.( Not sure how far its true). Personally, I don’t have enough trust about this dragon (china) because he has history for taking things by force. This guy is already waging an economic war with US.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span>
              </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; line-height: normal;  "><span style='font-size: 14pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>What I mean here is that Singaporeans can’t take things for granted because we are living in a highly vulnerable state. </span></p>

              <p>last time there was this documentary on discovery about singapore. think it was shown last year's national day. there was this economist or what la, said that no city-state country ever lasted for 100 years.</p>
              <p>i'm also wondering what you asked. looking at things, on the surface, people complaining here and there. after getting more educated, people still find shortcuts for getting fame and wealth. people running away from here. horrendous civil pay, influx of foreigners, bringing down local's paycheck to increase productivity.</p>

              <p>but at least show some humility. show off by using words like 'elite' for what.</p>

              <p>now i'm getting irritated. we are just like foundation of the building and they live on top of the roof, trying to get a view of the whole world. when they can't see, they get more people to support so that they can go higher. never think that people below are hungry and need to eat.</p>

You better rethink of migrating to another country like canada, Australia, UK etc because this singaporeship is sinking. Here afterwards you can find future both in china and India.

But I cannot help but feel insecure over the future of Singapore. Lets face it, it's not uncommon to hear, "when you are above 40, you are over the hill". </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style='color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>The government has been stressing on re-training, skills upgrading and re-adapt. The fact is, no matter how well qualified or adaptable one is, once you hit the magical 40, employers will say, "you are simply too old".</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style='color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>We have been focusing our resources and problem solving on low unskilled labour. But in reality, our managerial positions and skilled labour force are actually fast losing its competitiveness. </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style='color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>I travel around the region frequently for the past 10 years. It didn't take me long to realise how far our neighbours have come over the past decade. </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style='color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>They have quality skilled workers, and are less expensive. When I work with them, their analytical skills are equally good, if not better than us.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style='color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>It's not new anymore. Taxi drivers are fast becoming "too early to retire, too old to work" segment of the society. I like to talk to taxi drivers whenever I am heading for the airport. </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style='color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>There was this driver. Eloquent and well read. He was an export manager for 12 years with an MNC. Retrenched at 40 years old. He had been searching for a job since his retrenchment. </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style='color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>Although he was willing to lower his pay expectations, employers were not willing to lower their prejudice. He was deemed too old. I wouldn't be surprised if we have another No. 1; having the most highly educated taxi drivers in the world.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style='color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>On PM Lee calling the young to be committed and make a difference. Look around us. How dedicated can we be to Singapore when we can visualise what's in store for us after we turned 40? Then again, how committed are employers to us? But we can't blame them. They have bottom lines &amp; shareholders' gain to answer to. </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style='color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>Onus is really on the government to revamp the society. A society that is not a pressure cooker. A society that does not mirror so perfectly, what survival of the fittest is. </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style='color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>But a society, where it's people can be committed, do their best and not having to fear whether they will still wake up employed tomorrow. Sadly, Singapore does not offer such luxuries and security anymore.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style='color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>On the issue of babies. The government encourages us to pro-create. The next generation is essential in sustaining our competitive edge. Then again, the current market condition is such that our future has become uncertain. There is no more joy in having babies anymore; they have become more of a liability. It's really a chicken and egg issue.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style='color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>Many of my peers, bright and well educated have packed up and left. It's what MM Goh called "quitters". It's sad but true, Singapore no longer is a place where one can hope to work hard their lives and retire graciously. It's really the push factor. </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style='color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>A future is something we sweat it out, build and call our own. Unfortunately, people like me, mid 30's going on 40's, staying put by choice or otherwise, we can't help but feel what lies ahead is really a gamble. </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style='color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>To PM Lee and the Ministers, we are on a different platform. Until you truly understand our insecurity, the future of Singapore to me remains a question mark.<br><br><em>(SPH rejected this letter - From: LocalSin.

              <p>I was told by some of my friends in overseas, that singapore is going down. The Government is finding  very difficult to manage. They said singapore will be flop within 5 to 10 yrs. Singapore looks rich only from the outside poor on the inside. Because many people are suffering under poverty. You better rethink of migrating to another country like canada, Australia, UK etc because this singaporeship is sinking. Here afterwards you can find future both in china and India. And if you belong to the minority group either Malay or Indian your future is in deep trouble as you do not know mandrin.</p>
              <p>Is Singapore really going down? will we not see economic success as in the past? Are we going backwards? Can singapore survive for next 50 yrs? Can singapore government efficiently  manage singapore after LKY? Is singapore a future " Bankok" or even future "Malaysia or Indonesia".</p>
              <p>Pardon me, I am not good in either economics and business so can some knowledgable person educate me in good english because my singlish is very poor.</p>

              <p>Hi, sori hor, me also no good in economics, but on business wise, i am quiet efficient, i believe the govt knew that singapore is in a bad state and will not last long, that is why they are paying themselves high so as to save for the future. If a minister is drawing 2 million dollars per annual, in 50yrs, they already calculate that he/she can take 100million plus yearly increment, that will be around 150millions, enuf for perhaps 5 generations of their decendent while the rest of the citizens may not even last one generation or 1/2 of it, so to speak.</p>
