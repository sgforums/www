              <p>Tanjung Pelepas didn't cost much to build, or Malaysia didn't mind paying for white elephant. Kra Canal is of total different scale, and it is not something economically viable for Thailand to push on. That's why talk for so long.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Today Tanjung Pelepas is not a white elephant, but it falls short, very short of the orginal intention of replacing the PSA, or PSA would collapse because of PSA. Pelepas is just a local port, shuttling shipments from Malaysia to PSA, instead going via the causeway or second links, along the way, they take business away from Port Klang.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Mersk Lines retains most part of their business via PSA, Evergreen too.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>During the last seminar on regional cooperation on oil spill management, the people from Pelepas were actually counting on Singapore to provide the service in case of emergency, instead of looking for help from KL, or do it themselves.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>They can't laugh at us, but they did give a good shake up to the PSA management, led by Yeo Ning Hong.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>i dun tin malaysia intention of using Tanjung Pelepas to replace our port but to have a slice of the business if all the neighbouring countries are taking a slice of whatever we are doing, WHAT IS LEFT? only left over? and we are very expensive incomparison.</p>
              <p>Tanjung Pelepas is an example, our neighbours are improving overtime. they have every resources and we have nothing.</p>
              <p>can we still survive the next 50 years or another century?   </p>

              <p>its not a question of just whether our leaders can lead us aflot for the next 50years, they can come up with a genius masterplan, but it will only be successfully rendered when every single one of us are willing to support it...the government can do anything but ultimately we must support....i.e they can build how many casinos they like, but if we simply dont support it by boycotting those jobs, can it continue??</p>
              <p>so this is a question of the singapore spirit, will we endure the waves??</p>

              <p>firstly, wat is "Singapore Spirit"</p>
              <p>A goverment that dun wan to listen to the people and didnt come with all the data of the pros n cons of building casinos here?</p>
              <p>My best bet is to change the education system n teach them to be equal instead of our children competing "who is No. 1" n my name is "Ima Winner".</p>
              <p>ever heard that a mother reprimanded her child for scoring 90 marks?</p>
              <p>My belieive is "unity is strength" like wat a japanese said</p>
              <p>"1 chinese is a team, 2 chinese is a pig. 1 japanese is a pig, 2 japanese is a team"</p>
              <p>well maybe this is wat u call "Singapore PIG Spirit" and the only "spirits" you can find are in the graveyards.</p>

              <p>some ask "can we survive the next 50 years"? I ask "what should we do to prosper over the next 30 years"? You are saying "we won't survive the next 50 years."</p>
              <p>Textile industries left us long time ago, more pharmaceutical companies are investing in their R&amp;D centers here. They may not last forever, but if they stay for the next 30 years, we benefit for the next 30 years.</p>
              <p>what are the sun-setting know-how that are taking advantage of the gahment policies, care to share? </p>
              <p>don't be too quick to say that others don't understand how the world functions. But if you insist on staying the well, then you will not survive the next 10 years. </p>

              <p>yes, right to the topic and I have no answer to that.</p>
              <p>" You are saying "we won't survive the next 50 years." did i say this?</p>
              <p>on the sun-setting industries, you have to check with EDB to see how much they have invested and how many have failed or left or remaining</p>
              <p>here, if you patent a new product or techno for export, there is a rule that u need to seek approval from the authority. likewise, if a foreign company came up with a new techno, will they keep it in and benefit their own country?          </p>

              <p>don't ask me to check with EDB. do you know how much they invested and how many have failed or left or remaining? or are you assuming that much have been invested, many have failed and nothing or little is left?</p>
              <p>how would any companies want to keep their new technology and benefit their own country? in the first place why do they want to go to another place and do research there?</p>
              <p>Its a global world, friend, open up your mind, if the presence of MNC does not benefit Singapore, why do we think we need them here?</p>
