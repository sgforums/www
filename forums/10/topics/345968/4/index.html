              <p>Yes you are right. The fear of the influencial Chinese was the greater fear of the day. But the fear of the communist was also there, albeit at the background. You can find some books in the library on this.<br><br>You know, the Tungku and the British, among other reasons, supported LHK because they thought that Lee, a British educated lawyer, would be more pro-British, more pro-federation. In other words, more pro-Malaya and less communist.<br><br>Lee, if you remember, said he "ride on a tiger". That tiger was the vehicle of communism. <br><br>The words Chin Peng, the Plenn will ring like ghosts of the past to this older generation. </p>

              <p><br>angel, we have to understand how this ruling party functions.   They exist as businessmen to run the country.  Anyone not working to them is negative.  They believe that if one has the capability, one should not have problem working, they choose not to be understanding.    They have to behave such to protect their own interest, meet their selfish agenda.  If they care too much, they have to come out with $ to help people, and if they do so means they may have less money to go to their pockets.</p>
              <p>In Britain is different, they care about the welfare of the people.   You know in England, when someone picks up a ATM card and return to the person they will be rewarded in monetary term. </p>

              <p>You are also right. There were many factors contributing to the separation, and it is  hard to pin them all down. <br><br>Maybe, I should correct myself. The Tungku was afraid of Singapore aiding or being sympathetic to the insurgents conducted by Communist Party Of Malaya. The activities of the CPM, if you remember, went on, only to surrender in the 80s or 90s.<br><br>With the racial riot, the situation was very tensed. In released classified paper, the Malaysia govt did sent a contingent of soldiers to "calm" matters back then. Had they crossed the causeway, the history of Singapore would have been different.</p>

              Singapore looks rich only from the outside poor on the inside.
              Because many people are suffering under poverty. You better rethink
              of migrating to another country like canada, Australia, UK
              etc because this singaporeship is sinking. Here afterwards you
              can find future both in china and India. And if you
              belong to the minority group either Malay or Indian your future is
              in deep trouble as you do not know mandrin.</p>
              <p>Is Singapore really going down? will we not see economic success
              as in the past? Are we going backwards? Can singapore survive for
              next 50 yrs? Can singapore government efficiently  manage
              singapore after LKY? Is singapore a future " Bankok" or even future
              "Malaysia or Indonesia".</p>

              I personally don't think that we will see that kind of prosperity we had 10 years ago. Other countries like China, India and Vietnam are catching up very fast and we have more or less stagnated.
