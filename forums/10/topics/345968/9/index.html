              <p><br>errr....China has tried to emulate Singapore since Deng Xiao Ping visited Singapore in 1978, from suzhou industrial park to tianjin ecocity, from dalian to now guangzhou, they learned and applied but they have not built another Singapore.</p>
              <p>Singapore exist with multi racial and religion, this is not something that the Chinese can emulate.</p>

              <p>Actually, the canal still cannot replaces Singapore. The Canal leads to China, yes; it can bypass Singapore, yes; but it cannot replace Singapore. Singapore serves the entire Asia pacific region as a port. The Canal, even if built, is meant to serve China only. It leads to the western part of China. Even if China is kind enough to allow the commodities, to be reshipped out from there, the cost of transporting the commodities to the Eastern ports along the coastal area is still going to be very high. Not to mention that the ports on both western and eastern ends have to replicate Singapore's port efficiency.</p>
              <p>On the strategic front, there will also be problems. China's main intention of wanting such a canal is for energy security. The idea being that, in the event of war with the US, China can bypass the straits of Malacca which US can choke anytime it likes (US naval base in Singapore rings a bell to anyone?). With this in mind, what is the likelihood of U.S. allowing such a thing to happen? At the same time, this canal will also have to cut tru other states, not just Thailand alone. If not probably coordinated, things are likely to end up like the Pan Beibu Gulf railway where some the sections are not connected.</p>
              <p>The efficiency and leadership quality of the current Thai PM requires a longer observation period. When Thaksin first took power, he was also very popular, and he was elected, not put on stage via a judicial coup. Good PR skill does not automatically translate into effective leadership. </p>

              <p>I seriously don't know why you think Abhisit is honorable in according to your definition. He was elected into office via popular vote, he was placed in power after the party elected via voting got kicked out by the court with the lamest excuse in history, for appearing on a TV cooking program and taking some miserable fee from the TV station. </p>
              <p>It is true that the Yellows appeared in large numbers and protested long and hard for the current ruling party. But doesn't the fact that they are able to protest for a prolong period without the need to go to work suggest that these people might come exclusively from the wealthier class?

              <p>The Reds are unable to protest for long, the rich TV stations owner is not in their camp. They hardly have the resources to have their voice heard. Most of them have to work everyday and hence can't protest as long as the Yellows, provided that they manage to gather enough money to travel to the capital from their rural areas in the first place.</p>
              <p>So there is a chance that Abhisit is not popular, he just have supporters who are rich and powerful enough to be heard. Thaksin's error might have been that he is popular among the poor.</p>
              <p>Don't get me wrong, I don't dislike Abhisit. If his performance in the near future warrents it, I am willing to support his rule. I just don't understand why he fits your definition ofbeing honorable.</p>

              <p>There is actually very little academic work on the Kra Isthmus Canal or the Thai Canal (the latest relevant article that comes up when I searched tru Jstor dated 1939), suggesting very little academic interest in the subject. Aka, lots of smart people out there are not taking the idea serious enough to be interested about it. There are a number of articles about it around 2005 and 2006. Interestingly, the first article that pops up on google has the following quote:"<span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">Kamnuan Chalopathump, chairman of the Kra Canal project Senate committee, said Singapore was initially concerned about the impact on its economy. But a shipping industry observer said it may not be such a problem for Singapore. "For container ships, which travel quite fast, (the canal short cut) may not be so attractive. But for big oil tankers it could save time," he said."</span></p>
              <p>The purpose of the canal is therefore, mainly to transport fuel, and China is well, the main fuel consumer in the region. Also, Singapore is the main oil refinary of the region and somewhere between the 3rd and 1st in the world (depending on which source you believe in), so the very commodity that the canal is built for (transporting oil) has to come to Singapore to be refined before shipping out again. </p>

              <p>And where do you propose the people set the new places in? I know anywhere in Singapore is good for you, but most businessmen out there are actually looking out for things like infrastructure, efficiency and experience. The canal doesn't offer a really attractive shortcut and land the ships into a region unfamiliar with port handling and oil refinery business. I know you would choose the short cut over coming to Singapore any day, hell you would choose to sail your ship the other way around the world if you must to avoid Singapore and watch it sink, but I'm not too sure the businessmen out there will do something along the line.</p>

              <p>Protesters against Somchai shut down the entire International Airport and did everything they can to disrupt the entire Thai Administration. Protesters against Abhisit demonstrated at the government house but allowed Abhisit to enter via the side gate. Given the difference in protesters attitude, I would thank the reds too.</p>

              <p>I'm talking about the one that happened during Somchai era, remember at one point during the protests, some of Thaksin loyalist went against the yellow protesters and someone actually lobbed a grenade into the yellow camp?</p>

              <p>If I'm a rich enough person to buy an entire football club, and if Thai peasants are up for sale by the dozen as you were implying, I would be able to buy enough "protesters" to shut down more than just the airport. Why would he do something so lame as to just protest for a couple of days outside the government house?</p>

              <p>Oh course I read the entre paragraph, doesn't mean I have to retype everything or copy and paste it. I was under the assumption that if I type the first few words as reference, people would know which paragraph I'm talking about. So maybe the problem here is not how I read.....</p>

                  this downturn might force them to look at development
                  opportunities. The other would be the price rise for

              <p>Hmmm.... what is your intended timeline then? Given that Singapore 3 oil refineries refines more oil than Thailand's 7 and that Singapore is increasing its capacity by 70%, it is unlikely that Thailand or any other oil refining country in Thailand Gulf Region will catch up within a short time. And since Thailand will need at least 10 years to build this canal, I would say Singapore's oil refinery will be safe from this canal by at least another 15-20 years. In the longer run, say 50-100 years, well, it is possible. But if the world is still going to depend heavily on oil in 50-100 years time, I will feel very disturbed.</p>
              <p>If mistreatment of dissidents = screwing up the country, then Singapore really shouldn't have prospered in the first place. After all, its not like we are just starting to do what we did to the dissidents. In contrast, Thailand and Malaysia have been more leient towards their opposition, especially so in the past number of years. Doesn't seem to me that Thailand and Malaysia is in a better state than Singapore.</p>

              <p><br>Yup, I know nuts about oil refining. Are you able to give a real simple oil refinery 101 in 5 minutes. The subject is way off from what I normally read, so I don't think I will bother to read it up any time soon. How good or bad exactly is Singapore in the field of Oil Refinery. I keep seeing articles that says how we are like top 3 oil refinery or top 3 oil trading, but I'm not 100% sure what these mean.</p>
