              <p>I was told by some of my friends in overseas, that singapore is going down. The Government is finding  very difficult to manage. They said singapore will be flop within 5 to 10 yrs. Singapore looks rich only from the outside poor on the inside. Because many people are suffering under poverty. You better rethink of migrating to another country like canada, Australia, UK etc because this singaporeship is sinking. Here afterwards you can find future both in china and India. And if you belong to the minority group either Malay or Indian your future is in deep trouble as you do not know mandrin.</p>
              <p>Is Singapore really going down? will we not see economic success as in the past? Are we going backwards? Can singapore survive for next 50 yrs? Can singapore government efficiently  manage singapore after LKY? Is singapore a future " Bankok" or even future "Malaysia or Indonesia".</p>
              <p>Pardon me, I am not good in either economics and business so can some knowledgable person educate me in good english because my singlish is very poor.</p>

              <p><br>Dear TS,</p>
              <p>It is inevitable such defeatist thoughts pervades the mind, more so during this crisis, a crisis of confidence and the lack of it.</p>
              <p><br>A country can never sink, at most submerged under water when our polar ice caps melt fully, thousands of years yet. A country is only a physical object, nothing more.</p>
              <p><br>What makes a country special is its inhabitants. Are we a barbaric tribe or tribes, prone to warfare, or a peaceful people subjecting ourselves to the might of rule of constitutional law-the hallmark of an enlightened society?</p>
              <p><br>Singapore is no Elysian fields, but so is any other country. We are flawed beings, similar with everyone else. There is no perfection, but there exists patience to seek for excellence in all we do amongst majority of our citizens.</p>
              <p><br>We, as a people, do not believe in warfare and our military exist only to ensure peace, no threat to anyone who has no intention to harm our loved ones.</p>
              <p><br>By that virtue of enlightened peace instead of dark aged barbarism alone, Singapore is far from sinking. Political policies and citizenry support over the years will be benchmark to project our society's journey into the next 50 years or more.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Scientific evolution will change, but the creatures of habit that we are will take a far longer time to evolve.</p>
              <p><br>Economics wise, and with the concept of 'creatures of habit' philosophy, those who have more will spend more, and those with less will spend less.</p>
              <p><br>Peace and meritocracy practised here will be the means to achieve higher spending power for themselves and love ones. Allevation of poverty will be a political policy - those in power getting the rich and successful middle classes to help the less fortunate amongst us-, the way politics of the 60s era had eradicated slums our forefathers lived.</p>
              <p><br>Lower birth rates as well as the natural attrition rate of emigrating citizens will ensure Singapore survives, with a flat population growth rate, should ALL MNCs flee.</p>
              <p><br>A reversion back to the 60s would not mean death. It would only mean we all will have to rebuild all over again what we had lost, just as every other country on Earth would have to do should economic stimulas fail.</p>
              <p><br>Singapore sink? Think again. Those who can flee will flee, but those who cant will remain and rebuild our nation to what it once was, the way our uneducated forefathers - malays, indians, chinese, etc,  did with a domestic economy before leaping into a strong and vibrant export economy.</p>
              <p><br>Singapore is made up of you and me. Though we may fall or perish in this crisis, I, within the limits of my capabilities and beyond,  will not let Singapore sink, for the sake of the next generation just as the previous geneeration - our forefathers - had worked hard and smart for us. Will you do the same?</p>

              <p><br>By that virtue of enlightened peace instead of dark aged barbarism alone, Singapore is far from sinking. Political policies and citizenry support over the years will be benchmark to project our society's journey into the next 50 years or more.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Scientific evolution will change, but the creatures of habit that we are will take a far longer time to evolve.</p>
              <p><br>Economics wise, and with the concept of 'creatures of habit' philosophy, those who have more will spend more, and those with less will spend less.</p>
              <p><br>Peace and meritocracy practised here will be the means to achieve higher spending power for themselves and love ones. Allevation of poverty will be a political policy - those in power getting the rich and successful middle classes to help the less fortunate amongst us-, the way politics of the 60s era had eradicated slums our forefathers lived.</p>
              <p><br>Lower birth rates as well as the natural attrition rate of emigrating citizens will ensure Singapore survives, with a flat population growth rate, should ALL MNCs flee.</p>
              <p><br>A reversion back to the 60s would not mean death. It would only mean we all will have to rebuild all over again what we had lost, just as every other country on Earth would have to do should economic stimulas fail.</p>
              <p><br>Singapore sink? Think again. Those who can flee will flee, but those who cant will remain and rebuild our nation to what it once was, the way our uneducated forefathers - malays, indians, chinese, etc,  did with a domestic economy before leaping into a strong and vibrant export economy.</p>
              <p><br>Singapore is made up of you and me. Though we may fall or perish in this crisis, I, within the limits of my capabilities and beyond,  will not let Singapore sink, for the sake of the next generation just as the previous geneeration - our forefathers - had worked hard and smart for us. Will you do the same?</p>

              <p> Dear xtreyier</p>
              <p>I do, provided if I find an opportunity here to rebuild otherwise I will migrate but that doesn't mean I will not help rebuilding of singapore. I have to be honest here. The  cause of confusion  whether singapore will sink or not is  arised from reading different articles, Media and  other source.</p>
              <p>But I did not like what I see in singapore especially when it comes to employment. I belong to minority group, whenever I walked around shopping mall I see most of shops are filled with only chinese employees, Malay and Indian are rarely seen. It makes me feel that minority group are not given a fair chance in employment well this is only  a retail sector. I understand some employers need mandrin speaking employees to deal with chinese clients. But there are some employers use this as an excuse to cut off the minorities. It makes the minorites feel that they are less valued here.</p>
              <p>If Age, Gender and racial discrimination is practiced by most employers, how can this be a meritocratic society?  I know discrimination exist even in other English speaking countries but even then there is chance for an employment coz I don't see a greatest Barrier says that you should know mandarin. I grow up believing that I was living in more or less in an english speaking international city, but I was wrong.</p>

              <p>I am glad you would stick it out too.</p>
              <p>As for perceived racism, when i was a kid, i too, like you wondered where were the other malays and indians in my  neighbourhood primary school while reciting the national pledge.</p>
              <p>It was only much later that i realized that the chinese formed the majority of ethnic group in Singapore, and as such, cannot expect it to be filled to brime with other ethnic groups!</p>
              <p>Similarly, in the private sector, such expectations of total domination of minority ethnic groups into employment would be impossible to fulfill.</p>
              <p>I do agree that small pockets of racism exists, but in only the older generation whom will soon be rare species as well as the new foriegn PRs whom had not the opportunities majority of our young had in mixing with one another and realizing we are all of the same race - human beings.</p>
              <p>As for employment of other ethnic groups to serve certain groups, it is true and necessary, as the older generations are not as well verse in the national language of english as we are. However, it is only a language issue, and more often than not, i had seen minority groups who could speak customers lingo were hired and highly valued when they perform well.</p>
              <p>Thus, in Singapore, racism or calls for discrimination goes into deaf ears for we are pragmatic people who sees peace and economics as the way to achieve a better material life. Spirituality is reserved behind close doors and kept private, while adhering to secular laws to achieve equality for everyone of all ethnic groups.</p>

              <p>I definitely hope that dicatorship in Singapore to be finished soon. It's been too long and a change towards political freedom in Singapore would be a welcome in SEA region. There is no intellect in dictator governed country only people with high IQ.</p>
              <p>Right now Singapore is a beacon of 'successful' dictatorship in SEA region. It's true you don't need democracy to prosper but nurturing dictatorship will only corrupt the system from top to bottom and break the rule of law and civil society.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I know the dictator governed Singapore do much disinformation campaign. Putting  a mole posing as an anti governemnt activist is one favorite method and you can be sure that media is tightly controlled including speaker corner in sgforum. You only read what they allow you to read. Don't buy everything that you read by these people. Their only intention is to tarnish the image of the opposition by making them look like a fanatic fundamentalist and make you think that the current corrupt ruling government is a better option than the two. They even have plenty of moles with specific the task to annoy the genuine opposition in sgforums. They must have felt hurt and that's why they are trying to hurt back. Nah they are just being themselves: ASSHOLES.</p>

              <p><br>well, people got different life, whatever it is, just be humble about it, be it recession or booming, we are afterall, going after materialism, taking risk for the sake of it, getting less healthier for the gain of it, and always forget about ourselves when we talk about it. My suggestion here is, there are many better things in life to do than just worry about the recession or booming or the markets, so to speak.</p>
              <p>What happen if the market boomed, u want it to boom further, then u get yourself a condo, a mercs, then later you want more, a bungalow, a martin aston and so on...and when the market crashes down...u get weaker and anxious...but hell, is this call life??</p>
