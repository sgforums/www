              <p>MM Lee finally admitted as reported on CNA tonight that what he felt
                                                      that his ministers' projection of a 6.5 million population may not be
                                                      sustainable.<br> <br> Many people have given their view on this and yet he has refused to accept such feedbacks.<br> <br> He now said that he felt that the comfortable or optimum population for
                                                      Singapore should be between 5.0 to 5.5 millions. Apparently it is the
                                                      first time he has to slap his own minister Mah Bow Tan's face for such
                                                      a stupid forecast.<br> <br> He also said what he was most afraid of is not Singapore not being able
                                                      to attract foreign talents from outside but its own citizen talents
                                                      being attracted away from outside. As if for years he has not received
                                                      people's many feedbacks of his anti-people policies causing such brain
                                                      drain of our own talents to other countries.<br> <br> Apparently it is only after many years that he was finally convinced that the citizens' concern of such brain drains was right. <br> <br> In one policy after another it took many years after great deal of harm
                                                      was done then he realized the damage he has caused due to his own
                                                      stubbornness.<br> <br> What makes him finally change? Perhaps he was now really hurt for the
                                                      first time because even his own grand children have decided too that
                                                      Singapore is not the country to return to as home sweet home come back
                                                      after education abroad.<br> <br> It is proven once again that for many years citizens complaints against
                                                      his narrow and self-centred anti-people policies were not wrong after
                                                      all.<br> <br> What is wrong is his own obstinacy. It took him more than a decade to
                                                      change his streaming elitist policy and it also took him decade to
                                                      recognize his own people are talents who were driven away because of
                                                      his not bothering with promoting utilization of such practical talents.<br> <br> The problem is he has been the one who obstructs the younger ministers
                                                      and others to change by over-emphasising and talking too much of his
                                                      old policies which were anti-people and anti-progress most of the time.<br> <br> The only time Singapore can move with the time is for him to step down
                                                      and leave well alone. There are many talents out there who could reason
                                                      out things and do a lot better how to keep up with the larger world
                                                      outside.</p>

              Robert, according to a report I read MM Lee's grandson, Lee Hongyi has persuaded his brother Lee Haoyi not to 
              
              accept any scholarship n u think this is a possibility that Lee Hongyi might consider migrating to other countries n not coming back to Spore? The brain drain is already been mentioned by PM Lee two years back about the no of local migrating to other countries n u think they might come back to Spore?

              <p>If Singapore can attract FT, I am sure Singapore should be able to attract good and capable singaporeans back to singapore, because when they start a family and have a sizable income, they will appreciate the low taxes and security in this country.</p>

              <p>The governing of a country isn't that simple. Think of nature where one action affects the entire ecological system. A country has an ecology too.</p>
              <p>Most times a policy can have many effects it was never intended to have, let alone accomplishing it's intended goal. Which is why getting views from a cross section of the population may warn us what some of these potentially are. Which is why a good mix of politicians representing various viewpoints can be very helpful in this respect. And also why having politicians with predominantly the same mindset can be very restrictive.</p>
              <p>Factor in our own personal prejudices, ignorance and ambition and the effect gets worse. Factor in that there will be others influencing our opinions to their own advantage and it gets much worse. Now factor in the interactions with the world economy and the pressures of world politics and it begins to look impossible.</p>

              <p>The governing of a country isn't that simple. Think of nature where one action affects the entire ecological system. A country has an ecology too.</p>
              <p>Most times a policy can have many effects it was never intended to have, let alone accomplishing it's intended goal. Which is why getting views from a cross section of the population may warn us what some of these potentially are. Which is why a good mix of politicians representing various viewpoints can be very helpful in this respect. And also why having politicians with predominantly the same mindset can be very restrictive.</p>
              <p>Factor in our own personal prejudices, ignorance and ambition and the effect gets worse. Factor in that there will be others influencing our opinions to their own advantage and it gets much worse. Now factor in the interactions with the world economy and the pressures of world politics and it begins to look impossible.</p>
              <p>Sometimes, in trying to balance everything, you drop it all.</p>

              go to other countries. Remember around last year, there is a Spore Day in NY designed to attract back locals.
