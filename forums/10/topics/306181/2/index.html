              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has assured
              Singaporeans that the government will help mitigate the rising costs of
              food.
              <br> <br>Speaking at the Teck Ghee Lunar New Year celebrations, Mr Lee said
              revenues have been strong and the government will be distributing help
              – especially to the poor and elderly – in the upcoming Budget debate.
              <br> <br> But Singaporeans must also make necessary adjustments.
              <br> <br>Mr Lee said: "I expect the inflation to be higher this year than
              last year, especially in the first half of this year. Last year, the
              inflation was about 2 percent. This year, it may be 5 percent, it may
              be even more."
              <br> <br>Singapore is not the only country experiencing rising food prices.
              Prices in China and India are also going up, due to affluence and more
              consumption demand.
              <br> <br> Adverse weather conditions in Australia and China are also sending food prices upwards.
              <br> <br>Some measures that the government will undertake to ease the
              situation are to diversify the country's food sources and encourage
              consumers to switch to house brands, which are cheaper and give better
              value.
              <br> <br>Lower income families can expect relief in the form of the
              government's Workfare Scheme, which paid out S$150 million last month,
              benefiting some 290,000 workers.
              <br> <br> The Public Assistance Scheme is also being reviewed.
              <br> <br>Mr Lee said: "Most importantly, we need to grow the economy so that
              incomes will go up. Last year we had a good year, so wages, bonuses
              went up. And NTUC did a survey and found that last year, the bonuses
              which workers were getting were the highest bonuses in any year since
              1990 - which means nearly in 20 years, we have not had such good
              bonuses. <br> <br> "Lots of people are working, unemployment has come right down. We had
              230,000 more jobs last year and unemployment has gone down to 1.6
              percent."
              <br> <br>The prime minister added that being an open economy that imports
              all its food, Singapore cannot simply control the prices of food
              essentials as this will hurt the retailers and suppliers, resulting in
              shortages and queues.
              <br> <br>And if the government subsidises these essentials, it will be
              costly and ineffective as the subsidies would also go to those who are
              not poor.
              <br> <br>Mr Lee said while the government will help, Singaporeans must also
              do their part to work together to keep the country strong and
              competitive.

              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Many members of parliament (MPs), ministers and
              volunteers spent the last Sunday in the Year of the Pig fanning out
              across the island to distribute hong baos (red packets) and food packs
              to the needy.
              <br> <br>A total of 150 public assistance recipients from Kolam Ayer were
              treated to lunch, singing and dance performances. They also received
              NTUC gift vouchers, mandarin oranges and festive food stuff.
              <br> <br> Environment and Water Resources Minister Yaacob Ibrahim was there to wish them good health.
              <br> <br>Over at the Sree Narayana Mission Home in Yishun, Health Minister
              Khaw Boon Wan presented new wheelchairs and hong baos to residents.
              Low-income residents in the area also received food hampers worth
              S$150.
              <br> <br>Mr Khaw said the Health Ministry is looking into building more
              nursing homes in housing estates. This is to make it easier for
              children to visit their aged parents regularly.
              <br> <br>"With population growth and ageing, you have to keep up with
              demand. But you don't want to overbuild because it will be too easy for
              children to send their parents to nursing homes. The best solution is
              to allow the elderly to age at home," he said.
              <br> <br>Help was also at hand for the elderly in Bedok. 44 of those who are
              on the Public Assistance Scheme received hong baos from their MP who
              said there are several schemes to help Singaporeans cope with temporary
              hardships.
              <br> <br>Deputy Prime Minister S Jayakumar said: "We have many schemes –
              whether it's Comcare or schemes under the community development council
              (CDC) and within the grassroots organisations – so we're able to
              cushion them in times of difficulty until their period of difficulty is
              over."
              <br> <br>The South East CDC, NTUC Fairprice and Hwa Chong Institution also
              got together to help low-income families and single elderly persons
              cope with rising costs.
              <br> <br>Under its "Food Samaritan" project, the students got Fairprice
              shoppers to sponsor some 1,900 food and non-food packages which were
              then distributed to the needy in the district in time for the Lunar New
              Year celebrations.

                            Mr Lee said: "Most importantly, we need to grow the economy so that
              incomes will go up. Last year we had a good year, so wages, bonuses
              went up. And NTUC did a survey and found that last year, the
              bonuses which workers were getting were the highest bonuses in any
              year since 1990 - which means nearly in 20 years, we have not had
              such good bonuses.<br>
              <br>
              "Lots of people are working, unemployment has come right down. We
              had 230,000 more jobs last year and unemployment has gone down to
              1.6 percent."

              young people n majority mentioned they like to migrate to other countries. Look at people from HK, many of them migrate to Canada whereas local like to migrate to Australia. For the local guys, the frustrating thing is reservist liability which they need to come back to serve evey year n worse of all, they cannot downgrade n it is tought for those in combat vocation, still need to go outfield when they are in their late thirties or early forties.

              although full time NS has been reduced to two years. During PM Lee's national day rally speech, he seem worried about the no of locals migrating to other countries n the figures mentioned is 800 locals. I do agree the tax in US or Canada are bit too high to handle for the locals.

              I agreeed on the part that parents need to provide their children with the ncessary tools to survive in the competetive environment. What I quite worried
              
              is the part that Spore is becoming far too competetive for all these locals to handle especially the coming of foreigners. The worse part about NS is many parents would like their son to go to easy vocation such as clerk, storeman, driver or service medic. There is a system called the white horse policy, oh gosh remember during BMT, sergeant n officer will treat those white horse's parents with great respect. What parents are concerned is they are afrid their son will be mistreated. Once mistreated, they have to go thru the chain of command before they can go report to SAFMPC(Singapore Armed Forces Military Police Command), this gave commanders the chance to become little warlord controlling their fiefdoom, I once advocated of putting undercover MP in unit notorious for brutal training.

              <p>If I am PM, I wont be that worried about singaporeans trying to
                  make a living overseas as long as they dont give up their

              <p>If Singapore can attract FT, I am sure Singapore should be able
                  to attract good and capable singaporeans back to singapore, because
                  when they start a family and have a sizable income, they will
                  appreciate the low taxes and security in this country.</p>

              <p>If those same Singaporeans have millions of dollars in their account and self employed with a dash of investment savvyness , they will come back to escape the taxes and make use of the low wage system to make more money. Not many will be in that category</p>
              <p>This is my assumption that most Singaporeans overseas are likely to be employed by an organisation rather than self employed. What Lee is scared of is that those same skilled Singaporeans won't come back and Singapore needs the skills to fuel its workforce. Great if you have investors , bad if you don't have skilled and experienced workers.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Look at nursing alone where there is a worldwide shortage til the point that Africa begged for WHO intervention to ask the richer countries not to take their nurses.</p>
              <p>Train the nurses, try to bond them , after their bond completes, some will move overseas.  An endless hole they cannot plug. Other countries have that same problem. There are organisations falling over themselves to attract the nurses with pay that Singapore cannot match. Let alone other professions like actuaries.</p>

              <p><em>"No...Singaporeans are not being marginalised. Marginalisation is a figment of their imagination. Those are not elderly beggars sleeping on the streets, those are people who like to sleep on the streets - much cooler there, lah. No lah, those are not their belongings, those are their makeshift pillows - maybe they don't want to dirty the pillows on their nice clean bed. Singaporeans are complaining too much - they complain of rising cost when they want to spend on BRANDED<strong> food stuff.</strong> You know if they save those few cents per  box of bak kua or loaf of bread, they can pay off their HDB loans? And they want to complain some more..no wonder Wee Shu Min is right in expressing to those people to get out of her elite uncaring face. Those people so bad ...go and invade her internet privacy by discussing openly on what she said on the public blog . "</em></p>

              <p>First of all, if you are in the lower income group , you are likely to be involved in enterprise bargaining which pins your salary increments within multiyear duration.</p>
              <p>Second of all, the usual advice from treasury and reserve bank, as well as other NGOs,  is to try and not get into debt in the first place.</p>
              <p>Third of all, there is always the welfare and health safety net.</p>
              <p>Fourth of all, if any government tells its people to buy cheaper food to cope with inflation, have a serious problem.  Better quality food usually cost more. We are not just talking about tin can mushrooms.  For example, organic food which is better than your run-of-the-mill genetically modified food , is expensive. There are things that can be said like don't buy branded clothing , branded cars etc but food?</p>
              <p>What's next? Eat cheap food fried with ghee if you cannot afford the better quality healtier oil and wait for your heart attack? Coming from a man who thinks mee siam has hum , this does not sound encouraging at all.</p>
              <p>Oh one more thing, Australia has no GST taxes on fresh food. Not sure about Singapore.</p>
