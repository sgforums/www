            <div class='col-md body'>HONG KONG: Singapore journalist Ching Cheong has been jailed for five years by a Chinese court for spying, Hong Kong television said on Thursday.<br><br>Ching was put on trial behind closed doors two weeks ago after being detained for more than a year on charges of spying for Taiwan.<br><br>"He has been given five years. I'm sorry, but I cannot give any further details," lawyer He Peihua said in an interview seen on Cable TV News in Hong Kong.<br><br>James Lung, coordinator of the Hong Kong-based Rescue Ching Cheong Alliance, told AFP the court also ordered the confiscation of 300,000 yuan (37,500 dollars) of property.<br><br>"We think it's very unfair, because from the beginning to the end nobody knew what happened," Lung said. He added the family would consider appealing the verdict.<br><br>In response to the media queries on the case of Mr Ching Cheong, the publisher of The Straits Times, Singapore Press Holdings has issued a press statement noting with concern the sentence meted out.<br><br>The company has appealed to the Chinese authorities to show Mr Ching Cheong leniency and compassion on account of his poor health.<br><br>His wife Lau has always maintained his innocence, saying Ching apparently fell into a trap set over sensitive materials on late Communist Party chief Zhao Ziyang, who was sacked for opposing the 1989 Tiananmen crackdown.<br><br>She also said Ching had helped an academic at a Chinese government think-tank compile reports on Hong Kong and Taiwan commissioned by the central authorities, and gave advice on cross-strait relations.<br><br>The problem was he may have given too much information on mainland China to Taiwan authorities, according to Hong Kong media. The charges also seem to suggest this.<br><br>The verdict also deprived Ching of his political rights for one year, Xinhua said.<br><br>This is a routine addition to jail sentences in China, with little practical significance, as it means he cannot vote or run in elections in lawmaking assemblies.- AFP<br><br><a href="http://sg.news.yahoo.com/060831/5/singapore227783.html" rel="nofollow">http://sg.news.yahoo.com/060831/5/singapore227783.html</a><br><br><a href="http://sg.news.yahoo.com/060831/3/434ot.html" rel="nofollow">http://sg.news.yahoo.com/060831/3/434ot.html</a><br><br><a href="http://sg.news.yahoo.com/060831/1/434pk.html" rel="nofollow">http://sg.news.yahoo.com/060831/1/434pk.html</a></div>
