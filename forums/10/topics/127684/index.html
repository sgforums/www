            <div class='col-md body'>Sigh... you are right in that hate does beget hate, and two wrongs do not one right make. However, let's try to understand the situations by looking at the facts first. The Japanese -- at least those in the government -- are covering up the fact that their grandfathers in the army had raped and killed so many Chinese and Koreans' parents or grandparents during World War II. To add insult to injury, the Japanese are teaching their children and grandchildren and future generations that their forefathers in the army had been war heroes and had liberated many countries in Asia from European and American colonial masters.<br><br>All the protests and demonstrations may be politically-motivated, but the insult to ancestors is all very personal and could be very intensely emotional, which probably explains why some of the protests have descended into mindless rampages of violence. Let's use an analogy to your example below:<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by SMAPLionHeart:<br>Imagine if your grandfather molested or raped someone 60 years ago...<br>then someone beaten up your dad,or your son..for something which he had done no wrong happened 60 years ago..<br></blockquote>Imagine if your grandmother was raped by many people's grandfathers 50 years ago. Then these many people taught their grandsons and granddaughters that your grandmother was not raped by their grandfathers because she was in fact bestowed the honour to serve as a willing volunteer in their grandfathers' army at that time. Are you going to believe them and congratulate yourself that you are so lucky to share grandfathers with them? Or are you going to believe your grandmother and give those lying bastards a piece of your mind instead?<br><br>How could the Chinese and Koreans take this grievous insult lying down?<br><br>To seek revenge may be wrong, but to seek redress, especially in the form of admission to someone's past guilt, is not.<br><br>Now with some inkling the reasons behind their anger, let's examine why the Chinese and Koreans are choosing this time to flare up again. It has been 50 years since the war ended. The Chinese and Koreans have been sharing peace, albeit uneasy, with the Japanese and the three countries have re-established mutual diplomatic and trade cooperative relations since then. So why the raking up of old debts now?<br><br>Because this time, as in the past when the old hatreds are just starting to fade, the Japanese have once again tested the patience of the neighbours by implementing insensitive policies unilaterally without any apparent regard or respect for the neighbours.<br><br>Because this time, the Japanese have sought leadership in the region when they have not the courage as befitting a leader to admit their past guilt.</div>

The Government of the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany until 1989) has offered official apologies for the role of Germany in the Holocaust. <strong>Additionally, German leaders have continuously expressed repentance, most notably when former Chancellor Willy Brandt fell on his knees in front of a Holocaust memorial in the Warsaw Ghetto in 1970.</strong> Germany has also paid extensive reparations, including nearly $70 billion to the state of Israel. It has given $15 billion to Holocaust survivors and will continue to compensate them until 2015. Additionally, the government of Germany coordinated an effort to reach a settlement with German companies that had used slave labor during the war; the companies will pay $1.7 billion to victims. Germany also established a National Holocaust Memorial Museum in Berlin for looted property.<br><br>What has the japanese done? "Japanese officials have offered official and personal apologies or "regret" for the aggressive and bloody war it unleashed in Asia and the Pacific. Unlike Germany or Italy, where there is overwhelming national concensus, <strong>Japan has not come to a single conclusion actions of its military during and leading up to the war. Instead, the debate still brews,</strong> often among members of its ruling Liberal Democratic Party. Conservative, pro-nationalist members have thus far prevailed in this debate and control textbooks though they are denounced by a vocal minority of more liberal thinkers, intellectuals and teachers. <strong>In recent years, Prime Minister Koizumi has re-ignited the domestic and international controversy by paid homage to Yasukuni Shrine.</strong><br><br>Indeed, hatred and violence have no ends, human correct our past mistakes so that civilization can move on. Respecting war criminals, glorifying acrocities and whitewashing historical facts is not part of civilization.<br>[/img]</div>

When the British colony fell on February 15, 1942, the Japanese military authorities attempted a systematic extermination on the Chinese population of Malaya and Singapore, on the context of eliminating undesirable "anti-Japanese" elements. Even though the Sook Ching Massacre did not have the scale nor organization of the Holocaust in Europe, <strong>postwar testimonies suggested that the Japanese Army exterminated about 25,000 to 50,000 Nanyang Chinese.</strong> After the massacre was called off on March 3, the Japanese military authrities ordered the Chinese Chamber of Commerce to raise $50 million of "tribute money". Singapore requested Japan many times for an apology and compensation, especially after Singapore became self-governing. However, the Japanese Foreign Ministry replied using the San Francisco Peace Treaty of 1951, in which the United Kingdom was a signatory state (and therefore, the colony of Singapore), has settled all compensation claims (even though <strong>Japan's compensations to the Singapore colonial government practically only dealth with British property damages</strong>). In October 1966, Japan finally agreed to pay "compensation" to Singapore, now an independent, sovereign nation. However, half of the compensation was paid in the form of a loan, and the "compensation package" did not come with an official apology. <strong>Until today (2004), Japan still has not officially apologized for the systematic extermination of ethnic Chinese in the Sook Ching Massacre."</strong><br><br>Sad to know that a few aircon buses and some loan was enough to settle the lives of 25,000 to 50,000 Chinese in singapore.<br></div>

COME on if u dun even admit your own mistake and try ways and means to cover up...i dun believe that u really learn from yours own mistake...<br><br>In the book they play down ..lot of act they have done...such as they do not even mention the use of "comfort woman" which is so well-known to even the generation now....in the textbook they call themself the Liberator as they help those asia country to be freed from they colonial master...<br><br>if u have learn history before...u should know that history is just not there for fun....history is for human to learn the  mistake from the past and never to repeat again....<br><br>They should learn from germany...which do not try anything to cover up for the mistake they did...and even apologies for their mistake....<br><br>China and korea has suffer more from japan than anyone of the south east asia..country...even before world war 2 started..korean was already under japan rule..and china..has been fighting with them for years..So it understanding that they are anger by the changing of history book..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hello folks, i'm sure there's merit to each and everyone's opinions here.  we may not agwee with one another but we need not degenerate into the ugliness that was the motivation behind this topic.<br><br>anyway, just a thought.  the US has systematically eliminated all major threats to its 'dominance' for as long as anybody can remember.  i wouldn't be surprised if 20 years later we have a disclosure from CIA about US influence in the disintegration of USSR.<br><br>the single greatest threat to the US in the near future would be china.  Tian An Men failed.  Dalai Lama failed.  how to deal with china?  US needs more allies in the security council.  while the british can always be counted upon being brothers, the french has shown that it can turn its back if it wants to and russians are former nemesis.  time to bring on japan.<br><br>the chinese have never forgotten the war attrocities but have always kept them bottled up for the sake of japanese investments.  but today, china can 'better afford' to raise its voice, and has more reasons to do so especially when you add up issues like taiwan, crude oil reserves on east china sea islands, russian oil pipeline and now security council ... that's pushing tolerance limits a bit too far isn't it?<br><br>as long as the US is behind japan, the japs will continue to do as they please.  the chinese as yet cannot deal with the combined might of US and japan.  it recently became buddies with india again so with its back covered, the warheads can now point east.<br><br>speculations only ...</div>
