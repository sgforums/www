            <div class='col-md body'>i dun think its horse racing's fault that the sport as a whole has degraded as such.  i agree with CX when he says that its the PEOPLE, NOT the sport. . .<br><br>but at the end of the day, horse racing is still a sport. . . and the jockeys are still athletes and we respect them as such. . .<br><br>yes there exist many gambling whores who view horse racing as simply something for them to bet on, but there are among us people who also view it as a sport.<br><br>basically, everyone has his opinion here and we should leave it at that. . .<br><br>i think professional football is little more than politics and a needlessly hyped up activity for the rich earn money from disguised under the name of sports and that football stars are grossly overpaid and needlessly glorified for no particular reason. . . most people will disagree with me and i'm fine with that. . .</div>
