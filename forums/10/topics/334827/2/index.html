              <p><a title="emperornoclothes.jpg" href="http://www.asiaisgreen.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/emperornoclothes.jpg"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #33a23d;"><img title="emperornoclothes.jpg" src="http://www.asiaisgreen.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/emperornoclothes.jpg" alt="emperornoclothes.jpg" align="right"></span></span></a>Sometimes, we are hurt by comments that tell us the truth. We find them unpleasant even if they are spoken for our own good. We often ignore them or try to dispel them. Recently, there are some comments about Singapore’s efforts in energy and climate change:</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.todayonline.com/articles/224681print.asp"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #33a23d;">Today</span></span></a> reported the following comments by National University of Singapore Associate Professor Natasha Hamilton-Hart in response to whether Singapore could lead on climate change in Southeast Asia:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Prof Hamilton-Hart said while Singapore has “great potential”, the country lacked credibility.</p>
              <p>“The target here is to reduce energy intensity, but that’s not the same as reducing emissions,” she said. “To get other countries involved, Singapore needs to show a willingness to commit to bringing down its emissions.”</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><a href="http://www.todayonline.com/articles/224463print.asp"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #33a23d;">Today</span></span></a> reported comments by Mr Erik Thorsen, president and chief executive officer of Renewable Energy Corporation:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>“The (solar) industry will have to take responsibility by lowering prices, with governments supporting with incentives.”</p>
              <p>He added: “Singapore has a philosophy of not subsidising or subsidising very little. So, it’s very hard to make use of technologies and programmes that need more incentives to happen.”</p>
              <p>Were all countries to share Singapore’s attitude of waiting for technology to become cost-competitive before adopting it, such technology could not have been accomplished, he argued.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>The government has reasons for not doing the things mentioned in the comments - It’s the economy, stupid! The government cannot afford to bring down emissions significantly or give subsidies because it will distort the market and increase the business costs for companies and living costs for the people. It’s the typical ‘environment is important but economy comes first’ mindset and reasoning.</p>
              <p>We understand the government’s worries for our business and living costs, and appreciate their good efforts to maintain a sustainable environment as described in the <a href="http://www.mewr.gov.sg/nccs/index.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #33a23d;">National Climate Change Strategy</span></span></a> and <a href="http://app.mti.gov.sg/default.asp?id=2546"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #33a23d;">National Energy Policy Report</span></span></a>. But if we were to give the government a report card, it would say, “Has shown improvement but can do better”.</p>
              <p>For Singapore to become a global clean energy hub or take the lead in the region on climate change, we have to do better. The comments have some truth in them and it’s time to relook the two issues below:</p>
              <p><strong>Using reduction in absolute carbon dioxide emissions as a target instead of carbon intensity</strong></p>
              <p>The national target in the <a href="http://www.mewr.gov.sg/nccs/natGHGE.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #33a23d;">National Climate Change Strategy</span></span></a> is to reduce carbon intensity to 25% below 1990 levels by 2012. A reduction in carbon intensity (carbon dioxide emissions per dollar of GDP) does not necessary mean a reduction in the amount of carbon emissions. The problem of climate change is one of absolute concentrations of carbon dioxide and each country must reduce its absolute carbon emissions.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Singapore’s per capita emission</strong> <strong>is one of the</strong> <strong>highest in Asia</strong> and is similar to some developed countries.</span></span> Most developed countries under the Kyoto Protocol are required to reduce absolute emissions by about 5% below 1990 levels. Likewise, we should set a target of reducing our absolute carbon dioxide emissions.</p>
              <p><strong>Work towards a Four National Switches energy portfolio</strong></p>
              <p>We diversified our water supplies and have our four national taps: local catchment water, imported water, NEWater and desalinated water. Similarly, we should diversify our energy sources and work towards an energy portfolio of four national switches: fuel oil, natural gas and two other renewable energy sources (solar, wind, biomass, tidal, etc). The intention is not to completely replace fossil fuel but to reduce our dependence on their import.</p>
              <p>The cost of alternative renewable energy might be higher now but we should also take into account the future price of oil given the security and climate change concerns. Besides considering the cost of doing something, we should also consider the cost of not doing it.</p>

According to the <a href="http://wildsingaporenews.blogspot.com/2008/03/tuas-power-may-build-2b-coal-fired.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #33a23d;">Business Times</span></span></a>, Tuas Power is planning to convert its standby capacity of 1,200 MW that is currently generated by steam plants to be generated by either natural gas-fired plants or <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">coal-fired plants</span></strong></span>.</p>
              <p>Tuas Power’s CEO Lim Kong Puay explained that the capital costs of coal-fired plants (about $2 billion) would be higher than natural gas-fired plants (about $700 to $800 million), but <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">coal-fired plants have lower operating costs</span></span>. Tuas Power could also tap on its new owner, Huaneng’s vast experience in coal-fired plants in China.</p>
              <p>We think it is <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">highly possible that Tuas Power would take the coal route as it wants to tap on the expertise of Huaneng on coal and cut its costs before its competitors</span></span> (such as Power Seraya and Senoko Power) also acquire new owners and become more competitive. Once there is a coal-fired plant in Singapore, the worry is that other power plants will follow suit and build more coal-fired plants as coal is still more cost competitive than oil and natural gas.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">We are against the use of coal for generating electricity because coal is still a dirtier fuel source that emits more carbon dioxide, thus contributing to global warming</span>. <span style="color: #ff0000;">A cleaner coal-fired plant such as <span style="text-decoration: underline;">a modern Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) plant still <strong>emit about twice</strong> the carbon dioxide amount as compared to a natural gas-fired plant</span>.</span> The future zero emissions coal plant using carbon capture and sequestration technologies are still in research and not commercially available yet.</p>
              <p>In Tuas Power’s Health, Safety and Environmental Policy, they commit to:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Conducting operations in an environmentally responsible manner through maximizing our plant efficiency, resource conservation, reducing waste and controlling emissions</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>We hope that Tuas Power would remember its own environmental commitment to control emissions and reject the idea of building coal-fired plants in Singapore. If there is a go-ahead by the government to allow Tuas Power to start using coal to generate our energy, does it mean that we are contradicting our stand on sustainable development and climate change?</p>

              <p>Sigh...you want to reduce carbon emission, the only viable way is to go nuclear. And stop telling me that nuclear is unsafe. Please, the US carriers has been using a nuclear reactor and no ship has blown up due to their reactor. If you don't fear a US carrier passing or stationed in singapore, then you don't need to fear a Nuclear powerplant.</p>

              <p>Sigh, the chernobyl diaster is the instance where everything that should not be done wrongly is done wrongly. Here is some key points provided by people who know about the diaster.</p>

              <div class="postbody">Some other causes of Chernobyl:<br><br>1. The lead engineer building the plant had no experience or training in building nuclear reactors, and had previously only built dams.<br><br>2. There was no containment dome over the reactor.<br><br>3. They were running an experiment on the operating reactor which involved disabling more than 60 separate safety protocols while keeping it in service.</div>

              <p>The design of that nuclear power plant basically teaches us to be careful with nuclear power plant, and if people actually tried to maintain the nuclear power plant properly, we will not see any negative harm.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Another guy from another forum has said this well enough.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Worst case scenario - the chlorine tanks used for water purification rupture releasing a cloud of gas downwind into a town. Should we ban water purification plants?<br><br>Nasty scenario - terrorist buys one pound of nails from a hardware store, coats them in sugar water, and wraps them in a bag around some dynamite. He then takes a crap on them for the E coli bacteria. After the bacteria has spread over the nails, he takes the bag down to a city park, and sets it off, creating a biohazard situation for anyone even scratched by a nail. Should we ban hardware stores and supermarkets? Or a bunch of small explosives on roach bombs placed in a theater. Nothing like a cloud of nerve agent in the middle of a dark room with only a few exits to make a disaster. Should we ban bug sprays?<br></p>

              <p>Moreover, we do have chemical plants here in singapore, and what is the reason to put up so many security checkpoints, SAF patrols in the Jurong island?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To prevent terrorist from being able to bomb the place and cause harm to the singapore mainland.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Moreover, we have a nuclear aircraft carrier from the US parking here in singapore every now and then, shouldn't we be worried about the aircraft carrier from being bombed by terrorist as well?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In the long run, when our neighbouring state decides to adopt nuclear power, and build a nuclear power plant in Johor for example, isn't that a worse thing? Because we have to trust other nation to ensure that their nuclear reactor will not blow up and spread the nuclear fallout to singapore? Isn't it better to trust ourself on the safety issues?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Perhaps, singapore has the need to push and educate people on nuclear power for once?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If anything, the discussion on this site can be useful, I have asked others about nuclear issue in regards to singapore, and some of their comments is really useful to understand that the benefits outweighs the risk.</p>

              <p>Everything we do have risk, the issue here is, does the benefit outweigh the risk?</p>
