It cannot be on friday noon 'cos the time is too short for any interaction!<br><br>Shouldn't the more important prayer be on thursday evening? That is when Muslims welcome the "sabbath".<br><br>Islam got concept of "cell group" or not? Or at least a community where you belong, where the members encourage one another in the faith and study the Qu'ran together.</div></blockquote>the actual muslim `service' is on the friday itself. the imam in all the masjids across singapore will deliver the khutbah or sermon. the sermons are basically weekly reminders, sometimes admonitions, sometimes advice regarding muslims living in non-muslims environtment and sometimes general current affair issues are brought up, recently the organ donation issue.<br><br>muslims do not welcome the `sabbath' on thursday night. i noticed the word sabbath here is used for the meaning `rest' , but that's not what it means. sabbath is a jewish word meaning seven or the seventh day whereas in arabic the seventh day is called yaumul sab'ah. sabbath in jewish, sab'ah in arabic. and which day does the jews worship on?? saturday which is the seventh day of the week. and which day does the seventh day adventist christians worship on?? also saturday. muslims worship on friday, yaumul jumah, meaning day of gathering, which is the sixth day of the week. and it only takes 2 hrs, not the whole day, and after the prayers we are told to go about our bussiness as per normal. there are no `off' days in Islam like saturdays or sundays, and it is also not necessary to declare friday as an off day like they do in some muslim countries.<br><br>i'm not familiar with the concept of `cell' group. but we Muslims are encouraged to learn the deen (the way) of Islam from where the sources are available to us. for eg now masjids in singapore hold weekly classes and talks on various topics. i live in jurong and i can go to pasir ris to get the knowledge, just like i can go to any other masjids that are holding these talks or classes. or sometimes these classes are held in homes, where the muslims will gather in one of these homes generally once a week to learn the deen.</div>
