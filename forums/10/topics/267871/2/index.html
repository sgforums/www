Why must it be done in a mosque?<br><br>The whole idea seems a bit strange to me. Jews and Protestant Christians stick to one home church and their community spirit is strong.

Typically you go to a mosque nearest to your workplace (like those in Raffles place will go the underground mosque there). But then 1 hour how to interact with your fellow Muslims?

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Icemoon:</div><div class="quote_body">I have a religious question here. Why must it be done in a mosque?<br><br>The whole idea seems a bit strange to me. Jews and Protestant Christians stick to one home church and their community spirit is strong. Catholics can go any Catholic Church, but then the main point why they go church is for the Holy Communion.<br><br>Muslims leh? Typically you go to a mosque nearest to your workplace (like those in Raffles place will go the underground mosque there). But then 1 hour how to interact with your fellow Muslims? Is that mosque their home mosque?<br><br>Or is the friday prayer like the Catholic lunchtime Mass? Meaning Muslims actually have another home mosque which should be nearer to where they live?</div></blockquote>I'm not good in this but i will try my best to give you the best possible answer.<br><br>It needs to be done in a mosque cause there is a rule that says at least 40 people are needed to do the Friday prayer. Below than that, only the normal noon prayer should be done. And yes, there is a difference between a Friday prayer and a normal noon prayer. Also Friday prayer includes a sermon. (If you have done your Friday prayer, there is no need to do your noon prayer. But if you miss your Friday prayer, there is a need to do the noon prayer.)<br><br>If one stays in Jurong, and he wants to pray in a mosque in Pasir Ris, it is acceptable. Since Friday prayer clashes with work, of course we should go to the nearest mosque to save time.<br><br>We don't exactly interact, since we go there to listen to the sermon and pray. But as you all may know, when Muslim man meets another Muslim man they would offer a handshake, smile and say the 'Peace to be upon you' greetings.<br><br>This is the best I can come out with. Maybe other Muslims out there can help. If there is/are mistake(s), pls point out.<br><br></div>
