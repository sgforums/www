            <div class='col-md body'>I have this to say about such a sad case; it is red-tape, internal politics, and policy preservationism, that kills a critically ill patient.<br><br>Personally, I've observed that all government bodies in Singapore, are only all too proficient and keen in protecting the integrity of their set policies, rules, and regulations. While your needs, are least and last in their list of priorities in their sole function/s.<br><br>Seemingly, each encounter with either HDB, CPF, SGH, or whatever other abbreviated government organizations, their interests is so apparently obvious; unbending adherence to their set policies, rules, and regulations regardless of your predicament.<br><br>So I say, even a hospital is supposed to help save lives and heal the sick, their ultimate duty appears to be upholding their policies, rules, and regulations. Saving lives, comes last.<br><br>There can only be a difference if you are wealthy, and can afford to go to a private upper class hospital, wherein, their policies, rules, and regulations, are last in their attention, and life preservation is first in their list of priorities. Therefore, Singapore, is a country where the rich can survive better, while the lower income groups and teh poor, are subjected to such lacklustre healthcare.<br><br>And should the writer of this article manages a response from SGH or MOH, the common statement will always be; this is an isolated incident. It shouldn't have happened but it did, lets move on....<br><br>How we all wish we CAN move one - outta here that is...<br><br></div>

Remember this policy from Ministry of Finance last September?<br><br>"Under guidelines which came into effect in July, ministries and statutory boards must reduce their headcounts by three percent in the current fiscal year to March 2005 and by the same margin for the following two financial years, it said in a statement.<br><br>Failure to meet the guidelines will result in a headcount surcharge of S$10,000 (US$5882) for each employee above the authorised limit."<br><br>On top of that, we now have 5 working days, longer maternity leave (which really affects nurses since most of them are young and female) and expanded service into 'aesthetic medicine' (cosmetic surgery and the like) to earn the foreign buck.<br><br>You can only push your staff so far...increased demand but reduced staff at any one time...what do you expect the hospital staff to do?<br><br></div></blockquote>thats something i could never understand ALL department/ministries must cut staff head count........... it either means there are some problems which led to extra jobs and i guess some one should be made accountable or that its just some policy they inplemented for fun.<br><br>anyway why isit a general policy and not one that by individual department?</div>
