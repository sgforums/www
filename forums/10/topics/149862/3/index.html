My dad was sent to the A&amp;E department three times in two months because of stroke and, each time, my family had to wait at least six hours before he was pushed to a ward.<br>I can understand that the hospital is short of staff and we have to wait for every thing. But to make a patient wait hours for a bed is unforgiveable, especially when the patient is in critical condition.<br><br>The third time my dad was taken to SGH was also his last. When I drove him to SGH, he was already paralysed and could not speak. The A&amp;E doctors were quick to attend to him because of the urgency of his condition.<br>They ordered an immediate scan to see how badly his brain had been affected by the stroke, after which he was left unattended in a corner to await the results.<br>I could see that my dad was getting weaker as time went by. About two to three hours later, when the results came out, the doctors confirmed that he had suffered a stroke I again and had to be admitted.<br><br>It took another hour or two for the admission staff to tell s us that my dad had to wait as no bed was available in the neurology ward.<br>When we checked on him in the observation area, he was in a serious state. He was having fits and barely conscious, and his mouth was; foaming. No one attended to him.<br><br>It was only when we cried that a patient service officer quickly picked up my dad's file and called for someone to push him away. . When my dad finally got to the ward, it was past 2am. And we had arrived at the A&amp;E department about 7pm; it took more than six hours before my dad was seen by a neurologist.<br>If my dad had been taken to the ward earlier and been treated by a neurologist, his chances of living might be higher.<br><br>The neurologist told us that my dad had the worst kind of stroke anyone could get. He also told my family to quickly consider having a special injection administered as his condition was deteriorating by the minute since the onset of stroke at 5.45pm at home.<br><br>We took no more than 10 minutes to reach a decision. And to think that six hours were wasted in the A&amp;E department.<br><br>The image of my father lying there foaming and having seizures, with no one to attend to him, has been haunting me since. Sadly, he was pronounced brain dead the next day.<br><br>I appreciate the doctors in the A&amp;E department for their sense of urgency, and the doctors in the neurology ward who tried their best to save my father.<br><br>But I did not detect the, same sense of urgency in hospital staff who were at the front line, doing admission administration and ferrying of patients. I saw faces filled with weariness and reluctance rather than urgency and compassion.<br><br>I agree with Ms Rodziah that it seemed acceptable to the hospital for patients to wait hours for a bed - and specialised treatment and care. If Singapore wants to be a top-notch medical hub, how can we condone this kind of work attitude, and hours of waiting in the emergency department?<br><br>Tan Tze Yee (Ms)<br>Copyright @ 2005 Singapore Press Holdings.

Of course every doctor and nurse that has gained enough experience at AH will want to run over to Mt. E. Furthermore, an eye specialist earns many times more than an A/E doctor, who has to work long hours at night...which specialty do you think young doctors will choose?<br><br>Get real...the truth is, cost of medical treatment is high. The cost of treatment at Emergency Departments is higher than most other specialties and it is the department that tends to lose money. Now that the hospital administrator is given a fixed sum of money from the government to run the hospital, how can he make do with limited funding with more elderly needing treatment? Aesthetic medicine and eye surgery make money...of course he will encourage those departments to expand and pay their doctors well. But what about departments like diagnostics (laboratory medicine, radiology) and emergency medicine that always lose money? Do you think he will want to expand and pay their doctors well....and lose even more money?<br><br>At the end of the day, money is the issue. Are we prepared to spend more money on healthcare and buy fewer F15s and submarines? Maybe cut down on the overseas training trips and spend the money increasing hospital facilities instead.<br><br>Another thing: hospitals are run by silly MBA administrators, not doctors. They see 2 wards half filled and say it is not cost-effective, so close one ward and make sure all the beds are full. Then one dengue outbreak and patients will have to be turned away...In healthcare, cost effectiveness can kill...are we prepared to lose some money over such inefficiencies or save money, be super-efficient and lose some lives?<br><br>How can you blame the hospital staff when the beds are full? Yes, the poor chap was having seizures and foaming at the mouth. But can the nurses pull another patient from his bed and give it to this poor chap?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Seems like everyone here had some bad experiences with SGH. I would like to share mine as well.<br><br>My dad was down with Chronic Lung Cancer 10 years ago and bless his soul, he passed away peacefully 2 years back. We had the chance to "try" out both Mt. E as well as SGH.<br><br>During his fight with cancer, and when finances were not so drain, we admitted him into Mt. E everytime there is a bad relapse. The specialists there always ask this question, " Your dad is old and suffering. If he pass away, do you want us to do our utmost to resucitate him?" Our answer will always be yes! And it did happen a few times throughout the 8 years we "patronized" Mt. E. The Specialists are always less than 5 mins away from an emergency. Swear to God, I see the Dr running to the ICU when the nurse informed him that my dad "cannot make it".<br><br>Over at SGH, the story is totally different. My dad stopped breathing once at the dialysis centre. The nurses there stood and did nothing. I asked them "Aren't you going to revive my dad?" They actually told me that they need the dr to come and give the instructions to revive him!!! WTF! I told the nurses that if they do not do it immediately, I will F***King sue the whole hospital! Only after this "threat" did they try to revive him, luckily still on time. The Dr did come, (guess what?) 30 mins later!!! My dad would have finished his "heaven or hell" interview be then!<br><br>One of the consultant there told me later on that they have a undisclosed policy to provide the best medical care or ICU beds to young and fit patients. The older the patient, the less care he/she will be given! Walau, the way he made that statement sounded like we are in WW3 now.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Agree with what forumers have said &amp; experienced. The problems lies in the way the re-structured hospital are run. You have to find a way to beat the system when it doesn't serve you well. Here are a few xamples:<br><br>1) If you need to call for an ambulance for emergency, be prepared to be send to the nearest hospital even though your medical records &amp; your regular doctors are in another hospital. The ambulance will follow strictly to the procedures. THerefore, it is much faster if you call for a cab &amp; direct the cab to which hospital that you wanted to be admitted. For for medical emergency , call for mobile doctor .<br><br>2) Be prepared to wait  for up to 3 hours at A&amp;E, even if you have a fever &amp; think your condition will deteoriate fast. This is due to the long queue &amp; slow time taken for nurses to take the file &amp; examine you. Instead , if no surgery is required, just go straight to a GP whom you know can see you in the shortest time. THe quick examination will relieve you of your pain &amp; stress rather than be aggravated at A&amp;E during prolonged waiting. In fact , for $80 charges, A&amp; E is not worth it &amp; should be avoided as far as possible.<br><br>3) In cases of really life &amp; death situation, go straight to pte hosp when there is no wards available at restructured hospital. You will realise that  the whole process &amp; time taken to wait for the ward &amp; doctor to see you will not be worth the savings you get.<br><br>4) Even though, there is always the CT scan machine on standby 24 hrs , you should  know that it is not used according to when you want it. As such, ask to fix an apponitment early to get the scan before it is fully booked for 1 whole month.  Even then, be prepared to wait for at least a few hours for your turn.If this is the case , why not get a scan at another hospital that is available earlier. There is no diiference in which hospital you do the scanning.<br><br>5) Too many unpleasant experiences have taught us that even if you have fixed at an appoinment at 10.00am , you still may not get to see the doctor at 11.00am. Then your time with the doctor may last for just 5 mins. As such, if you think that your condition doesn't warrant to see a speciaist doctor, so be it. Go consult your own family doctor or recommended private specialist. It is your own decision that you have to make to cure your illness, not the doctors. They are not GOD . In fact, most of the time, they may not have your utmost interests in mind.<br><br>6) My final advice will be to go &amp; find out more about your own medical conditions rather than just rely everything what the doctors have said. THe doctors &amp; nurses may have their hand tight due to legal procedures &amp; the way the whole system works. What matters most is you should take ownership of your own life &amp; not just rely blindly on the advice of the doctors or nurses. They are looking at 90% of the cases but you may be the 10% that they have left out.<br></div>
