            <div class='col-md body'>Found this. Should be the one in Feb. Will look for the other one.<br><br>A Winning Formula,<br>"But we overdid it"<br>Ngiam Tong Dow talks about people, education and retirement in exclusive interview with Sunita Sue Leng, The Edge Singapore.<br>Feb 1, 2004<br><br>"I'm not saying I'm right all the time. But neither am I wrong at the time. I just want to raise the level of informed debate," says Ngiam Tong Dow.<br><br>If he had wanted to spark a debate, Ngiam's speech to the Economic Society of Singapore on Jan 15 did just that. And if letters to the newspapers and the follow-up commentaries are an indication, it shows his views continue to generate debate among Singaporeans.<br><br>From as far away as India where Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong was wrapping up a major business trip, the DPM also responded, saying, "He (Ngiam) feels he has latitude to express his views with less restraint than he's been accustomed to earlier, so good for him."<br><br>The ex-civil servant jolted the city-state by taking to task every major policy move over the last four decades - from land to transport, taxes, monetary and fiscal policy, housing, education, immigration and the Central Provident Fund (CPF).<br><br>In an interview with The Edge Singapore last Monday, the genial Ngiam spoke passionately, and in greater depth, on two issues closest to his heart - population and education.<br><br>When we met, Ngiam had read the reactions to his speech. His initial response? "On the whole, the reactions have been quite good."<br><br>He adds: "People should speak up. And serious debate should be done in a reasoned manner."<br><br>However, he stands firm by his suggestions that the CPF should be cut to 30% and that it should be fixed at that rate for the long term. The way he sees it, the CPF is a silver bullet adjustment to be used in extreme situations.<br><br>A fluctuating rate is bad for employers and also for government entities and planners.<br><br>Still, he says he likes DPM Lee's response [affirming there will be a range in CPF rates]. "It is cordial and informed. Public debate should be at that level," he adds.<br><br>The Edge Singapore: What are the burning policy issues for you? And why?<br><br>Ngiam: The most important issues for me are population and education. Those are the basis for any country's growth. In the 1960s, Singapore had high unemployment. Every time we passed a school at one o'clock, Goh Keng Swee [finance minister then] felt very depressed. He said, 'How am I going to find jobs for all these young people?' At the time, our population growth was very high, about 4%. So we introduced family planning, which was very successful.<br><br>And, by the mid-1970s, we had reached full employment and unemployment had fallen to 3% and below. But like all bureaucracies, we continued to penalise the third order of birth. What we didn't recognise was that as soon as women went out to work, the birth rate would fall naturally.<br><br>Is population size so critical? The Scandinavian countries, for example, have small populations and yet are so successful within the global economy.<br><br>When I was a young officer, we did studies on optimal population size. We looked at countries like Sweden, Norway, Switzerland and Israel. All those countries had about three, four, five million people. So we thought that was the magical figure. But what we didn't realise was that it was the quality of the population that matters. Yes, these countries have small populations but their education levels are very high.<br><br>So, when we talk about immigration in Singapore, we should not go for the numbers game. We have to go for quality. When we allow people into Singapore, we must make sure that the average level of education is higher than our average. It must add to the quality and not just the numbers. That means a selective immigration policy.<br><br>Today, knowledge is the great multiplier. Potential GDP is limited by land, labour and capital but in today's world, with knowledge you can multiply the land, labour and capital that you have. To do that, you need to educate your people. Every Singaporean should be educated up to A levels. Forty years ago, people didn't even have primary education. It is very difficult to re-train them now.<br><br>Some would say Singapore has achieved a high level of education.<br><br>I don't agree. I think we are too focused on producing scholars. We're very proud of our scholars, of course, but realistically, the country cannot move forward unless we have a large base of people who are well educated. As a former president of Matsushita Corp of Japan said to me, it is better to have a high plateau of people with a high average level of education than a few high peaks. In Japan, the aim was to increase the average level of education to senior high, which is equivalent to our A levels.<br><br>We produce lots of people with good grades but not many creative or entrepreneurial types. Why is that?<br><br>It's the focus on imperial scholars. The former Public Service Commission chairman, Tan Teck Chwee, used to say to me, if you want to be creative, you have to be immersed in one discipline, whether it is maths or music. You have to excel in that one subject, to have a real foundation in one discipline. When you're totally immersed in that subject, you can be very creative. For example, if you want to read philosophy, go ahead. But be very good in philosophy. In fact, you would study logic in philosophy and if you're good at it, I think you will be good at writing software programmes. Today, we are swinging from what was a very formatted education system to one which has more freedom but my message to our educationists is, please remember, content is also very important.<br><br>You also feel strongly about the CPF.<br><br>The CPF started off at 3% plus 3% in 1955 and it was meant for old age. And it was because the British government did not want to be responsible for the pension liabilities of its colonies. But along the way, the economy grew and real income was going up so fast. I would say we were too paternalistic as a government. We said instead of spending on consumer products and holidays, why don't you set aside more for your housing and your old age?<br><br>Unfortunately, we overdid the housing part. We allocated more and more to housing. At one stage, our rate was 45%. That was the peak. It was way too high. And housing could take as much as 25% to 30%. I would say you should not spend more than 20% of your income on rent.<br><br>In the early years, Singapore was very poor. Dr. Goh [Keng Swee] told the HDB chairman, 'Look, our household income is only S$400 a month. Even if you set aside 10% for housing, it's only S$40'. He said, 'I don't care what you do , but I'll contribute S$20. So build something which people can rent for S$40'. So that's how we ended up with the one-room flats in the early days. It was dim, poorly ventilated and smelly.<br><br>But we succeeded in housing the nation. However, as incomes rose and CPF contributions rose, the HDB built more than what was necessary. If you look at the population structure, there's no need to build more than three-room flats. There was also no need for a second bite of the cherry and a third bite. If you want to upgrade, you should pay for it out of your other income.<br><br>We thought we had a winning formula. But really, we overdid it.<br><br>Now that most of the population live in their own homes, isn't it time to refocus the CPF on retirement needs?<br><br>Yes. My proposal is 20% from the employee and 10% from the employer. Twenty per cent for your housing is not unreasonable. So the 10% is for old age. But if you want more for old age, which is the original purpose, something has got to give. Maybe the part allocated for housing should be cut to 15%. Then HDB should build flats which you can sell or rent for 15% of income. Why must you continue to build flats that take up 25% of income? When I became chairman of CPF, I immediately saw that we were asset-rich and cash-poor. The balances in the accounts are miserable.<br><br>Is it too late to reverse the policy?<br><br>No, it's not too late. We have to be quite tough. I would say, reduce the amount for housing and that for Medisave. So, both the HDB and the Ministry of Health will not be tempted to add on to their services beyond what people can pay. Whenever CPF went up, both these bodies rushed in to get their share of the pie.<br><br>We strayed form the straight and narrow path. CPF was started for old age. We should have stuck to that. But in all things when you're successful, you just carry on.<br><br>We were great optimists. We thought the GDP growth rate would go up in a straight line, 8% for the next 20 years. The 1997 financial crisis taught us a severe lesson. In fact, we should have learnt from the first crisis, in 1986. We cut CPF to 30% and we should have stuck there. But we raised it back. We did not learn the real lesson.<br><br>So the real challenge for the government today is how to reduce the amount for housing and Medisave and set aside more for old age. The old-age problem is already coming on. People of my generation are already retiring.<br><br>The Officer and Gentleman<br><br>Ngiam Tong Dow is presently Chairman of HDB Corp Pte Ltd. He has been a long-time insider of the government machinery, from the 1960s until as recently as last year.<br><br>Between October 1998 and June 2003, he was Chairman of the Housing Development Boards (HDB). Prior to that, he helmed the Economic Development Board (1975 to 1981) and later, the CPF Board (1998 to 2001).<br><br>He was also permanent secretary in several key government ministries, including the Ministry of Finance (1986 to 1999), the Prime Minister's office (1979 to 1994) and the Ministry of National Development (1987 to 1989).<br><br>Ngiam, 66, has two grown-up children. He scored a first-class honours in economics from the University of Malaya (in Singapore) back in 1959 and also has a Master of Public Administration from Harvard University.<br><br>(This exclusive interview was published in its Jan 26 edition.)<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>More Article. This one dated 23rd October 2003 - titled Singapore bigger than PAP.<br><br>S'pore 'bigger than PAP'.<br><br>By Susan Long.<br><br>Time to get off the autopilot, says a former civil servant<br><br>SINCE Mr Ngiam Tong Dow retired from the civil service in 1999, affairs of state have weighed heavily on his mind. The highly respected former Permanent Secretary worries about Singapore's long-term survival and the kind of society the next generation will inherit. At 66, the HDB Corp chairman insists he is 'no radical', just a concerned Singaporean with three grandchildren, who wonders 'whether there will be a Singapore for them in 50 years' time'. In Tea with Think, a weekly interview series, he gives a candid appraisal of the civil service, and his prognosis of what the lack of an alternative political leadership means for Singapore. The interview will be continued next week.<br><br>Q. With all this pessimism surrounding Singapore's prospects today, what's your personal prognosis? Will Singapore survive Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew?<br><br>A. Unequivocally yes, Singapore will survive SM Lee but provided he leaves the right legacy. What sort of legacy he wants to leave is for him to say, but I, a blooming upstart, dare to suggest to him that we should open up politically and allow talent to be spread throughout our society so that an alternative leadership can emerge. So far, the People's Action Party's tactic is to put all the scholars into the civil service because it believes the way to retain political power forever is to have a monopoly on talent. But in my view, that's a very short term view. It is the law of nature that all things must atrophy. Unless SM allows serious political challenges to emerge from the alternative elite out there, the incumbent elite will just coast along. At the first sign of a grassroots revolt, they will probably collapse just like the incumbent Progressive Party to the left-wing PAP onslaught in the late 1950s. I think our leaders have to accept that Singapore is larger than the PAP.<br><br>Q. What would be a useful first step in opening up?<br><br>A. For Singapore to survive, we should release half our talent - our President and Overseas Merit scholars - to the private sector. When ten scholars come home, five should turn to the right and join the public sector or the civil service; the other five should turn to the left and join the private sector. These scholars should serve their bond to Singapore - not to the Government - by working in or for Singapore overseas. As matters stand, those who wish to strike out have to break their bonds, pay a financial penalty and worse, be condemned as quitters. But it takes a certain temperament and mindset to be a civil servant. The former head of the civil service, Sim Kee Boon, once said that joining the administrative service is like entering a royal priesthood. Not all of us have the temperament to be priests. However upright a person is, the mandarin will in time begin to live a gilded life in a gilded cage. As a Permanent Secretary, I never had to worry whether I could pay my staff their wages. It was all provided for in the Budget. As chairman of DBS Bank, I worried about wages only 20 per cent of the time. I now face my greatest business challenge as chairman of HDB Corp, a new start-up spun off from HDB. I spend 90 per cent of my time worrying whether I have enough to pay my staff at the end of the month. It's a mental switch.<br><br>Q. What is your biggest worry about the civil service?<br><br>A. The greatest danger is we are flying on auto-pilot. What was once a great policy, we just carry on with more of the same, until reality intervenes. Take our industrial policy. At the beginning, it was the right thing for us to attract multinationals to Singapore. For some years now, I've been trying to tell everybody: 'Look, for God's sake, grow our own timber.' If we really want knowledge to be rooted in Singaporeans and based in Singapore, we have to support our SMEs. I'm not a supporter of SMEs just for the sake of more SMEs but we must grow our own roots. Creative Technology's Sim Wong Hoo is one and Hyflux's Olivia Lum is another but that's too few. We have been flying on auto-pilot for too long. The MNCs have contributed a lot to Singapore but they are totally unsentimental people. The moment you're uncompetitive, they just relocate.<br><br>Q. Why has this come about?<br><br>A. I suspect we have started to believe our own propaganda.<br><br>There is also a particular brand of Singapore elite arrogance creeping in. Some civil servants behave like they have a mandate from the emperor. We think we are little Lee Kuan Yews. SM Lee has earned his spurs, with his fine intellect and international standing. But even Lee Kuan Yew sometimes doesn't behave like Lee Kuan Yew. There is also a trend of intellectualisation for its own sake, which loses a sense of the pragmatic concerns of the larger world. The Chinese, for example, keep good archives of the Imperial examinations which used to be held at the Temple of Heaven. At the beginning, the scholars were tested on very practical subjects, such as how to control floods in their province. But over time, they were examined on the Confucian Analects and Chinese poetry composition. Hence, they became emasculated by the system, a worrying fate which could befall Singapore.<br><br>Q. But aren't you an exception to the norm of the gilded mandarin with zero bottomline consciousness?<br><br>A. That's because I started out with Economic Development Board in the 1959. Investment promotion then was all about hard foot slogging and personal persuasion, which teaches you to be very humble and patient. I learnt to be a supplicant and a professional beggar, instead of a dispenser of favours. These days, most civil servants start out administering the law. If I had my way, every administrative officer would start his or her career in the EDB. Hard foot slogging.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Part Two of same interview on 12Oct 2003<br><br>Stop dancing to the tune of the gorilla.<br><br>By Susan Long.<br><br>Part Two of the much-talked-about interview with ex-civil servant Ngiam Tong Dow<br><br>Q. YOUR idea of creating an alternate elite is not new. What do you think of the oft-mooted suggestion of achieving that splitting ranks within the People's Action Party?<br><br>A. Quite honestly, if you ask me, Team A-and-Team B is a synthetic and infantile idea.<br><br>If you want to challenge the Government, it must be spontaneous. You have to allow some of your best and brightest to remain outside your reach and let them grow spontaneously. How do you know their leadership will not be as good as yours? But if you monopolise all the talent, there will never be an alternative leadership. And alternatives are good for Singapore.<br><br>Q. In your calculation, what are the odds of this alternative replacing the incumbent?<br><br>A. Of course there's a political risk. Some of these chaps may turn out to be your real opposition, but that is the risk the PAP has to take if it really wants Singapore to endure.<br><br>A model we should work towards is the French model of the elite administration. The very brightest of France all go to university or college. Some emerge Socialists, others Conservative, some work in industries, some work in government. Yet, at the end of the day, when the chips are down, they are all Frenchmen. No member of the French elite will ever think of betraying his country, never. That is the sort of Singapore elite we want. It doesn't mean that all of us must belong to the PAP. That is very important.<br><br>Q. What do bad times mean for the PAP, which has based its legitimacy on providing the economic goods and asset enhancement? Is its social compact with the people in need of an update?<br><br>A. Oh yes. And my advice is: Go back to Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew's old credo, where nobody owes us a living. After I had just taken over as the Housing Board's chairman in 2000, an astute academic asked me: 'Tong Dow, what's your greatest problem at HDB?' Then he diagnosed it himself: 'Initially, you gave peanuts to monkeys so they would dance to your tune. Now you've given them so much by way of peanuts that the monkey has become a gorilla and you have to dance to its tune. That's your greatest problem.' Our people have become over-fed and today's economic realities mean we have to put them on a crash diet. We cannot starve them because there will be a political explosion. So the art of government today is to wean everyone off the dispensable items. We should just concentrate on helping the poorest 5 to 10 per cent of the population, instead of handing out a general largesse. Forget about asset enhancement, Singapore shares and utility rebates. You're dancing to the tune of the gorilla. I don't understand the urgency of raising the Goods and Services Tax. Why tax the lower-income, then return it to them in an aid package? It demeans human dignity and creates a growing supplicant class who habitually hold out their palms. Despite the fact that we say we are not a welfare state, we act like one of the most 'welfarish' states in the world. We should appeal instead to people's sense of pride and self-reliance. I think political courage is needed here. And my instinct is that the Singaporean will respect you for that.<br><br>Q. So what should this new compact consist of?<br><br>A. It should go back to what was originally promised: 'That you shall be given the best education, whether it be academic or vocational, according to your maximum potential.'<br><br>And there will be no judgment whether an engineer is better than a doctor or a chef.<br><br>My late mother was a great woman. Although illiterate, she single-handedly brought up four boys and a girl. She used to say in Hainanese: 'If you have one talent which you excel in, you will never starve.' I think the best legacy to leave is education and equal opportunity for all. When the Hainanese community came to Singapore, they were the latest arrivals and the smallest in number. So they had no choice but to become humble houseboys, waiters and cooks. But they always wanted their sons to have a better life than themselves. The great thing about Singapore was that we could get an education, which gave us mobility, despite coming from the poorest families. Today, the Hainanese, as a dialect group, form proportionately the highest number of professionals in Singapore.<br><br>Q. You say focus on education. What is top of your wishlist for re-making Singapore's education system?<br><br>A. Each year, the PSLE creams off all the top boys and girls and dispatches them to only two schools, Raffles Institution and Raffles Girls' School. However good these schools are, the problem is you are educating your elite in only two institutions, with only two sets of mentors, and casting them in more or less the same mould. It worries me that Singapore is only about 'one brand' because you never know what challenges lie ahead and where they will come from. I think we should spread out our best and brightest to at least a dozen schools.<br><br>Q. You advocate a more inclusive mindset all around?<br><br>A. Yes, intellectually, everyone has to accept that the country of Singapore is larger than the PAP. But even larger than the country of Singapore, which is limited by size and population, is the nation of Singapore, which includes a diaspora. My view is that we should have a more inclusive approach to nation-building. We have started the Majulah Connection, an international network where every Singaporean - whether he is a citizen or not, so long as he feels for Singapore - is included as part of our diaspora. Similarly, we should include foreigners who have worked and thrived here as friends of Singapore. That's the only way to survive. Otherwise, its just four million people on a little red dot of 600 sq km. If you exclude people, you become smaller and smaller, and in the end, you'll disappear.<br><br>Q. What is the kind of Singapore you hope your grandchildren will inherit?<br><br>A. Let's look at Sparta and Athens, two city states in Greek history. Singapore is like Sparta, where the top students are taken away from their parents as children and educated. Cohort by cohort, they each select their own leadership, ultimately electing their own Philosopher King. When I first read Plato's Republic, I was totally dazzled by the great logic of this organisational model where the best selects the best. But when I reached the end of the book, it dawned on me that though the starting point was meritocracy, the end result was dictatorship and elitism. In the end, that was how Sparta crumbled. Yet, Athens, a city of philosophers known for its different schools of thought, survived. What does this tell us about out-of-bounds markers? So SM Lee has to think very hard what legacy he wants to leave for Singapore and the type of society he wants to leave behind. Is it to be a Sparta, a well-organised martial society, but in the end, very brittle; or an untidy Athens which survived because of its diversity of thinking? Personally, I believe that Singaporeans are not so kuai (Hokkien for obedient) as to become a Sparta. This is our saving grace. As a young senior citizen, I very much hope that Singapore will survive for a long time, but as an Athens. It is more interesting and worth living and dying for.<br></div>

When there is a gap between one's real and one's declared aims, one turns as it were instinctively to long words and exhausted idioms, like a cuttlefish squirting out ink.</strong><br><br>George Orwell was thinking of political discourse in particular when he wrote these lines, as evidenced by the title that he gave to the essay in which they appear "Politics and the English Language" ( 1946 ).<br><br>Orwell suggested six rules to improve one's writing :<br><br>1 Never use a metaphor, simile or other figure of speech which you are used to seeing in print.<br>2 Never used a long word when a short one will do.<br>3 If it is possible to cut a word out, always cut it out.<br>4 Never use the passive when you can use the active.<br>5 Never use a foreign phrase, a scientific word, or jargon word if you can think of an everyday English equivalent.<br>6 Break any of these rules sooner than say anything outright barbarous.</div>
