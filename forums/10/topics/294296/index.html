From there, he was moved to Changi General Hospital's intensive care ward. He died last Saturday.<br>.<br>The Air Force School trainee, who held the rank of corporal, was given a full military burial yesterday.<br>.<br>Ministry of Defence (Mindef) spokesman Colonel Darius Lim said the ministry was investigating CPL Liu's death.<br>.<br>He said Mindef and the Singapore Armed Forces were providing assistance to the family.<br>.<br>CPL Liu's elder sister Yu Jun told Today that her brother had no known history of medical illness. As the youngest in the family, he was a popular figure. He was also "very active" at Temasek Polytechnic.<br>.<br>She said the family was struggling to come to terms with the loss as CPL Liu was close to their parents.<br>.<br>"He was always cheerful and would crack jokes to cheer us up," said Ms Liu.<br>.<br>His death is not the first such incident this year in which people collapsed while exercising.<br>.<br>In June, a 58-year-old defence executive officer died after a run on a treadmill at Gombak Camp.<br>.<br>In February, a second-year junior college student collapsed during the last 100m of a 2.4km run. She was taken to hospital but died that same day.<br><br></div>
