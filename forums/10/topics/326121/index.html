              <p>Channel NewsAsia - <span>Saturday, August 2</span></p>
              <p><span>
              </span></p><p class="first">SINGAPORE: Singaporeans should support a new political party if the ruling People’s Action Party (PAP) is no longer the best vehicle to take the country forward, said Foreign Affairs Minister George Yeo.</p>
              <p>Mr Yeo was speaking to students at a dialogue session at the Singapore Polytechnic on Friday.</p>
              <p>They discussed issues such as inducting talent into politics and how the ruling party aims to win the votes of younger Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>On that, Mr Yeo said the people must be clear about what they hope to see in the future, before they decide on which party to support.</p>
              <p>The foreign minister was also asked if the PAP is confident of winning back the opposition—held ward of Hougang in the next election.</p>
              <p>Mr Yeo answered: "We should be quietly confident, but never take the voters for granted, and to work hard to serve them.</p>
              <p>"The PAP must always have that spirit to want to serve the people of Hougang, believing that we can do better for them if we are in charge. That must always be our spirit, but of course, it’s for the people there to decide."</p>
              <p>================================================</p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Why so desperate to win HOugang?  </span></p>
              <p></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff6600;">Singaporeans should support a new political party if the ruling People’s Action Party (PAP) is no longer the best vehicle to take the country forward, said Foreign Affairs Minister George Yeo.   ---    </span><span style="color: #000000;">I am afraid to say that majority of the Singaporeans have lost trust in the PAP.    We are tired of having a self serving party to rule Singapore.  The best is yet to be.    There are younger Singaporeans who know that PAP is not having the best interest of the Singaporeans at heart.    Many don't have intention to stay here for they have no trust in the present gahmen.   </span></p>

              <p>M13, to be fair, the investments part can be taken out.</p>
              <p>Rising inflation can still be probably explained away. So can medical costs.</p>
              <p>What is most unacceptable is that they say they have to raise taxes here and there, fares here and there, in a period of economic uncertainty, and when the unemployment rate is slowly rising. 1.7% to 2.0% in March and 2.3% recently. Low, but steadily increasing...</p>
