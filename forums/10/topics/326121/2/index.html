              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Not tax and money the PAP is after. Would they be that stupid? </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Just cream off, by say X%, on the return of our reserve can made them richer than increasing GDP. And we, the citizens, don't even know the exact reserve to begin with.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">All this years, the PAP has been facing a slow but steady declining support base. By bringing in the foreigners, this will increase the support base of the PAP. At least, let this be a temporary or a last ditch measure to hold the tide of change. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Now I know some people will accuse me of generalising. But hold a second. At another posting, someone accused me being naive. Yes, the foreigners can also vote against the PAP - no doubt about this. But we are talking about trend and prediction, not individual reaction.<br><br>Who are these foreigners that come to our shores? <span> </span>Using a scale of one to four where I would classify one being as follows: The highly sort after scholar plus enterprenuer.<br><br>Are they anywhere near the scale of one? Are they the Bill Gate of Microsoft or anywhere close to an entrepreneur, not to mention the highly sort after scholar/entrepreneur that the world is after? The answer is no. All of your can see for yourselves, I need not go into this. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Most of them are from regional countries where the standard of living is poorer and the quality of life is also poorer. Singapore is a paradise to them where they can earn more, have better quality of life and enjoy richer standard of living. Singapore also allows them to plug into a first rate, readily-made infrastructure and first-class technology. <br><br>They have the best of both third and first worlds. They can save more, enjoy better quality of life compare to working back home and they enjoy labour/skill/wealth mobility that their poorer fellow countrymen can only dream about. <span> </span><span> </span><br><br>If<span> </span>they become citizens, would they not be grateful to their host country?<span>  </span>And vote for status quo? </span></p>
