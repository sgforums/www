              <p>Being a very young country like Singapore, it may not be ideal to have complete democracy like the Australians and Americans... they have that for hundreds of years and perfected it among its people. we on the other hand will only celebrate our independence of 43 years...</p>
              <p>i am all supportive of having another political party to "check" on the power of the government. i believe that absolute power do corrupt but at the same time, we need to find VERY CAPABLE people to lead the opposition. we need men that are swift and cultured with their words. we need "gentlemen" to interact to the government. For in LKY's own words, "come to us like a gentleman and we'll treat you like a gentleman. come to us like a barbarian and we'll treat you like a barbarian."</p>
              <p>i have nothing against Dr. Chee but if the report of him shouting at the top of his voice at Mr. Goh during pre-voting campaign is true. i can't see having him at the helm of my government. for example when we serve our NS, more than often the person higher than our rank is not someone we like or can get along with but we still have to respect his rank. "you don't have to respect me, but you have to respect my rank". sounds familiar? Dr. Chee had to respect Mr. Goh's position at least. if i remember correctly, he was still Prime Minister then... even not, a Senior Minister...</p>
              <p>conclusion; to really have the power to "check" our government, we need real capable men who knows how to manipulate to their favour in our complex political system but how many is really interested to get involve with politics?</p>

              <p>Being a very young country like Singapore, it may not be ideal
              to have complete democracy like the Australians and Americans...
              they have that for hundreds of years and perfected it among its
              people. we on the other hand will only celebrate our independence
              of 43 years...</p>
              <p>i am all supportive of having another political party to "check"
              on the power of the government. i believe that absolute power do
              corrupt but at the same time, we need to find VERY
              CAPABLE people to lead the opposition. we need men that are
              swift and cultured with their words. we need "gentlemen"
              to interact to the government. For in LKY's own words, "come
              to us like a gentleman and we'll treat you like a gentleman. come
              to us like a barbarian and we'll treat you like a barbarian."</p>
              <p>i have nothing against Dr. Chee but if the report of him
              shouting at the top of his voice at Mr. Goh during pre-voting
              campaign is true. i can't see having him at the helm of my
              government. for example when we serve our NS, more than
              often the person higher than our rank is not someone we like
              or can get along with but we still have to respect his rank. "you
              don't have to respect me, but you have to respect my rank". sounds
              familiar? Dr. Chee had to respect Mr. Goh's position at least. if i
              remember correctly, he was still Prime Minister then... even not, a
              Senior Minister...</p>
              <p>conclusion; to really have the power to "check" our government,
              we need real capable men who knows how to manipulate to their
              favour in our complex political system but how many is
              really interested to get involve with politics?</p>
