It is not what we really needed.<br>Why should be need to pay so much to use such services. The govt should look into it that going cashless should not add burden to its citizen. Already everything in Singapore is going up,up,up!!!!. People is finding it tough to cope with living expenses. So if nets chose to increase, I will give up and pay by cash. [/quote]<br><br>Citizens must cope with whatever they earn.<br><br>So the basics like housing, clothing, 3 meals a day and transportation should be provided for the citizens from the taxes they already pay without profiteering of any kind by the government.<br><br>If the government recovers any costs of such provisions of basic services to the people, then taxes should be corresponding reduced so as not to over-tax on both front and back ends.<br><br>Now the whole system of government is taxing and recovering the fullest possible costs through creative accounting on lands and GLCs.<br><br>This is uncaring government which leads to over-taxing or double-taxing and should be changed. Any attempts to change such a system of government so far?<br><br>What happen to the talents of so many scholars employed in government and public service? Why do they fail to understand such a simple logic about taxation, and provisions of basic services?<br><br>Are they only interested in their own promotions or careers that they are keeping quiet about such a basic good corporate governance?<br><br>Over and above such basics, until the basic services to the people as mentioned in the foregoing are fully and effectively satisfied government should not touch citizens' taxes to use them on unessential like E-services, NETS, world's firsts or number on.<br><br>So it is wrong to recover more monies i.e. indirect taxes from ordinary citizens by charging higher NETS fees where basics are concerned as they cannot even pay for utilities, housing and transportation which currently are being provided by the government which are over-priced taking into consideration costs recovery and original land costs which were already paid by citizens.<br><br>We are running not just a corporate government. We are having a government which tries ways and means of squeezing monies and more monies from the hapless citizens using legalistic wrangling and powers to do so.<br><br>The above-stated are the main issues affecting citizens and all are hoping the Straits Times, Dr. Tony Tan and the post-65s will be able to see through the hypocrisy of such a system and go for effective and real change.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>Right from Day One when NETS was introduced, I never used it. I either pay in cash or Credit Card. In fact, I find NETS rather inconvenient; while queing in line to pay for petrol I often wait longer because the person in front is paying by NETS. A cash transaction is faster, because often NETS transactions gets delayed because line was busy.<br><br>To me, it is just another medium through which our gov makes more money for themselves. And a lot of people out there, just dumbly follow... I think of Pied Piper and the hoards of mice following behind him...<br><br></div>
