            <div class='col-md body'>True enough, that is one of the perspectives of Singapore and I can agree with it. Singapore is so small world, most Singaporeans could only indulge in the so-called materialistic world. There is "softer and lighter" side of Singapore to be discovered though.<br><br>Perhaps what she have discover was sadly, the bad-side of Singapore. But sadly, this is the current plan of how such a small island nation state like us is going to survive in this big, big world.<br><br>I know South Africa has definitely more better things to be discovered. If Singaporeans sees this article by Melissa Tan. They will definitely defend Singapore.<br><br>One thing to note is that most Singaporeans are born here, in this small world where "survival" is vitally link to an individual contribution to the nation, in return, the nation survives by economical terms, and it returns global survival to its people.<br><br>Our soul is nationalism.<br><br>Singaporeans are after all, mostly city people. Not countryside farmers or villagers. City people tend to be more colder. Especially in a place where urban survival is fully enforced by meritocracy.<br><br>Breaking it down to explain. Here is what I can explain for what the South African writer , Ms Davids, expressed:<br><br><blockquote>The following is an article from The New Papers. I find the views of this African writer, rather frank, and most accurate.<br><br>South African writer's criticism which sparked debate S'pore is Soulless, money-faced<br>By Melissa Tan<br><br>THE South African journalist who called Singaporeans soulless and materialistic insists her view of our country is valid.<br><br>Ms Nashira Davids from the Sunday Times in South Africa arrived in Singapore in March for the launch of the Uniquely Singapore brand.<br><br>Her article, 'Third World Order', had sparked off a heated debate in The Straits Times Forum Pages.<br><br>In an e-mail to The New Paper on Sunday, Ms Davids told us it was her first trip to Singapore and the trip lasted less than a week.<br><br>She said that, before the trip, she had only good feedback from friends and colleagues who visited the country.<br><br>Was her stay was long enough to form such an impression of Singapore?<br><br>'How long should one remain in the country to form an impression?' she asked.<br><br>We told her about the letters to The Straits Times forum which her article had prompted.<br><br>She replied: 'I was invited to the country to write about my experiences.<br><br>'That is exactly what I did and I stand by what I wrote.<br><br>'I have the right to write as honestly as possible and that (the article) was my honest experience of the country.'<br><br>In the article, she said she felt that Singaporeans 'have traded everything for money'.<br><br>In its transition from Third World status, 'Singapore has lost its soul', she wrote.<br><br>Hoping to visit local street bazaars, she said that her visit to Ngee Ann City had 'left her uninspired'.<br><br><strong>Eiizumi's Analysis&gt;&gt;&gt; Now, hoping to visit local bazaars... Singapore has got few, but still available bazaars. Who ask her to go visit Ngee Ann City? If she want local bazaars, maybe she should make some effort to find some locals or best, tour guides to introduce her her local bazaars.</strong><br><br>The young people were likened to Asian versions of Britney Spears and David Beckham.<br><br><strong>Eiizumi's Analysis&gt;&gt;&gt; Not true. Singaporean are the most Americanised Asians in Asia. For the above examples of characters, they're British.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> </strong><br><br>She also recalled an incident where she asked a local for directions in a shopping mall.<br><br>A 'well-groomed, power-dressed woman' declined to help her out.<br><br><strong>Eiizumi's Analysis&gt;&gt;&gt; One thing to make sure, is the the local she asked "a local" at all? Though there are European races who are Singaporeans, not all "ang mohs" are Singaporeans. Neither she says what race was the local. Worst, not necessary every Singaporean could speak English.<br><br>If she said it was a 'well-groomed, power-dressed woman'. Then, the person could be a typical materialistic woman. If she ask me, I think I could give her some directions, and now I tell her, she's just unlucky to ask the wrong people.<br><br>Time wise, maybe the time she ask the person was weekdays' 1pm (after lunch-time). People are rushing back to their officesafter their lunchtime shopping.</strong><br><br>To which Ms Davids said in her article: 'A courtesy campaign has even been implemented to add new expressions such as - a smile to unanimated faces.'<br><br><strong>Eiizumi's Analysis&gt;&gt;&gt; Facing work everyday, (like I say, maybe its the working weekdays, worst, may be Monday blues) how can we smile? People will think that person gila or crazy lah. Perhaps the woman period leh? </strong><br><br>She mentioned a spiky-haired blonde man in a performance, saying that we ought to stop behaving 'yellow on the outside and white on the inside'.<br><br><strong>Eiizumi's Analysis&gt;&gt;&gt; Is it against any fashionable law that we can't coloured our hair and act like any ridiculous punk in the west? After all, I said we're pretty Americanised.</strong><br><br>She griped about the lack of 'Malay and Chinese house shops', the 'colourful street markets' and even 'traditional music'.<br><br><strong>Eiizumi's Analysis&gt;&gt;&gt; People no need to work is it? It is pretty hard to earn wages in tourism and arts in Singapore leh. Go Kampong Glam, Chinatown and Little India to check it out lah. There's something called "Tourist Guide" leh.</strong><br><br>She found only skyscrapers and shopping malls.<br><br><strong>Eiizumi's Analysis&gt;&gt;&gt; Ah... That's the problem, she haven't discover the true way of life in Singapore, of what and how most Singaporeans are living. Get out of town to check it out! Duh!</strong><br><br>However, she said she was impressed with Katong Antique House and our variety of food.<br><br>She also mentioned the Merlion guarding the entrance to the Singapore River, but 'sadly, it could not guard against the drive for money and power in this little island'.<br><br><strong>Eiizumi's Analysis&gt;&gt;&gt; No drive for money and power? The we eat what? Eat wind ah?! Power? How can a modern city work without power? It is the real world man! At least our Merlion isn't puking blood!</strong><br><br>She came to the conclusion that Singapore was 'truly unique - but for all the wrong reasons'. </blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>What she seen was only a small portion of what Singapore represents, as a word of fairness, this is not fair at all. In one week, all she visited were places like Ngee Ann City!? With all due respect, she may be a well to do journalist, but she is a very bad tourist that wanders along city area (probably refusing tourist guides so that she can see local life for herself) and hoping to see traditional dances and dresses in such places.<br><br>There are so many places she could have been, things could have seen, matters could be involved in, yet her choices were clearly limited by her shortsightedness.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually are not all cosmopolitan cities almost the same?<br><br>We are certainly westernised, that is for sure (which explains the britney and beckham). what perhaps she did not find ( and what we as singaporeans did not show too much) was a unique cultural identity that we are all proud of, which was why she made her comment on people being bananas.<br><br>she was looking for indian and malay food - something that she could not find in her native south africa. Chinese food is everywhere in the world, so it is certainly not unique. Even Indian takeways are so common in London. I dont think any English or american tourist would be very impressed with the chinese food here, even though the variety may be greater here.<br><br>I guess her experience with the asking of directions was just plain unfortunate. Most singaporeans i believe are friendly and receptive to people who needs help, whether they are tourists or not.<br><br>No bazaars? she prob did not know where the pasar malams are, it is not so usual to find pasar malams in the city, most are in the HDB heartlands, she was just misinformed or just had no opportunity to be informed about it.<br><br>Give her credit - she only stayed a week. how much can she experience? she did not see everything. what she saw was a souless city, and i agree with the point that the economic perogative of survival and making ends meet is really too dominant in SG. It is not helped by the fact that our economy has not done too well of late.<br><br>While she did not exactly capture a very nice picture of singapore, but wont this be the image that most tourists (assuming that the writer is the ordinary tourist) will see and experience? she painted a very good and accurate picture of Singaporeans' mentality (souless and money minded), from a tourist's point of view. Is this what we want our tourists to feel, that singaporeans are no different from the people of any other ordinary big city? But unfortunately, that is the reality.<br><br>I guess that when the tourism board want to promote SG as being unique, they are thinking of the food, the asian cultures and possibly all the physical or tangible things that are culturally unique to singapore. What the tourism board cannot control are all the intangibles - like the language the people use, attitudes of its people etc. The writer chose, i guess, to focus on the intangibles. And u know - she is not too far off from reality.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Souless? I don't agree! But materialistic. That I do. The thing is that it has to do with the environment. Lets face the fact eh! Singapore is only a very small country with little resources and limited space. If you are not economically usable you will be pushed out of the picture entirely. The only solution is if you migrate to other countries where the cost of a land is cheaper. Frankly speaking, I personally find it hard to be rooted here even if I was born here. Cause I don't even have a piece of land to call my own <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree with the fact that the South African writer is judging us too much on the surface. 1 week is barely enough to get to know Singapore...<br><br>On the other hand, she is definitely right in some ways, in that we are losing our culture. I'm not saying us having to put on cheongsams and sarongs all day long, blah blah blah, but we really are too Westernised....as a whole, Singaporeans place Western lifestyle so much higher than their own......things like hatred of own mother tongue and giving reasons such as "if america can have bar-top dancing why can't we?" makes it rather obvious</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree with her to a semi-large extent. Singapore is very materialistic because you have a culture where by younglings are encouraged to **** others to get on top and get good grades so u can get a job and earn big big moneyyy. THe administration also adds onto this materialistic competitive effect with its policies and preferences, the fast-paced lifestyle also contributes to this materialistic effect as well.<br><br>In being totallly materialistic, Singapore becomes kinda soulless, when hectic lifestyles erupts itself in a lack of grace to give directions. I myself have seen many instances of un-graceful behaviour in local people. However i believe singapore is a little soulless because of the materialistic bs i have been talking about. She also mentioned the courtesy campaign thingy haha! What i have done before as well, i mean, something is wrong if a government must "encourage its people to SMILE".<br><br>But about this knocking of yellow outside white inside thing, she is doing what i used to do, knocking asian people for embracing western fashion via globalisation, even though some asians WANT to be white (i refer to a poll ages ago whereby Singaporeans would rather be of another race; caucasian or jap). But then again that's the way the world is, there are many "bananas everyWHERE", and why is that necessarily wrong? Its simply people renouncing their former ways of life and embracing something they believe it worth while, so what? She still got to eat local spicy food so what is the big deal?<br><br>I disagree with her sayin Singapore has lost its SOUL, what the heck does she mean by SOUL? A soul of a country is forever existent, even when the country is nuked.<br><br>I wouldn't give a big deal about the narrow short-lived experience of a journalist who comes from a country full of apartheid and racism.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>mixed feeling, tend to agree on some of the writer point.<br>singaporean are indeed materialistic and prolly all chinese has lost it cultural roots. chinese new year treated like a holiday with basically no festive moods. worse for dragon boat and mooncake festival. chinese no longer like to study chinese but speak better english than chinese. we discriminate own china chinese but look up to westerners. are we lost??<br>prolly not totally our fault but our society and leaders of our country mould us to be what we are today.<br>when i go HK/Japan/Thailand, i feel differently. they really enjoy your traditional festive season very much.<br>what happen to us??<br>dont blame the size of our country for not able to keep historical building/monuments. the old national library doesnt took up so much space only to be torn down be replace by the new uni campus.<br>dont blame for writer, she deserve her opinion of Singapore. anyway, dint we invite her to write about us?</div>
