Conventional wisdom holds that international capital markets adjusted automatically and remarkably well: Enormous amounts of money flowed into oil-rich states, and efficient markets then placed that new money in cash-poor Third World economies. This massive reallocation of wealth is labeled petrodollar recycling."--BOOK JACKET. "David Spiro has followed the money trail, and the story he tells, based on interviews and a painstaking accumulation of fragmentary evidence, contradicts the accepted beliefs both in the particulars and in broad outline. Most of the sudden flush of new oil wealth did not go to poor oil-importing countries around the globe. Instead the United States made a deal with Saudi Arabia to sell it U.S. securities in secret, a deal resulting in a substantial portion of Saudi assets being held by the U.S. government. With this arrangement, the U.S. government violated its agreements with allies in the developed world. Spiro argues that American policy makers took this action to prop up otherwise intolerable levels of U.S. public debt. In effect, recycled OPEC wealth subsidized the debt-happy policies of the U.S. government as well as the debt-happy consumerism of its citizenry."--BOOK JACKET.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br></div>

Look at the data published by the Federal Reserve.  Most of the Treasury debt issued in the past few years have been purchased by Asian central banks, with those of Japan and China being the largest buyers.<br><br>The Saudis can no longer play this game because they have massive problems of their own, including a rapidly growing population that is largely young and unemployed, and thus open to exploitation by extremists.

They make up less than 5% of world population but consumes more than 20% of the the world's oil production.
