However, I have very little respect for people who can't be at least a little more considerate when it comes to dealing with people who are against their stand. I may not agree with oxford mushroom's pro-PAP stance, but at least I can show him some respect for not resorting to the prolific use of insults and name calling unlike a certain Salman we all know.<br><br>I also find it highly ludicrous that the PAP would be promoting racial harmony in its agenda but the Young PAP can't even seem to moderate their own forums well and let racial bigotry run loose in those forums. People have been jailed for putting similar postings in other forums. So what kind of image is the Young PAP forums going to have - that it is a safe haven for all racial bigots? If any of those bigots are gonna be the future leaders of my children, I'm gonna jump ship. My kids deserve far better than that.<br><br>In sgforums, any racial-sensitive threads are closely watched and when things get out of hand, the moderators move in and take any remedial action which they deem necessary (warn any offenders, close the thread, etc...). The recent thread on the treatment of Malays in the SAF was a pretty good demonstration of this. The moderators shut the place down when they decided that it was getting out of hand.<br><br>If the Young PAP forummites are supposed to be the future leaders of our country, then I expect them to have a minimum standard in terms of ethics - be it in the papers, on the street, or online. Even if it wasn't them who placed all those bigoted postings, the very least they could have done was to moderate the forum better.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>These Young PAP forummites are arrogant &amp; souless people who are mere robots filled with data. They are useful only to the extent that they fit into various slots in society. I fear for the future of Singapore if they going to be invited to be MPs &amp; leaders. Knowledge itself is a neutral tool that can be used for good or evil. As history sadly proves, educated minsters can wreak far greater horror than their unschooled brothers. At least, 7 of the participants at the Wannsee Conference where the Nazis planned the 'final solution' - extermination - to the 'Jewish problem', had doctoral degrees. It is far too risky to leave Singapore's future in the hands of politicians. People must be wise &amp; take action themselves to create peace.</div>
