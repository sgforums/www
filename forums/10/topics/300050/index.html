Now picture about twice that number of new workers entering the labour force every year.<br><br>That's what China sees.<br><br>Twenty-four million people hunt for jobs annually when there are only 12 million jobs up for grabs.<br><br>Imagine what people hungry for work would do to get and keep a job.<br><br>They can easily fill job fairs to the roof, tighter than sardines in a can, as the pictures show.<br><br>Tens of thousands of job seekers, jostling with resumes, willing to accept any terms to get a foot in the door.<br><br>This is what's happening in China, the world's most populous nation with 1.3 billion people.<br><br>Every year, job fairs attract thousands of rural Chinese flocking there for jobs.<br><br>This year's targeted registered unemployment rate has been set at 4.6per cent, up from last year's 4.1 per cent.<br><br>But economists believe the real set of figures could be twice as high as a large number of the unemployed are unregistered.<br><br>A record five million university students will graduate this year but nearly a third are unlikely to find jobs, adding to the swelling pool of unemployed graduates.<br><br>Factor in inflation and it's clear why there is a need to slow down an overheated economy.<br><br>And it can mean only one thing - fewer jobs to go around.<br><br>With such a drastic lack of jobs, thousands of Chinese have no choice but to find work overseas. Chinese officials have also talked about creating migrant workers to ease the unemployment problem at home.<br><br>TALE OF ANOTHER CITY<br><br>The job situation is very different here.<br><br>Today, the unemployment rate stands at 1.7 per cent, a level last seen nearly 10 years ago, before the Asian financial crisis. Job creations are also at a high.<br><br>But still, many jobs can't be filled. That's why the nation needs an army of foreign workers.<br><br>Yet, many Singaporeans do not welcome foreigners working here.<br><br>MP Ho Geok Choo, who is also president of the Singapore Human Resources Institute, said: 'Singaporeans lament competition in the job market. But other countries also face competition for jobs, probably even in a worse way.<br><br>'I'm sure the Chinese face competition from workers from Hong Kong, Taiwan and even Singapore.'<br><br>'We should count our blessings.'<br><br>LABOUR MISMATCH<br><br>In this booming economy and tight labour market, employers find themselves in a dilemma.<br><br>First, there are jobs with specific skills needed, but not enough local talent.<br><br>Madam Ho said: 'It's not a situation where if Singaporeans are prepared to take the job, they'll get it because these are jobs with specific skills.'<br><br>Mr Victor Lai, assistant vice-president of job-search firm Joshua Consulting Group, agreed.<br><br>'In high-growth industries like banking and finance, oil and gas and the biomedical sector, there's a shortage of talent because the job demands can't be fulfilled by locals.'<br><br>Secondly, there are jobs with less-specific skills, but Singaporean job hunters are reluctant to take them.<br><br>Mr Lai noted: 'These are more generic jobs or temporary, part-time or contract jobs.<br><br>'The employers may not be able to offer competitive salaries, or the (job seeker) may not want the job because of reasons like remote locations or because they want permanent positions.<br><br>'Since the job market is good, he or she does not have to take the job.'<br><br>So who do employers turn to?<br><br>Foreigners are the obvious choices.<br><br>But then Singaporeans grumble and accuse them of snatching our rice bowls.<br><br>Mr Lai said: 'The Government has made it clear they want to expand the population to 6.5 million. To do that, it has to create jobs.'<br><br>Even with more jobs, there will still be keen competition for the good ones. Are we ready for the competition?<br></div>
