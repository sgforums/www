            <div class='col-md body'>haha, I was actually quite shocked when my History teacher told me that Singapore is NOT a democracy. I argued with her for quite a while about me, but then, it kinda struck me. It isn't. It's run like a dictatorship.<br>If there's one thing I think Singapore should have, it would be more freedom. It's not a matter of who the leaders are. How much power they entitle the people with is a better question.<br>There have been some pretty bizarre arrests in Singapore before and there have been and still are some very strict laws concerning opposition.<br>I think it's time that the government stops thinking about itself and starts thinking about the people. It's time its decisions are made for the people's good, as opposed to their own good.<br>Singaporeans should be given more freedom.</div>

Have they explore and explore all treatments? Have they done enough review or because it is simply a 1 party system and New blood required to inject alternative view into the parliamentary system? Do we need to reform our Ministry and parliamentary to have a mechanism to create solution?<br><br>4) PAP perception and its role in governing Singapore?Â– With PAP in the 3rd generation of leadership has national building change? Survival of national truly question while we move ahead to build the nation have we forgot why we built the nation in the first place? What is the mission of PAP? What role it perceives itself to believe they are truly here to work for Singaporean and not people work for PAP<br></div>

That's no different from suggesting pitting an average joe against Maurice Greene in a 100m sprint - with Greene given a further headstart by starting at the 50m mark. That, in essence, is the sort of suggestion you're putting forth - try telling me you'd back the average joe to upset the odds...<br><br>Coalition governments are commonplace in just about every first world countriy and true democracy. If nothing, it at least serves the fundamental check-and-balance process which is so critical to sustaining a democratic constitution. If voting for inept opposition - especially in a situation where they are not even coming anywhere close to forming their own government with a majority - is akin to shooting yourself in the foot, keep the tyrants in power then and accept the status quo of not having checks-and-balances. Perhaps, it might even be worthwhile paying multi-million dollar paychecks to such "capable" leaders who have yet to even prove their mettle of being able to run coalition governments...</div>

Just as you're entitled to regard many in this forum as "all-talk-and-no-action", that's your prerogative.<br><br>Look, it's not hard for the criminals to justify anything at all - even if they decide to legalise rape and murder tomorrow, it still wouldn't be frowned upon by everyone (at least, not rapists and murderers).

That way, you're actually making strides towards eradicating global poverty and not just alleviating the predicaments confronting the "less fortunate"! No doubt what you're doing would help make some people's lives more bearable, but just how productive is such help? For how long can you help others? It just ain't a worthy pursuit in my view. Afterall, isn't giving money to a gambler to pay off his debts also a form of help?<br><br>To take this argument further, there're tonnes of desperate people on the planet (be they the terminally ill or just financially broke), so if you're speaking as a philanthropist, you might want to tell me who you'd like to help and how effectively you could actually contribute at the micro level in the prolonged period...<br><br>If everyone contributing "their own way" were that effective in eradicating societies of its social ills, there'd be world peace.</div>
