It's not about helping the starving out there.  It's about help those around you.<br><br>Dont forget, help those in your immediate back yard give way better results in the long run.  Afterall this is about domestic issues isnt it?   We arent criticising how badly foreign govts are running life badly for their citizens.  Let them fight their own battles.<br><br>If you talk about helping gamblers, personally i wouldnt. It's exactly it being a personal effort that i believe gives you the freedom of choice to do what you<br>want and who you want to help.<br><br>And ...no we cannot eradicate everything. Just do what you want and how. I'm offering my opinion on how it can be done.<br><br></div></blockquote>It's not. As far as I'm concerned, I see no reason to differentiate people on the basis of nationality - why should I help someone in my own backyard who's a complete stranger any more than someone of a different nationality who might genuinely need my help more urgently?<br><br>It is a choice - and a conscious choice at that. It certainly says a lot with regard to how altruistic your intentions are that "helping those in your immediate backyard give better results in the long run".<br><br>Just as you deem it prudent to help those in your own backyard, I can't view that course of action with any more disdain than humanly imaginable. Ultimately, I still don't see how your opinion on how things can be done will bear fruit, that's all. In essence, I just don't view that mode of helping as being remotely tangible in the long run - and that's just my opinion.</div>

I argued with her for quite a while about me, but then, it kinda struck me. It isn't. It's run like a dictatorship.<br>If there's one thing I think Singapore should have, it would be more freedom. It's not a matter of who the leaders are. How much power they entitle the people with is a better question.<br>There have been some pretty bizarre arrests in Singapore before and there have been and still are some very strict laws concerning opposition.<br>I think it's time that the government stops thinking about itself and starts thinking about the people. It's time its decisions are made for the people's good, as opposed to their own good.<br>Singaporeans should be given more freedom.</div></blockquote>It is morally wrong for leader to write his own story of success.<br><br>Sadam hussein has tried to build his own personality cult and statue which eventually was taken down by citizens when he drops out of power.<br><br>Such history books or memoirs are cheap records of one's own accounts of history and will not last long.<br><br>Deng Xiao Peng has passed away for some years now and the Chinese people still fondly remember his selflessness and sacrifice for the Chinese people. Deng did not try to cling on to power for himself although he could do so. He provided China with a lasting legacy with his selfless transition for the sake of a united Chinese leadership transition badly needed in that fractious country.<br><br>It will be like the Japanese trying to tamper with history by writing its own version about its war crimes and molestations of the comfort women.<br><br>A true success story is not self-praise but great endeavors of men in conquering the unknown and challenges based on people's own memory and actual beneficial experiences.<br><br>Singapore has a lot to learn in such area of governance - how to motivate people to work as a team selflessly to build a united country.</div>

Have they explore and explore all treatments? Have they done enough review or because it is simply a 1 party system and New blood required to inject alternative view into the parliamentary system? Do we need to reform our Ministry and parliamentary to have a mechanism to create solution?<br><br>4) PAP perception and its role in governing Singapore?Â– With PAP in the 3rd generation of leadership has national building change? Survival of national truly question while we move ahead to build the nation have we forgot why we built the nation in the first place? What is the mission of PAP? What role it perceives itself to believe they are truly here to work for Singaporean and not people work for PAP<br></div></blockquote>If people criticize the government, even if people are wrong and criticize without all the facts and substance it is still part and parcel of good corporate governance. It is only natural and logical reaction that people should want to point out leaders' mistakes for after all the leaders are dependent on their taxes and efforts to build the country for the good of all.<br><br>It is like a company selling a product to its customers. A good company will always regard customers' feedbacks as something positive and not like our government which always tries to put down discredit people's feedbacks.<br><br>There is too much self-praise and self-centredness on the part of our leaders and people's  criticisms are met with contempts with regular attempts being made to debunk or discredit people's feedbacks.<br><br>A country cannot really become a united or great country if its leaders keep behaving in such an adversarial manner. Our leaders do not seem to understand this as their major shortcomings.<br><br>They are still after many years of behaving like lords to the people still going to great length to put down negative feedbacks and discouraging people from participating in the governing process. Hence the leaders could not attract true talents even if they are trying to use monies to win them.<br><br>The leaders miss many opportunity to use good people who could not stay long because of negative self-centredness which create power struggles and office politics. So it is not money alone which will retain talents.<br><br>The western societies have clearly proven that by allowing their people to speak up and criticise their own government, they could make greater progress as witnessed by their leadership in science and technologies which brought about great prosperity to their people the world over.</div>
