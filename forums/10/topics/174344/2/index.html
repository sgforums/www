It is the press and media which control the mainstream reporting and the press was under the control of politicians to dish out such one-sided distorted view about our political oppositions.<br><br>It is our kiasu politicians in power who are not objective and who refuse up to now to allow true and free expressions of views and uninhibited participation in political renewal process which are the root cause of our political apathy.<br><br>I beg to disagree that the oppositions failed to earn the trust of the people. They are not in power and should not be made answerable for any lack of performance of the government or economy.<br><br>We are now short of political talents to carry on the tasks of upgrading our economy or social and cultural vibrancy,  largely because of our kiasu political practice by the party in power. Our leaders' own kiasu mindset is the first thing to change if they wish to maintain any authority to advise people to change anything.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In any case, its good to see WP appearing in some media everyday. Its good publicity. About them contesting in AMK GRC, maybe its just a decoy?<br><br>Somehow, I still think its better for them to contest in a weaker GRC and get themselves into Parliament first. Show the rest of Singapore what they can do for their GRC, then maybe the other GRCs will bulge in the next elections. Sad but true, we are a nation of "Wait and See". So this strategy may work better, than trying to convince the masses to vote for opposition.<br><br>My one cent...</div>

Or is that the perceived notion?<br><br>Our refusal to subscribe to western democracy is understandable, given the numerous scandals and corruption issues that plague the US 2-party system.<br><br>Then again, having a dynasty-style ruling party led by ONE family refusing to give up the reins of power is extremely disturbing.<br><br>The reasons behind them in the past was noble. But can the same reasons be used today to retain office? Are we stuck in the quagmire of instability and communist insurgency of the 50s and 60s? Do we have unstable neighbours threatening another indonesian confrontation? Are we plagued by religious and racial riots of the past?<br><br>Can we honestly believe that it was PM LHL's OWN decision to retain his father and bestow the position of MM to retain his services in government?<br><br>Is that how a true democracy is run? By refusing change? The 8-year term per office of the US president at least ensures that leadership is given fresh legs and new blood. To that end, this ensures policys are reviewed, outstanding motions are retained and past political connections are snapped with a new cabinet.<br><br>Western democracy may reek of problems, but there are many strengths we have not incorporated as yet to create the 'perfect model'.</div>
