            <div class='col-md body'>I beg to differ. Refer to my underlined replies.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by CM06:</div><div class="quote_body">....<br><br>Banks pump the property market - they charge our mother/father/you/your relative so much for paying housing/car/furniture/personal loans and guess what?  All your money in the bank is generating ....0.00001% .nothing.  Lock your funds up with "high" 2%fixed deposit so that they can charge 7% or much much higher for a longer period from these laons and earn more money.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> u can always not take any loan with the bank. Bank did not force anyone to loan with them. One can always approach GE money or the like. If one is unhappy about 2% fix deposit, you can always put your money in something else. Today if you buy cloth from me at $2, make it into a shirt and sell for $7, can I complain?</span><br><br>Banks raise NETS charge so everything one jump into credit cards - miss payment and you are screwed REALLY bad - they will eat everything you own declare you bankrupt and make you live the streets do they care?<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Please dun exaggerate. Everyone is responsible for their own spending. Please dun push one's irresponsible spending habit to the bank. And, btw if u really missed one payment, you'll just kana a late fee of around $40 depending on bank. You can still call the bank to waive it off.</span><br><br>Banks impose rules on notes changing, coins changing citing costs - where else do you have a choice to this? How come our $100 coins become $95 notes instead?  Banks eat our money and the MAS doesnt give a crap.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> If you today own an investing company. You help people to invest their funds on the stock market for example. A beaming uncle pass you his life savings of $50,000 in coins and odd notes. Another example, do you want your salary in coins, odd notes?  Banks must have the relevant currencies in whatever denominations that customers require, and be ready to accept denominations that customers deposit. These denominations are not readily use for investments, thus the cost.<br><br>However you still have a choice. You can save your $100 in notes instead, of use your $100 coins to purchase your stuff at the supermarket directly. </span><br><br>.......<br><br>What happens when the people get into debts? The women go sell body lor how young?  16 and above already starting to do it not to mention more and more of them are doing freelance or a social escort.  Sound nice?  How do you like to find out your 20+ year old niece is a prostitute and sleep men they dont know beyond a few names? Good luck to thosewho are "helping these poor girls out" when they walk into the hotelroom and see their best buddy's young daughter opening the door.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Usually when people get into debts from the bank, they more all their assets before it can be frozen to their family members. Then they declare bankrupt. The bank ALWAYS losses. The banks' stand is always to work out a repayment scheme with the customer if they are facing financial difficulty. It is usually customers who try to be funny. And from your paragraph about prostitution, perhaps you watch too much TV </span><br><br>What about the men? Who cares right? Backside not very popular yet anyway. What what do the poor men do?  They sit at home or do menial jobs.  If they owe a motorbike - fastfood delivery.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Ya, we men are at a disadvantage....whahahahahahhah!!!</span><br><br>It's a timebomb.  The rich will remain rich and become richer every day. Everyone else is just something to be exploited to make them every richer.<br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Or you can spent more time doing constructive things so that you can be richer in future. </span><br><br></div></blockquote></div>
