              <p>Kim Il Sung fought Japanese, Lee Kuan Yew collaborated with Japanese during WWII.</p>
              <p>I respect Kim Il Sung more.</p>
              <p>To me Lee Kuan Yew is nothing more than a dog of the british.</p>
              <p>His peranakan group were trained to be loyal to the british colonial masters and Lee Kuan Yew retained his pro-anglo outlook all his life.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A significant category of Chinese, although one not listed in the
                          census reports, were the Baba
                          Chinese or Straits
                          Chinese. They were Chinese who after long residence
                          in Southeast Asia spoke Malay or English as their first language, and
                          whose culture contained elements from China, Southeast Asia, and
                          sometimes Europe as well. An indication of the size of the Baba Chinese
                          community was provided by the 1980 census report that 9 percent of
                          Chinese families spoke English at home.</p>
              <p>Stereotypically the Baba were
                          the offspring of Chinese migrants and local women. In the nineteenth
                          century, they tended to be wealthier and better educated than the mass
                          of immigrants and to identify more with Singapore and Southeast Asia
                          than with China.</p>
              <p>In spite of their language, the Baba considered
                          themselves Chinese, retained Chinese kinship patterns and religion, and
                          even when speaking Malay used a distinct Baba dialect of Malay with many
                          loan words from Hokkien.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Never a large proportion of Singapore's Chinese
                          population, in the late nineteenth century they took advantage of
                          opportunities for education in English and promoted themselves as loyal
                          to Britain.</strong></span></span> In Singapore, many Baba families spoke English as a first
                          language and produced many of the leaders of Singapore's independent
                          political movements, including Lee Kuan Yew.</p>

              Malaysia has a multi-racial population but is quite unique in that the
              division is not just by race alone but by religion, language, culture
              and economic situation. Unity in such a diversity is extremely
              difficult to achieve. <br><br> 2. If we study other nations where people of different ethnic groups
              have immigrated, we will find that integration and unity depended on
              several important factors. Firstly the indigenous people or the people
              who had set up the country make up at least initially, a very big
              proportion of the population. Additionally they would be dominant and
              materially successful. The small numbers of immigrants trickling in
              found it judicious and beneficial to be identified with the numerically
              superior and powerful dominant inhabitants. They would willingly forget
              their original languages and adopt the language of the people of the
              country as well as their culture; they would intermarry and over time
              they would be totally absorbed and assimilated and identified with the
              indigenous people. In such a situation unity is not a problem. The
              United States is one such country where the original language and basic
              culture of first settlers are accepted by later immigrants.<br><br> 3. In the old days before the coming of the Europeans the few Chinese
              and Indians who settled in Malacca adopted the language and much of the
              culture of the Malays. Though there was no assimilation nevertheless
              good relations existed between the immigrant settlers and the Malays.
              <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Unfortunately when later the China-born Chinese-speaking immigrants
              dominated in numbers as well as economic wealth, the Malay speaking
              Baba and Nyonya deliberately dropped their Malay language and Baba
              culture and reverted to being Chinese in every way possible. </strong></span></span></span></p>

              <p>When come to race in Singapore, we are Singaporeans, whether or whoever you are, we must have racial tolerances, harmony and consultation approach to all matters. Peace shall then prevail and with peace, come prosperity.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So whether i make a singapore sling, babanonya or ali baba drinks etc etc, just enjoy it. I seek no conflict or control, only contention and self confident. Like it or not, we have to respect the Baba and all other races. In term of Malay speaking, LKY and his son is superb in it, and that is a high point in dealing with our neighourers and our malays frens here. And their Chinese is not bad too.</p>

              <p>Really, before PAP, i thot most of our people are coolies and workers doing odd jobs for the british and only those english speaking ones did find some clerical jobs, life was tough and under colonial, then when we get independency, in the first stage, there was lots of riots, gangsterism, poor education and racial riots. But now, look at me and you, we are enjoying our life with nonya kuah, living in private nice house, maids, cars, big comfortable bed and more importantly, peace and harmony. What else do you want?
