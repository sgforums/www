              <h1>5 out of 9 new NMPs list MM Lee as their “favourite politician”</h1>
              <p>Friday, 10 July 2009, 1:51 pm | 1,541 views</p>
              <p>In a Straits Times report on 10 July, five out of the nine new
              Nominated Members of Parliament (NMPs) list Minister Mentor Lee Kuan
              Yew as their favourite politician. United States president, Barack
              Obama, is second with two votes of confidence, with one each for former
              South African president, Nelson Mandela and another US president,
              Benjamin Franklin.</p>
              <p>New NMP, Associate Professor Paulin Tay Straughan, who is also vice
              dean of NUS’s Arts and Social Sciences faculty, gushes as she says, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>“I
              never envisaged that I would enter politics, but I had hoped that I
              would get to meet Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew and tell him how much I
              admire him,” she told the Straits Times. “I hope to do that soon.”</strong></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>To Mr Terry Lee Kok Hua, a veteran unionist, MM Lee is the “Father
              of Singapore”. </strong></span></span>“He has transformed Singapore from a Third World to
              First World nation that now provides Singaporeans with better jobs,
              better pay and a better life.”</p>
              <p>MM Lee is admired for his “wisdom, vision and foresight” by Mr Teo
              Siong Seng, managing director of shipping company Pacific International
              Lines, for “transforming this tiny city with virtually no natural
              resources into one of the most developed countries in the world today.”</p>
              <p>Indeed, MM Lee seems to be admired by the oldest and the youngest of
              the new NMPs. Mr Laurence Wee, 63, related how he had watched the
              debate between Mr Lee and Singapore’s first chief minister, Mr David
              Marshall, in the 1950s and went away awed by Mr Lee<span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>. “I was impressed
              with MM Lee’s calmness and composure during the debate,” says Mr Wee,
              who is Executive director of Presbyterian Community Services. “I
              thought to myself then that Mr Lee held the future of Singapore.”</strong></span></span></p>
              <p>To Ms Jocelyn Yeo, 30, winner of numerous medals for swimming for
              Singapore, MM Lee “epitomizes leadership”<span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>. “His wisdom, strength and
              courage in making decisions that shaped Singapore are greatly admired,”
              she says. “He was and is truly a leader among leaders.”</strong></span></span></p>
              <p>Nominated Members of Parliament are said to be selected because they
              can provide alternative views. Hopefully, their seemingly deep
              admiration for the Minister Mentor will not prevent them from doing so.</p>

              <h1>New NMP had joined Young PAP <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>“out of curiosity”</strong></span></h1>
              <p>IN A country where lines get blurred in so many areas, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Nominated MP
              aspirant Calvin Cheng’s decision not to resign his Young PAP membership
              the moment he launched his bid to enter Parliament is understandable.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p>If those lines were clearly drawn into our collective DNA, I am
              quite sure Mr Cheng would have officially cut his links with the youth
              wing of the ruling party the moment he had made up his mind that he
              wanted to enter Parliament.</p>
              <p>He did that only after a Today report highlighted the issue on Wednesday.</p>
              <p>This 34-year-old media entrepreneur must have felt all that was
              needed was to be honest and upfront with the high-level committee that
              sifts through NMP applications and picks people it thinks will make a
              contribution to debate in Parliament. Mr Cheng says that he told the
              committee he was an “inactive member” and that the committee did not
              question him on this.</p>
              <p>In defending his decision subsequently, he said his<span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> Young PAP
              membership expired two years after he joined the political organisation
              in 2006 and that he never even bothered to pick up his membership card.
              Now here is the real rub. He joined the Young PAP out of … you need to
              be ready for this word … curiosity.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p>Let me quote from a letter he wrote to Today:<span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> “I joined YPAP in 2006
              when I visited the Teck Ghee PAP branch with a friend, and I signed up
              out of curiosity.</strong></span></span> Due to many reasons, I never returned.”</p>
              <p>My, my … what does this say of this intelligent young man who
              graduated from Oxford and wants to be a member of the highest and most
              august chamber in Singapore?</p>
              <p>Shall we dismiss this curiosity episode as a case of boyish candour?</p>
              <p>I would have not bothered much if Mr Cheng had added this line in
              his letter: Looking back, I realise how wrong I was to treat my
              application to join an organisation like the YPAP in such a cavalier
              manner.</p>
              <p>The burden is now on Mr Cheng; he has to prove to Singaporeans that
              the decision by the Special Select Committee, which includes two
              ministers and several backbenchers, to pick him is not misplaced.</p>
              <p>As for the Young PAP, perhaps it needs to make sure that the people
              who want to join it do so for the right reasons and not for whimsical
              reasons like curiosity.</p>
