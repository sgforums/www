              <p>Really, before PAP, i thot most of our people are coolies and workers doing odd jobs for the british and only those english speaking ones did find some clerical jobs, life was tough and under colonial, then when we get independency, in the first stage, there was lots of riots, gangsterism, poor education and racial riots. But now, look at me and you, we are enjoying our life with nonya kuah, living in private nice house, maids, cars, big comfortable bed and more importantly, peace and harmony. What else do you want? Let me give you two words and hope you can realize and be enlighted in this society...that is Heaven and Earth.</p>

              <p><br>hey, my posting are very popular ok, both humorous and got a twinkle of meaning in it, yet it come with a hidden agenda that get people thinking.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Unemployment rising?? Omg! that is only in America, not here. With these type of recession, you get a 3% ++ unemployment, you should be laughing and be glad about it. Dun use these accuses to support your arguement ok. So lame.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So you think Yew HOck is good or LKY? Dun america start with the godfathers?? please lah, who started the gangsterism, because the british colonial master heckcare what the local do, just shoot them, surely when LKY come into power, he needs time to settle all these problem one at a time, his first step was to create jobs, and that he did it, without jobs, not only gangsterism will prevail, even old men will go on riot.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am not a muslim, nor bound to any religion, please dun insult people...just a mere singapore gal here argueing with a die hard Uncle.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The word heaven or earth implied peace, whoever rule the country, as long as there is peace, let him be, going into war or against it might trigger a civil unrest that make all of us suffer or die for it, just like what other countries did..fighting, riot, protest, killing etc etc...so for the sake of heaven and earth, stop all your negative sign on our govt, I am not saying they are perfect or very good, but so far so good. UNDERSTAND! if you do not understand, that mean that thru all your life, you failed to find peace. Please have a thought for others. Thank you</p>
