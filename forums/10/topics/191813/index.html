            <div class='col-md body'>New ministers are appointed again with a lot of fanfare about talents and their corporate experiences to contribute to solving problems.<br><br>It is hoped they will rise to the occasion and tell the truths of how they feel about past problems which are still not solved like the corporatisation policy to enable govenment to charge all fees up to market prices and all the high costs from double charging on lands and triple charging on vehicles as posted.<br><br>They should not keep quiet about the "20 major government policy errors" which have caused the economy to go sideway since 1980s.<br><br>All these problems were caused by incorrect short-sighted policy adopted during growth period but many of these past polices were no longer valid.<br><br>Do they have the guts to tell the truths or will they be keeping quiet just to safeguard their own highest pays. Or will they be putting up shielding look-good tempered measures just to avoid accountability to past problems.<br><br>What are your views?</div>
