              <p> </p>
              <p>Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative journalist Seymour Hersh created a
              stir earlier this month when he said the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bush administration ran an
              “executive assassination ring” that reported directly to Vice President
              Dick Cheney.</strong></span> “Under President Bush’s authority, they’ve been going into
              countries, not talking to the ambassador or to the CIA station chief,
              and <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>finding people on a list and executing them and leaving,”</strong></span> Hersh
              said. Seymour Hersh joins us to explain.</p>
              <p>Guest:</p>
              <p><strong>Seymour Hersh</strong>, Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative journalist for <em>The New Yorker</em>. His latest article is titled “Syria Calling</p>
              <p><strong>AMY GOODMAN: </strong>Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative journalist
              Seymour Hersh created a stir last month when he said the Bush
              administration ran an executive assassination ring that reported
              directly to Vice President Dick Cheney. Hersh made the comment during a
              speech at the University of Minnesota on March 10th.</p>
              <ul>
              <p><strong>SEYMOUR HERSH: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Congress has no oversight of it. It’s
              an executive assassination wing, essentially. And it’s been going on
              and on and on. </span></strong>And just today in the <em>Times</em> there was a story
              saying that its leader, a three-star admiral named McRaven, ordered a
              stop to certain activities because there were so many collateral
              deaths. It’s been going in—under President Bush’s authority, they’ve
              been going into countries, not talking to the ambassador or to the CIA
              station chief, and finding people on a list and executing them and
              leaving.</p>
              </ul>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>AMY GOODMAN: </strong>Yesterday, CNN interviewed Dick Cheney’s former
              national security adviser, John Hannah. Wolf Blitzer asked Hannah about
              Sy Hersh’s claim.</p>
              <ul>
              <p><strong>WOLF BLITZER: </strong>Is there a list of terrorists, suspected terrorists out there who can be assassinated?</p>
              <p><strong>JOHN HANNAH: </strong>There is clearly a group of people that go
              through a very extremely well-vetted process, inter-agency process, as
              I think was explained in your piece, that have committed acts of war
              against the United States, who are at war with the United States, or
              are suspected of planning operations of war against the United States,
              <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>who authority is given to the troops in the field and in certain war
              theaters to capture or kill those individuals. That is certainly true. </strong></span></p>
              <p><strong>WOLF BLITZER: </strong>And so, this would be, and from your
              perspective—and you worked in the Bush administration for many years—it
              would be totally constitutional, totally legal, to go out and find
              these guys and to whack ’em.</p>
              <p><strong>JOHN HANNAH: </strong>There’s no question that in a theater of
              war, when we are at war, and we know—there’s no doubt, we are still at
              war against al-Qaeda in Iraq, al-Qaeda in Afghanistan and on that
              Pakistani border, that our troops have the authority to go after and
              capture and kill the enemy, including the leadership of the enemy.</p>
              </ul>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>AMY GOODMAN: </strong>That’s John Hannah, Dick Cheney’s former
              national security adviser. Seymour Hersh joins me now here in
              Washington, D.C., staff writer for <em>The New Yorker</em> magazine. His
              latest article appears in the current issue, called “Syria Calling: The
              Obama Administration’s Chance to Engage in a Middle East Peace.”</p>
              <p>OK, welcome to <em>Democracy Now!</em>, Sy Hersh. It was good to
              see you last night at Georgetown. Talk about, first, these comments you
              made at the University of Minnesota.</p>
              <p><strong>SEYMOUR HERSH: </strong>Well, it was sort of stupid of me to start
              talking about stuff I haven’t written. I always kick myself when I do
              it. But I was with Walter Mondale, the former vice president, who was
              being amazingly open and sort of, for him—he had come a long way
              in—since I knew him as a senator who was reluctant to oppose the
              Vietnam War. And so, I was asked about future things, and I just—I am
              looking into stuff. I’ve done—there’s really nothing I said at
              Minnesota I haven’t written in the <em>New York Times</em>. Last summer, I wrote a long article about the Joint Special Operations Command.</p>
              <p>And just to go back to what John Hannah, who is—was—I think
              ended up being the senior national security adviser, almost—if not the
              chief of staff, deputy chief of staff for Dick Cheney in the last three
              or four years, what he said is simply that, yes, we go after people
              suspected—that was the word he used—of crimes against America. And I
              have to tell you that there’s an executive order, signed by Jerry Ford,
              President Ford, in the ’70s, forbidding such action. It’s not only
              contrary—it’s illegal, it’s immoral, it’s counterproductive.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The evidence—the problem with having military go kill people
              when they’re not directly in combat,</strong></span> these are asking American troops
              to go out and find people and, as you said earlier, in one of the
              statements I made that you played, they go into countries without
              telling any of the authorities, the American ambassador, the CIA chief,
              certainly nobody in the government that we’re going into, and it’s far
              more than just in combat areas. There’s more—at least a dozen countries
              and perhaps more. The President has authorized these kinds of actions
              in the Middle East and also in Latin America, I will tell you, Central
              America, some countries. They’ve been—our boys have been told they can
              go and take the kind of executive action they need, and that’s
              simply—there’s no legal basis for it.</p>
              <p>And not only that, if you look at Guantanamo, the American
              government knew by—well, let’s see, Guantanamo opened in early 2002.
              “Gitmo,” they call it, the base down in Cuba for alleged al-Qaeda
              terrorists. An internal report that I wrote about in a book I did years
              ago, an internal report made by the summer of 2002, estimated that at
              least half and possibly more of those people had nothing to do with
              actions against America. The intelligence we have is often very
              fragmentary, not very good. And the idea that the American president
              would think he has the constitutional power or the legal right to tell
              soldiers not engaged in immediate combat to go out and find people
              based on lists and execute them is just amazing to me. It’s amazing to
              me.</p>
              <p>And not only that, Amy, the thing about George Bush is,
              everything’s sort of done in plain sight. In his State of the Union
              address, I think January the 28th, 2003, about a month and a half
              before we went into Iraq, Bush was describing the progress in the war,
              and he said—I’m paraphrasing, but this is pretty close—he said that
              we’ve captured more than 3,000 members of al-Qaeda and suspected
              members, people suspected of operations against us. And then he added
              with that little smile he has, “And let me tell you, some of those
              people will not be able to ever operate again. I can assure you that.
              They will not be in a position.” He’s clearly talking about killing
              people, and to applause.</p>
              <p>So, there we are. I don’t back off what I said. I wish I hadn’t said it <em>ad hoc</em>, because, like I hope we’re going to talk about in a minute, I spend a lot of time writing stories for <em>The New Yorker</em>, and they’re very carefully vetted, and sometimes when you speak off the top, you’re not as precise.</p>
              <p><strong>AMY GOODMAN: </strong>Explain what the Joint Special Operations Command is and what oversight Congress has of it.</p>
              <p><strong>SEYMOUR HERSH: </strong>Well, it’s a special unit. We have
              something called the Special Operations Command that operates out of
              Florida, and it involves a lot of wings. And one of the units that work
              under the umbrella of the Special Operations Command is known as Joint
              Special Op—JSOC. It’s a special unit. What makes it so special, it’s a
              group of elite people that include Navy Seals, some Navy Seals, Delta
              Force, our—what we call our black units, the commando units. “Commando”
              is a word they don’t like, but that’s what we, most of us, refer to
              them as. And they promote from within. It’s a unit that has its own
              promotion structure. And one of the elements, I must tell you, about
              getting ahead in promotion is the number of kills you have. Of course.
              Because it’s basically devised—it’s been transmogrified, if you will,
              into this unit that goes after high-value targets.</p>
              <p>And where Cheney comes in and the idea of an assassination
              ring—I actually said “wing,” but of an assassination wing—that reports
              to Cheney was simply that they clear lists through the Vice President’s
              office. He’s not sitting around picking targets. They clear the lists.
              And he’s certainly deeply involved, less and less as time went on, of
              course, but in the beginning very closely involved. And this is the
              elite unit. I think they do three-month tours. And last summer, I wrote
              a long article in <em>The New Yorker</em>, last July, about how the JSOC
              operation is simply not available, and there’s no information provided
              by the executive to Congress.</p>
              <p><strong>AMY GOODMAN: </strong>What countries, Sy Hersh—what countries are they operating in?</p>
              <p><strong>SEYMOUR HERSH: </strong>A lot of countries.</p>
              <p><strong>AMY GOODMAN: </strong>Name some.</p>
              <p><strong>SEYMOUR HERSH: </strong>No, because I haven’t written about it,
              Amy. And I will tell you, as I say, in Central America, it’s far more
              than just the areas that Mr. Hannah talked about—Afghanistan, Iraq. You
              can understand an operation like this in the heat of battle in Iraq,
              killing—I mean, taking out enemy. That’s war. But when you go into
              other countries—let’s say Yemen, let’s say Peru, let’s say Colombia,
              let’s say Eritrea, let’s say Madagascar, let’s say Kenya, countries
              like that—and kill people who are believed on a list to be al-Qaeda or
              al-Qaeda-linked or anti-American, you’re violating most of the tenets.</p>
              <p>We’re a country that believes very much in due process. That’s
              what it’s all about. We don’t give the President of United States the
              right to tell military people, even in a war—and it’s a war against an
              idea, war against terrorism. It’s not as if we’re at war against a
              committed uniformed enemy. It’s a very complicated war we’re in. And
              with each of those actions, of course, there’s always collateral
              deaths, and there’s always more people ending up becoming our enemies.
              That’s the tragedy of Guantanamo. By the time people, whether they were
              with us or against us when they got there, by the time they’ve been
              there three or four months, they’re dangerous to us, because of the way
              they’ve been treated. But I’d love to move on to what I wrote about in <em>The New Yorker</em>.</p>
              <p><strong>AMY GOODMAN: </strong>One question: Is the assassination wing continuing under President Obama?</p>
              <p><strong>SEYMOUR HERSH: </strong>How do I know? I hope not.</p>
              <p><strong>AMY GOODMAN: </strong>We’re talking to Sy Hersh. We’re going to go
              to break, and then we’ll be back with him, the Pulitzer Prize-winning
              journalist. His piece in <em>The New Yorker</em> is called “Syria Calling: The Obama Administration’s Chance to Engage in a Middle East Peace.” Stay with us.</p>
