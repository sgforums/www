              <p>they should make strategic areas to launch a strike!</p>
              <p>eg)first the monks would protest as a decoy.......then the people would assemble armed men with Ak47 to attack the communication network in burma..the airports and rail network must be shutoff too if possible.then the power stations systems at night.then they should get people to pinpount the head of intelligence in burma as well as half the generals and have them silenced....the dictator in charge has gotten soft over the years and takes for granted his power.all these would be best done at night and after 1 week of protest by monks.it could also be done in 2 days if the right people were in charge.</p>
              <p>its all very easy.....u wipe out all infrastructure from communication,power supply lines ,poisoned food and poisoned water supply .the soldiers will not be able to attack on the day of attack.chances are the general dictators head will be up on the flag pole on the 7th day!</p>
              <p>its simple if the people in Burma knew what they really wanted and had the balls instead of running away in crutches!</p>

              <p>however having said that...................maybe there should be some real organisation regarding a serious confrontation as they ,their future and their family are doomed if they were to listen to their bumese dictator.</p>
              <p>so a concise plan should be made:</p>
              <p>1)stalk and monitor the whereabouts of their dictator and 10 teams and platoons be made for the action</p>
              <p>2)study their physical locations</p>
              <p>3)booby trap roads where oncoming police would arrive for the  decoys</p>
              <p>4)destroy all communications and power supply lines</p>
              <p>5)massacre convoys of soldiers and police with molotov cocktails and retrieve their weapons and uniforms</p>
              <p>6)use their uniforms to infiltrate various checkpoints and units thats within their capability and plans.</p>
              <p>7)issue weapons once ammo dumps ,food supply units and armoured units have been seized by infiltrators and isssue them to citizens</p>
              <p>8)either team thats supposed to be stalking dictators n key personell to have them eliminated or the armed citizens will now be a credible force to deal with.</p>
              <p>9)use loudspeakers to encourage more citizens to take part as they are more armed.</p>
              <p>and there we have it.....Burma for tomorrow.</p>

              <p><br>how can a monk come to a backlane and ask for money, how can a monk ask for money in hawker centre, how can a monk sell buddhist image in return for money. In Singapore, buddhism is still an infant, people go to a buddhist temple when someone die or visit the dead for some occasion. And even temple in Singapore have PRC monks and other foreign monks. As Mao ever put it to Dalai Lama, religion can be a poison if you do not know it well, and since Dalai dun accept it, he gets kicked out.</p>
              <p>In Taiwan, me have to ask for rice..nothing but rice only from the village, everyday from 4 am to 7am walking down the mountain and ask for rice only, not even fruits and vegetable, cos we nuns grew our own vegetables and fruits. We must not even touch money, so to speak. And when we give prayer to the dead or born, we accept only rice, nuts and beans, nothing else. That's why, some taiwanese gals are so slim and good shape like me.</p>

              <p>time has changed. do you expect the monks and nuns not to take modern transports but like olden days, travel by walking or always need someone to be with them to pay the fares on their behalf ? can the monks and nuns in singapore plant their own vegetables or go round asking for alms  which is illegal in singapore.</p>
              <p>if they are not allowed to receive money from the devotees, i think every monks will need a personal assistant to handle their daily needs.even if the monks and nuns do not step out of the temples, they still need to pay for the electrical bills and what about their daily necessities (clothings, hair cut, shoes etc.) or do you expect them to use candles. you have not grasped what buddha is trying to preach or you will not end up saying amen.</p>
              <p>one day the young ladies in singapore will become old, that is the time when we will seriously thinking of what is life all about. thus, do not judge us when we are still young.</p>
