              <p>time has changed. do you expect the monks and nuns not to take modern transports but like olden days, travel by walking or always need someone to be with them to pay the fares on their behalf ? can the monks and nuns in singapore plant their own vegetables or go round asking for alms  which is illegal in singapore.</p>
              <p>if they are not allowed to receive money from the devotees, i think every monks will need a personal assistant to handle their daily needs.even if the monks and nuns do not step out of the temples, they still need to pay for the electrical bills and what about their daily necessities (clothings, hair cut, shoes etc.) or do you expect them to use candles. you have not grasped what buddha is trying to preach or you will not end up saying amen.</p>
              <p>one day the young ladies in singapore will become old, that is the time when we will seriously thinking of what is life all about. thus, do not judge us when we are still young.</p>

              <p>People become monk because they cannot concentrate on buddhism in an outside world, if a person can understand the doctrine of buddha teaching, practice it well, spread to others thru his humble and serenity lifestyle, he dun hv to be a monk. Monk or sangha are actually person who seek buddhism in a different way and i respect that, because the Dharma said that we must respect the sangha, but on the contrary, buddha did not said you hv to be a monk inorder to get enlighted, in actual fact, you got to go down to the outside world, learn the way of laymen and human living, from there you get more experiences than a monk, because a monk hiding or preaching in a temple, dunno much about life. And Buddhism is nothing but the doctorine of Life. It is a matter of whether u want to live a blissful or unblissful life.</p>

              world, learn the way of laymen and human living, from there you get
              more experiences than a monk, because a monk hiding or preaching in
              a temple, dunno much about life. And Buddhism is nothing but the
              doctorine of Life. It is a matter of whether u want to live a
              blissful or unblissful life.</p>

              <p>Behold, Nun Angel.!!</p>
              <p>The wheel of life is forever spining, going on and on repeating itself in different world and condition, if one does not realise the meaning of life, one shall not be able to get away from this repeating life...on and on it goes until one realized the true meaning of life, thereyby entered Nirvana, then one shall stop all these repeating and be in the relam of one true self.</p>
              <p>When I first learned Buddhism as a study and not as a religion which buddhism is not, the chief nun asked me 3 questions, Who are you, Where you come from and where are you going to...everyday, she would ask me this same 3 questions...and i kept telling her the same answer, I am Angel, I come from Taichong and after finished this course, i am going to Singapore. By the end of 2 weeks, I find myself going round and round..and finally after those courses and meditation, i realized that for the whole 21 years of my life, actually, i dun really know who i am..and i start to realize we are actually living in an illusion, life is not long, it come and go, we all born crying and go with many peoples crying. Isn't it sad. From here, i learned to see thing more clearly, knowing that life is actually suffering, we must learn to forgive and forget, the smartest thing in life is not about gaining something, it is about the ability to hold back on our urge, our greed, our hatre, our frustration and our envism. For that, may all be in peace and harmony.</p>
