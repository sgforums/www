            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Where did you obtain YOUR ''facts'' from ?</blockquote>From the account of temasek. I don't think it is not a figure not to be trusted since it has legal obligations. And I think most of your accusation comes without any evidence or based on any studies.<br><br><blockquote>Do you want to have a detailed list of grand losses that are publicly known ?<br><br>Losses are not only restricted to those loss making ventures, but also to the payments or purchase of grossly over valued investments that are far above market prices, or beyond reasonable market valuation. </blockquote>there r loses which I agree. But there r profit which u have to agree. Tis is investment. Sometime u win, sometime u lose. Overall they make profit for their investments. Tat is the bottom line<br><br><blockquote>Are you suggesting that Temasek's current portfolio is a result of its own effort to grow its original capital to the current size in its portfolio ?<br><br>If this is so, Temasek should have been more honest then to report a mere growth of only 18 per cent for last financial year - as it has more then S$500 BILLION under its care. </blockquote>Yes. And I cannot open up your link. Furthermore I do not think tat singapore has 800 billion to play with. EVen in the para itself it already say they r estimates. In the annual report, they say tat singapore only give them 350 million in assets full stop.<br><br><blockquote>Singapore has been making surpluses every year, which means that Temasek's account has been topped up every year.<br><br>You were saying ''gov never top up tis amount after tat'' ? </blockquote>Making surplus means making profit. Wat has tat got to do with top up ? Even gov budget has been making surplus. So who top up singapore budget ? America ? I think tat is a need to differentiate between GIC and Temasek<br><br><blockquote>The fact is clear that we paid US$3 BILLION for Shin Corp, and since its purchase in early 2006, the investment has been drifting in limbo.<br><br>US$3 BILLION in fixed deposit at 0.5 per cent per annum would already have paid for the premium of a National Health and Hospitalisation Insurance Plan; instead of paying for someone's ego trip.</blockquote>it is 1.88 billion USD. And during tat time it is a good idea which can give singapore much more returns than 0.5%. Now it is still providing Thai telecommunication and we do not know it is a good investment or bad investment<br><br><blockquote>Spending S$400,000 to name the Marina Bay was not so clever as part of the strategy making effort, which merely require brain storming by a team that is probably already paid more then S$400,000.<br><br>Try harder to sound convincing </blockquote><a href="http://www.newsintercom.org/index.php?itemid=346" rel="nofollow">http://www.newsintercom.org/index.php?itemid=346</a><br><br>The branding exercise for Marina Bay was not a process to identify a name. Rather, it was an exercise to create a 'competitive strategy' that will guide the development and marketing of Marina Bay. The 9-month long<br>branding process included the following steps:<br>a) researching into strategies used by competing cities;<br>b) interviews with stakeholders, real estate developers, potential investors and tenants both locally and internationally to obtain feedback on a competitive positioning for Marina Bay. Interviews with the broader community to understand what they would like to see at Marina Bay;<br>c) identifying the differentiating niche of Marina Bay and develop a set of brand identities (which includes validation of the place name "Marina Bay")and to market testing them;<br>d) design a visual communication system to guide the presentation of marketing collaterals, our communication tone and strategies to give Marina Bay a distinctive identity.<br><br><blockquote>With infrastructural costs planned to be US$20 Billion since it was first planned in 1994, can this amount be recoup in such a short time that begin since 2004, when it was ready to receive men. </blockquote>The 20 billion is the money in invested from the foreign investors. I paste a link for your reading<br><br>He rejected a claim by a Singapore opposition leader that billions of dollars in taxpayers' money was wasted in the SIP project, saying investment in it from statutory boards and government-linked companies <strong>so far was US$147 million. </strong><br>...<br><br>At the end of May, <strong>133 projects worth $3.76 billion had been committed to the SIP, which it is estimated will cost $20 billion to $30 billion over 20 yea</strong>rs.<br><br><a href="http://www.singapore-window.org/sw99/90803af1.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.singapore-window.org/sw99/90803af1.htm</a><br><br><blockquote>Don't count your chickens before they are hatched.<br><br>The losses that are known are already well publicized and happily forgotten, there remains the losses that are securely kept secret from a supposedly 'all inclusive society'. </blockquote>I don't know man, u think singapore investment r all lousy and all will made loss after some time ?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><blockquote>There are many opportunities for investment, but it requires business acumen and experience to judge the potential of opportunities.<br><br>Sadly, after so many disasters experienced, we could have been more careful, more astute, and more diligent in the background preparation works.<br><br>Still, these are mere spoken words, and require a game plan to put into action. </blockquote>From the facts gathered, it shows tat the investment made more profit than losses overall. If u do not believe in it, then u r challenging the annual report made by temasek or believe in all words tat show singapore made loss and refuse to believe in any words tat singapore made a profit. Is it really tat difficult to believe singapore make a profit ?</div>
