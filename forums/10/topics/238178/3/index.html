But there r profit which u have to agree. Tis is investment. Sometime u win, sometime u lose. Overall they make profit for their investments. Tat is the bottom line<br><br>quote:<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Are you suggesting that Temasek's current portfolio is a result of its own effort to grow its original capital to the current size in its portfolio ?<br><br>If this is so, Temasek should have been more honest then to report a mere growth of only 18 per cent for last financial year - as it has more then S$500 BILLION under its care.<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Yes. And I cannot open up your link. Furthermore I do not think tat singapore has 800 billion to play with. EVen in the para itself it already say they r estimates.

Wat has tat got to do with top up ? Even gov budget has been making surplus. So who top up singapore budget ? America ?

Rather, it was an exercise to create a 'competitive strategy' that will guide the development and marketing of Marina Bay. The 9-month long<br>branding process included the following steps:<br>a) researching into strategies used by competing cities;<br>b) interviews with stakeholders, real estate developers, potential investors and tenants both locally and internationally to obtain feedback on a competitive positioning for Marina Bay. Interviews with the broader community to understand what they would like to see at Marina Bay;<br>c) identifying the differentiating niche of Marina Bay and develop a set of brand identities (which includes validation of the place name "Marina Bay"and to market testing them;<br>d) design a visual communication system to guide the presentation of marketing collaterals, our communication tone and strategies to give Marina Bay a distinctive identity.<br><br>quote:<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>With infrastructural costs planned to be US$20 Billion since it was first planned in 1994, can this amount be recoup in such a short time that begin since 2004, when it was ready to receive men.<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>The 20 billion is the money in invested from the foreign investors.

So i assumed that sometimes you were talking about military reserves.<br><br><strong>''Do you not agree that empty boast of HIGH Per Capita income based on National Reserves is NOTHING more then DELUDING ourselves ? </strong><br>Boasting high per capita income based on national reserves doesn't make sense to me, but then it was you who said high per capita income, not lionnoisy. You are the one who extracted this:<br><br><strong>The following was posted on 20 February 2007 02.31a.m. - found on Page 1 of this thread<br><br>From the following report "Singapore : New Poor and Social Cohesion":<br><br>quote:<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>It has been highlighted that the Per capita GDP in 2000 at around US$23,000 was higher that many First World countries [i]but the remuneration received by Singapore workers or wage share in GDP was about 42 percent, which is unusually low compared to developed countries and lowest among the Asian NIEs.<br><br>Some economists have therefore remarked that Singapore, while having attained a First World per capita income, in reality has kept in place an income structure that is closer to that of a Third World country (Department of Statistics, 2001).<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</strong><br><br>from what lionnoisy wrote in his first post he calculated the per capita of foreign exchange and gold reserves, not per capita income on national reserves.<span style="color: red;"> You were referring to per capita of GDP in the above quote, which is not the same as per capita of foreign exchange and gold reserves.</span> You should also know that per capita income is a of subset per capita GDP. Per capita GDP also includes gov spending. FYI, the correct terms actually are GDP per capita, not per capita GDP and Income per capita not per capita income. But i shall continue to use the terms as originally used in our discussions to avoid confusion.<br><br>After lionnoisy calculated the per capita of foreign exchange and gold reserves, then he asked whether the reserves were included in the assets of GIC and temasek holdings, he asked whether it is the gov or banks that owned the foreign exchange reserves, whether the reserves were invested and what is the performance. I don't know what the per capita of foreign exchange reserves and gold have  to do with the assets of GIC and temasek holdings. They are totally different things altogether. Later, he also asked about the profits of these companies.<br><br>But then you picked out the quote about the per capita GDP and per capita income, and tried to draw a connection with that to refute lionnoisy's statement about the profits of GIC, temasek, etc. It doesn't make sense to use the per capita GDP and per capita income to refute lionnoisy's statement about the companies' profits because the per capita GDP and per capita income refer to the economy as a whole, not specifically to GIC and temasek holdings. Unless you can prove how much of the per capita GDP is that of GIC and temasek holdings, etc, then you stand a better chance of having a logical argument about the link between per capita GDP or per capita income  with your discussion about temasek, GIC, etc.<br><br>In another post you said:<br><br><strong>''Without transparency, any discussion can only be based on the few information that is available; but the fact remains true that a boastful high Per Capita income based on National Reserves is nothing more then self-delusionary.'' </strong><br><br>You seem to be putting words in lionnoisy's mouth, after that you accuse him by saying:<br><br><strong>"the fact remains true that a boastful high Per Capita income based on National Reserves is nothing more then self-delusionary. " </strong><br><br>And you wrote to me saying:<br><br><strong>''If you will relook at the thread started by lionnoisy, this "Per Capita Income with foreign exchange reserves' was his topic and based on his interpretation of what he has read from the referenced CIA site - Reserves of foreign exchange and gold - that he gave in his opening post.<br><br>Was he incorrect ?''</strong><br>Are you trying to brainwash both me and lionnoisy to believe something that was not said in the first place???????? Maybe you have brainwashed lionnoisy but  not me.<br><br>You are the first person who tried to draw a link between per capita income with per capita of foreign exchange reserves and gold and then, tried to confuse us further by accusing lionnoisy of linking per capita income with national reserves. Anyway, lionnoisy was talking about the companies' profits which is not the same as per capita income. Who can understand what kind of  quack theories you are coming up with. And you can boast that your economics is so great.....<br><br>In your latest reply, there's not much content in what you write, mostly just personal attacks. <strong><span style="color: red;">I don't want to spend that much time personally attacking you because i don't want to be dragged down to your sinkingly low level, which is the pits.</span></strong> You are indeed exceptionally arrogant, which is proven when you said:<br><strong><br>''To the best of my knowledge, there are so many participants in this Speakers' Corner, and since the date of my joining this sgForum; and over the five odd years, I had some fun grinding four or five frauds - who are no better than parrots. Yet I have no problems with quite a few regular contributors, who have shown their brilliance in ORIGINAL THINKING; and have largely not challenged the personal views of the larger population of regular contributors.''</strong></div>

You are the FIRST person who came up with the term, high per capita income, not lionnoisy. Lionnoisy was talking about the companies <span style="color: red;">profits</span> in comparison with the per capita of foreign exchange reserves and gold. You put the word <span style="color: red;">'per capita income' </span>in lionnoisy's mouth when you made the statement above.<br><br><strong>''You seem to be continuously fixxated with the idea that I am ''the first person who tried to draw a link between per capita income with per capita of foreign exchange reserves and gold''.<br><br>Did you read the opening post from lionnoisy that started this thread ?<br><br>Did you not read the first line that was printed in his statement ?<br><br>''Per capita of TOP 10 Reserves of foreign exchange and gold in absolute value''<br><br>Am I the first person, or should not this credit go to lionnoisy ?<br><br>If you are not too clever in reading, can we trust your judgement with facts ?''</strong><br><br>You are the person who picked the quote from the report, <strong>"Singapore : </strong><strong>New Poor and Social Cohesion''</strong>, which was talking about <span style="color: red;">per capita GDP and per capita income</span>. After reading that, you developed some quack theories to use in your argument against lionnoisy. And you made the boo-boo right towards the end when you said <strong>''but the fact remains true that a boastful high Per Capita income based on National Reserves is nothing more then self-delusionary.'' </strong><br><br><strong><span style="color: red;">Hello!!!!!!! per capita income is not the same as per capita foreign exchange reserves and gold. </span></strong>You seem to only like to read what you write, since you write such long ego boosting statements about yourself...as if  the world cares.
