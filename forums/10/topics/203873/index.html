            <div class='col-md body'>From what I read, this is a specialist medical report, requiring a specialist to give an opinion with respect to the medical condition. A specialist report is often requested for insurance purposes, or to determine suitability for NS training, claims for work injuries, appeals in license renewal etc. It is also a medico-legal document which can and often is submitted to the courts in legal proceedings.<br><br>The preparation of a specialist medical report will require a specialist (not necessarily and often not the patient's doctor, who may have moved elsewhere) to review the case notes and form an opinion with regard to the question raised ie. whether the person is suitable for a job or NS training, or the likelihood of recovery from a work injury.<br><br>Depending on the complexity of the case, it often takes an hour or longer to prepare a specialist report. The charges reflect the time taken by the specialist to prepare that report, during which time he is taken away from his routine work and cannot see patients or perform other procedures.<br><br>If all the patient needs is to photocopy the case notes, it would be much cheaper but a stack of notes with unintelligible medical jargon would not be useful for most people. Actually, the cost is not that high if we consider how much it would cost to go to a lawyer just to make a statutory declaration. All the lawyer has to do is to certify that you have signed the statement that you yourself have prepared and the process takes a few minutes. But you expect to pay just as much, if not more.</div>
