              <p>Foreign superpowers eye Australia</p>
              <p>By Florence Chong</p>
              <p>February 18, 2008 05:17am<br>Article from: The Australian</p>
              <p>AUSTRALIA has attracted sizeable investments from some of the world's biggest and most established sovereign wealth funds.</p>
              <p>The
              most active are arguably the Singapore twins - Temasek and the
              Government of Investment Corporation - both of which have long been
              players in key sectors of the Australian economy.</p>
              <p>Neither Temasek
              nor GIC publish the value of assets by locations, but collectively they
              easily own more than $20 billion of holdings in Australia.</p>
              <p>Combined,
              the two Singapore investors represent the world's second-largest
              sovereign wealth fund, with assets totalling $US489 billion ($539
              billion), according to Morgan Stanley.</p>
              <p>But in coming years, the
              Singapore investors may be overshadowed by the new "financial
              superpower" - China Investment Corporation, China's sovereign wealth
              fund formally launched last year.</p>

              <p><br>but once china acquire the australian asset, it will mean China will dictate the price isnt it? Actually australia is also the main culprit causing global inflation because they are the one who keep jacking up price of coals and iron ore.</p>

              <p><br>You mean Iron can't be substituted with other metals if it gets too costly (if price is dictated by a monopoly)?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Having market power only constitutes a oligopoly, not a monopoly which can dictate price.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>First of all, Exxon-Mobil don't dictate the price of pump prices, it works on the general concensus of all the major petroleum company. That's why when any of the petrol companies in Singapore increase or lower their price, their competitors will follow suit, it's not like they dictate the price. Moreover the shares are freely traded (unlike other government controlled companies in Singapore), if you believe that they will make more money then invest your money there.</p>

              <p>First of all, Exxon-Mobil don't dictate the price of pump prices, it works on the general concensus of all the major petroleum company. That's why when any of the petrol companies in Singapore increase or lower their price, their competitors will follow suit, it's not like they dictate the price. Moreover the shares are freely traded (unlike other government controlled companies in Singapore), if you believe that they will make more money then invest your money there.</p>

              <p><em></em></p>
              <p>You are talking nonsense, when you said China can dictate prices by taking over ALL of Australia's Iron Ore companies. Even if they take over all of the Australian Companies they are NOT the single producer, there are still producers around.</p>

              <p>There are lots of other substitutes for Iron, other non-ferrous alloys.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>"Nonferrous metals and nonferrous alloys are not based on iron and include alloys of aluminum, copper, titanium, zinc, nickel, cobalt, tungsten, precious metals, and refractory metals. They are used in a variety of applications from construction to medical devices. A nonferrous alloy consists of two or more materials, one of which must be a nonferrous metal. Many nonferrous metals can be used in alloys and are chosen for specific characteristics such as strength, magnetic and electrical properties, and corrosion resistance. Some of these are transition metals, meaning they belong to the d-block in the periodic table and are elements which form an ion with a partially filled d-shell of electrons. Transition metals include zirconium, a silvery white metal; hafnium, a greyish metal; osmium, a blue-black metal; and tantalum, a rare, blue-gray metal. These nonferrous metals are used to create compounds such as aluminum zirconium, a common ingredient in antiperspirants, and osmium tetroxide, a volatile catalyst used to hasten chemical reactions. Other nonferrous metals and nonferrous alloys include copper beryllium, which is used for electronic components, and beryllium oxide, which is used for its electrical insulating properties.<br><br>Nonferrous metals and nonferrous alloys are useful in many applications because of their versatility, high density, and tensile strength. For example, tantalum sheet metal is used frequently to create surgical instruments because it does not react with bodily fluids and is corrosion resistant. Some nonferrous metals and nonferrous alloys are highly combustible and volatile, including powder zirconium, which may be stored under water for safety, and beryllium oxide, which is highly toxic if inhaled. Welding zirconium is also available. Nonferrous metals and nonferrous alloys are useful for applications requiring nonmagnetic, lightweight, high strength compounds. Since nonferrous metals and nonferrous alloys have high melting points, they are also often used in electrical and electronic applications."</em></p>

              <p>You should know better, sand which is a major component of buildings was banned by the Indonesian government, but still we managed to place less reliance on sand and search for other alternatives. You should understand the human endeavour, whenever there is an obstacle, humans will certainly find ways to work around that obstacle. Surely, when all our non-renewable resources are used up, you don't expect humans to just sit there and say "now that there is no oil (or any other non-renewable resources), we will just sit here and die", without thinking of any alternative solutions.</p>

              <p>If Exxon Mobil restrict production, price goes up, Shell increases production, won't that run contrary to Exxon's intention of increasing prices. Price dictation or fixing will not happen without collusion in an oligopoly.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Say Brazil Iron and Oz Iron, both sell 100 tonnes each at $1,000. Oz Iron cuts production to 50 tonnes. The price shoots up to $1,500 per tonnne.</p>
              <p>Brazil Iron still producing at 100 tonnes makes $150,000, while Oz Iron who cut production to inflate price makes $75,000. Who does it benefit?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Dictating price can only happen in a Monopoly.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I hope this helps your understanding. I only disagree on your understanding of dictating prices and monopoly.</p>

              <p>The reason why cartels are not sustainable is well-explained by the <a title="Prisoner's dilemma" href="/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma"><span style="color: #0000ff;">prisoner's dilemma</span></a>. The dilemma reads as follows:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Two suspects, A and B, are arrested by the police. The police have insufficient evidence for a conviction, and, having separated both prisoners, visit each of them to offer the same deal: if one testifies for the prosecution against the other and the other remains silent, the betrayer goes free and the silent accomplice receives the full 10-year sentence. If both stay silent, both prisoners are sentenced to only six months in jail for a minor charge. If each betrays the other, each receives a five-year sentence. Each prisoner must make the choice of whether to betray the other or to remain silent. However, neither prisoner knows for sure what choice the other prisoner will make. So this dilemma poses the question: How should the prisoners act?</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>The dilemma can be summarized thus:</p>
              <p>As can be seen, by staying silent (cooperating) both prisoners are better off than in the case where both decide to betray (deviate from the agreement, that is, competing). Nevertheless, if only one of the two prisoners betray while the other stays silent, the former would be free, which is still more desirable for him than having to stay in prison for six months. Exactly the same occurs in a cartel: while their members are better-off being part to the agreement than competing, deviating (for example by reducing one's price) could imply capturing a big amount of the market demand and making big profits. In other words, the members of a cartel always have an incentive to deviate from their agreement which explains why cartels are generally difficult to sustain in the long run. Empirical studies of <a title="20th century" href="/wiki/20th_century"><span style="color: #0000ff;">20th century</span></a> cartels have determined that the mean duration of discovered cartels is from 5 to 8 years. However, once a cartel is broken, the incentives to form the cartel return and the cartel may be re-formed.</p>
              <p>Whether the members of a cartel will choose to cheat on the agreement will depend on whether the short term returns to cheating outweigh the medium and long term losses which result from the possible breakdown of the cartel (this is why, also in the Prisoner's dilemma game, the equilibrium varies if the game is played once or if it is, instead, a repeated game). The relative size of these two factors depend in part on how difficult it is for firms to monitor whether the agreement is being adhered to and on the importance of short-run gains relative to the long-run gain. The longer the time firms in the cartel can cheat without detection, the greater the gains from doing so. Therefore, if monitoring is difficult, the higher the probability that some part to the agreement will cheat and the more unsustainable the cartel will be.</p>
              <p>There are several factors that will affect the firms' ability to monitor a cartel:<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="/forums/10/topics/#_note-8"><span style="color: #0000ff;">[9]</span></a></sup></p>

              <p><em>"Up until the 1930s economics involved a great deal of mathematics and numbers, but almost all of this was either superficial or irrelevant. It was used, for the most part, to provide uselessly precise formulations and solutions to problems which were intrinsically vague. Economics found itself in a state similar to that of physics of the 17th century: still waiting for the development of an appropriate language in which to express and resolve its problems. While physics had found its language in the </em><a class="mw-redirect" title="Infinitesimal calculus" href="/wiki/Infinitesimal_calculus"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>infinitesimal calculus</em></span></a><em>, von Neumann proposed the language of </em><a title="Game theory" href="/wiki/Game_theory"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>game theory</em></span></a><em> and a </em><a class="mw-redirect" title="General equilibrium theory" href="/wiki/General_equilibrium_theory"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>general equilibrium theory</em></span></a><em> for economics.</em></p>
              <p><em>His first significant contribution was the </em><a class="mw-redirect" title="Minimax theorem" href="/wiki/Minimax_theorem"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>minimax theorem</em></span></a><em> of 1928. This theorem establishes that in certain </em><a title="Zero-sum" href="/wiki/Zero-sum"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>zero sum games</em></span></a><em> involving perfect information (in which players know a priori the strategies of their opponents as well as their consequences), there exists one strategy which allows both players to minimize their maximum losses (hence the name minimax). When examining every possible strategy, a player must consider all the possible responses of the player's adversary and the maximum loss. The player then plays out the strategy which will result in the minimization of this maximum loss. Such a strategy, which minimizes the maximum loss, is called optimal for both players just in case their minimaxes are equal (in absolute value) and contrary (in sign). If the common value is zero, the game becomes pointless.</em></p>
              <p><em>Von Neumann eventually improved and extended the minimax theorem to include games involving imperfect information and games with more than two players.

              <p><em>Von Neumann's second important contribution in this area was the solution, in 1937, of a problem first described by </em><a class="mw-redirect" title="Leon Walras" href="/wiki/Leon_Walras"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>Leon Walras</em></span></a><em> in 1874, the existence of situations of equilibrium in mathematical models of market development based on supply and demand.

If both remain silent, both prisoners are sentenced to only six months in jail for a minor charge. If each betrays the other, each receives a five-year sentence.

Actually australia is also the main culprit causing global inflation because they are the one who keep jacking up price of coals and iron ore."</em></p>
              <p>You are talking nonsense, when you said China can dictate prices by taking over ALL of Australia's Iron Ore companies. Even if they take over all of the Australian Companies they are NOT the single producer, there are still producers around.</p>

              <p>There are lots of other substitutes for Iron, other non-ferrous alloys.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>"Nonferrous metals and nonferrous alloys are not based on iron and include alloys of aluminum, copper, titanium, zinc, nickel, cobalt, tungsten, precious metals, and refractory metals. They are used in a variety of applications from construction to medical devices. A nonferrous alloy consists of two or more materials, one of which must be a nonferrous metal. Many nonferrous metals can be used in alloys and are chosen for specific characteristics such as strength, magnetic and electrical properties, and corrosion resistance. Some of these are transition metals, meaning they belong to the d-block in the periodic table and are elements which form an ion with a partially filled d-shell of electrons. Transition metals include zirconium, a silvery white metal; hafnium, a greyish metal; osmium, a blue-black metal; and tantalum, a rare, blue-gray metal. These nonferrous metals are used to create compounds such as aluminum zirconium, a common ingredient in antiperspirants, and osmium tetroxide, a volatile catalyst used to hasten chemical reactions. Other nonferrous metals and nonferrous alloys include copper beryllium, which is used for electronic components, and beryllium oxide, which is used for its electrical insulating properties.<br><br>Nonferrous metals and nonferrous alloys are useful in many applications because of their versatility, high density, and tensile strength. For example, tantalum sheet metal is used frequently to create surgical instruments because it does not react with bodily fluids and is corrosion resistant. Some nonferrous metals and nonferrous alloys are highly combustible and volatile, including powder zirconium, which may be stored under water for safety, and beryllium oxide, which is highly toxic if inhaled. Welding zirconium is also available. Nonferrous metals and nonferrous alloys are useful for applications requiring nonmagnetic, lightweight, high strength compounds. Since nonferrous metals and nonferrous alloys have high melting points, they are also often used in electrical and electronic applications."</em></p>

              <p>You should know better, sand which is a major component of buildings was banned by the Indonesian government, but still we managed to place less reliance on sand and search for other alternatives. You should understand the human endeavour, whenever there is an obstacle, humans will certainly find ways to work around that obstacle. Surely, when all our non-renewable resources are used up, you don't expect humans to just sit there and say "now that there is no oil (or any other non-renewable resources), we will just sit here and die", without thinking of any alternative solutions.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If Exxon Mobil restrict production, price goes up, Shell increases production, won't that run contrary to Exxon's intention of increasing prices. Price dictation or fixing will not happen without collusion in an oligopoly.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Say Brazil Iron and Oz Iron, both sell 100 tonnes each at $1,000. Oz Iron cuts production to 50 tonnes. The price shoots up to $1,500 per tonnne.</p>
              <p>Brazil Iron still producing at 100 tonnes makes $150,000, while Oz Iron who cut production to inflate price makes $75,000. Who does it benefit?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Dictating price can only happen in a Monopoly.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I hope this helps your understanding. I only disagree on your understanding of dictating prices and monopoly.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>To proof my point, I would like to ask you, based on your knowledge on material, can you tell us which metal do you think has very similar or better mechanical properties as iron and is economically viable to replace iron? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>Sands? Although they are use in construction industry, but they are very different in the nature as compared to mining for iron ore and coal because</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1) They are not an internationally traded commodity</p>
              <p>2) Easily collected from the riverbed with simple crane and bardge</p>
              <p>3) They dont need expensive processing to turn ore into steel</p>
              <p>4) There are many supplier in the market.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In an oligopoly, there is always the dominant company and they are usually the price leader. Just like when Phillip Morris annouce price adjustment for their Marlboro brands, all other premium tobacco companies will follow.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There to 2 things which the steel mills and mining companies negotiate, PRICE and ALLOCATION, and such negotiations are done on a quarterly basis.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In a seller market, such negotiation can become very complex. e.g. mining companies can offer the mills an attractive price, but they might not necessary give them quantity you need to keep their mills running.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>At the moment, it is the seller market and China being the largest importer of iron ore in the world, despite them being one of the largest producer, are taken hostage by these mining companies. And that is the reason why the recent move by BHP to acquire Rio Tinto is causing so much fear to the Chinese government. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Back to my point about dictating price, suppose if China (the largest buyer in the world) is to acquire Rio Tinto, they will not have allocation worries and they will be able to dictate the price as they will become both buyer and seller.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Another thing which you might want to know is that buying iron ore and coal is not like how you will do your grocery shopping where you can switch brands anytime you like because iron ore do comes in different grade. And the orgin of the material will also affect have an impact on the cost because transportation is a big cost component in this business. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The business dealing between companies in the mining and steel industry is a very complex one, and one which you cant simply use elementary case study (like the one above) to represent.</p>

              <p>I think we can all agree that Foreign relations is a very complex subject.</p>
              <p>I doubt if China's interest in Australia is solely for it's resources as China has resources of it's own.</p>
              <p>Just as an example, if China expressed interest in Australia's coal and mineral mining companies, it may simply be because they want to improve the collection of their own resources in China and one way is to invest SWF in an Aussie company then give that company access to mines in China. The company's value goes up and the initial SWF investment appreciates and China gets to collect it's minerals more efficiently.</p>
              <p>The downside is that the money circulates outside Australia and the company's prosperity boom artificially boosts the country's economic statistics without there being any relevant benefits to the local economy and people. Australia effectively loses the benefits that company may have brought to the economy (eg jobs, training, money etc).</p>
              <p>China can then take the trained staff PRC staff and set up their own expert companies, first selling off the stock they bought earlier in these Aussie Companies and reinvesting it in their own.</p>
              <p>I think we need new economic theories for "global" markets as the old ones don't work so good and can get pretty misleading.</p>

              <p><em>China's iron ore are not suitable for making high grade steel sheet which are required for the booming auto industry. And that is why mills from China, Korea and Japan have to continue suck up to BHP and Rio Tinto despite the high prices. </em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Iron ore and coal are very important commodities for fast growing developing country like China. Although China is resource rich, but they will also have to preserve them for future generation, just like how USA is preserving their Alaskan oil field.</p>
              <p> </p>

Kobe Steel is currently making sample bars of 10 mm in diameter and 100 mm in length. It is also working to establish the technology to mass-produce bars, wire rods, shapes and plates made of the alloy.<br><br>"This value-added aluminum is suitable in applications where high performance is required," said Senior Researcher Hideo Hata at Kobe Steel's Materials Research Laboratory. "By 2008, we're aiming to commercialize the new material for use in special purpose vehicles - such as race cars - and aircraft and aerospace parts," he said.<br><br>The new aluminum alloy, under patent application, has a tensile strength of 780MPa, 10% higher than the 710 MPa of Weldalite(R), an aluminum-lithium alloy developed by Lockheed Martin Corporation and used in the External Fuel Tank of the Space Shuttle. The ductility of Kobe Steel's new alloy is also high. Generally speaking, as strength increases, material workability goes down. However, with a breaking elongation of 14%, Kobe Steel's new material has nearly three times the ductility of Weldalite's 5%. Ductility is 1.4 times that of titanium alloy and maraging steel. In addition, the new alloy has one of the highest specific strengths (the tensile strength divided by the density of the new material). The higher the specific strength, the lighter and stronger the material is.<br><br>Spray forming Process<br><br>In spray forming, molten metal is "sprayed" into droplets and is quickly quenched as it turns from a liquid to solid state. Molten metal in an induction furnace flows out of a small hole in the bottom of the furnace. Nitrogen gas is blown as the molten metal exits the hole, atomizing the material into a fine mist of droplets. The droplets accumulate and solidify into a preform on a table. Spray forming prevents the segregation of high-density alloy elements and enables melting with a uniform, fine microstructure. This is impossible to achieve using conventional melting and casting processes.<br><br>Utilizing these characteristics of the process, Kobe Steel succeeded in creating an alloy with a uniform and fine microstructure. Zinc, magnesium and copper are added to strengthen the material. In conventional melting and casting processes, when the amount of the alloy elements is increased, segregation during solidification and a coarsening of the material structure occurs. This limits the amount of the alloy elements. However, Kobe Steel's spray forming process clears these problems.<br><br>Kobe Steel originally began using a spray-forming process developed by Sandvik Osprey Ltd. in the United Kingdom. It later developed its own spray-forming process for the manufacture of aluminum alloys. Kobe Steel's spray-forming technology is currently used by subsidiary Kobelco Research Institute, Inc. to produce aluminum alloy target material used in the thin-film wiring of liquid crystal display panels. As the sample pieces of the new aluminum alloy are made by the same spray-forming equipment used to produce target material, Kobe Steel will be able to achieve volume production of the new alloy in a relatively short time. Metal ingots of up to 240 kg in weight can be produced to make large parts.<br><br>

              <p>One simple question. Just answer this.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Since you said it is possible for a company in oligopoly structure to dictate price, you must have some sort of proof to substantiate it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Which company in the oligopoly structure you are referring to is dictating the price of iron and petrol in the world?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you can't substantiate with evidence, then there is no point arguing.</p>

              <p>In the first place, my purpose in this forum is different from yours, I am not here to look for arguement.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>With regards to the the word "dictating price", I used that under the circumstances that if China (being the world biggest buyer of iron ore) buying into Rio Tinto (one of the world largest mining company).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When talking about oligopoly, I talk about PRICE LEADER not price dictator.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Have you given up trying to answer my question concerning replacing iron with other metals??</p>
