And to ask such questions show that you might not even be one  or just a person out to add fire to other civil servants. Even if you are one who is paid 4k , your position would have already made you aware of the obligations that come with it which obviously you are not aware of.

            <div class='col-md body'>Some businessmen make obscene profit from Singaporeans and yet nobody complain. On the other hand, always like to pick on civil servants and their average pay. No doubt, there are some slackers in the civil service that don't deserve their pay. This happens in all organisations. However, in general, I don't see civil servants being overpaid. I don't think that they are disproportionately well-off for any given years of working experience.</div>
