              <p>Do we need to wait till our friends become retrenched before acknowledging the problem is at our door ?</p>
              <p>If that is the trend of this generation of Singaporeans, is it any wonder that even the youthful and inexperienced PM can calmly state - <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.orientexpat.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=604">“Unemployment Rate in Singapore – May 2009 climb from 3.7 percent – and may rise to about 5 percent even as the economy develops”  </a></p>
              <p>In response to the 1987 and 1997 economic downturns, there were separate Economic Review Committee set up during those respective years that collated reports from several sub-committees.</p>
              <p>On both occasions, both set of ERC had submitted recommendations for the Government to release the vast sum of CPF to Singaporeans that will provide capital for enterprising Singaporeans to set up new businesses.</p>
              <p>It was reported that a strong local enterprise environment - that caters to local demands - can complement and even support the MNCs, which will also lead to a vibrant employment condition that is less wage sensitive.</p>
              <p>The ERC reported that too much of our money is locked up in the CPF - as well as too many regulations exist - that prevent local enterprise to take shape.</p>
              <p>While regulations have been relaxed that saw HDB homes being allowed to be used as registered business addresses - (with safeguards from being seized as recoverable assets in failed businesses) - the government ignored the other recommendations for relaxation in the hoarding of cash into the CPF.</p>
              <p>The Government has been treating Singaporeans as economic digits to fit into the industrial cogs that they planned to combined with foreign MNCs, and has no plans to build creative and independently enterprising Singaporeans to be successful.</p>
              <p>Singaporean workers could have been helped to be less dependent on MNCs for employment by providing "micro-loans for Singapore enterprises" - <a rel="nofollow" href="/forums/10/topics/358646">‘instead of starting such financial schemes in China’.  </a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For more ways to protect Singaporean Workers - try reading up on CSJ book - "Your Future, My Faith, Our Freedom" published in 2001.</p>
              <p>The Foreword of the book reads as follow:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><span style="font-style: italic;">"Like all good fairy tales, the Singapore Story as narrated by the ruling People's Action Party (PAP), needs to be read with a generous measure of make-believe and fantasy. Touted as the 'Boston of the East', 'Intelligent Island', and a hub for everything from the liberal arts to the life sciences, Singapore is held up as the model for developing countries, especially autocratic ones. Singaporeans continue to be told that they can ride into a secure and prosperous future only if they stick with the PAP rule.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-style: italic;">'Your Future, My Faith, Our Freedom' scoops away the public-relations puff and examines the going-ons behind the facade. It finds a startling and disturbing reality. Questions about the sustainability of a system that exploits rather than inspires, subjugates rather than serves are beginning to surface. The economy, social security system, distribution of wealth, and society in general are starting to creak under the weight of four decades of authoritarian rule.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Why has Singapore's economy become so shaky? Why is the CPF system in such a mess? Is the problem of income disparity more serious than the PAP lets on? The book analyses these questions and argues that without democratic reform, Singapore is headed for an increasingly troubled future. It calls for Singaporeans to heed the unmistakable signs of a weary and waning system, and makes vital proposals for an alternative, democratic one. It is essential reading not only for Singaporeans, but also for those who seek to understand better the Singapore system.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Fairy tales also make good bedtime stories. Unfortunately, this is not a time for Singaporeans to become somnolent."</span></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The above was written in Year 2001 - and with the years passing to the ninth year, Singapore continue to be in the doldrum.</p>

              <p><br>Discuss ?</p>
              <p>Yes, alot to discuss by the President of the Singapore Employer Association, the Sec-General from NTUC - who is a PAP Minister without Portfolio, and the Manpower Minister.</p>
              <p>The second tier discussion by representatives from the Tripartite Arrangement is a mere formal wayang kulit show to give the impression of "discussion" taking place.</p>
              <p>The outcome has already been clearly decided at Tier ONE - do you think that is any serious discussion taking place ?</p>
              <p>If serious discussions had taken place to represent the REAL VOICE of Singaporeans, do you think that there will be continuous moanings of the inability to meet with the high costs of living ?</p>
              <p>What is taking place at the NWC discussion is a political model from the two tier system designed by LKY that protect the political freedom of the elites to make decisions without hindrance.</p>
              <p>It exist in the PAP - where the larger membership has no say on who forms the CEC that rule the party.</p>
              <p>It exist in the two tier arrangement to pacify Singaporean's hunger for political involvment with the creation of the Town Council Election that allow Singaporeans to be involved in the daily management of events that affect our living environment; but neutralised our demand for a voice on National Matters.</p>
              <p>Don't take what you see too seriously in Singapore.</p>

              <p>My view is that in singapore 's situation, the common singaporean is screwed because no matter how much additional retraining they go through, there will always be a foreign worker equally skilled who will work for a wage that is less than what the singaporean can work for.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If the singaporean worker reduces his wage rate to match that of the foreign worker, the foreign worker will adjust her wage even lower.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hence wages will keep getting depressed until a level whereby it makes no sense  - low salary doesn't even cover the basic costs of living, accomodation, retirement needs, childrens' schooling etc. (that's when people say the singapore worker is choosy) <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>The attitude of most local businesses in hiring more foreign workers is that - when profit margins can be increased through a larger volume of business conducted due to more hands being available - the additional costs and inconveniences are tolerable.</p>
              <p>There are many ways to circumvent the quota-ratio in the number of Singaporeans to Foreign Workers hired.</p>
              <p>If the Manpower Ministry should vigorously check the accuracy of the information given during the application by successful businesses in engaging foreign workers, it will probably result in the Singapore economy becoming punctured.</p>
              <p>This is similar to the Traffic Police vigorously enforcing the traffic rule of 70 kmh speed limit on all Singapore roads - unless otherwise indicated - can the Singapore Economy survive the speed of 70 kmh ? </p>
              <p>If it had not been drivers taking the risk to exceed the road speed limit that is blindly administered and selectively enforced, Singapore would have been a sleepy and mediocre town and not a bustling, energetic city that everyone know</p>

              <p>The attitude of most local businesses in hiring more foreign workers is that - when profit margins can be increased through a larger volume of business conducted due to more hands being available - the additional costs and inconveniences are tolerable.</p>
              <p>There are many ways to circumvent the quota-ratio in the number of Singaporeans to Foreign Workers hired.</p>
              <p>If the Manpower Ministry should vigorously check the accuracy of the information given during the application by successful businesses in engaging foreign workers, it will probably result in the Singapore economy becoming punctured.</p>
              <p>This is similar to the Traffic Police vigorously enforcing the traffic rule of 70 kmh speed limit on all Singapore roads - unless otherwise indicated - can the Singapore Economy survive the speed of 70 kmh ? </p>
              <p>If it had not been drivers taking the risk to exceed the road speed limit that is blindly administered and selectively enforced, Singapore would have been a sleepy and mediocre town and not a bustling, energetic city that everyone know</p>

              <p>Kindly enlighten me on how is it possible for legally conducted businesses to circumvent the red tape set by the government without running aflout of the law? With the traffic drive limit set at 70kmh, it clearly means that drivers can have the luxury to drive up till 70kmh which is classified as the best recommended driving limit without endangering anyone life.</p>
              <p>Putting it into the business propective, the dependency quota is best recommended for businesses in the open market to keep their overhead down by hiring low wages foreigners. This act as a form of incentives for business to substain and to remain competitive in the open market. To hire a certain percentage of skilled Singaporean workers as pre-requistic is to mediate between profit and shared social responsibility. </p>
