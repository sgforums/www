              <p>I think a better yardstick is using Discretionary Income after deducting all necessities. Singapore's CPI has risen 9 points or so since 2005. And OZ as a country average edge close to 10, not much difference but in different cities, you see the difference with Sydney much better off than us but cities like Darwin, Brisbane has CPI increase pushing close to 11 or 12. This means their necessities spending like FOOD has increase much more than Singapore and which only means that their extra income would go more to spending on necessities.</p>
              <p>If the absolute amount is the best way to measure disposable income, then Malaysians or even Indonesians would be so happy. Every month, my colleagues in Indonesia would have MILLIONS of disposable income.</p>

              <p>All  I can say is choose your poison.</p>
              <p>Singapore is both an expensive and a cheap place to live in. Australia is also both an expensive and a cheap place to live in.</p>
              <p>Singapore is bloody expensive when it comes to luxuries but necessities like food is by no means expensive.</p>
              <p>Australia is so cheap when it comes to things like cars etc but food wise, its gonna cost you a fair bit.</p>
              <p>What I am saying is, every country is different and what you have at the end of the day after deducting your taxes, what you decide to spend it on decides whether you would have enough.</p>

              <p>Recently, the ABC's <em>Four Corners</em> program went behind the
              numbers to tell the very real story of four Australian families unable
              to obtain what most of us take for granted, a home. They are the new
              face of homelessness in this country.</p>
              <p>Their
              stories are backed up by the numbers. In 2006, 7,483 families were
              homeless, an increase of 17% since 2001. Of the 105,000 Australians
              defined as homeless, 26% or 26,790 people were in families with
              children and 12% were under the age of 12, just like those kids we saw
              on the program.</p>
              <p>It is necessary to take a
              bipartisan approach on this issue. The Federal housing minister, Tanya
              Plibersek, has combined her moral compassion with dedication to keep
              this issue before her government that I happily commend.</p>

              <p>No more serious than the situation in Singapore.  It's just that Australia doesn't have a policy of locking addicts out of public sight, screwing their eyes shut, sticking their fingers in their ears and screaming "LALALALALALALALA" to pretend that there's no problem, you dumb cocksucker.</p>

              <p>Wait a minute, just a couple of months ago you were harping on the idea that Singapore has a higher GDP per Capita than US, Australia, Switzerland and Japan, therefore a better standard of living. Now you are eating up your own words and telling me otherwise? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> Do you want me to dig out your post? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You know why Australian newspaper report news even if it looks the Australian government look bad? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>Who controls the press in Singapore? Who controls the press in Australia?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have real life experiences where an incompetent Singaporean polyclinic doctor diagnosed my reactive lymph node as thyroid disease. Was asked to go for a series of blood test. After the blood test, I was told by another doctor that the other doctor misdiagnosed me. While I was being treated by the first doctor, the pharmacy called up, asked her about the prescription for a certain drug given to a patient, apparently she had overdosed the patient 10 times, because 0.5 became a 5. She used to be from Marine Parade polyclinic, her name is M.Y. Ang. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>Just recently this year, my friend's mom was diagnosed with high probability of shingles by a GP. When she was admitted to Tan Tock Seng Hospital A&amp;E, the attending physician told my friend that his mom definitely 100% don't have shingles. It was after she was warded that a specialist diagnose her with shingles, it really pissed my friend off. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>The reason why everybody thinks that our health system is very efficient is because there are no bad publications regarding them. I wonder why this is so. Would having absolute control of the media have anything to do with it. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>You post the link again to emphasize that Australia is ranked No.2 and Singapore is ranked No.23 by the UN in terms of the Human Development Index? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>You discredit the UN's system of assessment and consider your own assessment to be of higher standing than the UN's? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Inflation goes up in Singapore, but salaries go down due to excess competition from cheap PRC labour.</p>

              <p>I think you totally have no concept of disposable income and purchasing power. I suppose that the Australian dollar is like the Indonesian rupiah. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Are you telling us that Australia's infant mortality is a result of the poor healthcare system?</p>
              <p>What do you know about infant mortality?</p>
              <p>Do you know that race and genetics is a major factor in infant mortality?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Being born the way you are is also a result of genetics, your intelligence, the diseases you are likely to have in your lifetime, your height, your weight, etc. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>You can fault a country's infant mortality because of genetic inheritance, likewise I can't fault you for your level of intelligence and bigotry.</p>
              <p>From Britannica Encyclopedia, it states:</p>
              <p><em>Futhermore, genetic defects are the major known cause of pregnancy loss in developed nations, and almost half of all spontaneous abortions (miscarriages) involve a chromosomally abnormal fetus. About 30 percent of all postnatal infant mortality in developed countries is due to genetic disease.</em></p>
              <p><em><img src="http://i664.photobucket.com/albums/vv8/deepak_c/causesofinfantmortality.png" alt=""></em></p>
              <p><a href="http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/228874/human-genetic-disease#ref=ref846010">http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/228874/human-genetic-disease#ref=ref846010</a></p>
              <p>The bar chart below shows the rate of racial infant mortality under the same healthcare system. It shows that Asians (doesn't just relate to Chinese, but I would think that the Chinese have better survival rate than the other Asians, notwithstanding Japanese) have a lower infant mortality rate compared to the Whites and maybe Aborigines in Australia.</p>

              <p>Food is expensive if your compare the level of disposable income.</p>
              <p>Australians earn much more but their food products are similar, if not cheaper than Singapore.</p>
              <p>This comparison was done by the author in Jan 2008, not sure if the prices still hold. I know for a fact that Australian calrose rice in Cold Storage is at least SG$15 per 5kg. Milk products and meat is definitely cheaper in Australia than Singapore.</p>
