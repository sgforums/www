Jeyaratnam, who became a one-man show when the Ruling Party manouvred to cut his supporting legs with the arrest of some Catholic Church social activists during the early 1980s - some of whom were smart young lawyers giving the administrative support to JBJ.<br><br>CSJ was similarly poorly supported in the administrative background, with poor and inept researchers that provided him with flawed data, which caused him to be slaughtered publicly by George Yeo in the much anticipated televised confrontation about the Cost of Living in Singapore.<br><br>The weakness of the Opposition cannot be entirely be due to the fault of the  Oppostion Parties, as the Ruling Party had purposefully undermined the Singaporean ability to support the Opposition either financially, or by giving moral support in the form of administrative service or otherwise.<br><br>Until Singaporeans learn to stand without fear of social or political or economic repurcussions for supporting the Opposition Parties, then we will see the development of stronger and more mature Opposition Parties.<br><br>Visit the website given in my previous post above, and you will hear the political views - of a NTU Associate Professor, Catherine Lim, CSJ, and others from the WP and PAP, as well as the views from others participating in this Forum - concerning the state of politics in Singapore, the dangers of continued state of affairs to the future of Singapore, and how Singapore can change for the better.<br><br>The road to progress is a long one, but it need us to open our minds and eyes to face new challenges with an open heart - to be brave and fearless.<br></span><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>whoa.. a little extreme to want sooo many opposition at once? But I don't mind seeing new faces in parliament. It is always good to have some opposition, some new ideas, new thoughts, new direction for Singapore. But to have so many opposition at once may spell chaos? Perhaps it would be better if some opposition members come in (pray they are the better ones), show Singapore they can do something, then slowly force a more fair election in Singapore? Then Singaporeans will benefit coz both sides will want to show/prove to the voters that they are better at managing the country.<br><br>Opposition should be made to work hard for their place in parliament (same goes for PAP of course), and should not be voted in just because PAP has been the ruling party for as many years as Singapore has been independent.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Chiam See Tong and Low Thia Khiang have proven themselves to a able MPs. Sylvia Lim, with a down-to-earth mentality, will certainly not get carried away if elected as a full-fledged MP either.<br><br>Chee Soon Juan, given his activist nature and confrontation approach, is unlikely to fill the shoes of a concerned MP caring for his residents; better to leave him as the govt spoiler.<br><br>Gandhi Ambalam, in an interview in <a href="http://i-speak.blogdrive.com/comments?id=219" rel="nofollow">Gail's blog</a>, seemed more activist rather than a concerned political hopeful. Coming from a decent educational background and having been chief editor of TCS (now mediacorp), i would expect him to exert a certain calm influence among voters; but somehow, it doesn't seem that way.<br><br>As GRC challengers, i would have liked to see the former WP West Coast GRC team led by Chia Ti Lik get voted in, as i felt they had perhaps the most credibilty and strength in depth, despite identical claims to Sylvia's Aljunied team.</div>

Perhaps it would be better if some opposition members come in (pray they are the better ones), show Singapore they can do something, then slowly force a more fair election in Singapore?
