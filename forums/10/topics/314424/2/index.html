              <p>Are you sure that other teens and young adults from other
                  countries are interested in political stuff.. come on...</p>

              <p>Dun come here and anyhow talk cork.</p>
              <p>Singapore education is not good, but all other countries ones
                  are not good either, at least most of them.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Sinaporean education is abit too follow useless rules too
                  rigidly. The result of our education makes singaporean abit too
                  inflexible. However, there are certain merits of singapore
                  education like its emphasis on continuous learning and being a well
                  rounded person. However there are still many areas of improvement.
                  Bascially, the modern educaiton system of the world is oout of
                  point. They do not bring out the best in humans.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Actually, this phenonmenon is good for businessmen. If they know
                  what is good education, they can set up the private school and earn
                  much money because the current education is quite lousy anyway in
                  teaching kids reallyuseful skills besides technical knowledge.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Singaporean education is nowhere achieving its full potential.
                  However, many other countries also faces the same problems in
                  education policies. However, parents has responsibility too. If you
                  are not happy, you can be your kids teacher, while having your
                  partner become a breadwinner.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You can hire personal teachers in singapore if you want to. This
                  kind of thing is flexible one what...</p>

              <p>If you think it is too rigid, why are you not training yourself to think outside the norm? That's what I have been training myself for recently, though I have started late. The SG education system is grossly insufficient such that someone can learn how to retire by around 40~50 (Anyway the PAP also don't want you to retire early). To be fair, so does most education systems around the world. What's the use of complaining that the education system sucks, blame the govt for it, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">then do nothing about it</span>?</p>
              <p><br>Sometimes I wonder, why do people complain so much? If there are cases where bankrupts (and PAP would considered lowly-educated) who can become a millionaire within a year in Singapore, what's stopping everyone from copying their strategies? I mean, you do learn in school about copying the strategies of those who score well, why not copy the mindset and strategies of those who earn well or do well in society?</p>
              <p>Just like you have made use of the internet to air your complains, why not at the same time make use of the internet to upgrade yourself?</p>

              <p>A bit in error, this paragraph.</p>
              <p><em><br></em></p>
              <p><em>...This class structure was clearly envisioned in the minds of Englishmen
                  and was so completely accepted that it was assumed without need to be
                  explicitly stated.</em></p>
              <p><em> In this structure, Britain was regarded as divided
                  into <strong>two groups the "classes" and the "masses."</strong></em></p>
              <p><em><strong>The "classes" were the
                  ones who had leisure.</strong></em></p>
              <p><em>This meant that they had property and income.</em></p>
              <p><em> On
                  this basis, they did not need to work for a living; they obtained an
                  education in a separate and expensive system; they married within their
                  own class; they had a distinctive accent; and, above all, they had a
                  distinctive attitude.<strong> </strong></em></p>
              <p><em><strong>This attitude was based on the training provided
                  in the special educational system of the "classes."</strong></em></p>
              <p><em>It might be summed
                  up in the statement that "methods are more important than goals" except
                  that this group regarded the methods and manners in which they acted as
                  goals or closely related to goals...</em></p>
              <p><em>...This educational system was based on three great negatives, not easily understood by Americans. </em></p>
              <p><em>These were</em></p>
              <p><em>(</em><em>a) education must <strong>not be vocational</strong>—that is, aimed at assisting one to make living; </em></p>
              <p><em>(</em><em>b) education is not aimed directly at creating or training the intelligence; and </em></p>
              <p><em>(</em><em>c)
                  education is not aimed at finding the "Truth." </em></p>
              <p><em>On its positive side,
                  the system of education of the "classes" displayed its real nature on
                  the school level rather than on the university level. </em></p>
              <p><em><strong>It aimed at
                  developing a moral outlook, a respect for traditions, qualities of
                  leadership and cooperation, and above all, perhaps, that ability for
                  cooperation in competition summed up in the English idea of "sport" and
                  "playing the game."</strong> </em></p>
              <p><em>Because of the restricted numbers of the upper
                  class in Britain, these attitudes applied chiefly to one another, and
                  did not necessarily apply to foreigners or even to the masses. They
                  applied to people who "belonged," and not to all human beings...</em></p>
