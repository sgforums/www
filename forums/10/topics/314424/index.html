              <h3 class="post-title entry-title">For the sake of your children, Singaporeans have to choose. Either protest or emigrate. Inaction is no option.</h3>
              <p>Ladies and Gentlemen,<br><br>The time has come for a decision that
              matters your children. Is it in the interests of your children to be
              educated in Singapore? If not, stay and fight for change, or leave
              Singapore. The Lees have destroyed the education system. In Singapore
              children are being turned into robots.<br><br>In every other respect,
              Singapore is declining. The economy is failing; the brain drain
              continues unabated; lawyers are becoming an endangered species; the
              judiciary is completely discredited; there is no rule of law.<br><br>If
              you find the status quo unacceptable and wish to see change, join the
              protestors now, demand for democratic change, or else, pack up and
              emigrate with your money, your family and your children.<br><br>The
              Singapore ship is on a collision course with an iceberg. Either right
              the course now, or abandon ship. Staying on deck and doing nothing is
              suicide.<br><br>Singapore education is an overly regimented system
              where children are subject to a multitude of pointless unnecessary
              rules, even infants being forced to obey them under pain of punishment;
              a system which destroys any possibility of their developing an
              independent spirit and spontaneity; where obedience to rules is a way
              of life and considered the highest virtue.<br><br>From an early age,
              they are driven like robots, to merely do as they are told; to embrace
              authority, where any attempt to question it is immediately considered
              bad manners.<br><br>Homework, lots and lots of it, has to be handed in
              on time and any deviation from schedule it is punished severely.
              Children being overwhelmed with school work suppresses the natural
              tendency in them for play and frolic, an important part of childhood
              development.</p>
              <p>As a result they lose all spontaneity, they lose their
              curiosity, and they lose their childhood and from an early age are
              transformed almost into adults, with schedules, time tables and
              appointment diaries.<br><br>The education system in Singapore destroys
              their childhood, which in turn affects their performance and analytical
              and thinking abilities in their adulthood.<br><br>Secondary school and
              college students are deliberately brainwashed into believing that any
              opposition to Lee Kuan Yew and his son, the Prime Minister, is a bad
              thing and if someone were to indulge in such activity, although legal
              under the law, is warned that his future in Singapore is ruined, due to
              government reprisals and persecution.<br><br>This indoctrination and
              brainwashing of young men is aggravated by national service where they
              are yet again told to obey military orders and respect authority
              unconditionally. They are programmed into thinking that their rulers
              can never be wrong and if left to the rulers, they will be provided
              with food work housing everything. This in turn dampens any
              entrepreneurial spirit, where reliance on the government becomes a way
              of life.<br><br>As a result of this indoctrination and brainwashing
              over several years, you are left with young adults going into the work
              force unable to think analytically or independently.<br><br>Particularly
              noticeable is the universal lack of interest in anything else other
              than their job. No knowledge of political systems. No knowledge of the
              constitution. Or their rights. Or about the rest of the world. It seems
              to me, all they are concerned is to go to work, do what they are told,
              and try to make as much money as they can. What they fail to realize
              is, they can make much more money if they knew a bit more about things
              other than just work.<br><br>For instance they do not realize they have
              rights as citizens, that the government is beholden to them and not the
              other way round. They don’t seem to understand any of this.<br><br>I
              met 5 young Singaporeans by chance at Chinatown Restaurant along
              Sacramento Street, in San Francisco on Friday last. To my question,
              they said they knew of Dr. Chee Soon Juan but had never met him.
              Questioned on their thoughts of the government, they gave the standard
              answers; that the PAP have more experience in government whereas the
              opposition did not; that they were waiting for Lee Kuan Yew to die for
              greater freedom and the usual other mouthwash. They were much more
              interested in telling me about their work in the American company in
              Singapore and how much money they were making. Nothing else interested
              them.<br><br>Needless to say, they had never heard of John Stuart Mill
              and his “Liberty” and no doubt they will never hear of it their entire
              life!<br><br>Not interested in the lack of human rights in Singapore.
              Not interested whether Lee Kuan Yew paid himself $3.7 a year or double
              that! I got the distinct impression, that they did not have strong
              views about anything, just programmed to follow the leader. No doubt,
              despite their book learning, they were just wasted lives. Very sad
              indeed.<br><br>They would not have turned out that way had they an
              education in USA, UK Australia New Zealand or Europe. In western
              schools discipline is balanced with humanity and compassion.</p>
              <p>Completely
              opposed to the Singapore’s regimented system, western schools give
              foremost importance to the fact that each child is an individual. Each
              is different. Each has his strengths and weaknesses. The weaknesses are
              not necessarily bad as with time, they can turn into strengths. And
              allowing the child to develop independent thinking and respecting it
              even if it is not necessarily what the mainstream might expect.<br><br>These
              children grow up into very robust individuals. Individuals who will
              stand on their own anytime anywhere with no fear to question authority
              if that is what is necessary.<br><br>In Singapore on the other hand,
              children have no views at all. Right and wrong becomes irrelevant.
              Obedience means everything. For instance, no Singapore student has
              questioned why they are not allowed to hold student protest in campus!
              The rule says no, and that is enough for them!<br><br>After the regular
              dosage of indoctrination and brainwashing over the years, these
              children lack the ability to compete with children from the west in the
              global marketplace. For jobs requiring compliance to a set of orders,
              they will do well. But if it is to think of new ideas and new ways to
              stay ahead, they will fail.<br><br>Singaporeans parents who submit
              their children to years of this regimen in their schools are almost
              committing a crime upon them. You are destroying their minds. In the
              end, after the Singapore administration has finished with them, you are
              left with a spiritless soulless spineless follower, not a leader with
              an independent mind.<br><br>A western educated child, who because of
              certain personal convictions, and questions authority, takes
              responsibility for his decisions. And from those decisions, right or
              wrong, the child stumbles along his life’s passage, sometimes correct,
              sometimes wrong; but in the end that child is an independent child able
              to stand alone with confidence.<br><br>The prime example, of a
              Singaporean regimented education is the Prime Minster himself. All he
              can do is to mimic and obey Lee Kuan Yew, his father; almost as if he
              will be lost without him.<br><br>And what is even more ignoble of this
              government is the fact that they do this because it helps them remain
              in power; since an unquestioning obedient population is easier to
              control than a questioning one; and that is why as parents you are duty
              bound not to permit this upon your children.<br><br>Since you know that
              the Parliamentary system no longer works to protect your interests, for
              change to happen, you have no choice but to publicly protest. Of
              course, such action may result in government reprisals but what choice
              do you have?<br><br>Otherwise emigrate with your family and children.
              Emigration has the additional advantage for you to withdraw your CPF by
              relinquishing your citizenship. For the sake of your children, you have
              to decide one way or the other.<br>Requiring your child to go through
              the Singapore education system is deliberately making them into second
              rate adults. With no curiosity, and no independence of thought.<br><br>Rather a strong word to use, but I will use it anyway. A zombie.<br><br>Gopalan Nair</p>

              <p>Singapore education is not good, but all other countries ones are not good either, at least most of them.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Sinaporean education is abit too follow useless rules too rigidly. The result of our education makes singaporean abit too inflexible. However, there are certain merits of singapore education like its emphasis on continuous learning and being a well rounded person. However there are still many areas of improvement. Bascially, the modern educaiton system of the world is oout of point. They do not bring out the best in humans.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Actually, this phenonmenon is good for businessmen. If they know what is good education, they can set up the private school and earn much money because the current education is quite lousy anyway in teaching kids reallyuseful skills besides technical knowledge.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Singaporean education is nowhere achieving its full potential. However, many other countries also faces the same problems in education policies. However, parents has responsibility too. If you are not happy, you can be your kids teacher, while having your partner become a breadwinner.</p>

              <p>You can hire personal teachers in singapore if you want to. This kind of thing is flexible one what...</p>
