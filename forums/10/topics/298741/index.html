            <div class='col-md body'><strong>New highs for ministerial salaries, new lows for media credibility</strong><br><br><a href="http://www.yawningbread.org/arch_2007/yax-824.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.yawningbread.org/arch_2007/yax-824.htm</a><br><br>I have to thank Benjamin Cheah for his article in The Online Citizen where he provided a hyperlink to a survey on the perceptions of media in 14 countries, conducted by the respected polling firm, Synovate.<br><br>1,011 people in Singapore were polled for the Singapore part of the survey, out of 11,344 worldwide.<br><br>Without that link I had little more to rely on than the reports in our local newspapers which highlighted how 48% of Singaporeans agreed that controls on the media are sometimes needed to preserve stability, while 43% felt that press freedom is non-negotiable. That would have been wonderful news for those who needed justification for the kind of media we have here.<br><br>Our local press did point out that Singapore was one of only 3 countries -- the other two being Russia and India, countries where indeed social, ethnic and religious unrest are very close to the surface -- that preferred controls over freedom, but I think we need to ask, is this an informed choice, or the result of a generation of brainwashing and scaremongering?<br><br>India has a very free press and people seem to have freely come to this opinion in the light of their national experience. Russia in the 1990s had a period of very free press too. Singaporeans have not experienced a free press for 40 years, so how do they know they don't want it?<br><br>Then this sentence in a newspaper report really got me:<br><br>Despite the fact that the media here was perceived "as less free than in any other country surveyed", 36 per cent gave the local press a high freedom rating.<br><br>-- 'Today' newspaper, 11 Dec 2007,<br>Social stability is key: Poll<br><br>You notice how it was spun into good news -- "Despite the fact..."? Don't be fooled. The real fact is that "36 percent" was the lowest score of all 14 countries surveyed.<br><br>The survey question had asked participants this:<br><br>On a scale of 5 to 1, where 5 means "very free" and 1 means "not at all free", how free do you think the press and media is in your country to be able to report the news accurately, truthfully and without undue bias?<br><br>9% of Singapore participants gave a score of "5" as their answer, 27% gave a score of "4", adding up to 36%.<br><br>Here are the results from all 14 countries to the same question. We're bottom of the class again.<br><br><img src="http://www.yawningbread.org/arch_2007/pic-824b.gif"><br><br>(Where the totals do not reach 100%, it's because of the "Don't knows". You'd notice that Singapore also has the highest percentage of "Don't knows": 10%. That's a very bad sign. Too many Singaporeans are apathetic, uninterested and uninformed.)<br><br>Our government likes to boast that our local mainstream media are free. The difference from the West, it is alleged, may be that here, they are also aware of their responsibility to report the news "fairly and accurately". The Western media's constant harping about the lack of freedom in Singapore is baseless, our ministers insist.<br><br>Yet, when one goes out to poll 1,011 people here about whether our media are indeed free, Singaporeans give answers that are consistent with what the Western media says, not what the government says. Funny that.<br><br>Â© Yawning Bread</div>

              <div>
              <p>Anyone receiving the news last week that a dangerous JI detainee
                                      had escaped from custody would have had an immediate question: How
                                      in the world did he escape?</p>
              <p>The question is so natural and so obvious that you’d think
                                      anyone barely paying attention would ask it. Unless, apparently,
                                      one worked for the national news media – in which case the question
                                      of how Mas Selamat Kastari escaped was immaterial.</p>
              <p>At least, that’s how it seemed right up to Thursday morning last

                                      with the story the next morning, carrying dramatic details of the
                                      ongoing manhunt in a page one story deemed worthy of five bylines,
                                      with the news editor himself leading the charge. But, apparently,
                                      none of them considered the “how” question to be newsworthy.</p>
              <p>ST’s competitor <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.todayonline.com/articles/240059.asp"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Today</span></a> had a
                                      strikingly similar approach on day one, covering the story as if it
                                      was the National Day Parade: a big show, not requiring the
                                      activation of any grey cells. Today brands itself on reporting the
                                      meaning behind the news, because it believes that the mere facts of
                                      the news are commodities already circulating through electronic
                                      media. Today's attempt to show that it had something more current
                                      and value-added than ST – whose headline read, "Massive manhunt" –
                                      was the headline "Manhunt continues". Like ST, Today's page one
                                      story, appearing next to its slogan “we set you thinking”,
                                      neglected to ask – let alone answer – how Mas Selamat escaped.</p>
              <p>Thus, following the mainstream media over the first 24 hours was
                                      frustrating and farcical. Not because the public must get answers
                                      instantly – I don’t believe that government or anyone else must
                                      serve the 24-hour news cycle at the expense of more urgent tasks –
                                      but because people deserve to know that questions of public
                                      interest are taken seriously by the journalists who serve them.
                                      Journalists can’t always find the answers, but they can at least
                                      anticipate readers’ questions.</p>
              <p>You already know this instinctively if you are a professional
                                      journalist. There’s a standard way of handling unavoidable gaps in
                                      your story, such as when newsmakers are not ready to answer
                                      questions by press time: you simply raise the question in your
                                      story, and state that answers are not yet forthcoming.</p>
              <p>This is exactly what other media did in its initial reports. The
                                      Associated Press news agency quoted the brief Ministry of Home
                                      Affairs statement about in the third paragraph of its report,
                                      adding immediately after, “It did not say how he escaped.”</p>
              <p>Similarly, Canada’s CBC said in the third paragraph of its
                                      report, “The statement did not say how he escaped.” The
                                      International Herald Tribune said, “Singapore has one of the
                                      tightest security systems in the world, and the government gave no
                                      details on how he escaped.”</p>
              <p>In Singapore, in the first 24 hours following the escape, it was
                                      left to the bizarre combination of <a rel="nofollow" href="http://theonlinecitizen.com/2008/02/28/bloggers%e2%80%99-reaction-to-ji-leader%e2%80%99s-escape/"><span style="color: #0000ff;">independent
                                      bloggers</span></a> and <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/331726/1/.html"><span style="color: #0000ff;">PAP MPs</span></a> to
                                      ask the question that was on everyone’s mind. Singapore’s
                                      mainstream media acted as if they didn’t want to know.</p>
              <p>When the national news media are so uniformly guilty of a lapse
                                      that puts them so clearly out of sync with other opinion shapers –
                                      in this case, the foreign media, local bloggers and even PAP
                                      backbenchers – there can be only one logical explanation: media
                                      management by the government. Editors must have been instructed not
                                      to raise the “how” question publicly.</p>
              <p>Muffling the media in this way may not have much of an effect on
                                      the outcome of this particular case. The relevant questions will
                                      surface anyway, as they already have. Home Affairs Minister Wong
                                      Kan Seng has already promised an independent inquiry. Foreign
                                      Minister George Yeo has assured that "what can be made public, will
                                      be made public".</p>
              <p>If other fiascos – ranging from the Nicoll Highway disaster to
                                      the NKF affair and SAF training mishaps – are any guide to how this
                                      one will play out, citizens will eventually get pretty detailed
                                      answers, and can then assess for themselves whether there’s been
                                      enough accountability, transparency and learning on the part of
                                      government.</p>
              <p>So, the main impact of the national media’s failure will be felt
                                      by the media themselves. Every time officials use their political
                                      power to force the press to act in a way that’s plainly counter to
                                      public expectations, it will lose credibility – the resource that
                                      even ministers acknowledge is something the media cannot do
                                      without. And this at a time of proliferating choice, when the only
                                      sensible policy option is to invest in the credibility of the
                                      nation’s mainstream media, as I've tried to argue <a rel="nofollow" href="http://journalism.sg/2008/02/02/government-needs-to-invest-in-the-credibility-of-the-press/"><span style="color: #810081;">elsewhere</span></a>.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, the die appears to have been cast: political
                                      control of the national press will be used to ensure that the tough
                                      questions about the great escape story are asked ever so gently, if
                                      at all. Journalists will instead give us blanket coverage of the
                                      manhunt, showing the impressive Singapore law and order system in
                                      action.</p>
              <p>On Sunday, day four of ST's coverage, news editor Carl Skadian
                                      finally acknowledged, "To most people, the questions uppermost in
                                      their minds were 'how did he do it?' and 'how could something like
                                      this happen in Singapore?'" Not that this made a jot of difference
                                      to ST's coverage. This statement was buried in the 4th leg of an
                                      article on the last of six pages of a package otherwise devoted to
                                      such minutiae as the use of MMS to spread the Wanted man's picture
                                      and how Mas Selamat got his limp.</p>
              <p>Treating citizens as if they were brain-dead will not make them
                                      so; they will simply migrate to other media that take them more
                                      seriously.</p>
