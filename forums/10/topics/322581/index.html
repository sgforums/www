              <p><strong><span class="contentpagetitle"> Upbeat and ready to continue speaking up for Singapore</span></strong></p>
              <p>Sunday, 29 June 2008</p>
              <p><em>Singapore Democrats</em></p>
              <p><img src="http://www.yoursdp.org/images/stories/TBT/TBT_charged.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p>Far from being downcast the 18 activists who have been charged with
              taking part in an assembly and procession without a permit showed they
              were made of sterner stuff.<br><br>The group met on Friday to discuss
              events surrounding the charge and their attendance at the Subordinate
              Courts on 11 Jul at 9 am. Their upbeat mood suggested that they were
              keen and ready to continue speaking up for Singaporeans in the <em>Tak Boleh Tahan</em>! campaign.<br><br>The
              activists are charged for conducting a protest outside Parliament House
              on 15 Mar 08 against the plethora of hikes introduced by the PAP
              Government such as the GST, transport fares, education fees, ERP rates,
              gas and electricity tariffs, medical costs and so on.<br> <br>These increases have exacerbated the already dire economic
              situation of many Singaporeans. The working poor have been the hardest
              hit.<br><br>The activists were determined to rally support from the
              people to fight back the Government's punitive measures. One of those
              charged, Jaslyn Go, told everyone that "public support is our best
              weapon against them. Let's stand united against them."<br><br>Chee Soon Juan duly noted that Jaslyn showed the kind of leadership that Singapore needed.<br><br>Lawyer
              Chia Ti Lik jumped in: "Sometimes, I think the women folk outdo us in
              such things. The ladies in our midst who do so much to inspire us with
              their tower of strength."<br><br>Ti Lik was, of course, referring to
              Jaslyn, Chee Siok Chin, and Suraya Binte Akbar who had played leading
              roles in the campaign for political reform in Singapore. This is
              despite the fact that some of them are mothers of young children.<br><br>Pointing
              to the PAP's strategy in dealing with the reform campaign, Chong Kai
              Xiong noted that when provoked, it seems that Lee Kuan Yew will make
              nasty and irrational moves at the expense of his regime.<br><br>Agreeing,
              Ti Lik added that pro-democracy advocates needed to be bold and daring
              at this time: "This is a test of our wit and courage at this point of
              time."<br><br>Underscoring Ti Lik's point, Sylvester Lim said: "They
              just sent me the love letter. My wife told them she was expecting it
              and they were surprised that we were not intimidated."<br><br>"Let them
              know that intimidation doesn't work on us any more," Sylvester
              continued, "because we are no longer afraid and it is our right to
              speak out as citizens."<br><br>"I am ready to go to jail for this
              cause," Jeffrey George weighed in. "Everyone must remember that what we
              did was not wrong and we did not do it for our own gain."<br><br>Indeed
              the protest was to speak up for Singaporeans affected by the price
              hikes initiated by the Government. This has driven thousands of
              Singaporeans into desperation, many unable to even afford meals. The
              level of homelessness in Singapore is unprecedented.<br><br>But unlike
              in other democratic societies, citizens here have no avenue to protest
              against government action and exploitative policies.<br><br>Muhammad
              Jufri had one concern though: "We just need to make arrangements so
              that we don't go to prison together. Someone needs to take care of our
              children. But I'm proud of what I did."<br><br>Jufri is, or course,
              referring to his wife and mother of three young children, Suraya, who
              has also been charged. She also indicated that she was at peace with
              what she was doing. "The policeman who handed me the letter seemed
              nervous," she told the group, "his hands were trembling."<br><br>The group reiterated their views that they <em>tak boleh tahan</em> the high cost of living. The youngest of the group, 20-year-old
              Shafi'ie made only one short comment: "I have no problem." Everyone
              applauded.</p>

              <p>You have done nothing wrong by protesting peacefully for a good cause. This is like the IMF/WB protestors being allowed limited protest two years ago.</p>
              <p>Every crime must be substantiated by a wrongful motive like intention to cause disturbance or unrest but peaceful protest is not such a motive.</p>
              <p>In IMF meeting a large group of more than 5 was allowed to hold a peaceful protest so obviously there is no crime if there is no motive to commit one.</p>
              <p>I applaud you for your courage and determination to carry on fighting for the rights and liberties of citizens at the risk to your personal safety for the good of all.</p>

              <p>PAP regime thought that they had depoliticised and brainwashed the entire Singapore society, so that no one can challenge them.</p>
              <p>Mainstream media all under their control.</p>
              <p>Spread state propaganda.</p>
              <p>Civil society all destroyed and weakened.</p>
              <p>All the fighting spirit to resist the dictates of PAP regime all destroyed.</p>
              <p>The entire society weakened.</p>
              <p>The entire society lost the soul, lost all spirit.</p>
              <p>PAP regime is wrong.</p>
              <p>The spirit still lives.</p>
              <p>The day will come when PAP political hegemony ends.</p>
