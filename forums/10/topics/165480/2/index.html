But this will not last as the constituents will know that any such actions are vote buying suggesting malpractices of some kind or unjust way of getting into parliament.<br><br>They will not acknowledge them as good MPs or owe them  the allegiance and they will also make use them for one term to get what they want.

The danger is, you have stupid people like Robert who actually believe it. It sound ridiculous but that reality. The tactaic of all these ooportunists is to throw a lot of mud and hope something sticks. The populance can easily be deceived in a deluge of lies. Do you know this is playing out in US, mid east and Europe to great effect.<br><br><blockquote><br>2nd, even if a good papist is voted in, the papist cannot question things due to the party-whip..</blockquote>I can understand.
