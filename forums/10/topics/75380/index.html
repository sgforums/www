            <div class='col-md body'>Allow me to take you back to the 60's, that is as far back as I can start.<br><br>Those days, economics was poor. One of the things we could not afford was a good, warmth, quality blanket to cover us during our sleep. Our parents would gather pieces of cloth leftover, cut them into regular shapes(usually squares), machines them together and then we have a blanket over us.<br><br>Sometimes it takes months to complete one such blanket. Reason maybe 1)you need to collect enough unwanted leftover cloths 2)hand-stitched(because could not afford a machine) 3)having to work, cook and take care of the children and parents.<br><br>In the end the blanket looks like a rojak of colors and pattern and even cloth material. But it does serves the purpose of covering ones during a cold night. Of course this is no comparision to one of high quality wool blanket.<br><br>One other chance you may get a wool is when, after a funeral you are left behind with some towels and blanket. Some clans send decorated blanket with messages of condolences to the bereaved family instead of floral wreath.<br><br>The Fabric of the Nation I would see is a representation showing people from all walks of life coming in together contributing a little warmth to those in needs during the SARS outbreak.<br><br>It gives us a visual reminder of the outbreak, how anxieties reigned then, how we came together to fight as one against a then unknown and unseen enemies and how some fellow being succumbed to the deadly diseases in the course of their work serving the sickly.<br><br>You must not view the exhibits as a piece of visual arts but feel the warmth that it could provide one.</div>
