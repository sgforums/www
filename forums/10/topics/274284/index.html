            <div class='col-md body'>Ts... what a shame. Maybe the next time u decide to post something ridiculous you'd do a little more research before shooting your mouth off at how easy the police have it and the "precious" amount of time you spent at the station when all they did was to "paste a mere sticker inwhich you could have done so yourself".</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think it is wonderful we can change our address at the police post. It saves alot of hassles and it updates my address at once with LTA, MOM,IRAS (govt dept only not bank accounts. that u have to do yourself). And for your info, definitely need to show proof like lawyer letter or HDB letter for property changes.</div>
