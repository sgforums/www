              <p><a href="http://theonlinecitizen.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/siaB320240.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-24866" title="siaB320240" src="http://theonlinecitizen.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/siaB320240.jpg" alt="" width="320" height="240"></a>“Singapore Airlines (SIA), SIAEC (SIA Engineering) and all other SIA-affiliated companies practise 10 per cent across-the-board pay cut for all employees the moment they turn 60 years old,” Ms Jennifer Tan wrote to the Straits Times in May this year. “When queries are made to the human resource department about such cuts,” Ms Tan wrote, “especially in relation to the new government push to extend the working life of experienced older workers, the reply given is that it is ‘company policy’.” (<a href="http://www.asiaone.com/Business/Office/Ask/Story/A1Story20100527-218740.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Asia One</span></span></a>)</p>
              <p>Captain P James, president of the Airline Pilots Association (Singapore), had also expressed similar sentiments in his letter to the Straits Times a week earlier. Referring to Singapore Airline’s cutting wages of older workers the moment they turn 60, he wrote: “It was really a case of no cut, no job. This was despite the fact that there was no change other than the pilot turning 60 years old.” (<a href="http://politics.sgforums.com/forums/3545/topics/400184?page=1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">See here</span></span></a>) Legally, pilots are allowed to work up to age 65. Captain James thus could not understand why SIA needed to cut the wages of pilots who turn 60. “Here is a company that has been struggling to stay above water, and yet it is willing to hire the more expensive expatriate pilot on a longer contract term, with the attendant costs such as housing and child allowances,” he said.</p>
              <p>“Why are they denying the national pilot, who helped build up the national icon, the same opportunity of a job until the end of his useful working life?”</p>
              <p>Given that SIA is a government-linked company (GLC) and that the government itself has been encouraging older Singaporeans to work longer, it is puzzling that GLCs themselves would resort to penalizing older workers by cutting their wages for no other reason than that these workers have turned 60.</p>
              <p>The Ministry of Manpower’s reply to these questions was: “Some wage adjustment is necessary in order to maintain the employability of workers as they age.” With regards to the specific question of employers cutting – or as MOM put it – “adjusting” wages of workers “as they reach 60”, MOM says:</p>
              <p><em>“The Retirement Age Act does allow wage reduction of up to 10 per cent.  However, the Act also makes it clear that if there is any reduction, it should be based on “reasonable factors” like the employee’s productivity, performance, duties and responsibilities, and the market value of the job. It is worth noting that age does not qualify as a reasonable factor in the Retirement Age Act.”</em></p>
              <p>It also said:</p>
              <p><em>“[Wage] reduction at 60 should not be “automatic”. We like to emphasise that it should only be based on the reasonable factors as stated clearly in the Retirement Age Act.” (</em><a href="http://www.mom.gov.sg/Home/Press_Replies/Pages/20100520-Lessthan3percentof%20privatefirmscutolderworkers'wages.aspx"><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">MOM</span></span></em></a><em>)</em></p>
              <p>The government has announced that it will introduce the Retirement Age Act (RAA) in 2012 – five years after it was <a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/276748/1/.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">first proposed in 2007</span></span></a>.</p>
              <p>Even before the Retirement Act’s expected enactment in 2012, many older workers may already have been terminated from their jobs or have had their pay cut substantially even before they reach 60 or 62. Employers may simply avoid the requirement to offer re-employment under the RAA, by letting go or cutting the wages of those approaching or who turn 62-years old, before the RAA takes effect in 2012.</p>
              <p>Although the proposed Retirement Age Act is clear that a pay cut should be based on “reasonable factors” and age is not one such factor, employers can get around this simply by citing these “reasonable factors” as the reason for terminating a 62-year old from his job or cutting his pay – even though the real reason may be his age!</p>
              <p>How do we effectively address issues of age discrimination like those highlighted by the Air Line Pilots Association?</p>
              <p>From past experience, getting employers to heed guidelines have not have been an easy task.</p>

              <p>They cut middle and low level staff wages by $50-100 dollars so that the CEO and his team of managers can get big angpows. This is because the managers are the ones who decide how to implement "cost savings" policy. HR justifies this because they say if they want they can fill the entire company (except for management, of course) with PhDs from China, that's the kind of attitude that allows the HR manager to drive a BMW you see. If you're a Singaporean and you're not in the management cliche, you're fucked even if you got a PhD. The top decision makers are surrounded by bootlickers who say yes to everything and submit reports with pretty numbers and the boss doesn't care anyway because he's busy looking after his own backside.</p>
              <p>Everything you read in the newspapers are bullshit. Singapore is going down because the top people are in denial. Just read what SMRT wrote to TODAY about people prefering to get into the train rather than get a seat. The genius who write this probably earn more than most Singaporeans and I think even the old uncle toilet cleaner at my market can understand the nature of the original complaint. Where is the responsibility of the private sector in improving public service? Accountability to shareholders you say? Why not put handholds on the outside of the train or allow people to climb on top of the train? I think better to vote in another government and nationalize the transports system again.</p>
              <p>You can't even get the drains cleared on time because the chain of command stops at the Bangla and all you are willing to do is swop Banglas rather than pay a bit better to a Singaporean who will understand the importance of his job and do it well. How many Banglas do you think you need to screen through and how long do you think you need to build a dedicated team of cleaners who will do their job properly? Then oops, Bangla want to go home liao. Its not all about money you see but always the human element of the story is ignored. Be it how to stop throwing people's money into an overseas landfill or how to keep the business areas flood-free, the decisions taken are based on calculations of self-profit rather than real problem-solving. That's just about cleaning drains properly. Zoom out and look at the big picture.</p>

              <p>The reality of things is that every one is just wayanging throughout the years.</p>
              <p>After the fiasco on the clogged drains, the flood is still around.</p>
              <p>Instead of fixing the problems and punishing the wayang, the boss himself ask the rest of the people to accept it is common to have flood now.</p>
              <p>This is serious case of weak and incompetent leadership at the helm.</p>
              <p>From now onwards, there will be no responsibility or accountablility of what ever happened.</p>
              <p>This losers are up there to earn and not to contribute.</p>
              <p>This is similar to the pigs in the animal farm.</p>
              <p>That is why people are leaving cos they do not want to work with losers who wayang all the time, take world highest salary and contribute nothing.</p>
