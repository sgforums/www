If we didn't have the likes of inventors like Thomas Edison for example- or the guy who invented the telephone, we wouldn't have light bulbs today and without the telephone, we wouldn't even have the internet at the 1st place!<br><br>Not to mention the Italian guy, Marconi- who invented the radio. Without him, we wouldn't have the eventual successor to the old analog radio, the modern digital radio. Sailors wouldn't communicate effectively when they are in the ocean without radio...<br><br>So inventors during that time were also bucking the trend- when people mocked them and their attempts- and in the process of inventing their product, they became leaders of their respective fields.<br><br>Without the sheer attempts of Edison, Marconi and Bell, we would still be using pigeons, candle lights and paper messages sent in the old snail mail. Be thankful these inventive leaders were around. We, in this modern society owe a huge, unpayable debt to these guys.</div>

He merely provided the vision and pushed forward its ideals and concepts for the creation of new war doctrines. The original idea came from several previously obscure but brilliant generals. One of these was Erich Von Mainstein.<br><br>As for why Hitler was more vilified than old man QING, my theory is one of recent events. Just as Saddam Hussein is now pretty much a forgotten man, our new neighbourhood bad guy is Osama Bin Ladin. People tend to forget the distant past and tend to compare more with our recent history. Furthermore, i have yet to come across a western author doing an autobiography of old man QING. As for our fave one-testicle bad boy, he has a few such books written and also published <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Mein Kampf </span>while doing time in prison in the 1930s. This book, while banned in previous years, is now available in Kinokuniya bookstores. It personifies his warped ideals and even had the author/translator maintaining that this is an 'Evil Book'.<br><br>I suppose the reason why our Education Minister is concerned about our young's misguided idolism of Hitler is probably one of ignorance and security. To know the past is not to repeat its mistakes. Post-war Germany for example did little to stem the tide of neo-Nazi facists which emerged afterwards until they evolved into street gangs of skinheads and racists. While most were harmless, a few did stir up trouble and became an embarrassment to peacetime Germany.<br><br>Big brother would never want a similar occurance happening on our shores...and rightly so.</div>

Autocratic leadership works well in situation when you have nothing; no resources, no motivation, no direction etc. However it needs to be adjusted once situation changed. Most autocratic leaders failed because of the failure to adjust when the situation changed.<br><br>Btw, aren't we living under the same type of leadership? The only difference I can see is that one chose to leave when failure is proven while the other stayed on to become a drag of his followers.</div>
