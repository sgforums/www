However, in terms of leadership capabilities, Hitler is no doubt one person who had great leadership qualities. This was acknowledged by several books written on leadership skills. Therefore, obviously the students had done some research before naming their team creatively for the <strong>Leadership Camp</strong>. ( Though they might get better response if they chose LKY).<br><br>Through this minor incident, it was obvious that our system limits our students' creativity. There are several threads in this forum comparing foriegn and local talents, many acknowledged that local talents lack of creativity, risk taking and articulation. Putting yourself into the shoes of the students, would you, after this incident still try again to dare to be different? Or would your rather follow the model answers of the 10 years series (Like most of our scholars and elites did)? Or worst of all, most, like me will choose not to participate in such activities again?<br><br>Sounds familiar, yes, this is what our society is. There is no room for creativity. If you think out of the box, you are out of the game.  We are moulded from young to become a "yes" man. We grew up memorising model answers from 10 years series. My son learnt to find the odd one out when he was in K1. It was imprinted in him that if you are different, you are the odd one out. However, I have always asked him to look at things in a different angle, I have always thought him that <strong> If you are different, you are special</strong><br><br>Lastly, I would like to once again stress that I am against students, or anyone from idolising Hitler. However, I felt that once in a while, we should always give rooms to our students to let their imagination run wild and to do what they had wanted to do. I believe that was in the mind of the teachers running the camp and thats why they did not stop the team from using the name. To these teachers, I would say, good job. To those who do not agree, I would urge you to think twice, otherwise, we will be like what the Chinese says: "Scared of human in front of the ship; afraid of ghosts at the tail of the ship"(Chuan2 Qian2 Pa4 Ren2, Chuan2 Wei3 Pa4 Gui3) and end up doing and gaining nothing.</div>

When others did it, they are being creative. When we do it, we somehow lack of the <strong>X FACTOR</strong>. So where have our X Factor gone? Who stole our X Factor?

Business practices evolve- just like all other things that involve human beings.

So if other thing changes, why not business?<br><br>Remember this: In the early 20th century, heavy industry in business were all the rage.
