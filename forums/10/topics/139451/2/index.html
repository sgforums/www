In 1933 the Nazi party came to power and began dismantling the treaty. The Heer was founded as part of the Wehrmacht in May 1935 with the passing of the "Law for the Reconstruction of the National Defense Forces". The Wehrmacht was expanded to include the Heer and Navy and with a third branch known as the Luftwaffe. Initially, the Heer was expanded to 21 Divisional sized units and smaller formations. Between 1935 and 1945 this force grew to consist of hundreds of Divisions and thousands of smaller supporting units. Between 1939 and 1945 close to 13 million served in the Heer. Over 1.6 million were killed and over 4.1 million were wounded. Of the 7361 men awarded the initial grade of the highest German combat honor of WWII, the Knights Cross, 4777 were from the Heer making up 65% of the total awarded. The Allies dissolved the Heer on August 20 1946.<br><br></div>

However, in terms of leadership capabilities, Hitler is no doubt one person who had great leadership qualities. This was acknowledged by several books written on leadership skills. Therefore, obviously the students had done some research before naming their team creatively for the [b]Leadership Camp</strong>. ( Though they might get better response if they chose LKY).<br><br>Through this minor incident, it was obvious that our system limits our students' creativity. There are several threads in this forum comparing foriegn and local talents, many acknowledged that local talents lack of creativity, risk taking and articulation. Putting yourself into the shoes of the students, would you, after this incident still try again to dare to be different? Or would your rather follow the model answers of the 10 years series (Like most of our scholars and elites did)? Or worst of all, most, like me will choose not to participate in such activities again?<br><br>Sounds familiar, yes, this is what our society is. There is no room for creativity. If you think out of the box, you are out of the game.  We are moulded from young to become a "yes" man. We grew up memorising model answers from 10 years series. My son learnt to find the odd one out when he was in K1. It was imprinted in him that if you are different, you are the odd one out. However, I have always asked him to look at things in a different angle, I have always thought him that <strong> If you are different, you are special</strong><br><br>Lastly, I would like to once again stress that I am against students, or anyone from idolising Hitler. However, I felt that once in a while, we should always give rooms to our students to let their imagination run wild and to do what they had wanted to do. I believe that was in the mind of the teachers running the camp and thats why they did not stop the team from using the name. To these teachers, I would say, good job. To those who do not agree, I would urge you to think twice, otherwise, we will be like what the Chinese says: "Scared of human in front of the ship; afraid of ghosts at the tail of the ship"(Chuan2 Qian2 Pa4 Ren2, Chuan2 Wei3 Pa4 Gui3) and end up doing and gaining nothing. [/b]</blockquote>Sadly, Singaporeans are indeed conformists. Our education and social policies have not allowed/encouraged them to think differently. They may also not know that to challenge the status quo we can improve the society. One good example is the PC. Before Bill Gate the status quo then was that only corporates and not private individuals could have access to computers.</div>

United States General George S. Patton emphasized fast pursuit, the use of an armored spearhead to effect a breakthrough, then cut-off and disrupt enemy forces prior to their flight. In his comments of the time, he credited Guderian and Rommel's work, notably Infantry Attacks, for insight.<br><br>Blitzkrieg has had partial influence on subsequent militaries and doctrines. The Israeli Defense Forces may have been influenced by blitzkrieg in creating a military of flexible armored spearheads and close air support.[15] The 1990's United States theorists of "Shock and awe" claim blitzkrieg as a subset of strategies which they term "rapid dominance."<br><br></div>
