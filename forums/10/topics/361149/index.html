              <p>Arrogant or Wise?</p>
              <p>Should you hear a leader utter such words, how would you think? -</p>
              <p>"I am often accused of interfering in the private lives of citizens. Yes, if I did not, had I not done that, we wouldn’t be here today. And I say without the slightest remorse, that we wouldn’t be here, we would not have made economic progress, if we had not intervened on very personal matters – who your neighbour is, how you live, the noise you make, how you spit, or what language you use. We decide what is right. Never mind what the people think.”</p>
              <p>In my PERSONAL view, IF i am from a matured and educated society, with a strong single conservative religious majority, taken out of context it would be a horror beyond comprehension upon my liberal sensibilities. How should such a leader hope to lead if every move one makes is being watched and control?</p>
              <p>However, if i came from a young and largely uneducated MULTI-RACIAL society of the last century, such words would mean differently.</p>
              <p><strong>'Who your neighbour is'</strong> - should we be segrated into religious or ethnic enclaves, whereby we know not how each other live to foster better understanding?</p>
              <p><strong>'how we live'</strong> - being minimally educated, should we as a society best be developed to our highest economic potential in a highly competitive national neighbourhood?</p>
              <p>Should not we be worried about putting food on the table more, rather than to hanker after incomprehensible philosophies, of which many would not be ready yet to contribute to society?</p>
              <p><strong>'the noise one makes'</strong> - being multi-racial, it would mean cultural mores and differences, and if not controlled, would it not only lead to antagonism and strife?</p>
              <p><strong>'the language one use'</strong> - Being of diverse ethnicities, each will lay claim onto the superiority of their own lingo. And language can be an unequal imposition upon minority groups. However and fortunately, the world of the last century was operating on the common lingo of English - a language of commerce of which our sea trading nation is part of, had it not serve us well in commerce as well as being a common societal building block to unite the various ethnic groups?</p>
              <p><strong>'We decide what is right'</strong> - Had not the Singapore government been a freely elected body politic, on the choice made by our votes that had been secret and sacred, something of which even modern chinese COMMUNISTS are not allowed today?</p>
              <p>Therefore, if they have the mandate of the people and society as a whole, do not the ones in govt get to decide what is right? And if they wrong, do not our society have the right to kick them out?</p>
              <p>I would readily admit there will be differences of opinion, and it should be if our society is to be 'open' and to mature. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Others should be allowed to voice their opinions, right or wrong, without fear or favour, more so in a forum of any topic or thread such as thus and not be bullied in any way by anyone to remain silent. Let silence be a choice and not an imposition.</span></p>
              <p>We would only benefit, if we share our views respectfully, and not by clamping up or allowing others to set the agenda to control our lives</p>

              <p>In the 30s, Al Capone was the most notorious ganster in Chicago USA. He controlled and ran all vices in that states and even out of states. He committed murders and bribed his way to power, controlling both the underworld and the secular world, even religion.</p>
              <p>He was the most evil men of the 30s that even far-away Russians knew him. The govt was aware of his existance and his doings, but was hamstrung by the US CONSTITUTION.</p>
              <p>The constitution was made up by good men, and had laws to protect every individuals, even criminals, but as a result, evil men knew such laws by heart and sought to circumvent it.</p>
              <p>Capone murdered, but sent his underlings to do the job and take the rap. He bribed, but made sure no one could collect any evidence. He sold liquour in the prohibition era, but it was managed by his henchmen who will admit the crime on his behalf.</p>
              <p>He forced poor young women into prostitution, paid miserly, beaten and raped incessantly, but it was his fellow gangster who did the job and would go to the lock up if found out.</p>
              <p>Anyone who betrayed Capone would be assured of retaliation on themselves and their families, including those he bribes. Thus no one talked and despite investigation to his criminal activities, there was no evidence to implicate him.</p>
              <p>This scum of Earth walked free, dined in the best restaurants, photographed with celebrities, lead a high life, while destroying many others. The only way the govt, representatives of the people, could catch him finally was to nail him on a tax evasion charge, and put this evil man away for life.</p>
              <p>Throughout american history, we had seen how criminals and evil men escaped justice by manipulating the laws, until 911 which cause the HOMELAND ACT, akin to our ISD, came into being.</p>
              <p>Should a leader be penalised for invoking ISD? We must acknowledge that society comes first and its protection is paramount.</p>
              <p>There are ways criminals can circumvent constitional laws. ISD is the frontline against subversive elements which would destroy a society and lives if they had the chance.</p>
              <p>The thing is, if one had done no wrong or do not intend to inflame the masses, what is there to fear of ISD? An instrument of political repression? Had Chaim or Sylvia Lim, opposition members, been abused or tortured by the unit?</p>
              <p>Whatever happened in our past, we must let such baggages go and not let it hinder our progress. Mistakes are only a way of improving ourselves further.</p>
              <p>WIth increased emphasis on education, we or at least our next generation will be ready to comprehend the philosophy of freedom and its responsibilites, as individuals and as a society. And that will be something to look forward to with patience, and need not let our pasts get us down and hatred sowed.</p>

              <p><br>I fully agree with you on that, more so when we have heard of recession heroes such as the doctor in Toa Payoh who cared more about the health of his patients than the amount of money in their wallet.</p>
              <p>However, the crux of the problem MAY not lie with him alone. There must had been a error in our education programme in the past whereby we were taught, or the lack of it,  to value money over service to society, and ran away on its own to become the more money the better, resulting in lack of public spirited members of public.</p>
              <p>Such youths demanded more money or they will not serve, or more frighteningly, serve the way India does, to line the pockets.</p>
              <p>The only way we can rectify it  is - I myself have not the answer. But i am sure, out of 3.5million people in our society, someone out there may have the pragmatic solution. Or is it just another hope that is to be thrashed?</p>

              <p>Yes, you have valid points and I equally share your concerns. How then is a society to protect itself and its members - parents, children, friends from threats and evil men who circumvent the laws of constitutions?</p>
              <p>If you have the pragmatic solution that can work for its protection, rest assured, every rational person would adopt and push your idea for passing into law.</p>
              <p>I feel i may have talked too much, and have no intention to hog this thread the way some loves to do in other threads. I would rather let others share their views, right or wrong. It's the way we will mature, beginning now.</p>

              <p>Yes, you have valid points and I equally share your concerns.
                          How then is a society to protect itself and its members - parents,
                          children, friends from threats and evil men who circumvent the laws
                          of constitutions?</p>
              <p>If you have the pragmatic solution that can work for its
                          protection, rest assured, every rational person would adopt and
                          push your idea for passing into law.</p>
              <p>I feel i may have talked too much, and have no intention to hog
                          this thread the way some loves to do in other threads. I would
                          rather let others share their views, right or wrong. It's the way
                          we will mature, beginning now.</p>

              <p>Through discourse we create knowledge. And that was how many scholars learned since history begin.</p>
              <p>The blade cuts both ways. While we can use it to protect.. it can also be use to destroy.</p>
              <p>The US constitution was created to protect the rights of citizens against governmental acts/abuse.</p>
              <p>If one day, an innocent person like yourself is accused of criminal act.. under the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Bill_of_Rights">amendments</a>, many of your fundamental rights will be accorded. ( Bill of rights, 5,6,7,8)</p>
              <p>In the case of Al Capone. I  don't think the hampering was due to the weakness of the constitution.. rather.. the failure of the Attorney General to put the criminal in jail.</p>
              <p>All criminal cases..due to the severity of the punishments , must be proven beyond reasonable doubt and only given one shot , ( due to the double jeorpardy protection).</p>
              <p>Much like the OJ simpson case, where many agrees the AG fumbled during the criminal trial  .  OJ was finally put away to jail.. in a civil trial.</p>
              <p>You may argue that the constitution is a stumbling block to protect our citizens from the likes of Al C and OJ. However...</p>
              <p>Criminals will be criminals.. they will commit crimes and find ways to run scot free.. with or without any constitutions.</p>

                      mind of the people?.   Please dont deem me as being paranoid -
                      actually the psychic (when I asked) said so.</p>

              <p>Umm, without control it is almost impossible for the great oppressor to run Singapore.</p>

              <p><br>No, who said we dun buy his crap or chilli crabs, we do, do you know that in 2007, he did alots of dialogue with the youth peoples, we do challenged him, he was very impressive, once in my poly years, i was handpicked among the 100 to attend his dialogue sessions too, but somehow most of the students question were pre mediatated or so call prescribed for him to answer, but as a naive gal, i asked him just one question straight out of my mind, "Dear Minister Mentor, when PM retired, what will be your designation, are you going to be a Senior Minsiter Mentor or retire out of politics". He laughed and replied "Young gals, i had said many, but perhaps this is the first time u might hear from me, if i am buried 6 foot below singapore soil, and if Singapore shake, i will rise up and be ready to serve Singapore, that is my committment to Singapore, I hope my message is clear to you". I saw his face red red, so i sat down and diam diam.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Later after the session, one of his aide approached me and asked me a few questions, beside asking my identity and my home, he also asked if anyone fore told me to ask such a question. Of course i said no lah. From then on, the polytechnic never ask me to take part in anything anymore.</p>
