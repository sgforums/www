            <div class='col-md body'>"Preceding Year [PY] Basis of Assessment<br><br>3.	Our current income tax system has the following characteristics:<br><br>Â„h Basis Period of Assessment: The incomes derived by individuals and companies are assessed for tax on a preceding year basis.  In other words, income tax payable this year is based on income earned in the previous year.<br><br>Â„h Method of Assessment: Singapore currently operates an Official Assessment System (OAS).  This means that the legal onus is on IRAS to assess the tax liability based on the taxpayerÂ¡Â¦s declaration of income. IRAS will then issue a Notice of Assessment on the amount of tax payable.<br><br>4. In addition, companies are required to file an Estimated Chargeable Income (ECI) within 3 months from the end of the accounting year.  Hence, a company whose accounting year ends on 31 Dec is required to file an ECI by 31 Mar of the following year.  The tax computed based on the ECI can be paid in installments.<br><br>5. Companies need only submit their final income tax return (Form C) together with their accounts and tax computation by 31 Jul of each year.  The final tax liability will be determined based on the return filed.<br><br>6. Individuals are required to report their incomes earned in the previous year by filing the income tax return (Form B or Form B1) by 15 Apr of the following year. IRAS then assesses the tax payable and issues a Notice of Assessment to taxpayers. Tax is payable within 1 month from the date of the Notice of Assessment.<br><br>7.	Taxpayers who are paying income tax via GIRO start paying their income tax based on estimated taxes before their actual tax liability is assessed by IRAS.  However, upon the filing of income tax returns and after IRAS has assessed the actual tax payable and issued the Notice of Assessment, the outstanding installments will be adjusted to reflect the actual tax payable.<br><br>Current Year [CY] Basis of Assessment<br><br>8.	Under the CY basis of assessment, the income earned by individuals and companies is assessed to tax on a current year basis i.e. tax is paid based on the income for that year, rather than income of the preceding year. For salaried individuals, the tax amount may be withheld by the employers on a monthly basis from their salaries and then paid to the tax authority. For companies, tax may be paid in installments."<br><br><a href="http://www.mof.gov.sg/quick_guide/attachments/CY_basis%20_Con_paper.doc" rel="nofollow">http://www.mof.gov.sg/quick_guide/attachments/CY_basis%20_Con_paper.doc</a><br><br>Okay, I will summarize for you. Our current tax system, is based on Previous Year basis of assessment ie. For this current year, we pay last years' taxes. With the new system, they are considering having a Current Year basis of assessment ie What you earn is taxed immediately.<br><br>Which do you prefer?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This is my comment to MOF based on their template for feedback.<br><br>Questions for Individuals<br><br>I1: Would switching to a CY basis of assessment smooth out your disposable income and expenditure patterns? In what way?<br><br>I believe that CY basis of assessment will have a great impact on our disposable income and expenditure patterns if it gets introduced. At the outset, the individual taxpayer will have to pay both his/her previousÂ¡Â¦ year tax liability as well as the current year! Thus, in a sense being slapped for paying 2 years of taxes in a single year.<br><br>On the effects of disposable income, an individual taxpayer will naturally have less disposable income as he/she has to fork out this yearÂ¡Â¦s taxes instead of paying for the previous yearÂ¡Â¦s taxes. He/she will feel the pinch in his monthly income, as he/she already is forced to give 20% of his/her pay to CPF(assuming the taxpayer is 16 - 55) and now coupled with having to pay taxes on that monthÂ¡Â¦s income (depending on his/her tax rate).<br><br>LetÂ¡Â¦s form an equation:<br><br>With CY basis of assessment<br>DPI = NI (Net Income) - CPF Contribution (20%) - Income Tax (Taxes for CY &amp; PY)<br><br>I2: How would switching to a CY basis of assessment impact your consumption?  In what way?<br><br>Whereas a taxpayer with the old system gets taxed only on his/her previous yearÂ¡Â¦s income, this new CY basis of assessment gets the taxpayer to pay his/her taxes immediately. Thus, my consumption would go down, as I would be receiving less income to spend.<br><br>Q1: Do you think Singapore should switch from preceding year to current year basis of assessment?  Why?<br><br>No. With the PY basis of assessment, we are able to project a more accurate tax liability than with the CY basis of assessment as we can base our taxes on our historical income and expenses. If you were to project or I call it forecasting on future income, you will bound to encounter some delayed expenses or accruals, which you would have to file for a reassessment again. I notice that in the tables for the companies and individual taxpayers showing the various options and methods, I see a familiar row, Â¡Â§AdjustmentsÂ¡Â¨, together words of forecasting methods such as Â¡Â§estimateÂ¡Â¨, Â¡Â§changesÂ¡Â¨ and Â¡Â§circumstancesÂ¡Â¨. As a result, this will cause more work for both IRAS and we the taxpayers.<br><br>With the PY basis of assessment, taxpayers do not really see the amount of tax they are liable to pay for this year until next year when the all familiar time to file taxes before the deadline in mid April. Hence psychologically if/when taxpayers go through a recessionary period they would have less expenses to worry about in that current year.<br><br>The PY basis of assessment is kind to the taxpayers and allows them to pay for only their previous yearÂ¡Â¦s tax liability through Giro which acts like instalments for those taxpayers who cannot afford a one huge deduction in one shot of their monthly income.<br><br></div>
