It's only a tiny island, I wouldn't even call it a country!" Loud Mouth laughed wholeheartedly after he said it, sincerely finding his neighbor Singapore amusing.<br><br>Jack Sparrow was bewildered. "Who the hell are you? What do you care where I'm moving to?"<br><br>"Malaysian people love you, Abang Jack. They've sent me to invite you to stay in Malaysia. Best place to live in the world!" Loud Mouth explained enthusiastically. He couldn't help but think how many votes he is going to get if he manages to bring back Jack Sparrow.<br><br>Jack Sparrow frowned. "Malaysia? Heard little of it. Tell me how it's better than Singapore, and I shall consider."<br><br>"Okay, first, everything is so transparent in Singapore. Feel so naked la. In Malaysia, you could do so many things, and there are many ways for cover-ups."<br><br>"Cover-ups, eh?" Jack Sparrow's eyes brighten, "Okay, go on."<br><br>"In Malaysia, nobody dare to criticize me...err.. us, because they are so scared! So we could basically get away with doing anything we like!"<br><br><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1335/662150521_883c678963_o.jpg"><br><br>"Even pirating?" Jack's moustache twitched with excitement.<br><br>" Something like that. Oh yeah, and..."Loud Mouth looked around to check if there's anyone eavesdropping, "We'll be spending millions sending some astronaut to the space, but if you're interested, we could replace him with you!"<br><br>"Pirates in the Outer Space eh? Hmm...interesting.... But I know nothing about doing scientific experiments for you guys, mate."<br><br>"Who says it's really about science? Just carry our flag, take a picture, make the people feel "boleh", and the whole nation will idolize you lah. Got it?"<br><br>"All right, you convinced me!" Jack Sparrow jumped at the opportunity, and whipped out a cellphone, "Let me call Kuan Yew to tell him I'm not coming anymore. Looks like Malaysia's more an interesting place than the casinos in Singapore, eh?"<br><br>"You betcha, Jack!" Loud Mouth responded with seemingly full attention, though in his mind he's already planning to run for the next (CENSORED) election....<br><br>Disclaimer: Any resemblance of the characters to people in real life is either coincidental or unfortunate.

            <div class='col-md body'>After inflaming a few racial issues, the future star of [CENSORED] party, Loud Mouth, successfully beat other candidates in his party election, and led his Barisan of Nonsense won the national election.<br><br>Yes, he's become the Prime Minister of Bolehsia.<br><br>Needless to say, he liked his new office in Bolehjaya very much. But he's bored, since he no longer needed to raise any more racial issues until the next election.<br><br>"Celaka, I'm terribly bored lah. Find me something to do."<br><br>"Yes, sir." His yesmen bowed in unison. "There's a United Nation conference next month in New York..."<br><br>"Conference means endless parties and free travel allowance for my entire family. Good. I want everyone in that Conference to know how boleh the new Prime Minister of Bolehsia is! Get prepared!"<br><br>So Loud Mouth and his yesmen took serious effort in making sure that Loud Mouth's first appearance in the UN is an unforgetable event, one that would make the entire Bolehsia proud.<br><br>So the day came. Loud Mouth, wearing a big smile on his face, and a keris around his waist, rode on an elephant and arrived in the New York Convention Hall. All the reporters were in awe and quickly took pictures.<br><br>"This must be the prime minister from Thailand" said one reporter.<br><br>"Stupid! I'm from Bolehsia! Thailand is not a real country, you dumbass!"<br><br>"Bolehsia? Never heard of." another reporter said.<br><br>Before Loud Mouth could pounce onto the reporter, his yesmen quickly dragged him into the convention hall.<br><br>Loud Mouth took a seat in the first row, and found himself sitting beside the president of United States, George World War Bush.<br><br><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1404/662939202_e22550e9e4_o.jpg"><br><br>"Yo, brother! You are Abang Bush, kan?"<br><br>"Yes... are you from Singapore?"<br><br>"Celaka, u blind kah? Can't you see my big shiny keris? Bolehsia la I'm from. By the way, Singapore is not a real country, it is a small island. SingaporeÂ’s population is just three to four million and there are no opportunities for corruption... unlike in our country." Loud Mouth proudly explained.<br><br>George World War Bush put on a smile, but in his mind he's trying to figure out whether Bolehsia has oil and/or is on his list of nuclear targets.<br><br>"So your country so big, must got a lot of opportunities for corruption lah, I envy u la!" Loud Mouth eyed Bush with envy. Then finally, he said while winking his right eye, "Does your White House need anyone?"<br><br>"Well, do you enjoy creating chaos and disharmony in the world? Do you know how to operate nuclear launch panel?" Bush asked.<br><br>"What are you talking about? Stirring racial conflict is my expertise! Nuclear bomb? Press button, senang saja! " Loud Mouth told the truth.<br><br>"All right, come to my office tomorrow. White House needs someone like you."<br><br>"I love you, man!" Loud Mouth replied in excitement.<br><br>Back in his luxury presidential suite sponsored by Bolehsians' tax money, Loud Mouth calculated how much more [CENSORED] he could get now he has his hand on the nuclear launch button.<br><br>Disclaimer: Any resemblance of characters in this story to real life people is either coincidental or unfortunate.<br><br><a href="http://www.BolehNation.com" rel="nofollow">www.BolehNation.com</a></div>
