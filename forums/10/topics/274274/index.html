            <div class='col-md body'><strong>More foreigners taking up Singapore citizenship</strong><br>By Julia Ng,<br>Channel NewsAsia | Posted: 15 August 2007 2254 hrs<br><br><img src="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/imagegallery/store/phpRXZ7wE.jpg"><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Larry Medina with daughter Erika </span><br><br>SINGAPORE: The number of babies born in Singapore in the first half of this year rose marginally to 18,488 from 18,294 in the same period last year.<br><br>But thanks to foreigners, Singapore's population has grown more than marginally.<br><br>Figures released by the National Population Secretariat showed that last year, over 13,209 foreigners were granted Singapore citizenship - 309 more than in 2005.<br><br>The number of permanent residents also jumped, from 52,300 in 2005 to 57,300 last year.<br><br>And to drive home the message that all Singaporeans share a common identity, a National Citizenship ceremony will be held this Saturday to swear in new citizens like Larry Medina and his family.<br><br>The 41-year-old accountant relocated his family from the US to Singapore seven years ago.<br><br>And it didn't take long for Larry and his Indonesian wife to decide that their future in Singapore will be brighter than in the US.<br><br>Larry said: "Certainly very complex decisions and the things that convinced us were: we expect the economies to continue to boom in Asia and Singapore is the best location to take advantage of that; my wife's family is close by as well, and all the usual things that people say about Singapore - that it's an easy place to live in, from the infrastructure perspective, and good schools for the kids, etc."<br><br>But choosing Singapore over US means that Larry has to relinquish his US citizenship, which he did recently and with few regrets.<br><br>Larry's wife, who is a Permanent Resident, has also applied for Singapore citizenship and hopes to be granted her pink Identity Card within months.<br><br>Their children get to keep their US citizenship till they turn 18 when they have to choose which country to call home.<br><br>Erika Medina, 7, is enrolled at a public primary school - Balestier Hill Primary - and lists Chinese lessons as one of her favourite subjects.<br><br>Her father is planning to send her 4-year-old brother to a public school too.<br><br>Singapore hopes to add about 40,000 citizens and 200,000 permanent residents to its fold over the next five years.<br><br>But attracting new migrants is only half the story.<br><br>With more immigrants from different cultures and backgrounds, integration of these new citizens becomes all the more vital.<br><br>Getting them involved in grassroots activities is one way to help new citizens like Maung Naig Win Kyaw bond with the community.<br><br>Maung came to Singapore from Myanmar 16 years ago.<br><br>The project engineer had not intended to settle down in Singapore.<br><br>But all that changed after he met his wife, who is a Singaporean.<br><br>Now, the 44-year-old is so involved in grassroots activities that he has become a close friend to many in his neighbourhood.<br><br>He said: "I enjoy helping the elderly people around this area. I feel that when I join the RC, Residents' Committee, I can contribute more for the elderly people....(like) helping them prevent dengue fever. Sometimes they call me to join them for tea, and I enjoy all these. I don't feel any difference between new citizens and local Singaporeans."<br><br>Maung and his six-year-old son received their Singapore citizenship last year.<br><br>And Maung will be adding another member to the Singapore family - his second child will be born next month. - CNA/ir<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The US State Department now says that it will assume that a US citizen intends to retain (not give up) his US citizenship if he:<br><br>1. is naturalized in a foreign country;<br>2. takes a routine oath of allegiance to a foreign country; or<br>3. accepts foreign government employment that is of a "non-policy-level" nature.<br><br>Apparently, a "routine oath of allegiance" to another country is no longer taken as firm evidence of intent to give up US citizenship, even if said oath includes a renunciation of US citizenship. This represents a dramatic reversal of previous US policy; it used to be that any such statement was taken rigidly at face value (as in the Supreme Court's 1980 Terrazas decision).</div>

And of course the financial hub, tourism, MICE industry etc, will also mean more opportunity for service industry.<br><br>The ball is now at your court, please qualify your statement.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>One cool quote from <a href="http://young-pap.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://young-pap.blogspot.com</a> regarding the results of primary school balloting:<br><br><blockquote>"Dear Sir,<br>Today, both my Singapore-born Singapore-citizen sons serve your family well by giving up their school places to your India-born India-citizen son. BUT THAT'S NOT ENOUGH! 12 years later, I will make sure my two sons serve your family again, by doing NS to protect you and your wife's safety, while your son is away from Singapore, having given up his PR to avoid NS! BUT THAT'S NOT ENOUGH! So, another 12 years after that, when you son comes back to Singapore as a "new" PR, in need of a job but too old to do NS, my children will give up their jobs so that your son can have one. Having no jobs, my two sons will then kill time, by doing more reservists and IPPT to ensure the safety and pleasure of your family! The honour is ours, Sir!"</blockquote>Just something to think about. Is Singapore closely approaching the situation stated above?</div>
