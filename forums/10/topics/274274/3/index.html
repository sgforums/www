He gave his own goats just sufficient food to keep them alive, but fed the strangers more abundantly in the hope of enticing them to stay with him and of making them his own.<br>When the thaw set in, he led them all out to feed, and the Wild Goats scampered away as fast as they could to the mountains.<br>The Goatherd scolded them for their ingratitude in leaving him, when during the storm he had taken more care of them than of his own herd.<br>One of them, turning about, said to him: That is the very reason why we are so cautious; for if you yesterday treated us better than the Goats you have had so long, it is plain also that if others came after us, you would in the same manner prefer them to ourselves.<br><br></div>

You've heard of the 'global village', haven't you?</div></blockquote>Global village? More like Chinese and Indian villages. Well, it takes a bigger  bigot to know another bigot. I suggest you look up the meaning of the word bigot before using it on me. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> You should look at the issues first before passing judgement and taking the moral high ground with me, my issue is with too many foreign talents extracting profits out of Singapore, I am not against foreigners.<br><br>There is a maximum amount of immgrants that Singapore can take it, we are not like the US or Australia, where the economy is huge enough to absorb all those immigrants without causing social tensions. Well, I am not totally against immigrants, provided they are really "talents". But at the current situation, think we taking in the sub-standard ah neh from India and sub-standard ah niu from China. How does his add value to Singapore?<br><br>They are constantly displacing Singaporeans from their jobs, due to cheaper wages which we are unable to compete with. Why aren't we able to compete with them for cheaper wages? It's because they have a lower cost structure for their families living in China, each S$1 earned here converts to RMB 5.00, without CPF, they stand to remit more back to China. The 4-6 average Chinese workers is able to squeeze into a room. Is the average Singaporean family able to squeeze 4-6 persons into a room?<br><br>Frankly I have nothing against these immigrant workers, it's not their fault, it's more the fault of the P4P government for failing to restrict the numbers of foreign workers. These worker cause the average Singaporean to have a lower standard of living by competing in terms of lower wages.<br><br>If you look at other countries, like Japan, UK, Australia, they have policies to restrict these immigrant workers to protect their own citizens. But Singapore has to take the idiotic route of competing for cheaper cost instead of quality. Ask yourself why is the price of a Rolex on the increase, while other generic electrical goods keep falling in value? To me, Singapore is just chasing a falling rock into the bottom of the well.<br><br>Not too long ago, this house was delapidated, the immigrants of the past came over from distant land to build this house to it's greatness today. These folks did not reap the benefits of building this house, instead they have been made poorer with the increase in new immigrant workers, as wage price drops, it cause a domino effect, wage levels below it dropped as well, causing these old folks who use to be able to make more from jobs at hawker centers, to be relinquish to picking up cans and boxes for a living.<br><br>Why was cheap foreign labour allowed to enter Singapore so easily? It's because of the governments intention to lower wage levels, as wage levels are always price sticky downwards. Their downward pressure of these foreigners caused the average wage level of Singaporeans to decrease. Talk to some taxi drivers, some use to be managers in factories, now they drive taxis because their bosses tell them, with your wage I can hire 3-4 Chinese workers. Would this have happened if there were less foreign labours being seconded to Singapore?<br><br>Like I said before, Singapore reliance on using cost economics is a negative sum game that will work against them in the long run. China and India with a huge labour force cannot be challenged by Singapore. How many more years of depressed wage levels does Singapore have to endure before India and China reach our levels of GDP per capita?<br><br>Don't you think by changing the demographical composition of Singapore will result in social tensions in the future?<br><br></div>
