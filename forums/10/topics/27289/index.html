            <div class='col-md body'>some users felt that it was "sensitive" and "dangerous" to discuss issues concerning other ethnic groups in an open public forum.<br><br>i disagree. i think that refusing to address an issue in no way resolves it and just cos we do not talk about it, it doesn't mean that S'poreans are "colour-blind" and all embracing in their approach to members of different eithnic groups.<br><br>what's there to be afraid of as long as your views are reasonable and moderate and above all, mature.<br><br>so here's the rule: no racial supremacy crap, no racist slurs and if u'ld prefer to keep your views concerning the topic to yourself, so be it. don't post.<br><br>are we as open, or in fact, as neutral towards members of other ethnic groups as we'ld like to believe?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well.....can i say tt u R NOT RACIST enuff to discuss openly...for example, in this Forum? However, juz like how a Forum is supposed to be - Open to the Public (not only restricted to S'pore, it's Globally) for Discussions, we have to Bear In Mind tt attempting to discuss 'RACISM' (rite now which is to me a Taboo, or rather a Sensitive Issue), we take the risk (if we r AWARE of the Situation now...i dun have to emphasize) of inviting Individuals who may not be the 'Friendly Ones' to discuss the Issue OBJECTIVELY but SUBJECTIVELY. Morever, there isnt anyone to 'Control Situation' if it gets outta hand. (starting to use abusively words or vulagr language &amp; etc...) If this shld ever happen which is nobody's intention or Maybe there r.....We wldnt know (terrorists may juz be Anyone...), who's gonna be Responsible!?!<br><br>If u'd like to express ur Views on RACISM.....why not u try somewhere like STRAITS TIMES INTERACTIVE ONLINE or juz the FORUMS.....at least, there r Regulators or Moderators <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think it's perfectly alright to discuss race issues in open forums. The faster we talk about it and get it off our chest, in a mature fashion (lets ignore how we interpret 'mature' for the moment and use a general meaning), the better we can understand differing views. For those who can't discuss race issues in a mature fashion, then they just have to take some serious flaming from the rest for a while as a result.</div>
