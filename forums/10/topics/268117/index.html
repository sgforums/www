            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Dear friends and countrymen,<br><br>Having been a spectator to all that has gone on in our little country these 23 years, I must say has been an enjoyable and entertaining experience. I would in my opinion like to express my feelings towards all the issues i feel that are close to my heart.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">One people, One nation, One Singapore?</span><br><br>It is with pride that I would like to share my personal experience of patriotism with all of you. In 2006 I was selected to be a part of our countries NDP celebrations. This will always be especially dear to me as it was the last ever NDP to be held in our glorious National Stadium. To me, it definitely has been the one single moment where i have toroughly felt the warmth of the Singapore People. Standing together and celebrating in our success, it reinforced all my beliefs that we have come a long way under sturdy leadership since our days as a mere fising village.<br><br>It is with sadness though that other than this single celebration, i have felt a sense of lacking in noticing the Singaporean spirit outside these national celebrations.<br><br>Being a student overseas currently, has further opened my eyey to what we truly have taken for granted. Now a student in Australia I find myself in a community where people treasure life as it is and strive to make the lives of others around them better through the smallest of deeds. A trip to the supermarket yields a plesant driving experience where horns are needless and courteous drivers who give way readily. A smiling cashier who spends the minutes at the checkout bothering to ask how your day has gone. People who hold the lift readily instead of pressing the close button on sight of your approach.<br><br>Though they say the grass is always greener on the other side, I have never once had the idea of giving up my citizenship as a Singaporean. Because in many ways we are still number 1 for many of the right reasons. Services here are slow and administration is a nightmare. Simple tasks here can often take days unlike our over-efficient homeland. Not to mention a hardworking people that keep services and entertainment open past 5pm! Magnificent food at the hawker centers at 3 dollars compared to sub standard substitutes here at at least 8 dollars. Believe me, the standard of living here isnt that cheap.<br><br>While the pressures of living in our cosy country are evident, we must admit we are a fortunate people. Our government gets more stick sometimes than credit! I refer to a previous post by fellow Singaporean Shaun Jalleh <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=267471" rel="nofollow">http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=267471</a><br><br>In my humble opinion i feel this is yet another example where we as Singaporean fail to preotect our own identity. Have we no pride or compassion for our fellow man? Where have the good values of our forefathers, pareants and religions taught us? Is it really so hard to help our fellow man? I quiz myself as to what i may have done that day in Shauns position. And i have come to this conclusion, I would have stood up for a fellow Singaporean and told our foreign friend to not judge us by her single encounter, because i believe we are better than that as Singaporeans. People of a developed country.<br><br>Many a times we have been labled a kiasu, selfish, kiasee, bo chup people. All that has to change! As a developled country we have the moral responsibility to stand up and live like people of standard! We do not need and should never allow foreigners to teach us to be gracious and civil! As educated people in a competitive society, it should be our perogative to encourage one another and aspire for more. Singaporeans do not lack compassion, look at how many people have to beg compared to our neighbouring countries! Many organisations receive enough help from the public to continue caring for the poor and aged.<br><br>In short my fellow countrymen, lets be grateful of what we have and strive to make Singapore a more plesant place to live! A simple hello, not pretending to not see the poor helpless person approaching the lift while pressing the door close button and saying thank your for small graces, all make living in our little built up country a little more plesant. Wouldnt that be nice?<br><br>Building our country into the worlds hub for almost every industry is not easy thus we should leave that to our capable government. However, making our country into the most desirable place to live is our duty. My friends, Lets all make Singapore a better place to live. Majullah Singapura! [/b]</div>

Well, it's a choice one has to make; between a more individualistic lifestyle and a constrained lifestyle. One cannot have the best of both world as economics dictates. Efficiency is also subject to interpretation. What is your definition of efficiency? To me, efficiency is the completion of a task in a timely and cheap manner. Are our ministers cheap? If it takes team A $1,000 to complete the task in 1 hour, while team B uses $4,000 to complete the task in 30 mins. I wouldn't call team B efficient, because it used more resources than team A, though it completed the task earlier.<br><br>Obviously, you are not a business or economics student. Since you are still studying, I think it's forgiveable to make this mistake. The cost of 8 dollars is justified, because on the average, Australians make many times more than our salary. Since you are using money made in Singapore to finance your living and education in Australia, then obviously everything will seem exhorbitant when compared to Singapore. I have a friend who just came back after 6 years in Australia, she's planning to stay there permanently, if things are so expensive and unaffordable, don't think she would have made the choice to migrate there.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by sWaiZZy:</div><div class="quote_body">While the pressures of living in our cosy country are evident, we must admit we are a fortunate people.

We are just average. They deserve the stick because more could be done to help the citizens and it does not include self serving policies like increasing one's own pay at the expense of citizens.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by sWaiZZy:</div><div class="quote_body">Though they say the grass is always greener on the other side, I have never once had the idea of giving up my citizenship as a Singaporean.

What has all these number one in everything done for Singaporeans, it's a egoistical delusion created by the ruling elites to entrap the dumber Singaporeans. Have all these number one in everything translate to shorter working hours, higher pay and better quality of life? More often we are told to tighten our belts and we have to work longer hours. Well, don't expect to be making 3rd world salary (Singapore) in a first world nation with the intention of spending it in a first world country (Australia). Ask the average Australian, I am sure that they are alright with the price. On the whole, Australians make many more times the average Singaporean in Singapore.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by sWaiZZy:</div><div class="quote_body">Many a times we have been labled a kiasu, selfish, kiasee, bo chup people.

I would in my opinion like to express my feelings towards all the issues i feel that are close to my heart.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">One people, One nation, One Singapore?</span><br><br>It is with pride that I would like to share my personal experience of patriotism with all of you. In 2006 I was selected to be a part of our countries NDP celebrations. This will always be especially dear to me as it was the last ever NDP to be held in our glorious National Stadium. To me, it definitely has been the one single moment where i have toroughly felt the warmth of the Singapore People. Standing together and celebrating in our success, it reinforced all my beliefs that we have come a long way under sturdy leadership since our days as a mere fising village.<br><br>It is with sadness though that other than this single celebration, i have felt a sense of lacking in noticing the Singaporean spirit outside these national celebrations.<br><br>Being a student overseas currently, has further opened my eyey to what we truly have taken for granted. Now a student in Australia I find myself in a community where people treasure life as it is and strive to make the lives of others around them better through the smallest of deeds. A trip to the supermarket yields a plesant driving experience where horns are needless and courteous drivers who give way readily. A smiling cashier who spends the minutes at the checkout bothering to ask how your day has gone. People who hold the lift readily instead of pressing the close button on sight of your approach.<br><br>Though they say the grass is always greener on the other side, I have never once had the idea of giving up my citizenship as a Singaporean. Because in many ways we are still number 1 for many of the right reasons. Services here are slow and administration is a nightmare. Simple tasks here can often take days unlike our over-efficient homeland. Not to mention a hardworking people that keep services and entertainment open past 5pm! Magnificent food at the hawker centers at 3 dollars compared to sub standard substitutes here at at least 8 dollars. Believe me, the standard of living here isnt that cheap.<br><br>While the pressures of living in our cosy country are evident, we must admit we are a fortunate people. Our government gets more stick sometimes than credit! I refer to a previous post by fellow Singaporean Shaun Jalleh <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=267471" rel="nofollow">http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=267471</a><br><br>In my humble opinion i feel this is yet another example where we as Singaporean fail to preotect our own identity. Have we no pride or compassion for our fellow man? Where have the good values of our forefathers, pareants and religions taught us? Is it really so hard to help our fellow man? I quiz myself as to what i may have done that day in Shauns position. And i have come to this conclusion, I would have stood up for a fellow Singaporean and told our foreign friend to not judge us by her single encounter, because i believe we are better than that as Singaporeans. People of a developed country.<br><br>Many a times we have been labled a kiasu, selfish, kiasee, bo chup people. All that has to change! As a developled country we have the moral responsibility to stand up and live like people of standard! We do not need and should never allow foreigners to teach us to be gracious and civil! As educated people in a competitive society, it should be our perogative to encourage one another and aspire for more. Singaporeans do not lack compassion, look at how many people have to beg compared to our neighbouring countries! Many organisations receive enough help from the public to continue caring for the poor and aged.<br><br>In short my fellow countrymen, lets be grateful of what we have and strive to make Singapore a more plesant place to live! A simple hello, not pretending to not see the poor helpless person approaching the lift while pressing the door close button and saying thank your for small graces, all make living in our little built up country a little more plesant. Wouldnt that be nice?<br><br>Building our country into the worlds hub for almost every industry is not easy thus we should leave that to our capable government. However, making our country into the most desirable place to live is our duty. My friends, Lets all make Singapore a better place to live. Majullah Singapura! </strong>[/b]</blockquote>You know, whoever you are,...<br><br>Your posting reads like a fairy tale book... or even a Secondary School Textbook...<br><br>Nicely written, well put.... but loades with MSG... looks like a container load of Instant Noodles...!!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In relation to maurizio 13,<br><br>LoL i am a finance student! Albeit maybe not a very good one hehehe <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> But heres my take on the issue<br><br>1) Aussies pay higher than Singaporeans? Not really considering their exhorbitant tax rates that encourage non participation in the workforce. Why do I say this? Because doctors and other highly skilled workers here are taxed in the excess of 40%. Tax here is very dependant on how much you earn. ie you are not taxed on the first 20k and subsequently you pay tax as your annual income increases. I hope thats clear enough to understand. This high tax rate on higher income earners provides for their dole system where non participants in the workforce are given money for not working. Dosent this create for inefficiency? Moreover, it clearly is evident that higher income earners here are not gratified for their skills here due to their taxation principles. You often find that many in the top tier of earners work more out of passion rather than choice.<br><br>2) Housing here is just as expensive as Singapore. A 2 room apartment can range from 200k up to 500k depending on location. In terms of size, I do not see much difference in a 400k house from a 3 room apartment. The only advantage is you get to live in a low rise building with fewer neighbours and perhaps more "personal space"<br><br>3) Labor unions here are very strong and enforce minimum wages, inefficiencies often occur due to strikes from many service and basic infrastructure sectors which often lead to stops in transport indusries. Being here and witnessing how strikes can affect your daily livelihood is not a fun prospect. Something i appreciate that dosent happen back home. Though they do enfoce minimum wages, i throughly feel it often is a stumbling block for many businesses as all these measures often take out an economic competitive edge that many startups may have.<br><br>4) Cars here are cheaper than Singapore for sure but realise that it is more than a necssity here due to the vast differnece in distances we have to travel here to get to places which service our daily needs ie postal services, food and entertainment. Fuel prices are pegged to Singapores. Withour making barriers to buy a car in Singapore it would really make our country a living nightmare to live in. Already many of us complain of morning and evening traffic. Think how it would be worse if everyone could easily afford a car. We would probably need to park in River Valley just to be in proximity to walk to Orchard road!<br><br>Quote: maurizio13<br>Number one in everything! What has all these number one in everything done for Singaporeans, it's a egoistical delusion created by the ruling elites to entrap the dumber Singaporeans. Have all these number one in everything translate to shorter working hours, higher pay and better quality of life? More often we are told to tighten our belts and we have to work longer hours. Well, don't expect to be making 3rd world salary (Singapore) in a first world nation with the intention of spending it in a first world country (Australia). Ask the average Australian, I am sure that they are alright with the price. On the whole, Australians make many more times the average Singaporean in Singapore.<br><br>I beg to differ, the average Aussie dosent earn as much as Singaporeans and in terms of personal wealth they lag far behind. A simple economic example. Less hours on supposedly more pay but taxed at relavant rates in relation to income scale. ie average ussie earns 100k per year which equates to a $30,550.00 tax bill before various levies. A simple anology, banks here pay fixed deposits in the excess of 6% per annoum as compared to low measly rates in singapore of around 2-3%. What does this tell you? That banks do not hold much liquidity and can easily to afford to pay more on deposits with them. In short, Aussies bo lui and dont save.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by sWaiZZy:<br><strong>Dear friends and countrymen,<br><br>Having been a spectator to all that has gone on in our little country these 23 years, I must say has been an enjoyable and entertaining experience. I would in my opinion like to express my feelings towards all the issues i feel that are close to my heart.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">One people, One nation, One Singapore?</span><br><br>It is with pride that I would like to share my personal experience of patriotism with all of you. In 2006 I was selected to be a part of our countries NDP celebrations. This will always be especially dear to me as it was the last ever NDP to be held in our glorious National Stadium. To me, it definitely has been the one single moment where i have toroughly felt the warmth of the Singapore People. Standing together and celebrating in our success, it reinforced all my beliefs that we have come a long way under sturdy leadership since our days as a mere fising village.<br><br>It is with sadness though that other than this single celebration, i have felt a sense of lacking in noticing the Singaporean spirit outside these national celebrations.<br><br>Being a student overseas currently, has further opened my eyey to what we truly have taken for granted. Now a student in Australia I find myself in a community where people treasure life as it is and strive to make the lives of others around them better through the smallest of deeds. A trip to the supermarket yields a plesant driving experience where horns are needless and courteous drivers who give way readily. A smiling cashier who spends the minutes at the checkout bothering to ask how your day has gone. People who hold the lift readily instead of pressing the close button on sight of your approach.<br><br>Though they say the grass is always greener on the other side, I have never once had the idea of giving up my citizenship as a Singaporean. Because in many ways we are still number 1 for many of the right reasons. Services here are slow and administration is a nightmare. Simple tasks here can often take days unlike our over-efficient homeland. Not to mention a hardworking people that keep services and entertainment open past 5pm! Magnificent food at the hawker centers at 3 dollars compared to sub standard substitutes here at at least 8 dollars. Believe me, the standard of living here isnt that cheap.<br><br>While the pressures of living in our cosy country are evident, we must admit we are a fortunate people. Our government gets more stick sometimes than credit! I refer to a previous post by fellow Singaporean Shaun Jalleh <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=267471" rel="nofollow">http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=267471</a><br><br>In my humble opinion i feel this is yet another example where we as Singaporean fail to preotect our own identity. Have we no pride or compassion for our fellow man? Where have the good values of our forefathers, pareants and religions taught us? Is it really so hard to help our fellow man? I quiz myself as to what i may have done that day in Shauns position. And i have come to this conclusion, I would have stood up for a fellow Singaporean and told our foreign friend to not judge us by her single encounter, because i believe we are better than that as Singaporeans. People of a developed country.<br><br>Many a times we have been labled a kiasu, selfish, kiasee, bo chup people. All that has to change! As a developled country we have the moral responsibility to stand up and live like people of standard! We do not need and should never allow foreigners to teach us to be gracious and civil! As educated people in a competitive society, it should be our perogative to encourage one another and aspire for more. Singaporeans do not lack compassion, look at how many people have to beg compared to our neighbouring countries! Many organisations receive enough help from the public to continue caring for the poor and aged.<br><br>In short my fellow countrymen, lets be grateful of what we have and strive to make Singapore a more plesant place to live! A simple hello, not pretending to not see the poor helpless person approaching the lift while pressing the door close button and saying thank your for small graces, all make living in our little built up country a little more plesant. Wouldnt that be nice?<br><br>Building our country into the worlds hub for almost every industry is not easy thus we should leave that to our capable government. However, making our country into the most desirable place to live is our duty. My friends, Lets all make Singapore a better place to live.

            <div class='col-md body'>"There are many other people around you earning silly money doing less work than you, not only ministers, people like your boss. Why not go take issue with them? If there are so many empassioned Singaporeans that take such harsh stances on ministers pay, I have this to say, its a democratic country and there are always trend setters and followers . . . "<br><br>WE have no good reason to take any issue with them.  It is different where is govt is concerned, it is the taxpayers whose money they are earning.  So to say you are OK with whatever $$$ they are paying themselves, even if one day they pay themselves $5m it is OK with you!   You need to be objective and adopt reasonable reasoning, if you wanna talk about issue like this.</div>
