passing of laws and regulations for fair and just administration,<br>(2) justice,<br>(3) free and unencumbered right of citizens to elect representatives or offer themselves as candidates to stand for election,<br>(4) implementing policies and decisions in objectively defined work processes to ensure good corporate governance where all decisions and policies are carried out with accountability and responsibility essential to development of citizensÂ’ social, cultural and economic vibrancy and competitiveness.<br><br>Specifically the constitution should clearly define (a) An effective executive, (b) Independent legislature, (c) An independent judiciary.<br><br>Each of the above-stated three component branches of government has its own critical roles and responsibilities to play. By spelling out such roles and responsibilities as well as power or authority it will then lead of development of good corporate governance to serve the greatest benefits of the greatest number.<br><br>When such a constitution is established, it is then possible to bring about condition for citizens and government to work in cooperation, and with coordination and efficiency. All government policies and decisions will then gain the fullest support and participation of its citizens in nation building.<br><br>Too much discretionary power<br><br>The current vagueness due to lack of clear definition of rights and privileges of citizens and component branches of government has created a situation where the executive has accumulated too much discretionary power to pass laws and regulations to suit its own narrow agendas, avoiding accountability and curtailing peopleÂ’s right to speak up, and participate in governing policies, appointments of government etc.<br><br>With such vague and uncertain constitution will the government be able to bring about a cosmopolitan and inclusive society? Will it govern the nation for the greatest good of the greatest number?<br><br>Or will it continue to govern the country by taxing and recovering costs of government from the citizens to the fullest extent, resulting in taxes being accumulated as surpluses for spending on extravagant projects like the 7 wonders or shin corp.<br><br>It is obviously more critical to find a balance between the need for law and order and facilitating the conditions for full and uninhibited participation by the citizens in good corporate governance essential to a competitive and vibrant development of nationhood.</div>
