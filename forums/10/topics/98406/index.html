            <div class='col-md body'><br>Let us take a look at the following examples.  It would show that PAP government get its "how to deliver" of "what it want to offer" from the outside experts, public, and civil servents.  Like the latest one:<br><br>YOUNG Singaporeans who spoke up during a six-week consultation exercise that has just ended want a better and more inclusive Singapore.<br><br>PM Lee offers a more inclusive society and the how to deliver is from the public.  So any party leader in that position can have the same resources to come up with the "how to".<br><br>================<br>SEPT 23, 2004<br>PREVENTING BLACKOUTS<br>Panel of nine to review power grid<br><br>By Alexis Hooi<br><br>A HIGH-POWERED committee of nine local and international energy experts has been formed to review Singapore's electricity and gas delivery systems.<br><br>The panel is expected to submit a report to the Government, with recommendations for bolstering the reliability of the power grid, next year.<br>================<br>On how to improve birth rate, how did the final package come to being?  Isn't it the work of civil servents who gather, organize, and evaluate public feedback and comments and then present to the minister to make the final decision.<br>================<br>Entrepreneurship? The challenge is ours<br>By Isabelle Chan, CNETAsia<br>Friday, October 15 2004 1:18 PM<br><br>commentary What do you want to be when you grow up?<br><br>I had different answers as I was growing up. I wanted to be a teacher<br>when I was 12 years old; an advertising executive when I was 18; and a<br>journalist when I was 21.<br><br>Becoming a businesswoman never crossed by mind. And the career<br>decisions I had to make were mainly about the courses I had to study<br>to get into my dream profession and which company I wanted to work for.<br><br>Today, we face slightly different choices: Should you join the<br>corporate world as an executive, or start your own business?<br><br>The Singapore government is trying to make this decision an easy one,<br>especially for those who decide to take up the challenge and risks. In<br>fact, the authorities hope more Singaporeans would consider<br>entrepreneurship as an option and they are doing what they think is<br>needed to provide a nurturing environment.<br><br>From restructuring the educational system and methods of teaching, to<br>appointing an "entrepreneurship minister", the government has, over<br>the last two years, introduced new programs and incentives to get<br>Singaporeans to venture into business. And hopefully, produce more<br>entrepreneurs like Creative Technology's Sim Wong Hoo who can continue<br>to put Singapore on the world map in sectors like technology and<br>biomedicine.<br><br>During his National Day Rally address on Aug 18, 2002, the then Prime<br>Minister Goh Chok Chong emphasized the importance of remaking<br>Singapore and announced that the government would, among several<br>things, promote entrepreneurship. Many questioned the country's<br>ability to successfully breed entrepreneurs, considering how Singapore<br>is well-known for its "rigid" and law-abiding society which is not<br>exactly conducive for innovative ideas to flourish.<br><br>It's been more than two years since that speech, and so far, the<br>government has attempted to create the right conditions for aspiring<br>entrepreneurs to start a business. For example, all homeowners are<br>allowed to conduct small-scale businesses in their homes under the<br>Home Office Scheme, which was introduced in June 2003. And judging by<br>this week's showing at the Global Entrepolis @ Singapore 2004 event,<br>there is no question that the government is committed to creating an<br>enterprising culture.<br><br>On top of the expected lineup of high-level industry speakers such as<br>K V Kamath, managing director and CEO of India's ICICI Bank and<br>Padmasree Warrior, chief technology officer of Motorola, this year's<br>premier business event featured a minister-studded cast. They include<br>His Excellency S R Nathan, president of the Republic of Singapore,<br>Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew, and<br>Minister for Trade &amp; Industry Lim Hng Kiang.<br><br>The speeches were varied, but the tune was the same. The government<br>heads were there to not only grace the event but lend support to the<br>local business community, which need strong regional business ties<br>with its ASEAN neighbors as well as India and China.<br><br>Although there was little tech news to report on, I enjoyed listening<br>to two guest speakers. One was Hong Chen, chairman and CEO of<br>Milpitas, Calif.-based GRIC Communications, who spoke at the<br>Distinguished Technopreneurs Forum Incoporating Forum on Silicon<br>Valley-Asia Links. The other was Fred Lin, one of the founding members<br>of Multitech Tawan, which is now Acer, who spoke at the 2nd Monte jade<br>Singapore Annual Gala Event.<br><br>Both trained as engineers, but they later became entrepreneurs and<br>built successful technology companies. Among their achievements: Hong<br>founded and led his company's successful IPO on NASDAQ in 1999, while<br>Lin set directions for several new Acer subsidiaries.<br><br>Hong and Lin shared their struggles and growing up experiences with<br>the delegates, which was one of the objectives of the event.<br><br>The Chinese-born Hong had lots of tips for budding entrepreneurs, such<br>as finding the right partner and recognizing that "it's better to take<br>a small piece of the bigger pie than a big piece of a smaller pie".<br><br>Lin emphasized the importance for the founders of companies to evolve<br>their attitudes and abilities as the company grows. Once the company<br>passes the startup phase, new leadership attributes and styles will be<br>required to match the new business changes and requirements, he said.<br><br>Startup scorecard<br>Twenty new startups received support for funding under the Startup<br>Enterprise Development Scheme (SEEDS) programme at an official<br>ceremony held at the Enterprise Exchange during Global Entrepolis @<br>Singapore 2004. More than half of these 20 companies provide<br>innovative IT products. They include Web content developer Avant Werx,<br>biometric technology provider IDLink Systems, and online gaming<br>developer Mikoshi.<br><br>Eighteen companies obtained support for SEEDS funding from the<br>Economic Development Board and two from SPRING Singapore. SEEDS, the<br>co-funding equity scheme between government and private investors,<br>provides a total of S$11 million (US$6.5 million) to the new 20 companies.<br><br>This brings the total of enterprises that have received SEEDS funding<br>to 120 since its launch in 2001, and a total of S$66 million (US$39.3<br>million) has been raised. The 120 SEEDS enterprises are projected to<br>generate S$350 million (US$208.2 million) and more than 1,400 jobs by<br>the end of this year.<br><br>But money is not the only thing that these young startups get. Four<br>companies with relevant domain and industry knowledge--Agilis<br>Communications Technologies, AdPlanet Group, Singapore Tyler Print<br>Institute and Sirius Capital Holdings--have been roped into the SEEDS<br>program to provide support and mentorship to budding entrepreneurs.<br><br>Limit to government's help<br>These pro-business programs aim to create a more nurturing environment<br>for local ventures but the key question is: Where does the help from<br>the government end? "An entrepreneurial culture cannot simply be<br>planned and ordered into being," said Prime Minister Lee at the<br>opening of Global Entrepolis @ Singapore 2004.<br><br>The government has acknowledged that it cannot succeed in promoting<br>entrepreneurship by giving out state subsidies or government<br>contracts, and has reiterated that it doesn't plan to jump in too<br>quickly to help when the going gets tough.<br><br>"Our people need to have fire in their bellies. They need to be on the<br>lookout for opportunities, and be ready to take calculated risks. They<br>must dare to conceive business plans and realize them," Lee said.<br><br>And while Lee calls fostering an entrepreneurial spirit "the most<br>difficult economic challenge for governments", I say this challenge is<br>ours, not theirs. If choosing entrepreneurship is a choice that we<br>make by ourselves, the challenges and risks should also be ours.<br><br>As Lee aptly put it: "A true entrepreneur depends on his<br>resourcefulness and drive, his business ideas, judgment and execution.<br>Only if Singapore entrepreneurs succeed in creating their businesses<br>through their own efforts, and can hold their own against competition,<br>can we say that we have truly achieved an enterprising culture."<br><br></div>
