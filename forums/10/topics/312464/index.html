              <p>March 26 - An Indonesian-led crackdown on Jemaah Islamiah has dealt the
              Southeast Asian Islamic militant network several major blows over
              recent years, although some members believed responsible for deadly
              attacks remain at large.</p>
              <p>Here is an overview of the fate of some of the best-known members of
              the group which aims to establish an Islamic state and has attacked
              Western targets in Southeast Asia.</p>
              <p>At large:</p>
              <p>* NOORDIN
              MOHAMMAD TOP -- Accused of masterminding a series of deadly bombings
              including the second Bali blasts in 2005 that killed more than 20
              people, Malaysian-born Top is said to be JI's leading strategist and a
              key financier. Indonesian police say they have often come close to
              capturing him.</p>
              <p>* UMAR PATEK -- Wanted for the 2002 Bali bombing
              that killed 202 people, JI member Patek is thought to have fled to the
              Philippines' restive southern islands in 2003 with fellow accused
              Dulmatin. Both have been working with members of Abu Sayyaf, a
              Philippine group responsible for the country's worst terror attack, a
              2004 ferry bombing that killed over 100 people. Captured:</p>
              <p>* ABU
              DUJANA -- Indonesia's most-wanted man when he was captured in central
              Java in June last year, Abu Dujana was wanted in connection with
              bombings including the 2004 attack on the Australian embassy in
              Jakarta. He is on trial for authorising the shipping of explosives to
              the religiously divided Sulawesi region of Poso and for harbouring
              fugitive militants, but is not charged with a specific bombing attack.
              Police say Dujana headed a new JI military wing, called Sariyah or
              military company.</p>
              <p>* RIDUAN ISAMUDDIN, ALSO KNOWN AS HAMBALI --
              One of a number of hardcore militants believed to have joined the group
              in Malaysia, Hambali was accused of planning the 2002 Bali bombings and
              captured in 2003. The Afghanistan-war veteran dubbed "the Osama bin
              Laden of Southeast Asia" was seen as the main link between JI and al
              Qaeda. He is now being held in Guantanamo Bay.</p>
              <p>* MOHAMAD BAEHAQI,
              ALIAS LATIF -- Philippine police arrested Latif, the Indonesian
              national they say is a JI member linked to bombings in 2006 which
              killed 20 people, in a Muslim rebel hideout on February 17 2008.</p>
              <p>Captured, convicted, and on death row for 2002 Bali bombings:</p>
              <p>*
              AMROZI -- The mechanic from Lamongan, East Java, was dubbed the
              "smiling bomber" because of his constant grin during the Bali bombing
              trial. He was the first of the three JI members on death row to be
              arrested by Indonesian police in November 2002, and the first to be
              sentenced to death, in August 2003.</p>
              <p>* IMAM SAMUDRA -- The alleged
              chief planner of the Bali bombings, described by police as a computer
              expert from Serang in western Java, confessed he planned the blasts
              when arrested in late November 2002. He was sentenced to death in
              September 2003.</p>
              <p>* MUKLAS, ALSO KNOWN AS ALI GUFRON -- Amrozi's
              older brother, the Islamic teacher Muklas was arrested in central Java
              in early December 2002. Accused of being operational chief of JI's
              Southeast Asian branch, he said he did not play a direct role in the
              Bali attack and retracted a confession in June 2003, saying he was
              tortured into confessing by interrogators. He remained defiant
              throughout his trial.</p>
              <p>Captured and released:</p>
              <p>* ABU BAKAR
              BASHIR -- Accused of co-founding JI with the late Abdullah Sungkar
              after they fled into exile in Malaysia in the early 1980s; security
              officials and experts have said Bashir was the group's spiritual
              leader, but he has consistently denied being part of it. The bearded
              preacher of Yemeni descent led an Islamic Youth movement before setting
              up the so-called "heart of JI", the Al-Mukmin boarding school in Solo,
              Central Java, in the 1970s with Sungkar. Jailed for conspiracy in the
              2002 Bali bombings, he was released in June 2006 and later cleared of
              wrongdoing.</p>
              <p>Deceased:</p>
              <p>* ABDULLAH SUNGKAR -- After he was
              alleged to have helped co-found JI, cleric Sungkar went to Afghanistan
              to participate in the Soviet-Afghan war in the 1980s, laying the
              foundations for JI's links with al Qaeda. When Sungkar died in 1999,
              Bashir became the group's leader, some experts say.</p>
              <p>* AZAHARI
              HUSIN -- A British-trained former university professor who became a
              master bombmaker for JI and allegedly played key roles in some of the
              most deadly bomb attacks that struck Indonesia this decade, the
              bespectacled Malaysian, nicknamed the Demolition Man, was killed in a
              shootout with anti-terror police commandos in the East Java district of
              Batu in 2005.</p>
              <p>Uncertain:</p>
              <p>* DULMATIN -- Believed to have
              fled to the Philippines in 2003 after being implicated in the 2002 Bali
              blasts, Dulmatin eluded authorities for years before he was reported
              wounded in a military raid on Jan. 31, 2008. In February the Philippine
              military said they may have exhumed his body, although DNA tests are
              being conducted.</p>
