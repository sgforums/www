            <div class='col-md body'>Seriously I don't think the anti-piracy activities will benefit companies such as Microsoft, Adobe, and Macromedia in the long run. It will instead, tip in favor of Linux, and Sun Microsystems and other freeware companies. Why?<br><br>Let's see the minds of the people who buys pirated stuff: "I will never buy original stuff. So expensive!!". So even if piracy was eradicated, they would never ever convince / persuade these people to buy their original goods, as what they want are goods as cheap as possible. Well, maybe initially they will buy those original goods, but I can say, 5 - 10 years from now, if Linux, a freeware OS, becomes even more user-friendly, many people will flock to it as it is nearly free. And oh of course, StarOffice. It is free to download, a small fee if you want it by post. When they become more powerful in features, you will know what will happen.<br><br>Another thing: Right now, the average age of having an advanced IT knowledge is getting smaller and smaller. However, if the government's wish is to educate all students on IT, I think the wish would be dead. To enable the students to have a greater knowledge of IT means that the students should have the necessary programs installed IN THEIR COMPUTER, such as Adobe and Macromedia. However the parents of the students do not understand the importance of the programs and even if they do, they would have no money to buy. Look, Adobe and Macromedia products have unrealistically high prices. How are the students to get them into their computer? They have absolutely no way to do it except buying pirated CDs.<br><br>I am not a avid supporter of pirated CDs, but when piracy was totally eradicated, this will be the destiny: Big Companies will lose money, Freeware Companies will gain revenue. However, this destiny can be avoided only if the companies reduce their prices, not by little, but by lots.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>the thing is theyre US or jap or euro based companies... and they use their currency as the basis to set the price. $50 is nuthin if u live in US, but when they sell it to other lower standard of living, 3rd world or new-economic countries thats where the currency exchange comes in. and thats the prob- the price will be too high fer us until it becomes ridiculous to warrant a purchase.<br><br>or at least thats what C-Fu sez  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>------------------<br>Now say it with me... fuuud is guuuud...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In the words of Steve Ballmer of Microsoft with regards to piracy "If you're going to get pirated,you want them to pirate your stuff, not your competitor's stuff.In developing countries, it is important to have a high share of the piracy software".So it would seem that Microsoft supports piracy as long as it helps them gain a market share,ehehe  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>------------------<br>Theory Of Relativity<br>Eating a lot of good food will make 1 hour seem like 5 minutes while eating lotsa horrigible cooked veggies will make 5 minutes seem like 1 hour <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">~~~<br>Waiting for Diablo 2 Add-on <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
