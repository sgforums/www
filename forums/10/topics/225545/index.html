Public speaking is also prohibited unless the speaker has been licensed by the government.<br><br>These laws, together with "politically motivated" defamation suits, have created in Singapore a "climate of political intimidation and self-censorship", and belie "the government's repeated claims that it is building an 'open society'", Amnesty International said.<br><br>Leaders of the ruling People's Action Party (PAP) -- which has been in power since the city-state's independence in 1965 -- say such legal action is necessary to safeguard their reputations.<br><br>They have also filed defamation law suits against foreign media, most recently the Far Eastern Economic Review, while legal suits launched against opposition politicians have bankrupted Chee and veteran opposition leader J.B. Jeyaretnam.<br><br>Under Singapore's laws, bankrupts cannot contest elections.<br><br>Chee, one of Singapore's most vocal opposition politicians, is also facing a defamation suit launched by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and his father Lee Kuan Yew over an article in the SDP's newsletter.<br><br>He has been jailed five times since 1999 for speaking in public without a permit, and for questioning the independence of Singapore's judiciary.

Still when there is no proof, you are defaming someone. As the law says, all the innocent until proven otherwise. So before you find some proof, don't defame ppl. Its irresponsible and reasonable and you get sued too.<br><br>I still think that everyone is merely accusing someone because they feel angry or feel unjustified BUT STILL you cannot defame someone.<br><br>Prove me wrong, see you in the court and bring forth evidence to the judge.</div>
