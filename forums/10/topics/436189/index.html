              Confrontational or constructive?
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px;">Pragmatic or populist?</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px;">Those were the "hard choices" facing Singaporeans in deciding the kind of politics they want, said Emeritus Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong during a National Day dinner at Marine Parade on Saturday.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px;">Expressing concern about the "whipping up of resentment" by those opposed to the Government during the May General Election, he asked if Singaporeans would choose "constructive politics" or "confrontational and divisive politics".</p>

              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px;">In his first major speech since the May elections, Mr Goh also said that with the country being in transition, the new and younger team of leaders together with the people will have to decide what their goals are for Singapore, and how to achieve them.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px;">They will have to make "hard choices" to solve problems within the economic, social and political spheres, reported <em>Channel NewsAsia</em>.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px;">Referring to the growing number of Singaporeans voicing out their views on various issues, especially online, he added that those born after independence will increasingly decide Singapore's political future.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px;">"Singaporeans generally, not just the young, now want to have more say in their future and have their diverse interests reflected in a pluralistic parliament," he said.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px;">"It is much easier to agitate and criticise than to come up with alternative, sound policies that will solve problems for the majority. Will Singaporeans choose constructive politics and debate policies rationally in the future, or choose confrontational and divisive politics based on stoking envy and resentment?"</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px;">They must also choose between pragmatic and populist politics, said Mr Goh.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px;">In pragmatic politics, Singaporeans will accept measures with short-term pain but long-term gain.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px;">"In populist politics, they want immediate gratification and ignore the long-term costs. Which way will Singapore politics go?" he asked.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px;">Turning his attention to Presidential Elections later this month, the former Prime Minister urged voters to scrutinize all four presidential hopefuls, "especially their character, integrity, experience, bearing and gravitas".</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px;">"In particular, we should ask whether they can deliver their promises under the Constitution," he was quoted as saying by <em>The Straits Times</em>.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px;">As deputy prime minister, Mr Goh was involved in conceptualizing the elected presidency in the 1980s.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px;">Saying that he knows the candidates well after having worked with all four of them before, he added that he wants the presidential office to be occupied by the best person who can rise above partisan politics and strengthen Singapore's governance framework.</p>

              <p>Chok Tong, cool , cool down.   EVery government in every country has the resentment from their citizens.    All depends on what lead them to be so.    </p>

              <p>This is subjective. And when it concerns the population at large, no right or wrong answer or even one capsulated answer.</p>
              <p>We just want a kind of politics that gets things done the correct way, with consensus. We had our fill of the dictatorial best way.</p>

                  independence will increasingly decide Singapore's political
                  future.</p>
                  <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px;">"Singaporeans
                  generally, not just the young, now want to have more say in their
                  future and have their diverse interests reflected in a pluralistic
                  parliament," he said.</p>
                  <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px;">"It is much easier
                  to agitate and criticise than to come up with alternative, sound
                  policies that will solve problems for the majority. Will
                  Singaporeans choose constructive politics and debate policies
                  rationally in the future, or choose confrontational and divisive
                  politics based on stoking envy and resentment?"</p>
                  <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px;">They must also
                  choose between pragmatic and populist politics, said Mr Goh.</p>
                  <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px;">In pragmatic
                  politics, Singaporeans will accept measures with short-term pain
                  but long-term gain.</p>
                  <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px;">"In populist
                  politics, they want immediate gratification and ignore the
                  long-term costs. Which way will Singapore politics go?" he
                  asked.</p>
                  <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px;">Turning his
                  attention to Presidential Elections later this month, the former
                  Prime Minister urged voters to scrutinize all four presidential
                  hopefuls, "especially their character, integrity, experience,
                  bearing and gravitas".</p>
                  <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px;">"In particular, we
                  should ask whether they can deliver their promises under the
                  Constitution," he was quoted as saying by <em>The Straits
                  Times</em>.</p>
                  <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px;">As deputy prime
                  minister, Mr Goh was involved in conceptualizing the elected
                  presidency in the 1980s.</p>
                  <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px;">Saying that he
                  knows the candidates well after having worked with all four of them
                  before, he added that he wants the presidential office to be
                  occupied by the best person who can rise above partisan politics
                  and strengthen Singapore's governance framework.</p>

              <p>If citizens is to remain pragmatic, they may not catch up with the trend of changing and act quick inorder tor respond quickly, by being populistic, at least you act and manage to change in time as the world changes, the present example of govt changing it strategy to remove some unpopular ministers and re focusing more on Singaporeans and their livinghood is a result of a populist action. If citizens are to remain pragmatic, today, these unpopular minister will still be around, act arrogantly, and there will still be free flow of FT and Fworkers like no tomorrow. The citizens of singapore should be praised for being populist so as to change and able to adapt to change both themselves and others to suit the current situation that is moving and changing so fast with not much room for being pragmatic.</p>
              <p>If a 23yo gal like me can tell you this, I dunno why you can still be around, pragmatically speaking, you should had retired and give up all your position.</p>

              <p><br>Why PAP is around for so long, because of citizens being dazed with pragmatic politics for too long, they do not dare to change, take risk and in long run, become complacent and let nature take is course, that is what PAP wanted, but it seem that today, it is changing, could be because of social media influence or peoples had seen the world to tell them enuf is enuf, we want a change. So, they turn to populist politics, and that makes the PAP govt scrambling to get in touch thru social media, you see the change make thru populist politics?</p>
