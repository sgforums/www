His first time in the election.  Isn't this politics?  The pioner quit the party immediately.  I know you people are now just focusing on yourself.  It's ok if you don't agree to what I say, when the PAP really gets voted out, then go find out for yourself.  We have been in good hands all these years, why rock the boat.  Even if you have to pass comments, you don't have to curse and swear at Mr. Lee Kuan Yew or any other ministers or ex-ministers. Just air your views politely.  The whole word is in crisis.  You think only you?  Singapore, such a small country can tie over the last recession faster than other countries.  What more do you expect?  Free hand outs?</p>

              while paying the mortgage, they also pay high property taxes.
               Up to $550 PER MONTH!  That is $6,600 PER ANNUM FOR
              LIFE!  Not only that.  Every few years the authorities
              check their house, if you had done renovation works,  they
              just increase your property tax.  We pay 30 to 40 years
              mortgage and the property tax is negligible.  Even for landed
              properties, our property taxes are low.  How to compare?
               Philippines?  Zero government subsidy housing.
               They buy a piece of land and build their own homes.  No
              money, build the structure first (the shell).  Save up enough
              money and do a partition for one room,  Save more money, put
              another room.  If roof leaks, no money to repair, live with it
              till they have money to repair the roof.  They have no one to
              help them.  You walk in the streets of some South East Asian
              countries and get stabbed, gunned down, dead also don't know what
              happened?  Singapore is such a safe haven. </p>
              <p>PAP is already listening to Singaporeans as they are now aware
              of their resentment.  But don't be too hard on them.  Why
              scold 4 letter word and curse and swear at Mr. Lee Kuan Yew and
              ministers?  Some even say, vote PAP out.  Can they be
              sure the next government can do a better job than the PAP?  No
              one can tell.  The Chinese saying "Living a good life, don't
              know how to appreciate the good life".</p>
              <p>Whatever situation we are in, good or bad it all depends on
              oneself. Why some people are rich and some poor?  It depends
              on how we live life and strive forward and not always expecting the
              government to do something for us.  If we make good money, we
              can afford private housing. And life will be good. Why keep
              complaining and all the blame game?</p>
              <p>I like the way you rationalize the situation Domo.</p>

              <p>You should answer the 2 questions:</p>
              
              <p>1) You tell us to migrate. If you are not happy in this anti-PAP forum, why are you here? I can say I don't own the forum, but I have a stake in my country so you don't tell me what to do and what to say. If you didn't attack my views I wouldn't attack you back.</p>
              
              <p>2) If the President is neutral, what difference does it make to you or the PAP who the president is? Lee Hsien Loong said the PAP is not the president's master, why do you care so much that Tony Tan be president?</p>

                              An ignoramus who doesn't know the president makes no policy, and serves 5 years not 4. Who knows only to criticize other countries like Singapore is the best in the world.

              <p>What talking you?  You are so so so ignorant.  There you go again comparing our President with other Presidents of the world.  Pointless to say more.  You just don't get it.  How can a Singaporean like you be so blur to the outside world. You need to travel out of Singapore to know what I am talking about, see the world, instead of hiding in your own cocoon.</p>
              <p>I have no intention to live in Hongkong.  May be you will appreciate the small space more than me.  To me Singapore is still one of the most liveable cities in the world, the best government we have in the world.  I do not belong to the PAP, but I have high regards for them and cannot tolerate abusive people like you with no sense of gratitude.  </p>

              <p>Reclaim Singapore. You are one of those who have not gone through a depression in our country, so don't talk big.  Singapore falls in your this kind of calibre, we die standing.  Narrow minded, self-centred individual with microscopic mind.</p>
