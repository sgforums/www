                                   How can a Singaporean like you be so blur to the outside
                                  world. You need to travel out of Singapore to know what I am

                                  still one of the most liveable cities in the world, the best
                                  government we have in the world.  I do not belong to the PAP,

                                  this country, we get big investors here and Singapore is
                                  flourishing.  Say what you like.</p>
                                  <p>Reclaim Singapore. You are one of those who have not gone
                                  through a depression in our country, so don't talk big.
                                   Singapore falls in your this kind of calibre, we die

                              <p>Yes, you can buy 2,500 sq.ft land and live in landed
                              properties.  Prices are very low, about $250,000.  But
                              while paying the mortgage, they also pay high property taxes.
                               Up to $550 PER MONTH!  That is $6,600 PER ANNUM FOR
                              LIFE!  Not only that.  Every few years the authorities
                              check their house, if you had done renovation works,  they
                              just increase your property tax.  We pay 30 to 40 years
                              mortgage and the property tax is negligible.  Even for landed
                              properties, our property taxes are low.  How to compare?

                              <p>I must take issue with you on so many points.</p>
                              <p>1. Most Hong Kongers live in government apartments</p>
                              <p>2. My Sg apartment property tax is $4,000 based on the rental value. But I live in it. Plus my mortgage.</p>
                              <p> 3. Is that reasonable compared to $6,000 for a <b>bungalow</b> in the western country <b>YOU cited</b>?</p>
                              <p><b>4. If you think 40 year mortgage is ok, I don't know what to say.</b></p>
                          <p>5. My children's children can inherit my house, and they will never have to start a mortgage all over again.</p>
                              <p></p>
                              <p>Congratulations, you have sunk your own argument.</p>
                      
                              <p>which brings me to the question: why am I still here? Ans: I have other nests.</p>

              <p>in this time and age, information and 'news' come as tsunami to those who seek. what is important is the ability of discernment. what is right and what is wrong, what is believable and what is bull shit, what is worth reading through and what should be deleted after the first line.</p>
              <p>everybody has every right, political or not, but if that affects others, then that right comes with responsibilities!</p>
              <p>Agree there should be check and balance. What is more important is the channel through which check and balance can be effective. sgforum is a place for people to vent their unhappiness, the kpkb here can hardly check, let alone balance.</p>

              <p>We have been brainwashed since primary school to believe that we have a near-ideal situation where 90% of Singaporeans own their own apartment.</p>
              <p>However, what we have is legally, a mere 99yr rental unit. You can be evicted from your hdb flat with no refund should HDB wants to.</p>
              <p>If you throw killer litter in private condo, you will only be liable to fines, and perhaps jail and compensation if you managed to inflict harm on others.</p>
              <p>but if you are found guilty of throwing killer litter, your flat can be confiscated, w/o compensation, by HDB, in addition to the fines and jaiterm mentioned earlier.</p>
              <p>Lastly, let say, when you need to make a secured bank loan, private housing can be used as mortgage, but not hdb flats, even when they are fully paid for, and with the loan amount being a fraction of the flat's value.</p>
              <p>Yes, tax here is low. but don't forget, income here is extremely low too.</p>
              <p>A labourer in the West, makes more than our average uni grad. even after paying off high taxes, he still have many times more disposable income than his counterparts in singapore.</p>

              <p>Well, u sure can appreciate whoever you want, but I certainly will not appreciate one who did so little and yet get so high a pay. Hk is a total different stories, it is now under china, and when china grow, it also grow, they got a minimum wage system, less foreign workers, good Foreign talents. So, you cannot compare an apple to an orange.</p>
              <p>What you can compare is past present and future danger. Let take a look at normal singapore 45yo man who worked for my family as a pub manager from a bartender, worked about 15 years, one of the oldest since my dad open pub business here.</p>
              <p>As a bartender, in 1995, he was paid $1,200, inflation only 1%, cost of living, from foods to house is more than enuf for him to get married and borne 2 lovely childrens, a 4 rooms flat was about 90k only, given his paid increased $100 per year, in 15years, his paid is now 2700, plus promotion, it is only $3000, his kids now in secondary schools, needs lots of money to buy this and that, and a 4 room flat now cost 350k++, inflation at 5.5%.</p>
              <p>In reality, he wants to quit to get a higher paid job, but nowhere can he find a paid higher than $3200 as a pub manager or resturant captain, most only quote him $1800 only, cos young and handsome philipinos can just take $1500.  If you look at the salary increment and the cost of living progression, salary is lacking far far behind due to foreigner accepting of depressive salaries. And frankly, I cannot paid a 45yo pub mgr more than what he demands, cos, I will not be competitive.</p>

                  <p>This is not 1970s Singapore with cheap, uneducated workers, intimidated by the law, ignorant and without anything close to the internet. You can hold back the tide, it will only crash down harder on you. Some of us fortunate enough will leave, some will make life harder for you, some will languish in jail. You will have a nation of poor and angry people. Censorship and the police will only get you so far. Those in jail will be martyrs and heroes. Event those who fail to crack your GRC will be heroes. The people wonâ€™t be so stupid as to be brainwashed (unless you take away their education). Your nation will not succeed.</p>

              We just PAP out of politics, not out of life. Hope you get shot by a sniper one of these days.

              <p>I have said many times over, I am just an individual. So stop
                      taking me as member of PAP government!</p>
              <p>Whatever unhappiness you all feel, there is no necessity to
                      curse and swear at our ministers and ex-ministers to go to hell.
                      There is retribution in what you people say.  </p>
              <p>Very well then, go vote and support your beloved Opposition and
                      see what they can do for you.  It is never easy to be the
                      government.  Ruling parties all over the world are
                      experiencing tough times with their people and a lot of them are no
                      better than us.  Give constructive feedback to your MPs. May
                      be you all should form an Opposition yourself and do greatness to
                      Singaporeans. Not just a whole lot of complaints.</p>
              <p>I am wasting my time in this forum.  I got better things to
                      do to better my life, instead of whining, cursing and swearing.          </p>
