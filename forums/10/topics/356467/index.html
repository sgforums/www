Domestic economic policy was narrowly concerned with four major goals to eliminate Germany’s issues, elimination of unemployment, rapid and substantial rearmament, protection against the resurgence of hyper-inflation, and expansion of production of consumer goods to improve middle and lower-class living standards. All of these policy goals were intended to address the perceived shortcomings of the Weimar Republic and to solidify domestic support for the party. In this, the party was successful. Between 1933 and 1936 the German Gross National Product (GNP) increased by an average annual rate of 9.5%, and the rate for industry alone rose by 17.2%.</p></div>

              <p>How very Leviathan. Unfortunately, Nazism was more than the catalyst to a world war, it also engendered a racist policy that killed six million Jews, 3 million Gypsies, and many others including disabled Germans, Soviet POWS. I don't consider that war, but rather, a genocide.</p>
              <p>"Men cannot change without wars" - of course, but don't forget, change can be for the worst. We may argue that Allied victory shapes the later generation's perspective of the war - painting Nazis as evil, or Austria as an unwitting victim. That may be true. But I still don't understand how we can explain away the mass graves and deplorable conditions of the death camps. History could be a remnant of the truth, but this is truth enough for me to hope nothing like this ever happens again.</p>

              <p>When Adolf Hitler became chancellor of the German
              Reich on January 30, 1933, he was not yet forty-four years old. From
              his birth in Austria in 1889 to the outbreak of war in 1914, his life
              had been a succession of failures, the seven years 1907-1914 being
              passed as a social derelict in Vienna and Munich. There he had become a
              fanatical Pan-German anti-Semite, attributing his own failures to the
              "intrigues of international Jewry."</p>
              <p>The outbreak of war in August 1914 gave Hitler the
              first real motivation of his life. He became a super-patriot, joined
              the Sixteenth Volunteer Bavarian Infantry, and served at the front for
              four years. In his way he was an excellent soldier.</p>
              <p>Attached to the
              regimental staff as messenger for the First Company, he was completely
              happy, always volunteering for the most dangerous tasks. Although his
              relations with his superiors were excellent and he was decorated with
              the Iron Cross, second class, in 1914 and with the Iron Cross, first
              class, in 1918, he was never promoted beyond Private, First Class,
              because he was incapable of having any real relationships with his
              fellow soldiers or of taking command of any group of them. He remained
              on active service at the front for four years.</p>
              <p>During that period his
              regiment of 3,500 suffered 3,260 killed in action, and Hitler himself
              was wounded twice. These were the only two occasions on which he left
              the front. In October 1918 he was blinded by mustard gas and sent to a
              hospital at Pasewalk, near Berlin.</p>
              <p>When he emerged a month later he
              found the war finished, Germany beaten, and the monarchy overthrown. He
              refused to become reconciled to this situation.</p>
              <p>Unable to accept either
              defeat or the republic, remembering the war as the second great love of
              his life (the first being his mother), he stayed with the army and
              eventually became a political spy for the Reichswehr, stationed near
              Munich. In the course of spying on the numerous political groups in
              Munich, Hitler became fascinated by the rantings of Gottfried Feder
              against the "interest slavery of the Jews."</p>
              <p>At some meetings Hitler
              himself became a participant, attacking the "Jewish plot to dominate
              the world" or ranting about the need for Pan-German unity. As a result
              he was asked to join the German Workers' Party, and did so, becoming
              one of about sixty regular members and the seventh member of its
              executive committee.</p>
              <p>The German Workers' Party had been founded by a
              Munich locksmith, Anton Drexler, on January 5, 1919, as a nationalist,
              Pan-German, workers' group. In a few months Captain Ernst Rohm of Franz
              von Epp's corps of the Black Reichswohr joined the movement and became
              the conduit by which secret Reichswehr funds, coming through Epp, were
              conveyed to the party.</p>
              <p>He also began to organize a strong-arm militia
              within the group (the Storm Troops, or SA). When Hitler joined in
              September 1919, he was put in charge of party publicity. Since this was
              the chief expense, and since Hitler also became the party's leading
              orator, public opinion soon came to regard the whole movement as
              Hitler's, and Rohm paid the Reichswehr's funds to Hitler directly.</p>
              <p>During 1920 the party grew from 54 to 3,000
              members; it changed its name to National Socialist German Workers'
              Party, purchased the <em>Và¹–lkischer Beobachter</em> with 60,000 marks of General von Epp's money, and drew up its "Twenty-five-Point Program."</p>
              <p>The party program of 1920 was printed in the party
              literature for twenty-five years, but its provisions became more remote
              from attainment as years passed. Even in 1920, many of its clauses were
              put in to win support from the lower classes rather than because they
              were sincerely desired by the party leaders.</p>
              <p>These included (1)
              Pan-Germanism;</p>
              <p>(2) German international equality, including the
              abrogation of the Treaty of Versailles;</p>
              <p>(3) living space for Germans,
              including colonial areas;</p>
              <p>(4) German citizenship to be based on blood
              only, with no naturalization, no immigration for non-Germans, and all
              Jews or "other aliens" eliminated;</p>
              <p>(5) all unearned incomes to be
              abolished, the state to control all monopolies, to impose an
              excess-profits tax on corporations, to "communalize" the large
              department stores, to encourage small business in the allotment of
              government contracts, to take agricultural land for public purposes
              without compensation, and to provide old-age pensions;</p>
              <p>(6) to punish all
              war profiteers and usurers with death; and</p>
              <p>(7) to see that the press,
              education, culture, and religion conform to "the morals and religious
              sense of the German race."</p>
              <p>As the party grew, adding members and spreading
              out to link up with similar movements in other parts of Germany, Hitler
              strengthened his control of the group...</p>

              <p>And by this date, certain members of the Milner Group <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>and of the
              British Conservative government had reached the fantastic idea that
              they could kill two birds with one stone by setting Germany and Russia
              against one another in Eastern Europe. </strong></span></p>
              <p>In this way they felt that the
              <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>two enemies would stalemate one another</strong></span>, or that Germany would become
              satisfied with the oil of Rumania and the wheat of the Ukraine. </p>
              <p>It
              never occurred to anyone in a responsible position that Germany and
              Russia might make common cause, even temporarily, against the West. 
              Even less did it occur to them that Russia might beat Germany and thus
              open all Central Europe to Bolshevism.</p>
              <p>In order to <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>carry out this plan of allowing Germany to drive eastward
              against Russia</strong></span>, it was necessary to do three things:</p>
              <p>(1) <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>to liquidate
              all the countries standing between Germany and Russia; </strong></span></p>
              <p>(2)<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> to prevent
              France from honoring her alliances with these countries</strong></span>;  and</p>
              <p>(3) to
              hoodwink the English people into accepting this as a necessary, indeed,
              the only solution to the international problem. </p>
              <p>The<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> Chamberlain group
              were so successful in all three of these things that they came within
              an ace of succeeding, </strong></span>and failed only because of the obstinacy of the
              Poles, the unseemly haste of Hitler...</p>

              <p>An incorrect interpretation of history:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>March Madness 1939</strong></p>
              <p>by Patrick J. Buchanan</p>
              <p>On Sept. 1, 1939, Hitler’s panzers smashed into Poland. Two days
                  later, an anguished Neville Chamberlain declared war, the most awful
                  war in all of history.</p>
              <p>Was the war inevitable? No. No war is inevitable until it has begun. Was it a necessary war? Hearken to Churchill:</p>
              <p>“One day, President Roosevelt told me that he was asking publicly
                  for suggestions about what the war should be called. I said at once,
                  ‘The Unnecessary War.’ There never was a war more easy to stop than
                  that which has just wrecked what was left of the world … .”</p>
              <p>But if the war need not have happened, what caused it?</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Let us go back to Munich.</strong></span></p>
              <p>On Sept. 30, 1938, at Munich, Chamberlain signed away the
                  Sudetenland rather than fight to keep 3.5 million Germans under a Czech
                  rule imposed upon them at the Paris peace conference in violation of
                  Wilson’s principle of self-determination.</p>
              <p>Why did Britain not fight?</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Because Britain had no alliance with Prague and Chamberlain did not
                  “give two hoots” who ruled the Sudetenland. </strong></span>Also, Britain had no draft,
                  no divisions to send to France, no Spitfires, no support from America
                  or her dominions, no ally save France, who had been told that, if war
                  came, the United States would not deliver the planes France had
                  purchased.</p>
              <p>U.S. neutrality laws forbade it.</p>
              <p>In his meetings with Chamberlain, Hitler had warned that Poland and
                  Hungary would also be entering claims for ancestral lands ceded to the
                  Czechs at Paris in 1919.</p>
              <p>Thus, after Munich, Warsaw had seized coal-rich Teschen, which held
                  tens of thousands of Poles. Hungary, in the “Vienna Award” of Nov. 2,
                  1938, got back lands in Slovakia and Ruthenia where Hungarians were the
                  majority and Budapest had ruled before 1919.</p>
              <p>Neither Britain nor France resisted these border revisions.</p>
              <p>Came then March 1939, when Czechoslovakia began to crumble.</p>
              <p>On March 10, to crush a Slovakian push for independence, Czech
                  President Emil Hacha ousted Slovak Prime Minister Father Tiso, occupied
                  Bratislava and installed a pro-Prague regime.</p>
              <p>On March 11, Tiso fled to Vienna and appealed to Berlin.</p>
              <p>On March 13, Tiso met Hitler, who told him that if he did not
                  declare independence immediately, Germany would not interfere with
                  Hungary’s re-annexation of Slovakia. Budapest was moving troops to the
                  border.</p>
              <p>On March 14, Slovakia declared independence. Ruthenia followed, dissolving what was left of Czechoslovakia.</p>
              <p>Adm. Horthy, told by Hitler he could re-annex Ruthenia but must keep his hands off Slovakia, occupied Ruthenia.</p>
              <p>Hacha now asked to meet with Hitler to get the same guarantee of independence Slovakia had gotten.</p>
              <p>But Hitler bullied Hacha into making the Czech remnant a protectorate of Germany.</p>
              <p>Thus, six months after Munich, the Germans of Czechoslovakia were
                  where they wished to be, under German rule. The Poles were under Polish
                  rule. The Hungarians were under Hungarian rule. And the Slovaks were
                  under Slovak rule in their new nation.</p>
              <p>But 500,000 Ruthenians were back under Budapest, and 7 million
                  Czechs were back under German rule — this time Berlin, not Vienna.</p>
              <p>Ethnonationalism had torn Czechoslovakia apart as it had the parent
                  Hapsburg Empire. Yet, no vital British interest was imperiled.</p>
              <p>And though Hitler had used brutal Bismarckian diplomacy, not force,
                  Chamberlain was humiliated. The altarpiece of his career, the Munich
                  accord, was now an object of mockery.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Made a fool of by Hitler, baited by his backbenchers, goaded by Lord
                  Halifax, facing a vote of no confidence, on March 31, 1939, Chamberlain
                  made the greatest blunder in British diplomatic history. He handed an
                  unsolicited war guarantee to the Polish colonels who had just bitten
                  off a chunk of Czechoslovakia.</strong></span></p>
              <p>Lunacy, raged Lloyd George, who was echoed by British leaders and almost every historian since.</p>
              <p>With the British Empire behind it, Warsaw now refused even to
                  discuss a return of Danzig, the Baltic town, 95 percent German, which
                  even Chamberlain thought should be returned.</p>
              <p>Hitler did not want a war with Poland. Had he wanted war, he would
                  have demanded the return of the entire Polish Corridor taken from
                  Germany in 1919. He wanted Danzig back and Poland as an ally in his
                  anti-Comintern Pact. Nor did he want war with a Britain he admired and
                  always saw as a natural ally.</p>
              <p>Nor did he want war with France, or he would have demanded the return of Alsace.</p>
              <p>But Hitler was out on a limb with Danzig and could not crawl back.</p>
              <p>Repeatedly, Hitler tried to negotiate Danzig. Repeatedly, the Poles
                  rebuffed him. Seeing the Allies courting Josef Stalin, Hitler decided
                  to cut his own deal with the detested Bolsheviks and settle the Polish
                  issue by force.</p>
              <p>Though Britain had no plans to aid Poland, no intention of aiding
                  Poland and would do nothing to aid Poland — Churchill would cede half
                  that nation to Stalin and the other half to Stalin’s stooges — Britain
                  declared war for Poland.</p>
              <p>The most awful war in all of history followed, which would bankrupt
                  Britain, bring down her empire and bring Stalin’s Red Army into Prague,
                  Berlin and Vienna. But Hitler was dead and Germany in ashes.</p>
              <p>Cost: 50 million lives. “But ’twas a famous victory.”</p>

              <p>...Yet despite the euphoria of his 50th birthday, Hitler had turned a
                  fateful corner that spring of 1939 and was leading Germany on a road to
                  catastrophe.</p>
              <p>A man willing to listen to advice might have
                  heeded warnings that the Western powers of Britain and France would not
                  continue to sit back and let Germany trample over other European
                  countries.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Neville Chamberlain, the British Prime Minister, had
                  acquiesced to Hitler’s demands over the Sudetenland in October the
                  previous year on the understanding that Germany had no further
                  ambitions with regard to land conquest.</strong></span></p>
              <p>Hitler had duly given
                  him such an assurance, then five months later, in March 1939, had
                  invaded the rest of Czechoslovakia. Contemptuous of Chamberlain and the
                  British and French, the Fuhrer had told his acolytes that the Western
                  powers might protest, but as before would do nothing.</p>
              <p>In this,
                  he had been woefully wrong. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Chamberlain might have been prepared to
                  give Hitler the benefit of the doubt once, but not again.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>His
                  ministers and, indeed, the whole country fell behind the Prime
                  Minister’s new tough stance. Public opinion in Britain agreed with
                  Chamberlain that Hitler would have to be tackled.</strong></span></p>
              <p>Nonetheless,
                  Hitler noted that still Britain and France had done nothing and with
                  Czechoslovakia now annexed into the Reich, he turned his attention to
                  Poland.</p>
              <p>In 1919, the new Polish state had been granted a strip
                  of land between the province of East Prussia and the rest of Germany
                  that gave them access to the Baltic Sea.</p>
              <p>Hitler wanted this
                  largely Germanpeopled strip of land back and had assumed that Poland
                  could be threatened and bullied into ceding this Danzig ‘corridor’ back
                  to Germany. This done, he believed Poland would then become a virtual
                  German satellite and ally when he eventually launched an attack on the
                  Soviet Union.</p>
              <p>The Poles, however, had no intention of being
                  bullied and flatly rejected German proposals to cede the corridor
                  despite threats of military action. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Then, on the last day of March,
                  came the news that Britain had agreed a mutual assistance pact with the
                  Polish government should Germany attempt to make any territorial claims
                  on Poland.</strong></span></p>
              <p>Hitler flew into a rage, thumping his fist on the
                  marble-topped table in his study. ‘I’ll brew them a devil’s potion,’ he
                  muttered. It was at this moment, 70 years ago, that the die was cast:
                  Poland, he realised, was not going to roll over without a fight.</p>
              <p>Speer
                  had been on a visit to Mussolini’s Italy during Hitler’s annexation of
                  Czechoslovakia, but on his return at the beginning of April noticed a
                  mood of general depression. The days of peaceful victories seemed to be
                  over.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, the economic situation in Germany was beginning
                  seriously to falter once more, offset by an increasingly acute labour
                  shortage caused by Hitler’s rapid expansion of the Armed Forces.</p>
              <p>‘Apprehensions about the future,’ wrote Speer, ‘filled us all.’</p>
              <p>The Fuhrer, however, brushed such matters aside. What did he care of such trifling domestic issues?</p>
              <p>Of
                  course, there would be economic problems, he reasoned, but these would
                  be solved in due course when the lands of the East would be opened up,
                  creating lebensraum — ‘living space’ — and natural resources.</p>
              <p>This
                  belief also ran alongside his increasingly fervent conviction that war
                  was a panacea. Many of the Nazi elite might have secretly voiced
                  concerns, but Hitler was exhilarated by the prospect. ‘If it comes to
                  war,’ he told Speer, ‘the German people are tough enough.’</p>
              <p>As
                  Hitler turned 50, he was preparing to announce to the German people his
                  new stance against Poland and Britain. Just as his belief in his
                  greatness had reached new heights, so, too, had he come to accept that
                  his own and Germany’s destinies were inextricably linked.</p>
              <p>Germany
                  had to expand further, of that he was convinced, and that meant one
                  thing: war. Germany would fight that war and win, or else sink back
                  into the abyss. It was as plain to him as black and white. There could
                  be no middle ground.</p>
              <p>Allied to this belief was his conviction that time was running out.</p>
              <p>He
                  had always been a chronic hypochondriac and now, with this milestone
                  birthday, he had been reminded that he was beginning to age. ‘I’m now
                  50 years old,’ he told his entourage in August, ‘still in full
                  possession of my strength. The problems must be solved by me, and I can
                  wait no longer. In a few years I will be physically and perhaps
                  mentally no longer up to it.’</p>
              <p>His Reichstag speech on April 28,
                  1939, lasted two hours and 20 minutes and was prompted not only by
                  Britain and Poland’s new stance, but also by President Roosevelt’s
                  demand that Germany give an assurance that they would not attack 30
                  named countries — Poland included — for 25 years.</p>
              <p>Incensed, Hitler responded to the American President, contemptuously berating him with heavy sarcasm.</p>
              <p>He also used the speech to tear up the terms of a naval agreement made with Britain four years earlier.</p>
              <p>After the applause had died down, he returned to the Reich Chancellery, exhausted and drenched in sweat.</p>
              <p>Listening
                  to the speech was the Berlin-based American journalist William L
                  Shirer, who was impressed by Hitler’s performance, if not the words he
                  spoke.</p>
              <p>‘Still much doubt here among the informed,’ Shirer
                  wrote in his diary, ‘whether Hitler has made up his mind to begin a
                  world war for the sake of Danzig.’</p>
              <p>But Hitler had made up his
                  mind. A few weeks later he told a meeting of senior Nazis and military
                  commanders that the time had come to attack Poland at the first
                  suitable opportunity.</p>
              <p>‘We cannot expect a repetition of Czechoslovakia,’ he told them. ‘There will be war.’</p>
              <p>However,
                  he did recognise that a showdown with the West, and Britain in
                  particular, was probably no longer avoidable in the long run.</p>
              <p>‘Therefore England is our enemy and the showdown with England is a matter of life and death,’ he told his lackeys.</p>
              <p>It
                  was not an open declaration of war, but it was a declaration of intent.
                  It was also one that made his military commanders gulp nervously, for
                  although the rest of the world was fooled by the newsreels of military
                  parades and Luftwaffe fly-pasts, they knew, as Hitler knew, that the
                  German war machine was nothing like as invincible as had been
                  portrayed.</p>
              <p>Their navy was small, dwarfed by that of Britain, while neither the army nor air force was as large as those of France.</p>
              <p>Then,
                  to the relief of those listening, he told them he did not envisage
                  conflict with Britain and France for several years, that is, until
                  1943-44, and not over Poland despite declarations to the opposite.</p>
              <p>‘Hitler
                  spoke a sentence which still echoes in my ears,’ wrote Paul Schmidt,
                  the Fuhrer’s interpreter during his diplomatic wrangling in that
                  fateful spring and summer. ‘I am unshakeably convinced,’ he declared
                  ‘that neither England nor France will embark upon a general war.’ It
                  was a fatal miscalculation.</p>
              <p>Nonetheless, Hitler did fear a
                  tripartite pact between Britain, France and his other implacable enemy,
                  the Soviet Union, and so in order to achieve his immediate goal and
                  neutralise such a threat, he began feverishly to woo the Russians,
                  recognising that Stalin held the key to the destruction of Poland.</p>
              <p>If Russia could be tempted by a partition of that country, then
                  surely Britain’s and France’s guarantees would be valueless, and
                  Britain — the most dangerous enemy — would be weakened.</p>
              <p>Not
                  until August 24 was the subsequent German-Soviet Non-aggression Pact
                  signed, an astonishing piece of diplomacy that stunned the world and
                  which Hitler believed had enabled him to march into Poland without fear
                  of yet starting a world war.</p>
              <p>How wrong he was. His decision to
                  invade Poland on September 1 must surely be one of the most
                  catastrophic in world history. Chamberlain’s reedy voice announced to
                  the world at 11am on Sunday, September 3, that Britain was at war with
                  Germany. Soon after, so, too, was France.</p>
              <p>Six years later and
                  with some 50million people dead and much of Europe lying in ruins, the
                  world’s most violent and terrible conflict was over.</p>
              <p>Yet the
                  fate of the world was laid down 70 years ago this month, when a
                  delusional, ego-maniacal despot turned 50 and made his irreversible
                  decision to wage war on Poland.</p>

              <p>It is disappointing that the threadstarter kept silent and did not propound his allegations that National Socialism (NAZIsm) is alive. Perhaps he fear a backlash? He who fears should remain silent instead, for it shows perhaps his critical thinking may not be sound and stand on its own merits.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hitler, the father of Nazism is a genius. But no genius was born spouted out of his mother's fertility canal leading armies and humans to death.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A genius is the sum of his education and experiences in life, more so a social science genius. Hitler was a product of his times, of an 18th century militarist german empire split asunder by wars, unaccepted by its intellectuals who spout unbalanced philosophies which caused much of the harm of 18th century wars.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Young bookish Hitler's thoughts, the austrian vagabond, was shaped by thinkers such as Fitchte, Hegal, Treitschke, Nietzeche, Gebineau and Houston Stewart Chamberlian - son in law of Richard Wagner and nephew of British PM Neville.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>These mad nationalists intellectuals were themselves shaped by events happening in dis-united germany, and the victories gain by its bastard son Prussia- a small state of german militarists sparta-like who won european lands and thru its cruelties, a chance for a german empire to grow.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>They even had to reject historical facts to propound their theories to gain nationalism affection. When one distorts facts of history, one is actually denying the blood and sacrifices ancestors made so that history may not be repeated. These 'thinkers' disregarded facts, western and greek philosophy so blatantly and made the uneducated common masses believed Germans were a 'master race' to rule over humanity.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Read their works, and you will vomit with absolute revulsion as a modern person. They are antirepublic, antisocialist, antidemocratic. They believe in absolute dictatorship, a rule of blood and iron. The State is all, and as Trietschke puts it -"it does not matter what you think, so long as you obey".</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hegal, worshipped by even Karl Marx, believed in a State's absolute control of lives, and the masses should be slaves to the state. Nietzche, who in the end of his life was committed into a state asylum, wrote in his famous 'Will to Power' - the atrocious lord of the earth theory, of elites ruling the world and might is right.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Such philosophies were dangerous which lead to Hilter's Mein Kampf -'My Struggle' - a distorted work of a tortured and deluded soul, and the deaths of millions innocent.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It took another genius - Roosevelt and his team, along of entire nations to prove their philosophies wrong.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Is Nazism alive today? No. The aryan master race is a joke now. But certain parts of Hegal's and Nietzche theories are still adopted. Is might right and only a strong hand can control the destiny of humanity?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In my view, it is not. Humans are flawed beings, no matter how noble they or others may think themselves to be, because in time, there is no escaping temptations of life. We are not heavenly beings, and ultimately if left unchecked, we may ruin the lives of others.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thus there is a necessity for checks and more important - reasonable humane laws for a society to thrive. And such laws can only be legislated by an elected representative, chosen by the masses. One can be make a mistake, but thousands will not. No man must be elevated to Godly status, for ALL men are flawed, one way or another. Not realizing it will only lead to death for innocents.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In Singapore, no man is God, and we do have a parliamentary system to ensure the masses are taken care of, build up carefully and fine tuned to match the needs of time. Therefore, we must critically ensure such system is continued as envisioned by our forefathers who created our immortal national pledge.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Enjoy philosophy, but one must have a critical mind to discern what each propounds, otherwise, like Hitler, it may lead to destruction of not just oneself, but lives of others as well.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>How very Leviathan. Unfortunately, Nazism was more than the catalyst to a world war, it also engendered a racist policy that killed six million Jews, 3 million Gypsies, and many others including disabled Germans, Soviet POWS. I don't consider that war, but rather, a genocide.</p>

              <p>Jew hating in Christian Europe has its roots back in the middle ages, inflamed by the rise of christianity warped, encouraged by the Byzantine Roman Empire. Do remember Christ hung from a roman wooden crucifix and blooded by roman spears, on orders from a roman governor, not jewish paraphenalia or society.</p>
              <p>In time, it became fashionable to hate jews, more so when they were restricted to live in slums and perform menial jobs, even for the intelligent ones. Banking was one trade they performed well in Europe and help funded wars, even crusades, and most unfortunately, killing jews was one way to avoid paying off loans.</p>
              <p>Gebineau and Chamberlian regarded the Jews as a pure race, similar with the Aryans to lend credence of 'purity' to an uneducated german mass, but were quick to denounce the jews as losing their rightful purity in time and was an abomination to heaven wherelse the germans had been perfect stock since time began and responsible for scientific advances and civilisation  - ( I am speechless at such idiocy!).</p>
              <p>Japan had always admire Han Chinese civilisation and at no time did they despise Chinese, and had even feared them. It was only when they gave up feudalism, modernise their society. studied in US, England, Russia, Germany that they followed in the footsteps of the Europeans to gain a piece of the rich China Mainland to support their resourceless country.</p>
              <p>In the 1930s, again due to mad german 18th century philosophies of might is right, the jap army ruled and civilian authority were only second fiddle to them. When might is right, the jap army were the ones who were responsible for atrocities, and jap society must as a whole take responsibility for allowing a bunch of impeccably dressed animals decked with medals unleashed upon innocent civilians. </p>
              <p>As to who is intelligent amongst humans, the answer can be found in every human society, not just chinese, jews, aryans, greeks, romans, etc.</p>
              <p>No one is born intelligent, but the sum of one's education  (passed down thoughts and advances from forefathers' mistakes) and experiences makes him/her an intelligent person, a contributor to the furtherance of mankind, be him an african, polynesian, french, etc.</p>

              <p>It is disappointing that the threadstarter kept silent and did
              not propound his allegations that National Socialism (NAZIsm) is
              alive. Perhaps he fear a backlash? He who fears should remain
              silent instead, for it shows perhaps his critical
              thinking may not be sound and stand on its own merits.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hitler, the father of Nazism is a genius. But no genius was born
              spouted out of his mother's fertility canal leading armies and
              humans to death.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A genius is the sum of his education and experiences in life,
              more so a social science genius. Hitler was a product of his times,
              of an 18th century militarist german empire split asunder by wars,
              unaccepted by its intellectuals who spout unbalanced philosophies
              which caused much of the harm of 18th century wars.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Young bookish Hitler's thoughts, the austrian vagabond, was
              shaped by thinkers such as Fitchte, Hegal, Treitschke, Nietzeche,
              Gebineau and Houston Stewart Chamberlian - son in law of Richard
              Wagner and nephew of British PM Neville.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>These mad nationalists intellectuals were themselves shaped
              by events happening in dis-united germany, and the victories gain
              by its bastard son Prussia- a small state of german militarists
              sparta-like who won european lands and thru its cruelties, a chance
              for a german empire to grow.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>They even had to reject historical facts to propound their
              theories to gain nationalism affection. When one distorts facts of
              history, one is actually denying the blood and sacrifices ancestors
              made so that history may not be repeated. These 'thinkers'
              disregarded facts, western and greek philosophy so blatantly
              and made the uneducated common masses believed Germans were a
              'master race' to rule over humanity.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Read their works, and you will vomit with absolute revulsion as
              a modern person. They are antirepublic, antisocialist,
              antidemocratic. They believe in absolute dictatorship, a rule of
              blood and iron. The State is all, and as Trietschke puts it -"it
              does not matter what you think, so long as you obey".</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hegal, worshipped by even Karl Marx, believed in a State's
              absolute control of lives, and the masses should be slaves to the
              state. Nietzche, who in the end of his life was committed into a
              state asylum, wrote in his famous 'Will to Power' - the atrocious
              lord of the earth theory, of elites ruling the world and might is
              right.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Such philosophies were dangerous which lead to Hilter's Mein
              Kampf -'My Struggle' - a distorted work of a tortured and deluded
              soul, and the deaths of millions innocent.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It took another genius - Roosevelt and his team, along of entire
              nations to prove their philosophies wrong.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Is Nazism alive today? No. The aryan master race is a joke now.
              But certain parts of Hegal's and Nietzche theories are still
              adopted. Is might right and only a strong hand can control the
              destiny of humanity?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In my view, it is not. Humans are flawed beings, no matter how
              noble they or others may think themselves to be, because in time,
              there is no escaping temptations of life. We are not heavenly
              beings, and ultimately if left unchecked, we may ruin the lives of
              others.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thus there is a necessity for checks and more important -
              reasonable humane laws for a society to thrive. And such laws can
              only be legislated by an elected representative, chosen by the
              masses. One can be make a mistake, but thousands will not. No man
              must be elevated to Godly status, for ALL men are flawed, one way
              or another. Not realizing it will only lead to death for
              innocents.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In Singapore, no man is God, and we do have a parliamentary
              system to ensure the masses are taken care of, build up carefully
              and fine tuned to match the needs of time. Therefore, we must
              critically ensure such system is continued as envisioned by our
              forefathers who created our immortal national pledge.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Enjoy philosophy, but one must have a critical mind to discern
              what each propounds, otherwise, like Hitler, it may lead to
              destruction of not just oneself, but lives of others as well.</p>

              <p>Quite right. Mein Kampf was a friggin joke. His line of argument, which was repeated incessantly throughout went like this:</p>
              <p>1.I shall learn of this situation by observing.</p>
              <p>2. Man, they are doing a bad job.</p>
              <p>3. Why don't other common people see that they are doing a bad job?</p>
              <p>4. There is an upper echelon conspiring to pull the wool over our eyes!</p>
              <p>5. Gasp, there is a JEW in this upper echelon. Gasp, there are Jews in the Russian revolution. Gasp, Jewish Bolshevism  - Jewish Conspiracy!</p>
              <p>6. Judenfragen - Endlosung</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ultimately I think people will valorise facts or philosophical works in any way just to achieve their aims. Who's to say, in centuries to come, Hitler's racial policy won't be utilised to start another world war?</p>

              <p><span style="color: #000000;">...On March 28, 1938, shortly after the Austrian
              Anschluss, Henlein traveled to Berlin and was told by Hitler to cause trouble
              in Czechoslovakia by making ever-increasing demands on behalf of the Sudeten
              German Party "which are unacceptable to the Czech government."
              The strategy worked well. Every time the Czech government was about to
              give in, Henlein demanded something more so that no agreement could ever
              be reached. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Throughout the summer of 1938, Nazi agitators
              in the Sudetenland caused political and social unrest while Goebbels' propaganda
              machine waged a ferocious anti-Czech campaign claiming that Sudeten Germans
              were being persecuted by the Czechs. At the annual Nuremberg Rally in early
              September, Hitler and Göring both made threatening speeches concerning
              the so-called Sudeten question.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">With Germany edging ever-closer to war, the peace-minded
              British Prime Minister decided to send a personal telegram to Hitler asking
              for a face-to-face meeting "to find a peaceful solution." Hitler
              was genuinely surprised by the request and immediately agreed to a meeting.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Thus, on the morning of September 15, 1938, the
              69-year-old Neville Chamberlain boarded an airplane for the first time
              in his life and departed England. Seven hours later he arrived by car at
              Berchtesgaden and met Hitler for the first time. </strong></span>The Führer led him
              into his villa and up to the great room with the big picture window and
              views of the Alps. </span></p>
              <p><img src="http://www.historyplace.com/worldwar2/triumph/chamberlain2.jpg" alt="Portrait of British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain." width="227" height="331" align="right"><span style="color: #000000;">Six
              months earlier, the Chancellor of Austria had walked into this same room
              hoping to negotiate a peaceful solution and had been relentlessly badgered.
              This time, Hitler once again dominated the whole discussion, but carefully
              avoided the crude bullying tactics he had used before. Chamberlain was,
              after all, the head of government for the British Empire, one of the greatest
              powers the world had ever known. To the British Prime Minister, Hitler
              complained at length about the "persecuted" Sudeten Germans inside
              Czechoslovakia and then boldly asked if the Sudetenland area could be simply
              handed over to Germany. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Chamberlain responded that he would consider asking
              the Czechs to cede the Sudetenland but said he was not prepared give an
              answer on the spot and first needed to consult with his Cabinet back in
              London. He asked Hitler to refrain from any military action until he returned
              for his next visit. Hitler agreed to the military delay.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Chamberlain returned to London and succeeded in
              getting his government's approval for the Sudetenland concession. He also
              received a favorable response from Britain's former World War I ally, France. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Regarding his first impression of Hitler, Chamberlain
              commented: "In spite of the hardness and ruthlessness I thought I
              saw in his face, I got the impression that here was a man who could be
              relied upon when he had given his word."</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Meanwhile, behind his back, Hitler proceeded ahead
              with his war plans. Representatives from Poland and Hungary were secretly
              approached by the Nazis and asked if they each wanted a piece of Czechoslovakia
              in return for letting Hitler break up the country. The military rulers
              of Poland, along with Hungary's Fascist government, both agreed to stand
              by and let Hitler invade Czechoslovakia in return for a share of the spoils.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Britain and France, having agreed among themselves
              to give Hitler the Sudetenland, now confronted the Czech government. On
              September 19, the British and French ambassadors in Prague sternly advised
              the Czechs that they should give up all areas along the German border where
              50 percent of the population or more was German. The Czech government,
              realizing it had been abandoned by its Western Allies, reluctantly gave
              in and agreed to the terms. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">On September 22, an optimistic Chamberlain returned
              to Germany to see Hitler, this time to a hotel at Godesberg along the Rhine
              River. The Prime Minister informed Hitler that he could have the Sudetenland
              after all, just as he wanted. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">"Do I understand that the British, French,
              and Czech governments have agreed to the transfer of the Sudetenland from
              Czechoslovakia to Germany?" Hitler asked him.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">"Yes," said the smiling Chamberlain.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">"I'm awfully sorry," Hitler responded,
              "but that won't do anymore...this solution is no longer of any use."</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Chamberlain was stunned, his hopes for an easy
              peace suddenly dashed. Hitler now raised the stakes by demanding a German
              Army occupation of the Sudetenland by October 1st and the expulsion of
              all non-Germans living there. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Chamberlain, utterly flabbergasted at this dangerous
              turn of events, informed Hitler this amounted to a military ultimatum and
              said the Czechs wouldn't agree to such terms. But Hitler said he didn't
              care. The Czechs had to agree to an Army occupation, or else.</span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">The British Prime Minister had just become the
              second victim of Hitler's gangster diplomacy. He had risked his whole political
              career and the prestige of the British Empire to appease Hitler, only to
              be rudely turned down for no apparent reason. </span></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Chamberlain returned home deeply disappointed
              to ponder what to do about this mess. France, on hearing of the Führer's
              ultimatum, mobilized a hundred Army divisions and began packing them off
              toward the French-German border. The Czech Army consisting of a million
              men was mobilized. England also put its entire naval fleet on alert and
              declared a state of emergency in London.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Europe, it seemed, was headed for war after all.
              This was good news for the anti-Hitler conspirators in Germany. Things
              were now going as they had hoped, and they prepared to strike against Hitler
              in Berlin as soon as he gave the order to invade Czechoslovakia. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Interestingly, Hitler attempted to arouse popular
              support for the coming war by having an Army division parade through the
              streets of Berlin. But all along the parade route people turned away or
              ducked into nearby stores and subway entrances. The Führer stood on
              the balcony of the Reich Chancellery reviewing the troops. But after seeing
              that only a few hundred people cared to watch, Hitler went back inside.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Some two decades earlier, at the beginning of
              World War I, throngs of people had filled Berlin's streets to cheer their
              young soldiers and toss flowers as they marched off to the front. Now,
              nobody cheered. The German people clearly did not want another war, and
              Hitler saw this.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">As a result, he decided to step back from the
              brink and delay his war for Lebensraum for a while. He sent a letter to
              Chamberlain promising that if the Western Allies yielded the Sudetenland
              to the German Army, it would not result in the destruction of Czechoslovakia.
              Germany would even be glad to join with England and France in guaranteeing
              the rest of Czechoslovakia from any further aggression. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Chamberlain decided to grasp at this last chance
              for saving the peace. He telegraphed Hitler that he was ready to return
              for more talks "at once." </strong></span>He also sent a telegram to Italy's
              Fascist leader, Benito Mussolini, asking him to intercede with Hitler on
              his behalf. Mussolini then contacted Hitler and proposed a joint summit
              that would include Germany, England, France, and Italy. Hitler agreed to
              it. The location chosen was Munich.</span></p>
              <p><img src="http://www.historyplace.com/worldwar2/triumph/hitler-chamberlain.jpg" alt="Adolf Hitler greets Neville Chamberlain upon his arrival in Munich." width="280" height="408" align="right"><span style="color: #000000;">Before
              leaving England for his third and final trip to Germany, Chamberlain declared:
              "When I was a little boy, I used to repeat, 'If at first you don't
              succeed, try, try, try again.' That's what I am doing. When I come back
              I hope I may be able to say, as Hotspur says in Henry IV, 'Out of this
              nettle, danger, we plucked this flower, safely.' "</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">The Munich conference took place inside a brand
              new Nazi building called the Führerbau on September 29 and lasted
              into the early morning hours of the 30th. It was attended by Hitler, Chamberlain,
              Mussolini, and French Prime Minister, Edouard Daladier. Czech representatives
              were also there but had to wait outside the meeting room because Hitler
              refused to let them inside to participate.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">At the conference, Mussolini said he had his own
              proposal which might help to resolve things quickly. Unknown to Chamberlain
              and Daladier, that proposal had been supplied to Mussolini by the Nazis
              and essentially contained the same demands as Hitler's ultimatum. However,
              Chamberlain and Daladier accepted this proposal without hesitation in their
              overwhelming desire to avoid bloodshed.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Just after 1 a.m. on September 30, the four leaders
              signed the Munich Agreement allowing the German Army to occupy the Sudetenland
              beginning on October 1, to be completed by October 10. About 1:30 a.m.,
              the Czech representatives were informed of the terms by Chamberlain and
              Daladier. They had no say in the matter and had no choice but to comply. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Upon arriving back home in London, Chamberlain
              declared: "The settlement of the Czechoslovakian problem which has
              now been achieved is in my view only the prelude to a larger settlement
              in which all Europe may find peace." </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Few politicians in England disagreed. Winston
              Churchill voiced the loudest single protest, calling the Munich Agreement
              "a total, unmitigated defeat."</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Back in Germany, the Army generals who had been
              preparing to oust Hitler gave up in complete dismay. All plans concerning
              the overthrow of the Führer were shelved. The generals now resigned
              themselves to follow Hitler into the abyss that lay ahead for Germany. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">On Saturday, October 1, the German Army rolled
              into the Sudetenland on schedule. Many of the Czechs living there fled
              their homes in panic with only the clothes on their back.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Once again Hitler had gotten everything he wanted
              without firing a single shot. Incredibly, this time he would have welcomed
              a fight. Somewhat exasperated, he said: "I did not think it possible
              that Czechoslovakia would be virtually served up to me on a plate by her
              friends."</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Regarding his impression of the Western Allies,
              Hitler would later say: "Our enemies are little worms. I saw them
              at Munich."</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Regarding his final impression of Hitler, Chamberlain
              said: "Hitler is the commonest little swine I have ever encountered."</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">But by now, success after success had made Hitler
              and the Nazis drunk with power. They were beginning to think they could
              do anything, even conquer the world. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Hitler's primary goal of Lebensraum was being
              achieved step by step, just as he had planned. Now it was time to pay some
              attention to his secondary goal, a reckoning with the Jews. Up till now,
              the Nazis had largely held off out of concern for international opinion.
              But that didn't seem to matter so much anymore...</span></p>
