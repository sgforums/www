              <p>Don't recall them mentioning anything about increasing their own salaries by 60 p/c when campaigning for the 2006 GE. </p>

              <p>To the noisy pussy - everyday is National Day - and with that damn motorcade having the right of way, it is a Parade everywhere that damn official car move.</p>
              <p>The noisy pussy must be having a hard on each time it sees a convoy blocking all traffic - and must have missed a damn MPV with a LED Board hung on its rear and flashing a message of thanks for giving way, while a Blue blinking laser flashes its status as it escort <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">an ordinary car</span></strong> with another plain clothes person riding a Traffic Police high powered motor bike  - and heading into a shopping mall.</p>

              <p>That is monthly pension for retirement and also with annual wage of S$2 Million for coming back from retirement to be in office again - two packages for one person from public money.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What makes the imbecile in the noisy-pussy - so confident
              with the statement that it dare to make in such a strident manner
              in public ?</p>
              <p>Did the pussy <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">audit the books</span></strong> to
              determine all that it had claimed ?</p>
              <p>The official car was seen daily running down Orchard Road with
              plain clothes security at every street corner, and constables
              standing by 30 minutes before the motorcade drive past - just to
              make sure the traffic lights produce a "green wave".</p>
              <p>Obviously, the dumb pussy will make all its
              deafening noise and got itself thrown out of all the golf
              clubs, and could not know about the motorcade with the
              official car driving into the golf clubs located around
              Singapore.</p>
              <p>To the noisy pussy - everyday is National Day - and with that
              damn motorcade having the right of way, it is a Parade everywhere
              that damn official car move.</p>
              <p>The noisy pussy must be having a hard on each time it sees a
              convoy blocking all traffic - and must have missed a damn MPV
              with a LED Board hung on its rear and flashing a message of thanks
              for giving way, while a Blue blinking laser flashes its status
              as it escort <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">an
              ordinary car</span></strong> with another plain clothes person
              riding a Traffic Police high powered motor bike  - and
              heading into a shopping mall.</p>
              <p>Who possibly can be having the right of way over citizens, and
              with a smaller escort party going into a shopping mall ?</p>
              <p>Grandma is bed ridden, are the grand kiddies having
              fun with the security escorts at citizens expense ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Whatever the foreign VIP say and get - is it any business
              for the noisy pussy to poke its prick into what is paid by
              the citizens of other countries ?</p>
              <p>Singaporeans are furious that while we are expected to take
              pay cuts and reduced CPF, as much as we are told to accept short
              term employment contracts of 3 to 5 years - as there is no such
              thing as an iron rice bowl - the keepers of the resident noisy
              pussy is giving themselves a circus party at the expense
              of Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>Obviously, the noisy pussy is brain dead from all the
              useless noise that it is making for its own entertainment just
              to get the morning and evening pat that it dearly need to live for
              another day.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Did the noisy pussy confirmed if LKY made good his statement
              that he will pay for the special SIA plane that flew grandma back
              from London to Singapore ?</p>
              <p>Was that money paid from his Law Firm, or did
              that come from Singaporean's money that pay for his
              monthly pension since his retirement at age 65 PLUS the annual
              salary of $2 Million Plus since he returned from retirement ?</p>
              <p>That is monthly pension for retirement and also
              with annual wage of S$2 Million for coming back from
              retirement to be in office again - two packages for one person from
              public money.</p>
              <p>Why do you need any single plane, when you have a whole fleet of
              planes to choose from - any time ?</p>
              <p>Obviously the noisy pussy is too dumb to realise that
              it is an imbecile.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Is there any good for Singapore being fourth in GDP per
              capita ranking at US$49,288 - comparable to the other
              countries ?</p>
              <p>What does that mean to a noisy pussy ?</p>
              <p>Does the noisy pussy believe that every person in Singapore is
              earning US$49,288 as an annual income - at current USD-SGD exchange
              rate that will be S$68,000 ?</p>
              <p>How does that relate to the realities in "income or
              wage distribution" and "income inequality" in Singapore
              ?</p>
              <p>It is obvious the noisy pussy lives on hot gas that
              will give it the morning hard on to start its daily hot
              breathing drive to attempt its loudest roar that can only result
              with a wimpy mew - as the hot gas push through the hot air
              from its mouth.</p>

              <p>Tax higher?</p>
              <p>Something you need to be clear about, the tax is higher but the Australia government doesn't hoard money like Singapore's PAP government. The PAP government hoard money by denying her citizens social welfare.</p>
              <p>How else you think those reserves come about?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Brother!</p>
              <p>The 10% GST that Australia charges is not a blanket all policy, Australia doesn't charge GST for basic food items, medication and books. Singapore is a blanket everything policy, maybe Australia is not into helping the poor like the PAP government here is. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When you are poor, you don't expect to eat in a 5 star hotel, that's why supermarket prices in Australia is comparable to Singapore supermarket prices, most of the time, Australian supermarket prices are much cheaper than Singapore. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Obviously you don't understand how GST works. When a company in Singapore doesn't charge GST because her turnover a year doesn't exceed $1 million, it doesn't mean that there is no GST implied in it's prices.</p>
              <p>e.g. When a non-GST registered company buys products from a GST registered company, if there is GST already charged to the product, surely you don't expect the non-GST registered company not to charge the cost of GST in it's prices.</p>
              <p>Say lionnoisy Pte Ltd, buys chickens from PAP chickens wholesale market at $1.07, surely you don't expect lionnoisy Pte Ltd to sell the chickens at below $1.07. Say if PAP chickens sell the chickens to lionnoisy at $1.00 (without GST), then lionnoisy can sell the chickens to consumers at $1.00.</p>
              <p>At the end of the day, non-GST registered doesn't necessarily imply that there is no GST imputed in the product.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>That explains your level of intellect and your ease in being brainwashed by PAP propaganda. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Did you look at the after tax salary of both Australia and Singapore? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>By bringing tax in Singapore and Australia, you have just showed us you never learn from past mistakes, it's umpteen times you brought up a failed argument about Singapore and Australian tax system. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p><br>Jobless rate amongst Singapore residents (PR and citizens) is 5%. Why would I want to include employed foreign labour force in my unemployed calculation? To reduce the citizens' unemployment rate? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> To trick simple minded Singaporeans into believing that we are having less unemployed than they would like to think? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong>Unemployment</strong></p>
              <p>5.   Preliminary estimates show that the seasonally adjusted overall unemployment rate rose slightly to 3.4% in September 2009 from 3.3% in June 2009. <strong>Among the resident labour force, the rate increased to 5.0% in September 2009.</strong> This followed the decline from 4.8% in March 2009 to 4.6% in June 2009, when some residents then had deferred job search and pursued courses amid the difficult job market. The unemployment rates were still below the peak (overall: 4.8%; resident: 6.2%) experienced in September 2003 (due to the SARS outbreak).</p>

              <p>Like I said before, high GDP per capita or low GDP per capita doesn't clearly represent the living standards in Singapore. Singapore's GDP per capita is like what you said higher than Japan and Switzerland, but salaries are like 3rd World Countries like China and India, while cost of living is that of Japan.</p>
              <p>How much do workers in Japan and Switzerland get compared to Singapore?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Seriously, all these facts brought up in previous discussion doesn't register in that huge mane of yours, because you bring up the exact same debunked points all over again. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>spore is paid less because foreigners do jobs while the sporeans go on strike.so the foreigners in spore are also to be blamed.they are ammo to kill us when werkin in spore and when there is opportunity to go to better places,,,they are d ones to go first.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>In Australia, probably not many people want to stack shelves in the supermarket, so the supermarket has to increase wages to attract workers to do the work.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Compare that to singapore, say bus drivers.  Nobody wants to work as a bus driver because of low wages and long hours.  Unlike Australia, where the supermarket has to up wages to attract people, the situation here is such that the bus company sets the lowest wage they are prepared to pay, then imports cheap foreign workers who will work at that wage. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>The Presidentail Standard can be changed by a simple Act of Parliament, when the next PM or President gets tired of the Red Color, and need not necessarily to any other country flag.</p>
              <p>Afterall, the Red Color is a reflection of the true character of the Communist Autocrat that is determined to promote the ONE-Party Rule to have its hand controlling not only the Government bodies but also in all aspects of civic life in commerce, culture, law, education, social, and politics - that is similar to any Communist Country.</p>
              <p>It is time for the noisy to wake itself from its monotonous syncophantic mindless noise that hypnotise its weak mind without any effort from its Master's Voice.</p>

              <p>Can the empathy of a noisy pussy be worth a gram of salt for all its worthles tears spilled ?</p>
              <p>Can its worthless saltiness even make up for all the blood and sweat that so many generations have drained from their bodies to build a Singapore since trusting LKY in 1957, only to realise that all the hardwork is wasted when the hardearned monies are given to save foreign banks - while our poor suffer in silence ?</p>
              <p>While our CPF is delayed till past age 65 to 85, we have the MM paid a pension at his official retirement age of 65, and to be paid an annual salary of S$2.0 million every year with the pension also paid at the same time.</p>
              <p>Obviously, the noisy pussy will wish to have one more political party to be established and split the electorate even more, so as to give its MIW a better chance at the next election - why will the noisy pussy expect Singaporeans to be as stupid as itself ?</p>
              <p>It is time for the noisy pussy to straigthen itself and look honestly at itself in the mirror before the mirror look back at the noisy pussy and show what the truth can be.</p>
