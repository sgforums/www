Citizens are the people who comprise the state and have subjected themselves to the Government for the promotion of their general welfare and for the protection of their individual and collective rights<br><br>As such, there are certain privileges and benefits to be gained from being a citizen of a particular state. At the same time, there are also responsibilities and obligations on the individual. In Singapore for example, every male citizen is eligible for National Service<br><br>In the modern state, there are three distinct rights associated with citizenship: Civil - this comprises the rights necessary for individual freedom; Political - this encompasses the right to participate in the political process AND in the exercise of political power; finally the Social aspect - refers to the right to the prevailing standard of life and social heritage of a society<br><br>Whether or not an MRT should stop at Potong Pasir or Hougang should have lifts upgraded, have got everything to do with a citizen's basic right. If upgrading is necessary for the betterment of an estate, the citizens of that estate is entitled to it. There shall be no two ways about it<br><br>To put it plainly, if a war breaks out between Singapore and another, the people of Potong Pasir and Hougang are also "enemy status", and if captured will also be treated as POWs by international law under the Geneva Convention 1949<br><br>Any act by the government to deny a citizen of his basic right can and may be construed as deprivation. AND, under the law, this is incorrect. If they wish to deprive the '2 renegade provinces', then the PAP must take steps to pass other laws to 'terminate' their citizenship. A Minister and his cabinet cannot act in a quasi-judicial capacity to deprive citizens of their rights. They are bounded by law to protect our rights and have to act fairly<br><br>Under current laws, citizens may not be banished from Singapore (the exception being Mr Chia Thye Poh). If the unthinkable happens, then the people of Potong Pasir and Hougang would have their rights to secede from the Republic </blockquote>It is gratifying that there are still some citizens who would come forward to talk and remind all of their citizens' rights.<br><br>Please carry on. Sad that schools do not teach such basic civic duties or their citizens' rights. People become ignorant and the whole government is taking advantage by riding roughshod over their rights while refusing to perform government's duties and responsibilities.<br><br>It will not hesitate to do anything like increasing taxes and GST even if costs of basic necessities like transportation and utilities have risen to 40-60% of the lower-income family incomes.<br><br>It is about time citizens form citizens clubs at every constituency and pass themselves in such civic duties and ask for their rights and be able to serve as watch dogs for the people since the government no longer care about such civic conscience.<br><br>Citizens who become members of citizens' clubs can group together to come up with plans to attend meet-the-people or write petitions to check oon any abuses or hypocrisy as seen happening frequently in parliament.<br><br>Just imagine - Temasek could lose S$3 billions of citizens' monies on Shin Corp with hardly anyone asking questions of PM in parliament. It was only one mild or subdued question by Inderjit Singh as reported in Today paper (16.11.2006) "Sir, will you please issue us a detailed report on actually what happened in the Shin Corp deal and whether there is compliance with due process ?" Reply: "When Thai authority has finally completed its investigation, more details will be given"<br><br>That is called check and balance in our system of governance. No wonder there is no further progress in economic restructuring for the last 20 years because of such wayangs in parliament.<br><br></div>
