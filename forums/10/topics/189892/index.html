            <div class='col-md body'>This, is what I call an airing of opnion in black and white.<br><br>Very well written indeed!<br><br>============================================<br>Strong mandate? I beg to differ<br><br>May 9, 2006<br>The Straits Times<br><br>I AM not alone in wanting to beg to differ that it was a strong mandate that was given to the ruling party. Being in denial that there is genuine unhappiness and discontent among Singaporeans with regard to policies, cost of living, health care, disbursement of funds, etc, will only sway more voters to favour the opposition in the next election.<br><br>For every vote that was lost represents a voice that is asking for accountability, for answers, for checks, for changes, for help and, perhaps, more transparency.<br><br>The fact that voters in the opposition wards of Hougang and Potong Pasir rejected the ruling party's $180 million offer linking ward upgrading to the election of its candidates proves that votes cannot be 'bought'.<br><br>Let's not forget that regardless of which ward they come from, each and every one of them is a taxpayer and deserves the same amenities and packages lined up for the PAP wards. The ruling party has a duty of care to all Singaporeans young and old, pro-PAP or otherwise.<br><br>Such calculated measures should have no place in a First World nation that strives to produce a gracious society. When integrity has been made to be synonymous with the name PAP, then it should be applied in this aspect as well.<br><br>I also hope that the minority-candidate-form saga would be closed for good. There are far more important issues.<br><br>The ruling party has encouraged open and serious debate and though the country may have progressed and moved forward, very little improvement has been made to help Singaporeans with the high cost of living.<br><br>There is a wide gap between the party members and the people simply because while the party members have made big leaps in this race to get us forward, the people themselves continue taking small steps to catch up.<br><br>There seems to be only one set of opinion that is allowed and I felt stifled reading the papers and watching the broadcast media in the past nine days.<br><br>Voters have evolved dramatically over the years and they should be given a choice in every aspect, for the good of this nation.<br><br>Phyllis Christe (Ms)<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br><br>PM LHL is stretching his victory to the limit that is possible to justify his own mandate from the 66.13% who voted in favor of his GRC of six persons.<br><br>He should realise that there remain 33.87% who have given their votes to six <strong><span style="color: blue;">UNKNOWN and UNTESTED NEWBIES</span></strong> from the Workers' Party; and this had happened despite his position as the Leader of the Party and the Country !!!<br><br>The simple fact that his percentage of votes have gone down, when compared with the increase in votes given to LTK of WP and CST of SDA in this Election 2006 - is clear indication that this is NOT a strong mandate given to the POWER OF ONE.<br><br>How can he seriously claim to have a STRONG MANDATE when 43.92% of the Aljunied GRC had given their votes to FIVE UNTESTED NEWBIES that formed the Team A from the WP - all of whom have never been in Politics ?<br><br>With the other 37 election wards being uncontested, who knows if the percentage of votes going to the Opposition would have increased ?<br><br>The attitude was correctly set in PM LHL speech on Sunday - that the Ruling Party and the Opposition DO NOT have all the solutions; that both sides have the talents to move together to solve problems facing Singapore.<br><br>Unfortunately, it seems that it is mere rhetoric only, and the "moving together" has begun by treating the Chairman of the WP - Sylvia Lim - with caustic suspicion in the continued persecution of James Gomez, an incident that is blown up by only ONE PERSISTENT VOICE from MM LKY.<br><br>Instead of wasting energies in persecuting Political Opponents - similar to Third World countries - one would have thought that an intelligent POWER OF ONE would have started some efforts to regain the confidence of the other 33.87% of the Electorate that voted for the Opposition.<br><br>Sadly, we have a POWER OF ONE claiming to be in a Class with the First World, but in effect behaving no better then the uncouth and bearish behaviour so characteristic of Third World Politicians.<br><br></div>
