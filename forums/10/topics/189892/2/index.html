            <div class='col-md body'>Let's not forget two blatant myths the fascist media distorted which give as accurate a reflection of a warped reality as having people believe Santa Claus actually delivers presents to kids every Christmas.<br><br>Firstly, there were those headlines that the PAP was <strong>not returned to power</strong> on nomination day. While it's true that the PAP had a theoretical chance of not garnering 50% of the seats in parliament, the myth fails to account for the fact that no other single party could have even chalked up 37 seats(to rival the number PAP had been assured on nomination day), even accounting for the theoretical chance that the PAP lost all 47 contested seats. In essence, under the practice of a parliamentary democracy, how could you effectively be 'out of power' if you still held the most seats in a coalition government?<br><br>Second myth - the PAP had a 66.6% mandate. This is utter nonsense. The fact of the matter is PAP won 66.6% of the <strong>valid votes</strong> cast, and not 66.6% of the total votes cast. Evidently, the figure does not account for the substantial share of invalid votes and needless to say, had this portion been factored in the statistics, their mandate is actually lower than 66.6%! Quite simply, how people who haven't been in favour of you(although not necessarily against you) could be cast aside and omitted from one's "mandate" is beyond me...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Well, welcome to the wonderful world of Singapore politics with a 'first world' government and a 'first world' media...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's rather difficult and misleading to look at pure figures and attempt to interpret their significance. The fact that 33.4% of the electorate voted for the opposition does not necessarily mean that all of those people were against the PAP per se. We cannot really speculate with any degree of accuracy on their intentions based just on the figure alone. Some might have voted for the opposition because they felt that the PAP had been too heavy-handed in the Gomez affair, some because they wanted to encourage the development of the opposition, some because they genuinely wanted the opposition candidates to be their MPs, some because they genuinely hated the PAP and would vote opposition come what may. We can't really tell unless we do an extensive ground survey. So without that both sides of the story are just rhetorical "spin"; both sides can claim victory without concrete proof and without fear from irrefutable refutation.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I have been reading all this coming and going.... and let me share with you what my fellow singaporeans which i talked to as a "straw poll" thinks... below are quotes from what they said:<br><br>"I don't like PAP, but opposition lousy. so i vote PAP lor"<br><br>"Vote PAP lor, then what?"<br><br>"PAP no good, opposition not good, so I still think PAP should be govenment"<br><br>"I am not voting opposition, I don't want someone like Chee Soon Juan to be a Minister".<br><br>from a resident in the old "bukit gombak" (SDP ling how dong win Seet Ai Mei last time)<br>"If given another chance, I will not vote opposition, why? becos last time with Mr LHD as MP, we tell Mr Ling we want bus stop, but he didn't do anything, and then this pap guy come along and promise to do this and that... so we vote him lor!"<br><br>from another person on my comment that opposition should win a GRC:<br>"How can! Then a lot of MPs will be out you know. and at least one minister will be out! How Can!"<br><br>From a person which we were discussing about upgrade and I told her to vote based on national issues(need for opposition) rather then "local" issues.<br>"Elections is about upgrade mah, then what? what do we know about national issues??".<br><br>So you see, there is a very very slim chance that PAP will lose a GRC or even more seats, because the MAJORITY of singaporeans have no inkling what they are voting for or what the issues were....<br><br>There is no way we can reach out to these people, and they are ALL pretty well educated and are all professionals..... but they have no idea what is happening....<br><br>I tried to talk to them, but the "gap" is just too wide....<br><br>Also, MOST singaporeans feel that it is RIGHT for the PAP to dangle the PAP as a upgrading carrot.<br><br></div>

If anything, a vote of abstention, is certainly never considered to be for compliance - case in point : if a resolution had to be passed at a UN General Assembly, any abstained votes will certainly never serve to count towards obtaining the mandatory 2/3 majority for a resolution to be passed.<br><br>I mean that's a statistic - you wouldn't get a mandate anywhere close to 66.6% if you included the share of invalid votes(well, let's just give them the benefit of the doubt that the uncontested wards, had they been contested, would not have shaded this figure any further  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> ).</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Seriously, I think that the ruling party has got to rethink how it should position itself. We are a rapidly maturing state and that our citizen's do have the ability to think for themselves, and know whats good for us. We don't need to be ruled with an iron fist, all we need is that room to really grow to make us a truly 1st class nation.<br><br>If a nation has petty politicians who pick on the tiny little things which the opposition does, and hurls lawsuits here and about during every election, what does this show the world about our government? Also, the very idea that there are GRCs which have walkovers are unrealistic. Everyone on the island should vote, why? As this will show that the election is a good guage of the people's decision on which party they want to have rule over them.<br><br>The issue of bribing the voters...this shows how underhand and strong armed the ruling party is doesn't it? If I can't convice you...I would just buy you. But don't forget, you are buying us with whose money? Is it your? I seriously doubt so...and add to the fact that we S'poreans are not a poor lot compared to other countries.We do have our pride, if you dangle the bribe infront of us, won't that be insulting our people? Won't that be telling the world that our people are so cheap can and will be bought over and its simply a matter of dollars and cents?<br><br>Lastly, I belief that the problem of voters and opposition parties being suppressed is actually a ticking timebomb which if not defused, will actually cause us more harm then good.</div>

Impression I received is that they are quite happy for the PAP returning to power but someone indicated they would like to see PAP more accountable and undo many of the wrongs done by whatever means - they didn't suggest waht or how..<br>This morning I also went to deposit a  garmen CPF cheque for an old man who is unable to go there  so I went for a plate of ''Keow Teow har fun''.

The situation now seems to be that in the minds of many, everything PAP == Singapore and that everything Opposition == traitor.<br><br>It really, really broke my heart when I saw the MSN nick of one of my friends on the night of the election. It said: 'Majulah PAP! Majulah Singapura!' To me the implication of that is clear: PAP is Singapore, and Singapore is PAP. He thinks that to be Singaporean, you have to support PAP, and that everything to do with the opposition isn't Singaporean at all.<br><br>Let's face it; in the minds of many, all those who don't support PAP don't deserve to be called Singaporeans. They don't seem to realise that many a time, anti-PAP can be the same as pro-Singapore as well. And those of us who do realise it and start questioning PAP's policies and practices get labelled as 'traitors' and 'ingrates' by the majority.<br><br>In this light, I find it hard not to despair. The only hope I can see is that PAP's mandate is indeed weakening, no matter how much they say. The statistics speak for themselves: they fared worse compared to the previous elections.<br><br>The sad thing is that the population seems to have swallowed their claim that they have a 'strong mandate' hook, line, and sinker.<br><br>If we're ever gonna turn the situation around in this country, it's up to the people to realise just how far down the black hole we've come. Our situation will never change if the people are going to continue with this sense of apathy and naivete.</div>
