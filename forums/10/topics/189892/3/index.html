I find it extremely sad that the knowledge which most Singaporeans seem to know is the stuff they have in their textbooks and lecture notes. When I urge my friends to read the news on a daily basis, they laugh it off and say that 'it's a waste of brain space'.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>I'll agree with you that most Singaporeans don't know who the heck Guy Fawkes is. And I'm willing to bet that even those who do know who Guy Fawkes is would think that he's just a fictional character on V for Vendetta.<br><br>With this in mind, I find it hard to see how on earth we can turn our own situation around. The condition of a people can only change if the people themselves take steps to change it. If the majority are truly ignorant and proud of it, then I can hardly see how change is ever going to happen.<br><br>But I guess Lazerlordz has a point when he says that we can all make a difference, no matter how small or trivial it may seem to be. If anything, PAP's weakening mandate in the recent elections does show that Singaporeans may not necessarily be swayed by factors like upgrading or the progress package.<br><br>So I will try to be optimistic that things will change, but at the same time, I can't deny my pessimism for the future or my cynicism for supposed changes for the better.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I was a cynic once, when I was doing my studies in JI.It stayed with me throughout my NS life, until I ORDed, and began dabbling in photography, which really brought me out of my comfort zone and into the dwellings of the elderly and the destitute.It brought me to schools where students were lucky and more than happy to be out of NA or NT stream, never mind about thinking of the future.<br><br>I got myself thinking perhaps my craft could help to enlighten others to the plight of the less fortunate, and yet behind my mind, lay a deep sense of truth, which I reluctantly began to accept when I see that despite any sort of exhortations, no one really cared, and people spend their time or money, on "charity events" because of the prizes on offer.<br><br>No one does things for their own sake anymore, it's always about the Other and what the Other can offer.<br><br>We seem so modern, progressive and future-minded as a state, but as a society, the fair majority of Singaporeans still live day to day in denial and choose only to exist within their little bubble, and their ignorance is something sadly of their own making.If you cannot stand up to a bus captain abusing his power and berating an old lady, calling her names, I can surely understand why you will simply shut your eyes and choose the easiest path and not bother about any critical thinking.<br><br>My optimism died one day in February, when the above happened and my exhortations were the lone voice in a bus, where my fellow passengers continued in their iPod-strung world.<br><br>Call me a fool for daring to believe and to possess optimism.It's your own freedom of speech.I may have lost some of it, and surely a little dies everytime I see the blatant ignorance of the youth and fellow peers.But I will not begrudge your choice to be a sheep.After all, it's your choice to be slaughtered after the short but comfortable existence in a fenced up field.<br></div>
