            <div class='col-md body'>I think theinternet political discussion is a good move, based on the newspaper response to the YPAP cycling event removed from site issue. This is a good start to make the PAP govt to be more transparent and accountable. The govt knows that the political discussion scene in SG is very vibrant thus it must tread carefully so as to not offend the young, as this group usually have many alternative sources of info and do not buy what govt say blindly. Yes, internet forum may not change the political scene and situation in SG and PAP is still going to be high handled as ever, but it proves that PAP cannot be like in the pass, do whatever things they like without being scruntinized............</div>
