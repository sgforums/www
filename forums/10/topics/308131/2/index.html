              enough or not is subjective....largely depends on his lifestyle, for all you know he may not be extravagant, the salary could go to the kids' education and what else...pre-school fees are ridiculous....for the security guards who can support 6 with $1k salary, something has got to give, you can be sure the children running amok until primary school starts, but by then the cycle repeats itself, the children will most likely end up as security guards too....i for one would like to know how a family of 6 can live with $1k....
              
              perhaps his not enough means not being able to save.....public transport is not cheap to start with..utilities cost have gone up 50% within the last 12 months, then you have phone / internet and other incidentals...minimally i am assuming he has already consumed $2k for essentials....where the rest goes is best answered by the engineer himself...........

              <p> </p>
              <p>What I do feel is that the wealth distribution/wage gap is too big. Its too capitalistic.... the govt policies should tax the rich abit more and distribute it to the lower masses.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>According to a "source" she invests in property alot. Its more profitable to invest in SG than in AUS and cheaper too. Its easier to start investing in AUS but you don't make as much. The downside is that its very hard to break into the property market in SG. In other words the rich get very rich and the poor stay poor.</p>

              <p>problem if u tax the rich more: They might move out of Singapore, and the government collects less tax overall. Sure, to not tax them so much might seem to be based on money from my reason, but if they move out, where are we going to get the top-up?</p>
              <p>In some ways, I feel that the government is moving in the right direction. Tax the rich less, tax expenditure, especially on "luxury goods" more.
