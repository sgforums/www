              <p>i realise dat when having two children, best to have them wif an age difference of 6 years apart. cos it would be hell if at the same time u have to pay more for education fees such as one child taking o lvl while the other A lvl. or both children attending university education.</p>
              <p>definitely unaffordable!</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The problem with Singapore, and the source of so much angst among fellow Singaporeans, is that it is both a city and a country. I’ve lived in both New York and London, and the fact is that a large proportion of people (at least half from my own personal experience) living in these 2 “global” cities were not born there specifically (though many of them were born in the country).</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Vibrant cities attracts people to go there to live and work and play. But it also implies that there is a large turnover of population, as is indeed the case in both New York and London. People flock to these cities because the pay is higher, the lifestyle is more exciting, the career options are greater etc. Many of the people who flock there also do not stay forever. But it also means these cities are much more expensive and cramped than other territories just outside them. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">In a broad sense, the situation in Singapore is actually not very different when seen from this perspective. What is different about Singapore is that it is both a city and a country.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">You see a person born in London who might prefer a cheaper and less exciting lifestyle for whatever reason could escape to Wales or Cornwall without having to leave the country. In these places, a London pension or even small government handouts can go a long way because they are so much cheaper. Singaporeans do not have that choice. If you don’t want the city life, you have to leave Singapore or you’re forced into a marginal existence because you simply can’t afford to fully enjoy the vibrant but expensive lifestyle.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">So a Singaporean who wants a slower pace of life and a bigger house is forced to move to Australia or NZ, or if he doesn’t move he will constantly feel aggrieved about how “unfair” the government treats him. If Singapore were part of Malaysia, for example, this person could move to Trengganu or something. After selling his HDB in Singapore, he could buy a massive beach-front bungalow in Trengganu, and enjoy a much cheaper lifestyle.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;">So perhaps the practical way to solve the problem that Singapore is both a city and a country is maybe that we need to re-merge with Malaysia.</p>

              <p>They did get a "boost" to continue their struggle. The average low income household will get maybe around $1400 (dad and mum only, and forget the stupid ST report of $2300). This is at most 1 mth of salary for them.</p>
              <p>Yet it is the single parent families (divorced or one parent passed away) that are the ones we should be more concerned about. They might only get $750 at most, and I don't see how this can help them much...</p>

              $5000/month enough?????
              
              Some people with around $3 million/yr or $250 000/month also feel not enough....
              
              Perhaps these overpaid millionaires should put things into perspective...

              <p>They did get a "boost" to continue their struggle. The average low income household will get maybe around $1400 (dad and mum only, and forget the stupid ST report of $2300). This is at most 1 mth of salary for them.</p>
              <p>Yet it is the single parent families (divorced or one parent passed away) that are the ones we should be more concerned about. They might only get $750 at most, and I don't see how this can help them much...</p>

              <p>Seriously, if the packaged was skewed such that people over age 65 that are extremely needy get $2k while the rest of us get $100 (PAP will still want to buy some votes), I wonder how many will complain. I won't.</p>
              <p>I can imagine that for $2k, these poor people will have enough to live for near to half a year.</p>
