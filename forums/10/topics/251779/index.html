            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>justicepao wrote:<br>Here again it proves my point that many of the employers' purported recruitment of talents is bullshit. No need to employ oxen knife to kill chickens. Many of the local talents are fully capable but not given the opportunities because the employers deemed they are not talents! The Dean of Admissions of MIT bluffed MIT that she got 3 degrees from 3 schools 28 years ago when she applied to be Admin Asst. In 18 yrs she managed to climb on the opportunity given to finally become the Dean of Admissions. She manages to hold the fort for a decade before being found out that she has never graduated. QED. She would not have been promoted to Dean had they know that she never graduate before which seems to be superfluous requirement!<br><br>Of course, I am not condoning her cheating at all. What she did was just like so many elites have done like roughly 50% ofthose grads who cheat at least once in their college education - many corporate elites that cheat the public - all much lesser than they are respected for!!!</blockquote>Leaders are people who are given the opportunity to serve the people but our leaders often claim they are the talents.<br><br>This is a typical case which clearly shows that people without university degree could equally excel as a university dean if given an opportunity to work as one based on real work ability rather than possession of university examination often insisted upon by our leaders.<br><br>Except in special fields, what we should be more concerned with is the real work ability to produce efficiency and increase our economic competitiveness.<br><br>Unfortunately our leaders continue to create exclusivity in all professions and career insisting nowadays that even working as a security guard requires passing of an examination. No wonder costs of security guards hiring went up by more than 10% since the latest MHA ruling for security guard accreditation in 2006 based on the excuse of combating terrorism.<br><br>Very soon it may become necessary for citizens to pass examination and obtain paper qualification to do baby sitting or cooking.<br><br>But in our society such persons who are many are denied opportunity to make good even if they prove their abilities in the working place simply because they lack the paper qualifications.<br><br>Employers are generally biased and not willing to accept people with abilities.<br><br>So this case once again proves the point there is no such thing as talents based on claims or assumptions like a university degree or first- or second -class honours.<br><br>Once a person is given an opportunity to serve as a minister or MP, he or she should be humble to serve the people and not claim they are the real talents.<br><br>We have yet come across those with higher educations excelling in any particular field because of that education.<br><br>Rather it is the opportunity given that person to work in particular field and determine finally whether he has learned enough from that opportunity to become talents from real exposures, period.<br><br>So to all the ministers and MPs we citizens would like to say this : do not claim to be talents and just do your job well done. When you have served the people well then people will decide whether you are of special abilities like the Japanese managers who produced a Toyota Production System to help our workers to turn around their economic competitiveness.</div>
