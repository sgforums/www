            <div class='col-md body'>Look, fear and what not is nonsense. The Thai Military can make a cock and bull story for the populace but they are only beginning to understand that they cannot do what they like and expect the market to accept their policies warm heartedly. They have back pedaled on every policy they thought would punish us but now they realise that seizing Shincorp by force is going to give rise to very negative reactions from foreign investors which Thailand so desperately needs.<br><br>They will not cook up some random law out of the blue to take Shincorp back by force. What they can possibly do, which I believe they would, is sit down and talk to Temasek and work out a face saving solution that will allow them to run off without embarrassing themselves any further and Temasek will not loose the bulk of taxpayers' cash they stuffed in.</div>
