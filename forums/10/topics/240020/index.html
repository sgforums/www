            <div class='col-md body'>As Thailand claims, the shin corp buy-out was illegal:<br><br><blockquote>Thailand's commerce ministry had earlier investigated allegations that Temasek had used a holding company as a nominee shareholder of Shin Corp to get around a 49 per cent limit on foreign ownership of telecommunications companies.<br><br>"Of course they broke the law. This was pointed out by the initial investigation by the Ministry of Commerce," Mr Sittichai said.<br><br>"The investigation has gone quiet after it was passed to the police, but now we are reviving it and it will be sent to the Department of Special Investigations. I think it will not take long before we decide whether to send the case to court," he said, adding that the probe would be wrapped up in a matter of months. </blockquote>If the Thais investigate and have conclusive evidence that the takeover was not in accordance with the law, they may well push ahead with their threat to re-take Shin Corp, and there is NOTHING SG can do about it, except file an appeal to the international court. In the long run, Temaesk may even write-off the total loss as another expensive TUITION FEE, one which we seem to pay for regularly, at the cost of taxpayer's monies due to poor and ill-researched decisions left in the hands of half-baked 'CEOs' leading govt-link corporations.<br></div>

In the long run, Temaesk may even write-off the total loss as another expensive TUITION FEE, one which we seem to pay for regularly, at the cost of taxpayer's monies due to poor and ill-researched decisions left in the hands of [b]half-baked </strong>'CEOs' leading govt-link corporations.<br>[/b]</blockquote>Fwah!

            <div class='col-md body'>I think the issue will be viewed in a different light if Temasek Holdings is a truly commercial company not tinged by the government.  In this case, its a pure commercial dealing &amp; its easier for folks to swallow.</div>
