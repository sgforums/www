            <div class='col-md body'>Written by Thomas Frank<br><br><br><br>[What happens when a country sacrifices criticism and intellectual<br>life on the altar of the market? Thomas Frank is the editor of The<br>Baffler magazine. He is the author of "The Conquest of Cool" and "One<br>Market, Under God".]<br><br>Markets may have made their peace with activism, rebellion,<br>radicalism, revolution, change-agenting, hierarchy-questioning,<br>sacred-cow-killing, power-seizing, apple-cart-overturning and<br>everything else on the exciting menu of New Economy upheaval, but<br>markets still have trouble reconciling themselves to democracy<br>proper. Markets romp joyfully when word arrives that the vote-<br>counting has been halted. Markets punish the bond prices of countries<br>where left parties still attract a substantial vote. Markets reward<br>countries where left parties have been induced to wind up their<br>operations. To you Bill Clinton's rightward triangulations may have<br>seemed like rank hypocrisy or worse, since they deprived Americans of<br>meaningful political choice, but in the view of markets the man who<br>managed to kill off the New Deal is a statesman for the ages.<br><br>Above all markets love the country of Singapore. There was a time a<br>few years ago when one heard this repeated so frequently that it<br>became one of the great media clichÃ©s of the age. Singapore was an<br>economic miracle, a land arisen from Third World to First in a<br>handful of decades. Singapore was showing the world the way forward.<br>Singapore had resolved it all: ethnic hatred, crime, social decay,<br>good government. Singapore was the country with the most economic<br>freedom in the world. Singapore was the best place to do business in<br>all the earth. Singapore was more comprehensively wired than anywhere<br>else. "Asian values," as described by Lee Kuan Yew, the man who has<br>effectively ruled Singapore ever since 1959, would inevitably<br>prevail. And as proof you needed look no farther than a postcard of<br>Singapore's glittering downtown, at all the spanking new skyscrapers<br>erupting from the earth in stern testimony to the market's approval.<br><br>And what the market loved best about Singapore was what was absent:<br>Politics. The country has quite literally traded politics for wealth,<br>with its most prominent political thinkers endlessly reminding the<br>world that "Asian values" prioritize economic achievement over civil<br>liberties. But the trade-off between a lively political life and the<br>blessings of the market is hardly a uniquely Asian phenomenon.<br>Americans know the logic quite well. For ten years now we have<br>labored mightily to convince ourselves that once we had hobbled<br>unions and rolled back regulation and dropped antitrust enforcement<br>and "reformed" welfare and stopped worrying generally, we would break<br>free into a world beyond ideology and dread partisanship, a place of<br>civility and simple pleasures, a utopia where watching the NASDAQ<br>shower us with its blessings far outranked electioneering as an<br>statement of our democratic ways. So acute was the desire in some<br>circles to nail a final lid on politics that Thomas Friedman, the<br>highly respected New York Times foreign affairs columnist, actually<br>came up with a term for the glorious trade-off in his ecstatic 1999<br>book, The Lexus and the Olive Tree: "the golden straitjacket." Since<br>all alternatives to laissez-faire are now historically discredited,<br>Friedman maintained, all countries must now adopt the same rigidly<br>pro-business stance. When they do, "your economy grows and your<br>politics shrinks." The pseudo-democracy of markets replaces the real<br>democracy of democracy, the great multinational corporations nod<br>their approval, and (some) people get fantastically rich.<br><br>I have no idea whether Friedman had Singapore specifically in mind<br>when he came up with this formulation, but there can be little doubt<br>that Singapore has come close indeed to realizing the "post-partisan"<br>dream of New Economy ideologues everywhere. Many facts can be cited<br>to illustrate Singapore's exchange of democracy for wealth, but few<br>are more poignant than the bankruptcy into which the country's<br>opposition MPs (at present there are three in a parliament of 84),<br>are perennially thrown by ruling party lawsuits. Dissenting publicly<br>can quite literally mean losing it all. As a result opposition<br>politicians have learned, as X'ho, the ultra-arch Singapore punk<br>rocker puts it, "Speak not, bankrupt not."<br><br>Unfortunately, aggressive "depoliticization," as Singaporean<br>journalists refer to it, has pitfalls of its own. As the allure of<br>public life recedes, the country may get rich, but who is to manage<br>the public sector? So effectively has the ruling party punished the<br>opposition and discredited politics generally that it now faces,<br>ironically, a crisis unique among advanced nations: It has trouble<br>recruiting gung ho young candidates to stand for parliament.<br><br>Nor do countries simply evolve into "golden straitjacket"<br>postpartisanship by some natural process of popular enlightenment.<br>Depoliticization is an achievement that requires effort. And building<br>a depoliticized state in Southeast Asia was an accomplishment that<br>took decades. The arduous story is told in precise, clinical detail<br>by Francis Seow, one of the country's best known dissidents, in his<br>1998 book The Media Enthralled. Running down the long, long list of<br>Lee Kuan Yew's battles with a once-feisty press, Seow tells us<br>exactly what arguments and legal strategems Lee used from the 60s to<br>the 90s to get his way in every single case, to force the more<br>tractable publications to see things as he did and the recalcitrant<br>sheets simply to disappear. Only rarely did the country have to<br>resort to outright censorship. Warring with the Economist, Far<br>Eastern Economic Review, the International Herald Tribune, and the<br>Asian Wall Street Journal, Lee used a combination of lawsuits, anti-<br>Western bluster, intimidation, and circulation restriction to ensure<br>that these publications would practice "self-censorship" when<br>describing events in his country. Turning to the local media, Lee<br>came up with a plan whereby market forces did the work for him. Using<br>the language of marketplace democracy that we all know so well from<br>brokerage commercials and "New Democrat" reform efforts, Lee's<br>government simply required that all newspaper publishing operations<br>be publicly traded rather than owned by families or private investors-<br>-and that crucial voting shares be held by politically reliable<br>individuals. "Lee Kuan Yew has understood perfectly that the media<br>business is, first and foremost, a business," the canny Singaporean<br>journalist Cherian George has written: "that a press allowed to make<br>money out of a system will support that system; and that publishers<br>value their bottom-line more highly than they do their editorial<br>freedom."<br><br>Described that way Lee Kuan Yew sounds like the kind of guy a<br>traditional American press lord, thundering on behalf of the<br>interests of the owning class, could do business with. But Lee<br>tolerates very little thunder. He and his successors seem to regard<br>the press as fundamentally illegitimate, an unelected interloper in<br>the nation's politics. In 1994 a writer named Catherine Lim made the<br>mistake of violating an unwritten prohibition against criticism of<br>government officials; in the official declaration that slapped her<br>down it was announced that neither journalists nor anyone else could<br>be allowed "to set the political agenda from outside the political<br>arena. . . . People who seek to change the nature of Singapore<br>politics and society cannot be allowed to do so from political<br>sanctuaries." No one could be permitted to comment on political<br>issues except duly declared politicians--and everyone knows how the<br>government deals with them. The results may be draconian, but the<br>terms of the debate must seem very familiar to American readers,<br>living as they have through thirty years of assaults on the "elite"<br>media, always said to be foisting their "arrogant" concerns and their<br>big city ways on the rest of us. And Lee Kuan Yew has achieved in<br>Singapore what the American Right can only dream about: Freedom from<br>the press--and along with it freedom from criticism and freedom from<br>critical thought generally.<br><br>* * *<br><br>So what replaces politics? What fills the blank space left when a<br>country has sacrificed criticism and intellectual life on the altar<br>of the market? I went to Singapore to find out. Since the Asian<br>economic collapse in 1998 we've heard very little about Singapore or<br>the wonders of "Asian values" or the necessity of following Singapore<br>down the paths of inevitability. No longer do intrepid New Economy<br>ideologues bring us back bold stories from this land of the future.<br>But there is still much to be learned from the land of Lee Kuan Yew.<br><br>I have before me a copy of the Straits Times, the country's official<br>newspaper, dated December 10, 2000. I have kept the paper in my files<br>because it was my first clue that there was something amiss about<br>this country. I remember reading it for the first time on a sunny<br>equatorial morning in a twelfth story hotel room overlooking the<br>city's marina, a blimp advertising a local Internet service provider<br>orbiting annoyingly outside my window. From its front page the<br>Straits Times looked like a standard state-of-the-industry product,<br>remininding one of USA Today maybe a little more than the New York<br>Times. There were colorful photos and human interest stories, serious<br>journalism about important topics like water reservoirs, all of it<br>written in familiar newspaper English. It certainly looked<br>inoffensive. Where things started to go wrong was in an account of<br>protests at a college commencement in Hong Kong in which Lee Kuan Yew<br>had been awarded an honorary degree. Although it was a news story, I<br>had trouble discerning exactly why the students were protesting (this<br>would have to wait until I was in Hong Kong a week later and came<br>across the South China Morning Post's coverage of the incident); the<br>point of the piece seemed rather to be the foolishness and feebleness<br>of protesters, and the contrasting nobility of Lee. Lee is said to<br>speak in a "business-like" tone; to stand stoically while great waves<br>of official flattery wash over him, "perhaps because he has received<br>so many [accolades] over the years that they roll off him." Of the<br>protesters, it is noted that they are few in number, that there are<br>many "outsiders" among their ranks; that they are "led by a man<br>dubbed 'Long Hair' Leung Kwok Hung"; and that, given the opportunity,<br>they will complain about nearly anything: "Another day, another<br>protest."<br><br>Protest may not earn a Straits Times journalist's respect, but<br>turning to the paper's "Review" section, I discovered what did.<br>There, in the place most American newspapers reserve for book reviews<br>and think-pieces, I found a profile of the management guru who co-<br>wrote the One to One series of marketing books; a column about the<br>urgent need to adapt to waves of workplace "change" (you know,<br>like "outsourcing"); an enthusiastic story about the new president of<br>PepsiCo, a native of India who likes rock 'n roll and reportedly<br>studies videotapes of Michael Jordan's greatest basketball moments in<br>order to "catch insights about the value of teamwork"; a profile of<br>the management guru who co-wrote The Individualized Corporation<br>("Power to the people is [his] motto"); a discussion of one of the<br>paper's more popular feature writers in which the concept of "the<br>journalist as a brand" is used as a point of departure; and a review<br>of one of those sweeping, pseudo-historical books so beloved of<br>business readers that start out with the Neanderthals and end up<br>affirming various contemporary management homilies about creativity<br>and entrepreneurship. In the entire section, only a brief editorial<br>and a lone column (deploring the persecution of the Chinese minority<br>in Indonesia) addresses matters other than management theory.<br><br>Venturing out from my hotel I found that nearly wherever I went<br>management talk--even the liberationist variety we hear so much of<br>these days from the evangelists of the everyone-will-be-free Internet<br>economy--blended easily with the depoliticized, prosperity-centric<br>culture of Singapore. In the bookstores I could find no copies of the<br>Baffler but collections of management theory so vast that they dwarf<br>any I have ever seen in America. In the upscale Ngee Ann City mall I<br>bought a copy of George Gilder's long-anticipated Telecosm and<br>thumbed through the alarming new installment in the Fifth Discipline<br>series, Schools That Learn. From the windows of the offices of the<br>Informatics Group bold advertisements instructed me to "Increase Your<br>Market Value," advised me to "Surf Ahead in Your Career," and<br>exhorted me to "Make it to the Top." I was passed on the street by a<br>rebellious youth whose sassy T-shirt derided those "at the bottom of<br>the ladder." In Suntec City, a combination mall and office complex<br>that is billed as "Asia's vertical Silicon Valley," I walked through<br>a corridor in which the spaces that are usually taken up by ads for<br>commercial products were instead given over to testimonials from<br>various jargon-spouting CIOs and SVPs from Oracle, Xerox, and Union<br>Bank of Switzerland: "Networking for Success at Suntec City"; "Suntec<br>City is positively future-proof"; "You've got to get connected."<br>Venturing further into the crowded complex I discovered that it was<br>Microsoft Day at the "Fountain of Wealth," the gigantic bronze ring<br>around which the mall is arranged. I watched as fathers and sons,<br>under the benevolent gaze of Bill Gates's emissaries to Southeast<br>Asia, slowly circumnavigated the fountain in the direction believed<br>to maximize the acquisition of luck. For many, the presence of<br>corporate PR officials and the banalities of American management<br>rhetoric clearly made for a pleasant shopping experience. In fact,<br>the line outside Suntec City's Kenny Rogers restaurant was so long<br>that I had to get my ribs from Tony Roma's instead. (I could also<br>have chosen a rib place called "Fat Daddy.")<br><br>I do not mean to mock Singapore, like so many writers do, as some<br>weird and brutal Asian regime. In fact, proceeding from these two<br>crucial starting points--Singapore is very rich; Singapore tolerates<br>no political criticism--it has become a country whose culture,<br>superficially at least, looks a lot like our own. I did not find<br>Singapore strange; I found it familiar. My objections to what I saw<br>there almost all arose from the official media's energetic<br>recapitulation of bland American originals: management theory, fast<br>food, pop music, Hollywood movies. Depoliticized but intensely<br>successorized, Singapore is what America will be like if the "New<br>Economy" crowd get their way for much longer. Christmas, for example,<br>is celebrated with far more enthusiasm than it is at home--and<br>entirely as a secular holiday. The displays of lights and dioramas on<br>Orchard Road--including a two-story outdoor tableau of skiers<br>complete with gusts of fake snow--are so elaborate they put one more<br>in mind of downtown Vegas than Marshall Field's windows. Their<br>celebration of the holiday puts our own in the shade. Ads for the<br>Takashimaya department store promised "A Christmas in Gold." Those<br>for another whispered unsarcastically of "The Glitz and the Glamour."<br>And the reach of the holiday cheer is astoundingly comprehensive: I<br>heard the same soundtrack of maudlin Christmas favorites<br>(including "The Little Drummer Boy" in a tearful minor key) in a<br>supermarket, a gym, and in the underground bunker where British<br>generals planned their ineffectual defense of the island in 1942.<br><br>I will admit that I found the music irritating. In my hotel dining<br>room a top-of-the-line grand piano was used to produce unctuous<br>renditions of "Yesterday," Broadway favorites, songs by the<br>Carpenters. Later I observed the same set-up and the same repertoire<br>in effect in the famous Raffles hotel. And a third time in a mall<br>whose name I have now forgotten. On the radio I heard an excited<br>announcer hail the unbearably awful boy-band Westlife as "kick-ass."<br>At Changi airport I saw the private jet of the Backstreet Boys<br>waiting to ferry its toxic cargo off to some other unfortunate burg.<br><br>But the weakness of public intellectual life was what struck one most<br>sharply. History museums that deal in transparent party-line<br>propaganda. TV dramas that interrupted themselves so the characters<br>could advise viewers didactically on personal safety or civic<br>responsibilities. And positive reviews as far as the eye could see. I<br>understand how Lee Kuan Yew's "hypersensitivity to criticism" (to use<br>Seow's phrase) has had a chilling effect on the country's political<br>discourse. What is less clear is the process by which this suspicion<br>of criticism has been extended into the cultural realm. But this it<br>has undeniably done. X'ho, the acidic Singaporean cultural observer,<br>declares sarcastically that "unlike other countries, we are 100%<br>good, and though we dare not outrightly say we are perfect, the non-<br>existence of put-downs in public media and the constant self praising<br>we do imply that, yes, we are absolutely fair and perfect." From<br>every magazine, newspaper, alternative weekly, or slick lifestyle<br>supplement I came across arose a suffocating fog of affirmation.<br>Helpful appreciations of that great new movie, Charlie's Angels. Some<br>fun facts about the career of that enchanting singer, Christina<br>Aguilera. A great expensive new restaurant to consider for your<br>Christmas feast. Where was that legendary Singaporean rudeness in the<br>world of ideas? Could anyone here muster a simple, honest "no"?<br><br>I am pleased to report that at least one person can. Before leaving<br>the country I managed to procure both a book and a spoken-word CD by<br>the above-mentioned X'Ho, a former punk rocker who has of late moved<br>into the broader field of cultural criticism. What first drew me to<br>his book, Skew Me, You Rebel, Meh?, I admit, was its cover: The<br>dayglo pink and orange background with ransom-note lettering that we<br>all remember so fondly from the Sex Pistols days. Making it more<br>attractive still was the plastic wrapper in which it had been<br>germlessly encased, ensuring that casual shoppers wouldn't be<br>bothered by its contents. And for good reason. X'Ho turns out to be a<br>scathing critic of the money culture of his native land.<br>In "Singapore You're Not My Country," a poem by Alfian Sa'at that<br>X'ho reads on his CD, we hear<br><br>Singapore why do you wail that way, demanding my IC?<br>Singapore stop yelling and calling me names.<br>How dare you call me a chauvinist, an opposition party, a liar<br>a traitor, a mendicant professor, a Marxist homosexual communist<br>pornography banned literature chewing gum liberty smuggler?<br>How can you say I do not believe in<br>The Free Press autopsies flogging mudslinging bankruptcy<br>which are the five pillars of Justice?<br>And how can you call yourself a country, you terrible hallucination<br>of highways and cranes and condominiums ten minutes' drive from the<br>MRT<br><br>In his own work X'ho seems to prefer, for reasons that should be very<br>clear by now, to work through sarcasm, ridicule, irony, and double-<br>speak (and also mainly through small rock magazines like Big O). The<br>collection of poems and essays that he reads on his CD, Me All Good<br>No Bad, are advertised as "Pro-Singaporean content." He mocks such<br>characteristically Singaporean initiatives as an ill-begotten drive<br>to ban smoking simply by repeating them verbatim in his almost<br>aristocratically correct English. He proposes as a national<br>motto, "Say 'Yes.' It's the Way to the Top. . . . Heaven is just a<br>compliance away." (On the other hand, there's his exceedingly direct<br>and irony-free chant, "Asian values suck.") In America we are quite<br>familiar by now with irony as an statement of privilege, with irony<br>as salesmanship, with irony as Tory scorn. I had to go all the way to<br>Singapore to have my faith in the arch restored.</div>
