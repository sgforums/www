Reasons for the demonstration and who are involved in the demonstrations are not important.<br><br>The communist china shot their students demonstrating in Tiananmen, the democratic american also shot their student demonstrators in Kent State University, and the peaceful and religious Thai also shot their students in a political aftermath. Whatever the reasons for the demonstration, planned or spontaneous, soldiers should never be sent in, live rounds should never be issued and order should never be given to shoot.<br><br>It is difficult to keep the balance, but there will be no excuse whatsoever for the use of extreme force for suppression of demonstration.

The students didn't know when to stop and were made used of by tugs for all kinds of other purposes. I am not surprised policemen were adbucted and killed. People like Wu Er Kai Xi and Chai Ling thought they could just take over the communists government with a demonstration, they were simply niave and stupid. And the government didn't know how to handle a situation like this and treated that as a civil war. All in all, it turned out to be a sad incident for PRC, not for Chinese as a whole though.<br><br>Under no circumstance should army be sent in to suppress a demonstration. The situation was not amounting to a civil war yet and it wasn't likely to happen. Basically, the government should learn to handle situation like this, to do that, they should first see that such a demonstration could happen.</div>

The US national Guard also shoot at Protestors at Kent states..what.. they are no even violent and are unarmed.

All Rights Reserved. This report contains video footage by a Spanish television crew and has been shown on Frontline and PBS stations. The complete report and video can be accessed at http://www.tsquare.tv/film/transcript01.html. A pertinent excerpt from the narration is shown below. The speakers are students and allied persons who protested at Tiananmen Square.<br><br>FENG CONGDE: At around 3:30, the four people on the hunger strike came to talk to the students. They said, "Blood is being spilled all over the city. More than enough blood has already been shed to awaken the people. We know you're not afraid of dying, but leaving now doesn't mean that you're cowards."<br><br>HOU DEJIAN: Chai Ling told us she had heard that leading government reformers hoped that the students could stay on the Square until daybreak. So Liu Xiaobo told her: "I don't care if it's true or not, but no leader has the right to gamble with thousands of students' lives at the Square."<br><br>FENG CONGDE: Finally our student headquarters told them, "You can go ahead and negotiate, but you can't represent us."<br><br>HOU DEJIAN: So we went ourselves. We got into a van and drove only a few seconds before we saw the soldiers, all lined up on Changan Avenue. As we got closer the soldiers pointed their guns at us. They didn't know what we were up to. A few minutes later, an officer appeared. He listened to what we had to say and went to report to his superiors. He came back and told us that they had agreed to our request. He said, "We hope you can convince the students to leave the Square." We rushed back to the monument to tell the students. Their opinions were divided.<br><br>NARRATION: There was little time to debate. The troops sequestered in the nearby Great Hall of the People now came out and moved toward the Monument. Soldiers with guns at the ready converged on the students from all directions.<br><br>LIANG XIAOYAN: The soldiers came right up in front of us. They were in full battle gear. The students all stood up. I was in the front row, with a gun pointing straight at my chest. It was only a few inches away. The soldiers looked really mean. Only later did the terror hit me. At the time I was simply stunned. I didn't feel a thing. I can't imagine what would have happened had they really opened fire.<br><br>FENG CONGDE: I was in charge of the vote to determine whether we should leave. I said, "On the count of three, those who want to go, shout 'Go!'; those who vote to stay shout 'Stay!'" I couldn't tell which side was louder.<br><br>HOU DEJIAN: I knew that those who wanted to leave would be ashamed to shout very loud, while those who wanted to stay would shout with all their might.<br><br>FENG CONGDE: Because of this situation, I felt that when the two sides sounded about the same, most likely more people voted to leave. So I announced the decision to leave.<br><br>NARRATION: At dawn on June 4th, after occupying the Square for more than three weeks, all the remaining students and their teachers and supporters left Tiananmen Square.<br><br>HOU DEJIAN was born in Taiwan in 1956, became a singer-songwriter, and achieved fame with his 1979 song "Children of the Dragon." During the protest movement, Hou took part in the four-man hunger strike of June 2nd. Chinese language newspapers (outside of China) published Hou Dejian's account of the final hours in Tiananmen Squarequare. In one interview, Hou Dejian related:<br><br>"Some people said that two hundred died in the Square and others claimed that two thousand died. There were also stories of tanks running over students who were trying to leave. I have to say that I did not see any of that. I don't know where those people did. I myself was in the Square until six thirty in the morning.<br>I kept thinking, are we going to use lies to attack an enemy who lies? Aren't facts powerful enough? To tell lies against our enemy's lies only satisfies our need to vent our anger, but it's a dangerous thing to do. Maybe your lies will be exposed, and you'll be powerless to fight your enemy."<br><br>The following excerpts are taken from<br>Black Hands of Beijing: Lives of Defiance in China's Democracy Movement, George Black and Robin Munro (New York: John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 1993), pp. 234 - 246. The complete report can be accessed at: http://www.tsquare.tv/chronology/BlackHchrn01.html<br><br>"The phrase "Tiananmen Square massacre" is now fixed firmly in the political vocabulary of the late twentieth century. Yet it is inaccurate. There was no massacre in Tiananmen Square on the night of June 3. But on the western approach roads, along Chang'an Boulevard and Fuxingmen Avenue, there was a bloodbath that claimed hundreds of lives when the People's Liberation Army found its path blocked by a popular uprising that was being fueled by despair and rage. To insist on this distinction is not splitting hairs. What took place was the slaughter not of students but of ordinary workers and residents - precisely the target that the Chinese government had intended."<br><br>"Imagination filled the gaps. Into the vacuum rushed the most lurid tales of the supposed denouement in the square. Wu'er Kaixi, flamboyant to the last, reported that he had seen "about two hundred students" cut down by gunfire in the army's predawn assault, but it was revealed later that he had been spirited away to safety in a van several hours earlier. A widely recounted eyewitness report, purportedly from a student at Qinghua University, spoke of the students on the Monument being mowed down at point-blank range by a bank of machine guns at four in the morning. The survivors had then either been chased across the square by tanks and crushed, or clubbed to death by infantrymen. But it was all pure fabrication."</blockquote></div>
