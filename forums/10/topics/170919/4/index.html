The police initially were empty handed in the square, They just sat at the entrance of the building, and formed lines by crossing elbows to prevent the demostrators from growing thousands more, I have pics to show, (after I have my Dinner).<br><br>In the lastest incident, You would shoot too, If the crowd throws bottled bombs at you, and seeing your colleagues dismembered and curling on the ground wriggling in blood. I dare say any governmemt law enforcement agency in the world will fire the weapons.

The tianamen incident occured and ended on the same day. The Tank in question was travelling in a line formation along chang'an boulevard not at the square. The western media delibrately used close-up shot to portray an image that it occured at the square, and null the fact that the man climbed up the tank to shake the drivers hand. It was from a video Taken from the 5th of june, the next day...</div>
