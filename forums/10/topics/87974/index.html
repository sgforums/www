            <div class='col-md body'>Don't think there is a law for this since this is a very new situation and the law makers tends to be slower on this. Even if there is, the police officer may not know it yet (Yes, not all police officer knows the law well themselves). Things you can do is possibly make a big fuss out of this (newspaper, minister etc..) or/and maybe complain to Police noting down the person who gave you that reply.<br><br>What you experience might become a real big problem in the future when the mobile phone gets better and better. Countries like Japan had law which requires that all photo-taking mobile phone to make a sound when a photo is being taken so that no one is caught unaware.

This way, you can know the reason and there are witnesses (ie. the nice person that woke you up). If the person attacks you in any form, verbal (vulgarities) or physically (shoving you aside), it has become a police case.<br><br>When you went to the police, it was a private case, I'm not too sure, but I think it is infrindgement of privacy and it is a civil case. The police can't even be your witness even if you deicide to sue. I'm not a lawyer, so you might want to check up on my this point.<br><br>The police handled it poorly, you could have asked to speak to the duty officer (IO) as you feel that your quiries are not being addressed. I believe that you should have asked him to take your statement, just file a report, just in case your pciture is used for generating cash or for illegal purposes.
