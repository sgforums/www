He can't explain himself thru local media or get permission to hold rally to defend himself.

Although you see him shouting at the PAP, is this the full story? So what's is it that led him to shout at the PAP, you and I will never know cause we are not there.

But shout is shout. And I got a piece of inside news months after it happened. His own party members try to stop him and pull him away, but he refuse. Looks like he learnt his lesson, do you see him shout anymore? No. If he think he's not wrong why he stop shouting? He realize it so no need to defend him about this. I continue to support his other POV.</div>
