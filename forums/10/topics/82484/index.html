At countryside, the cost of living is lower but their income is lower too. So it will be better to compare income from cities to cost of living in cities other than comparing it with countries.<br><br><blockquote>And remember this .... the europeans have always had a much higher cost of living than most ASIAN countries for the last few decades.
