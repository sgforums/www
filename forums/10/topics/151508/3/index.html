            <div class='col-md body'>i strongly hope we can live harmony with the aussies and put aside this issue behind us. Aussies have to understand drug trafficking is death sentence whether the trafficker is singaporean or aussie.<br>if any singaporean commit a crime in aussie, we shall also be sentence according to your country criminal laws.<br>the death sentence is use as a deterent for drug traffickers . but once they are caught, have to face the consequences whether local or foreign.<br>i have deep respect to australia as a good country and i study there but i hope the aussies can also respect singapore legal justice system. He was given a fair trail and proven guilty which i believe the aussie has no dispute.<br><br>just dont do drug trafficking and nobody will be hang here.<br><br></div>

The so-called "Li Dynasty" (if that's what you are referring to) naturally have detractors. Not everything that is being done by the pap gov is great. However why is it that the detractors also choose to focus on the bad and ignore the good. Would these folks want to live under, say, a Gloria Arroyo, or a Yudiyohono (sp) or a Thaksin government?</div>
