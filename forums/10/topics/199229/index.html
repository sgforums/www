We have two key priorities - <strong><span style="color: blue;">first to build up our core competencies in selected strategic areas</span></strong> and, <strong><span style="color: blue;">secondly, to attract and develop a significant concentration of talent to sustain research activities in the long term</span></strong>. And if we can achieve this, we will create more career opportunities in R and D and this will attract more students to go into higher post-graduate education"<br><br>In biomedical sciences, the next phase will build on Singapore's basic research and drug discovery capabilities.<br><br>In the area of environmental and water technologies, the Council believes that Singapore is well placed to take a leading role in developing new technological solutions.<br><br>PM Lee said: "We believe that over the next ten years many new opportunities will emerge because technology will improve. The weather is changing, climate is going to change, places which are wet are going to be drought, places which were able to conserve water, now with more population will find themselves short of water. If there is high energy it puts more pressure on technology to come up with more efficient ways to use clean water. In fact there will be many opportunities."<br><br>And in the interactive and digital media sector, games and edu-tainment are potential focus areas for Singapore.<br><br>Dr Vivian Balakrishnan, Second Minister for Information, Communications and the Arts, said: "One big area of opportunity in interactive and digital media is really in content creation, content customisation and in being able to transmit content trans-culturally and this require people with artistic and linguistic and scientific perspectives being brought to bear in one brain or better still in teams which are then assembled in research labs and corporate labs and businesses."<br><br>For all these plans to roll out, <strong>the council has approved S$1.4 billion over the next five years to fund the development of the three strategic research programmes</strong>.<br><br><strong><span style="color: indigo;">And a good number of jobs created by these sectors will be for Singaporeans</span></strong>.<br><br>Dr Tony Tan, Deputy Chairman, Research, Innovation Enterprise Council, said: <strong>"<span style="color: blue;">It would be a shame for us to create all of these jobs and find that we don't have Singaporeans who can actually have the skills to do the job and we have to import foreign talent to do it. Singaporeans must make an effort to be educated and trained</span>."</strong><br><br>The <strong>National Research Foundation has set up three executive committees</strong> to implement some of the recommendations which the Council has made to develop the three strategic areas of growth for Singapore.<br><br>In the meantime, the Foundation will also be on the lookout for new emerging markets to ensure that Singapore always remains on top of the research arena.<br><br>The Council will hold its second meeting in March next year. - CNA/ch<br></blockquote><span style="color: darkred;">How much did Singapore spend in bringing the best TALENTS of "international academics and industrialists " to sit on this supposedly 'high powered' Singapore Council for Research, Innovation and Enterprise (RIEC) that is chaired by PM LHL and with Dr Tony Tan as Deputy Chairman ?<br><br>All the scholars recruited from the best Singapore talents forming the LHL Government had to be backed up with a team of "international talents " - how much did we spend to seek their advise and confirmation for the way forward ?<br><br>Are we comforted with the million dollars spent which resulted in the PM being able to crystallize the problem of </span><strong>"an environment which is very systematic, <span style="color: red;">where a lot of things are managed rather than left to grow from the ground"</span></strong> <span style="color: darkred;">?<br><br>Was this realisation that <strong>"alot of things are managed and should have been left to grow from the ground"</strong> the result of the FT advise ?<br><br>Was this conclusion not obvious with all the years of Singapore complaints about the strong interfering hands of the Government ?<br><br>Is it surprising that despite this conclusion, we continue to be managed with a commitment - </span><strong><span style="color: blue;">"first to build up our core competencies in selected strategic areas</span></strong> and, <strong><span style="color: blue;">secondly, to attract and develop a significant concentration of talent to sustain research activities in the long term"</span></strong> <span style="color: darkred;">?<br><br>It seems that despite the FT advise, 'free market mechanism' remains distrusted, and need tinkering by the big persuasive hands of government to move social forces.<br><br>Are the million dollars spent on the Foreign Advisers and our Elite Ministers worth every cent for Singaporeans ?</span><br><br></div>
