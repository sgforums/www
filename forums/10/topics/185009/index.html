            <div class='col-md body'>It's not about the selling of national assets and all those corruption crap. The Bangkok elites need to get rid of Thaksin because he is effectively narrowing the income gap and taking power from the rich and giving it to the poor. The elites risk (like Sondhi) risk loosing their fortune if Thaksin continues to hold power.<br><br>Thaksin hopes that by stepping down, it would at least pacify the people in the south and Bangkok. Hopefully, they'll cooperate during the by-elections and TRT will still hold political power since they won majority seats. If the next PM chooses not hold another election, the opposition parties are screwed.<br><br>So... the conclusion is that there will be no conclusion. The opposition will continue to create problems for the government until they get what they wants. Power hungry Chamlong has screwed the country once again.<br><br>Only on thing for sure. Thailand is screwed. This political saga only shows the Thai politics is unstable. The economy will start to decline, investers will start to divert their monies to China and India (if they had not done so) and poverty will become rampant again.<br><br>The people just shot themselves in the foot. Better go sell those Thailand based Unit Trusts and shares...</div>

Thailand's experiment in democracy bears similarities to what will happen in Singapore the day a democratic government is elected. The elitists here will ignore the will of the majority and retake power using all the clout that their wealth, education, and position in society gives them, all supposedly in the "best interests of the nation," using high flung rhetoric such as "freedom" and "human rights" to misle the public. Which is why democracy will never succeed here- we'll be back to the status quo in short order.<br><br>Any Singaporean foolish enough to think that what has happened in Thailand is an expression of 'democracy' needs his head checked.
