            <div class='col-md body'>I realised that alot of secondary school have taken to adopt the 5 day week and conveniently push all the CCAs which were originally scheduled on Saturday to weekdays. This has a great impact on the students as CCAs on saturdays were actually meant for students to engage in productive and healthy activities in school instead of loitering around in shopping malls or going out on the streets. By closing the schools and locking them up on Saturdays, the school are actually shutting out the kids from going back! With the focus now on an all-rounded education, depriving students of saturday CCAs make them more prone to become even worse "mugger toads" for the hardworking, and cause the less hardworking to play even more. Is that a desirable thing to have?<br><br>5 day week. Should it be 5 days study and Saturdays let the kids enjoy their time with their friends in school, playing their favourite sports or having fun at their uniformed groups or other activities? Poor kids deprived of all the fun of growing up. STUDY STUDY STUDY is all they do now.

            <div class='col-md body'>actually...the 5 day week was created coz of the gov's pro-family stance.it was created to encourage parents to spend more quality time with their kids on the full sat and sundays-to foster bonds and blablabla.<br><br>well,what my jc did was shorten all the lessons by 5 mins so we end school earlier,and then CCA is after school.that way...we still have our CCAs,just not on sat.but its still unclear if my jc's rankings will drop or whatever due to the shorter lessons.then again,ranking for JCs have been abolished.ha ha.<br><br>as for mugger toads...hmmmm....its good to mug once in a while i guess.not 24/7.<br><br>thank goodness i've just finished my a levels.so i won't really be embroiled in this cca mess i hopeeee.</div>
