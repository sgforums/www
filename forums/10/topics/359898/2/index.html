              <p>So you're saying there has been lack of alternative leader figures?<br><br>So ask why there has been lack of alternative leader figure?<br><br>Because the price to pay to be an alternative leader figure is so high it's not really an option. You're told that the credit that why Singapore is successful goes to PAP and LKY regime. There's nothing wrong with that except you should begin to question that once you realized that PAP doesn't allow a healthy opposition to live in Singapore.<br><br>Do you really believe there's a man irreplaceable in this world? If there's one it must have been made up.<br><br>So Singapore success story has been made a pathetic excuse to deprive the people of Singapore their alternative leaders. In other words Singapore people have been made slaves to the ruling government without choice and freedom to choose their own leaders. Everybody that doesn't make their camp on the PAP side and make that known and try to offer a genuine alternative leadership to the people gets fixed and they will soon it's extremely uncomfortable to stay and fight in Singapore environs.<br><br>Singaporeans are owned by the PAP as of now imo.</p>

              <p>My dear Prophet, You have ask yourself what leader are you referring?? if u are an opposition leader, you should know better that it is a uphill task to take over PAP, you should know that you need to struggle all the way, it is like an egg against a rock. But it is not impossible to do it, history had shown us political strugglers who really rally well and gain the respect of the peoples end up being the govt. China Mao is a classic example, Ghandi, mandela of africa, and currently, the lady from mynmar..these are peoples who really put their lives for his/her peoples.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And if you look at our oppositions, Dr Chee, Mr Chiam etc etc...what have they done? nothing better if not worst, and of course you can argue that they are very much limited in their movement with the ruling party keeping full eyes on them, well, so are other strugglers in other nation, they go to jail, fight, persistence, get questioned and bashed...they still continue, cos they hv a believe that their country will better without the current ruler.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now, what have we (opposition) in singapore done? And i dun blame the current ruling party from attacking the oppositions in every opportunity they can, that is a part of their job, a survive instinct, a game of attack before you loose. You simply cannot blame them, if you are the ruling part, let said the hammer party wins, what are you going to do with the PAP members?? Surely you will try to erase them off this planet, if not, you dun fit to be a politician.</p>

              <p>you just brought out 2 interesting points.</p>
              <p>" the liberty to choose whatever you like to choose without repercussions". Repercussions from whom and to whom? if by your choice others suffer the repercussion, then you have no consideration for others when you exercise your freedom. Many people are like that, that is why you are suffering, by some others inconsiderate use of freedom.</p>
              <p><br>"the price to pay ". There is price for everything, including the choice of leaders. Many people in Singapore do no want to pay the price of having an alternative government, until they are very sure that the new one would be better than the old one. You have the choice to live in another country with a government of your choice, but your choice is limited by your ability to move and others' freedom to accept you.</p>
              <p>should you eat steak or chicken rice for dinner tonight? you can only choose one because that's all your stomach can take. not enough money, then chicken rice is all you can have. If no money, go home and eat what your mother cook, remember to say "thank you", for at least you have this final choice.</p>

              <p>I agree that Mr. Chiam is not doing very well on expanding his party, not as well as Mr. Low Thia Kiang, who now has Sylvia and the rest. The strength of a political party depend on how well they can get people to share the party's vision, and willing to come forward. Of course, with a strong party like PAP, the opposition is having an even tougher time to compete.</p>
              <p>the people in this forum seem to believe that in a true democratic country, the ruling party is obliged to make it easy for opposition, no matter how screwed up CSJ is, he should be given a chance....no, CSJ is not anywhere near the like of Chiam ST. </p>

              That's a bullshit, My suffering is due to some people regarding themselves above the law above moral and above ethics. In other words my suffering is due to tyranny the very thing that liberty can civil rights try to abolish. These kind of people should have been shot dead for the betterment of mankind. They are scums and villains. How could such people rule or placed in honorable position which they clearly don't deserve.
