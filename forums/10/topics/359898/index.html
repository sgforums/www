              No it can't.
                                
              Freedom means having the liberty to choose whatever you like to choose without repercussions as long as one respects his fellow mankind rights 
                                and to be able to change your mind and choose a different option if you like.
                                <br><br>
              You can't be a slave if you choose to follow something but if you changed your mind and decided to choose for something else you should not receive the threat of repercussions.
                                <br><br>
              That is freedom from slavery. The rights to choose and the rights to change your mind whenever you want.

              <p> </p>
              <p>As for Singaporeans, we are talking about a multi-racial society, not just merely chinese, it is not that singaporeans have to put up with the PAP, it is kind of mentality that until a better one come along, we might not put up PAP anymore, but so far, no one seem to be that better, and even if there is better one coming, their supporters are not rallying in the correct direction, eg as shown in these forums, a total disappointment.</p>

              So you're saying there has been lack of alternative leader figures?
                                <br><br>
              So ask why there has been lack of alternative leader figure?
                                <br><br>
              Because the price to pay to be an alternative leader figure is so high it's not really an option.
              You're told that the credit that why Singapore is successful goes to PAP and LKY regime. There's nothing wrong with that except you should begin to question that once you realized that PAP doesn't allow a healthy opposition to live in Singapore.
                                <br><br>
              Do you really believe there's a man irreplaceable in this world? If there's one it must have been made up.<br><br>
              So Singapore success story has been made a pathetic excuse to deprive the people of Singapore their alternative leaders. In other words Singapore people have been made slaves to the ruling government without choice and freedom to choose their own leaders. Everybody that doesn't make their camp on the PAP side and make that known and try to offer a genuine alternative leadership to the people gets fixed and they will soon it's extremely uncomfortable to stay and fight in Singapore environs.<br><br>
                                
              Singaporeans are owned by the PAP as of now imo.
              They follow the regime without question because they know the regime doesn't like to be questioned. They are not free people.
