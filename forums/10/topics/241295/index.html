            <div class='col-md body'>March 8, 2007<br>THE SHIN CORP PURCHASE<br>Temasek accountable to Govt on portfolio basis<br><br>MR PATRICK Tan Siong Kuan ('Billions at stake, so Shin saga a national concern'; ST, March 3) was understandably concerned that if Temasek Holdings' investment in Shin Corp made losses, Singapore would lose national reserves. But this is not the right way to measure Temasek's performance.<br><br>Temasek invests in a broad range of assets to diversify risk and achieve good returns on the portfolio as a whole. It accepts that some investments will do well while others may fail. What is important is that the portfolio as a whole delivers creditable and sustained returns. This is the approach taken by many other reputable, long-term investors.<br><br>The Government holds Temasek accountable for achieving good long-term performance on an overall portfolio basis, rather than on individual investments each year. If Temasek were to be assessed on each individual investment, it would adopt an overly conservative investment strategy and ultimately achieve much lower overall returns.<br><br>This approach has yielded good results. As of March 2006, Temasek has delivered a compounded annual return of 18 per cent in terms of total shareholder returns by market value since inception, or 28 per cent per annum in the last three years.<br><br>For the financial year 2006 ending March 2007, despite the Shin investment Temasek is again expected to do well.<br><br>Laurence Lien<br>Director<br>Governance and Investment<br>Ministry of Finance</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Today 8 Mar 2007<br><br><blockquote>Alliances may be safer bets<br>So, why do GLCs choose to acquire foreign assets?<br><br>Letter from Leong Sze Hian<br><br>I refer to the articles, "iTV to be operated by Thai govt firm" (March 3) and "Temasek's Thai woes deepen" (Feb 2<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">.<br>.<br>Nominated Member of Parliament Eunice Olsen raised a question in Parliament on the role of Temasek Holdings and asked if it could be more forthcoming in explaining its investment decisions and sharing its assessment.<br>.<br>As I read in the media about the unfolding saga of problems that our Government-Linked Companies (GLCs) are having with large-scale acquisitions in Thailand, Indonesia, Australia, and with countries such as Hong Kong and China in the past, I am compelled to ask searching questions, with the view that we must learn from the past in order to move forward into the future.<br>.<br>According to Professors Jeffrey H Dyer of Brigham Young University, Prashant Kale of the University of Michigan and Habir Singh of the Wharton School University of Pennsylvania, in Harvard Business Review (July-August 2004): "Alliances and acquisitions are alternative strategies Â— that is, the decision to do one usually implies not doing the other. If companies actually factored that into their decisions, they would make better deals."<br>.<br>This begs the question of what were the internal decision-making processes that our GLCs went through in deciding on acquisitions, instead of alliances, in the various countries concerned?<br>.<br>"Most acquisitions ... fail. A few may succeed, but acquisitions, on average, either destroy or don't add shareholder value," the professors wrote.<br>.<br>Our experience in Thailand is a case in point. "Acquisition deals are competitive and risky Â… Companies should consider exogenous factors like market uncertainty", and culture. Will it gain or lose the widespread acceptance of consumers, particularly in acquiring a major national asset of a foreign country?<br>.<br>According to Rita Gunther McGrath and Ian C MacMillan in Harvard Business Review (July-August 1995): "Business lore is full of stories about smart companies that incur huge losses when they enter unknown territory Â… new markets Â… By definition, new ventures call for a company to envision what is unknown, uncertain, and not yet obvious to the competition."<br>.<br>What management decision-making processes or other tools such as scenario planning, reverse income statement, pro forma operations specs, assumptions checklist, milestone planning, and so on, did the GLCs use?<br>.<br>Was "a keeper of the assumptions Â— someone whose formal task is to ensure that assumptions are checked and updated as each milestone is reached and that the revised assumptions are incorporated into successive iterations" designated?<br>.<br>How skilled are the GLCs in peripheral vision? Otherwise, we may end up being precisely wrong, rather than being about right.<br>.<br>A crucial question we may need to ask is whether the GLCs' present organisational capacity for strategic vision is more or less than their future needs? What risk-management techniques were used to weigh known, unknown and unknowable risks?<br>.<br>I write my comments and questions with the caveat that I know very little about the inner workings of the GLCs, because some, as private exempt companies, may not have much of their internal processes available as public information. </blockquote>This letter offers a better suggestion than the decision of GLC. at least we will not be seen as a "foreign govt hostile takeover of Thailand assets" no matter how hard we are trying to tell others that the GLC is a business entity<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Straits times index went up 58% over the last three years..and more for the rest of the asian equities.. If there was a fund that was only earning 28% over the last three years, it would be a lousy fund..<br><br>It also doesnt take a genius to beat Temasek in returns, any tom dick and harry who had invested passive index fund could have achieve close to 58% over the last 3 years<br><br>18% is also not a sustainable average. You can only achieve that from a small base which Singapore started 30 years ago.<br><br>If we can repeat 18% per annum from out current base,<br><br>our current 200 SGD billion reserves would be worth 2 867 400 billions in 30 years time or equivalent to 2867 trillions</div>
