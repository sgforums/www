              <p>It never fails to amuse me seeing Gan Kim Yong speak about the economy in the media. He has an engineering degree from cambridge, served in the home affairs department, president of NatSteel and now talks about Singapore's economy.</p>
              <p>Leo Yip, a former police scholar who was chief of CID and subsequently No. 2 in the SPF, then became LKY's principal private secretary, is now the chairman of EDB.</p>
              <p>Does it make sense to you pple? Do we see people of such vastly distant backgrounds manage economics 101 of the nation?</p>
