            <div class='col-md body'>Questions:<br>1) Is it true that officer cadets are choose based on their ECA?<br>2) Is it true that they are pre-determined before our BMT?<br><br>I finished my duty more than 7yrs liao, and these questions still lingers in my head to this day. i am truly disappointed with the army which i once look upon so dearly. i have to had some answers....<br><br>i was told by one of the officers that he can recommend someone with 'calibre' to the cadet course but at the end of the day, he said, there is actually a list of 'pre-selected' candidate. it so happens that cadets has ECA in relation to npcc, ncc or some basketball team captain - if not they would have at least an exemplary academic record.<br><br>back then i was aspiring to go ocs, i tried my best in everything i do. but nevertheless i didn't manage. because (imho):<br><br>1) i never had any proper ECA - why bother? back then my ECA was hanging around Wisma Atrium<br>2) my academic record is good but not exemplary - but i never study hard, i just study when exams is near<br>3) i was blackmarked by sore-eyes officers and specialists (i will never forget them in this lifetime!) because i was so and so's son (f*** the system!)<br><br>the strange think is, there was this guy who failed his ippt, has a damn too fat figure, failed his marksmanship and when in 'hypertension' or something during one training - went to ocs???  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>y? izzit because it is predestined? by the government? I heard one of the candidate when thru the FFI but fail due to a drug that he need to take for his supposely severe asthma cond. but he went thru and go to ocs. but i shldn't be surprise as i heard the so-called mo is somehow related to him and he was so desperate to go ocs.<br><br>can someone shed some lights if the above questions are true?<br><br>i love singapore and the army, but i simply hate the people in there - of course except for my buddies!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br></div>
