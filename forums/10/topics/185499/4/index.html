FT by definition are not singaporean and are therefore not even entitled to vote, let alone being eligible to be elected. We can question the qualifications and experience of the candidates but to suggest that only the local born should be eligible to contest is the worse crap I ever heard in political discussions.<br>If those not born locally are not accepted, even after NS, as equal to the local born Singaporeans, canÂ’t help but I see similarity in this misplaced Nationalism to the Nazi ideology in Germanic supremacy over all others. May not be of the same scale but equally stupid and arrogant.<br>If we look at those in the cabinets since the founding of Singapore, how many are local born?? This is why I find the starter of the thread, and his supporters, stupid, arrogant, and ignorant.<br>My wife and I decided to take Singapore as my home to start my family. Singapore is a small place, and the world is also getting smaller, fierce competitions are everywhere. I expect my children to face even greater challenges and difficulties in their life, and I have only two advice for them, do not run away from problem, and money alone cannot decide where you call home. Where my sons and daughters decide for their families will depend on them and their spouses, but before that, my sons will serve NS.<br>Wish you the best wherever you are and whatever you do.<br>Have a good day.<br></div>
