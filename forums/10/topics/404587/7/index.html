              of the Vice Presidents of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) Mr
              Thomas Bach has raised alarm bells on the spiraling costs of the
              inaugural Youth Olympic Games (YOG) in Singapore which has exceeded
              more than three times its initial budget to a shocking $387 million
              dollars.</p>
              <p><strong>“The financial requirements of the games should not limit
              future host candidates “to the same relatively small, exclusive circle
              of (developed) countries capable of holding Olympic Games,”</strong> Thomas Bach said. (read article <a href="http://www.southasiamail.com/news.php?id=78158">here</a>)</p>
              <p>There were some concerns that the sky-rocketing costs of hosting the
              YOG may deter developing countries from bidding for future games.</p>
              <p>In contrast, the twelfth Island Games – a biennial mini-Olympics for
              island communities to be staged in the Swedish-speaking island of Aland
              for roughly the same number of athletes last year cost only S$4 million
              dollars.</p>
              <p><strong>“A country which is able to organize Olympic Games should therefore not be considered as a host for Youth Olympic Games,”</strong> he added.</p>
              <p>Mr Bach is the second IOC Vice President to express his doubts about
              the YOG. Another Vice President Mr Richard Pound boycotted the event
              completely.</p>
              <p><strong>“It would be hypocritical to spend even more of the IOC’s money to come to something in which I do not believe”,</strong> says Pound. Instead of going to Singapore he went on vacation. (read article <a href="http://www.playthegame.org/news/detailed/former-ioc-vice-president-boycotts-yog-4959.html">here</a>)</p>
              <p>Mr Pound also doubted that the YOG will be a hit among the youth, contrary to what IOC President Jacques Rogge had proclaimed.</p>
              <p><strong>“Will the Youth Olympic Games get one more — what we call ‘a
              couch potato’ in America — into the swimming pool or on the track?”
              said Dick Pound. All the people involved are minors. They are still
              doing sports,”</strong> he quipped sarcastically.</p>
              <p>Despite the exorbitant costs of hosting the YOG, Singapore Minister
              for Community Development, Youth and Sports Dr Vivian Balakrishnan said
              he would still bid for the YOG at the present cost.</p>
              <p><strong>“I think this is not a trifling amount. But it is an amount
              that will give us value for money in terms of positioning ourselves, in
              terms of marketing ourselves, in terms of making sure we are on
              everyone’s radar screen the next time they make an investment decision,”</strong> he said during an interview with BBC News.</p>

              <p>The beleaguered Dr Vivian has come under fire of late from
              Singaporeans for bursting the YOG budget and a litany of comical
              screw-ups tarnishing Singapore’s reputation in the world.</p>
              <p>An online citizen set up by a school teacher to demand a public
              apology from Dr Vivian has garnered more than 300 signatures in one day

              </div>
              <p>As mentioned earlier, schools are ‘invited’ to attend these games.
              From my understanding, school tickets are sold to schools at a much
              discounted prize of $2. It has been inconvenient for spectators who
              wish to watch the games especially when our local athletes have
              succeeded to advance to the next round of competition.</p>
              <p>To simply put it, school students only attend the games in the early
              morning/afternoon aka curriculum time. During these times, athletes who
              are competing would only be in their preliminary rounds. What follows
              are the inconveniences that schools have brought to YOG spectators.</p>
              <p>1) Schools are assigned a sport to watch. Students watching the
              games do not know how the sport is being played, the rules etc. These
              students buy a bulk of tickets, thus causing the tickets to be
              ‘Sold-Out’. Shouldn’t the NSA be granted a certain amount to sell to
              their own sporting body at a discounted price as well? Esp since these
              ppl would actually KNOW what they are watching?</p>
              <p>2) Schools only attend Prelims which is held during the curriculum
              time. They do not attend the exciting matches which are usually held in
              the evening, thus leaving the competition venue barren during telecast.
              It makes SG appear to be non-supportive of their own games.</p>
              <p>3) Due to the tickets that schools have bought, they have limited
              the tickets for sale and prevent people who wish to come down to
              support the players during the more important matches after they have
              advanced to the following rounds. People who genuinely want to support
              the players are not given the chance to do so. So much for sporting
              nation and cheering on Team Singapore.</p>
              <p>For example, during the TKD match on the 16th when Singapore’s
              Darryl Tan clinched the first bronze medal, there were an influx of<br> supporters who wish to support him for the silver medal match. However,
              the tickets were ’sold out’ but it was evident that the venue was empty
              during the broadcast.</p>
              <p>Similarly, during Nurul Shafinas match on the 17th, after she has
              successfully clinched the bronze medal, many people wanted to support
              the TKD player but were unable to do so due to the ticket’s being sold
              out. Only the JCs were present during her exciting match where she
              almost won the game. Given that they were more local supporters who
              were there to cheer her on, she may have<br> possibly succeeded in winning Singapore’s silver medal with a strong crowd behind her.</p>
              <p>What I am suggesting is that YOG committee should have looked at
              these problem. Since they have made schools attend a sport, they should
              have seen that schools would only be able to attend the games during
              curriculum time and will leave once its evening. They then should
              release the seats that these schools have purchased and allow them to
              be sold to the general public who are able to attend and cheer our
              local athletes at that particular time. If these schools wish to watch
              the game, they should report 2 hours before, rather than just
              disappear, leaving the place with empty seats during LIVE telecast.</p>
              <p>Frankly speaking, I was disappointed that my friends and I were not
              granted tickets especially since I really wanted to support my friend
              and fellow Singapore athlete during her silver medal match. Her
              extended family members were equally disappointed. Yet, during
              broadcast, it was evident that there was a lack of local supporters and
              a lot of empty seats…So much for ‘Sold-Out’.</p>

              <p><br>shock???!!! not at all, perhaps these VP or whatsoever holding offices in the olympic committees do not understand that Singapore has a 7% Gst, ERP, high COE and many more high costs of living. What is 380++ millions when our we can afford to loose billions in our soverignity wealth leading to high cost of collection from its citizens and today, they claim to have gained 10 billions by MAS, but nothing in return for its citizens.</p>
              <p>So, dun worry, Singapore can even host the Olympic if they get a chance, afterall, unlike other countries, our cost can be recover easily</p>
              <p>If developing countries cannot afford, dun host.</p>
