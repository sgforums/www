              <p>I'm here in Indonesia and there is no mention of YOG on television. I think the YOG is great in terms of wanting to build a future for the world's young athletes, get young people excited in sports etc.....BUT on the commercial side, it is still a long shot from the REAL olympics.</p>
              <p>People want to see adults perform, superstars.........the real olympics will generate the publicity and revenue that the host country needs. Kids don't attract fans from around the world.....superstars and adults will. Novel idea by Rogge but I think this time he has gotten the idea of a sports consumer's mindset wrong.</p>

              <p></p>
              <p>As
              the opening ceremony was in progress on the north bank of Marina Bay,
              some kind of Youth Olympics carnival was going on on the south bank,
              just in front of The Sail building. Its centrepiece was a huge concert
              arena with perhaps 1,500 seats laid out, and in which a band was
              playing. I took this picture:</p>
              <p><a href="http://yawningbread.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/pic_201008_39.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1803" title="pic_201008_39" src="http://yawningbread.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/pic_201008_39.jpg?w=480&amp;h=360" alt="" width="480" height="360"></a></p>
              <p>I wonder how much of the S$387 million — the estimated cost of the Youth Olympics — went into that.</p>
              <p>I saw a bit of the fireworks overhead,
              but since I didn’t have the right camera and tripod for proper
              pictures, I decided not to stay for the main fireworks display. What’s
              the point of staying? Better to get home before the crowd spills out of
              the opening ceremony, packing the trains.</p>
              <p>Back home, I turned on the television and caught the tail end of the
              opening ceremony, in which a ghastly oversized bird built of chicken
              wire mesh and neon lights borrowed from Geylang (our red light
              district) floated across the bay. Perched on top of the contraption’s
              head was somebody holding aloft the olympic torch.</p>
              <p>Down on the water were eight to ten dragon boats playing the role of
              marine outriders to the fat bird. I was horrified that we chose kitsch
              over the authentic. We didn’t need the bird. It would have been more
              elegant to convey the torch at the head of a dragon boat. How much did
              that fowl cost? More money wasted.</p>

              <p></p>
              <p><strong>Leong Sze Hian</strong> -</p>
              <p><a href="http://theonlinecitizen.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/yog320240.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-25987" title="yog320240" src="http://theonlinecitizen.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/yog320240.jpg" alt="" width="259" height="194"></a>I
              was told that the mother of a Natonal Servicemen (NS Men) was griping
              about her son not being able to attend a family event because he had
              been ordered to attend the Youth Olympics Games as a spectator.</p>
              <p>He will be given an early dismissal from the army camp, to go home to change to civilian clothes to attend a YOG event.</p>
              <p>She is rather concerned that although her son would normally already
              be very tired after a day’s training, he would still have to go for the
              YOG event, which finishes very late.</p>
              <p>Does YOG or the Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) reimburse such NSmen for their transportation costs, to and from the YOG event?</p>
              <p>Are they reimbursed for any meal and drink during the event? Or are
              they served free food, like the ones that have been highlighted online?</p>
              <p>Are their attendance taken at the event to ensure that they turn up?</p>
              <p>It was reported in The Online Citizen article – “YOG – Another
              farce?” (Jul 10) – that the sluggish sales of 320,000 YOG tickets on 26
              May mysteriously shrunk to 245,000 on 7 July, of which 80,000 of the
              more than 100,000 sold were purchased by the Ministry of Education
              (MOE).</p>
              <p>MOE declined to disclose how much they paid for the tickets, or how
              much the schools and students allocated tickets may have to pay.</p>
              <p>Does MINDEF have to pay for the tickets like those bought by MOE?</p>
              <p>From brisk sales of close to 50 per cent of the 245,000 tickets sold
              (or about 38 per cent of the original 320,000 tickets figure), it then
              became 70 per cent sold on 2 August, according to the report “YOG
              ticket sales picking up, with 70% sold” (<a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/1072889/1/.html">Channel News Asia</a>, 2 August).</p>
              <p>Were any of these tickets taken by MINDEF?</p>
              <p>If more than 70 per cent had been sold as of 2 August, why is there a need to send NSmen to be spectators?</p>
              <p>Are the amounts paid by MOE and MINDEF included in the almost-more-than-four times YOG budget over-run of $387 million?</p>
              <p>If not, then what is the additional sum to the total YOG costs?</p>
              <p>By the way, I think the media may not know how to count, as every
              media report said that the YOG budget was three times over-run. $387
              million divided by the original budget of $104 million is about four
              times over-budget, or about 300 per cent over-budget!</p>
              <p>Why is it that there have been no media reports about MINDEF taking YOG tickets and the costs of these?</p>
              <p>Are the T-shirts given to all ministry staff the same as those given to volunteers?</p>
              <p>If they are different, how much do they cost and how many were given away to each of the two groups?</p>

              <p>Singapore’s reputation as a neat, organized and efficient country
              lies in tatters yesterday as the much anticipated YOG Opening Ceremony,
              billed by the Straits Times as Singapore’s “BIGGEST” show turned out to
              be a NIGHTMARE to both the organizers and viewers alike.</p>
              <p>[<span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #000000;"><span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #000000;"><em>Get instant updates and discussions about the YOG on our Facebook page </em><a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?v=info&amp;ref=nf&amp;gid=153492722129#%21/pages/The-Temasek-Review/190806675782?ref=sgm"><em>here</em></a>]</span></span></span></span></p>
              <p>The most important section of all past Olympic Games’ opening
              ceremonies is the part where all the participating nations are
              introduced with their flags displayed for to see which are usually well
              choreographed and rehearsed with not a single mistake tolerated.</p>
              <p>There were not one, but multiple screw-ups at this section of the
              YOG opening ceremony as the flag and name bearers appeared completely
              confused with the way they should be heading after making their
              appearances on stage leaving shell-shocked volunteers scurrying all
              over the place to direct them to their rightful locations.</p>
              <p>The flag-bearers were supposed to follow right behind the ushers
              holding placards showing the name of the countries and they were to
              walk in alternate left and right to lie up in front of the podium.</p>
              <p>In the snapshot below, the athlete carrying the Algeria flag
              appeared lost as to where to go and lingered on the stage long after
              his name-bearer (circled in red) had walked off:</p>
              <p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-29129" title="yogalgeria" src="http://www.temasekreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/yogalgeria-640x396.jpg" alt="yogalgeria" width="478" height="287"></p>
              <p>Next, the athlete bearing the Azerbaijan flag walked in the opposite direction of his name-bearer:</p>
              <p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29130" title="yogazer" src="http://www.temasekreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/yogazer.jpg" alt="yogazer" width="476" height="314"></p>
              <p>Similarly, the Bosnian althlete seemed clueless on where he should be heading as well:</p>
              <p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29131" title="yogbosnian" src="http://www.temasekreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/yogbosnian.jpg" alt="yogbosnian" width="470" height="333"></p>
              <p>The Jordan althlete stood still staring at the crowd upon appearing
              on the stage, looked around and then turned and walked off in the
              opposite direction, prompting one frustrated volunteer (circled in red)
              to rush after him and in the process almost collided with the
              name-bearer of the next country:</p>
              <p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29132" title="yogjordan" src="http://www.temasekreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/yogjordan.jpg" alt="yogjordan" width="463" height="300"></p>
              <p>As one netizen Benny Lim summed up the entire debacle succinctly:</p>
              <p><strong>“The projection introducing the different countries
              participating in the YOG was so bad (one side is brighter than the
              other – so I believe it’s made up of two projections). The athletes did
              not know which way to go. C’mon, this is the most important part of the
              opening. All I (as well as the rest of world) could see was the crew
              running about to pull back the athletics that went the wrong direction.”</strong></p>
              <p>It is absolutely unacceptable that the YOG committee can make such
              an elementary mistake in front of the world which displayed their lack
              of preparation for the event. Were there any rehearsals conducted for
              the athletes beforehand to instruct them on where to walk? Their
              nonchalant, cavalier and comical demeanour displayed on stage is an
              insult both to the host and the IOC.</p>
              <p>After splurging nearly $400 million dollars of taxpayers’ monies on
              staging the YOG, such a sloppy, unmotivated, disgraceful, pathetic and
              atrocious performance at the opening ceremony calls for an immediate
              internal inquiry.</p>
              <p>Contrary to showing what Singapore is “capable” of as proclaimed
              proudly by PAP minister Dr Vivian Balakrishnan, the YOG opening
              ceremony has managed to showcase the utter incompetence, impotence and
              ineptitude of the PAP regime to the rest of the world which brings to
              mind the escape of famed terrorist Mas Selamat Kasteri two years ago.</p>

              <p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-large wp-image-29120 aligncenter" title="yogshow08" src="http://www.temasekreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/yogshow08-640x408.jpg" alt="yogshow08" width="516" height="319"></p>
              <p> 1. The YOG bus lane is ridiculous. Using fear to inject
              graciousness is not going to work. Singaporeans are educated
              individuals. After all, isn’t it dangerous for such a big bus to be
              driving faster than a normal car on the expressway?</p>
              <p>2. The opening ceremony had too many repeated concepts with the
              recent NDP. Once again, we saw how Singapore developed as a
              multi-racial society; the symbolism of the 5 stars on the flag. All
              these concepts are good for NDP but not for YOG. The opening of YOG
              should be about making Singapore’s culture accessible to world’s youths
              in the way they like it.</p>
              <p>3. I do not get the strong feeling of excellence, friendship and
              respect from the entire opening ceremony. I don’t see how fighting with
              your inner monster and playing with fire contribute to the values.</p>
              <p>4. With such a budget, I expect the ceremony to be almost flawless.
              The projection introducing the different countries participating in the
              YOG was so bad (one side is brighter than the other – so I believe it’s
              made up of two projections). The athletics did not know which way to
              go. C’mon, this is the most important part of the opening. All I (as
              well as the rest of world) could see was the crew running about to pull
              back the athletics that went the wrong direction.</p>
              <p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-29121 aligncenter" title="yogshow19" src="http://www.temasekreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/yogshow19.jpg" alt="yogshow19" width="500" height="329"></p>
              <p>5. The YOG commentator should be fired!!! He destroyed the
              experience of viewers watching from home. His comments were running in
              conjunction with the live broadcast. Also, he kept talking about how
              many years he had stayed in Singapore blah blah blah. Who cares about
              that? Worst of all, he didn’t even have the decency to let us enjoy one
              act completely without injecting his very own comments.</p>
              <p>6. Sean Kingston’s NO SHOW completely destroyed the Olympic spirit.
              Each of the 5 musicians of the YOG theme song represents a continent,
              just as each circle of the Olympic flag represent a continent. With the
              missing Sean Kingston, the 5 circles on the Olympic flag is incomplete
              and sadly, it has to happen in Singapore.</p>
              <p>7. Finally, did SYOG Chairman, Mr Ng SerMiang, rehearse his speech?
              He seemed to have memorised the speech quite well. Nonetheless, why
              wasn’t there any decent individual correcting his pronunciation during
              a rehearsal before allowing him to speak to the world with such bad
              pronunciation?</p>
              <p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29122" title="yogshow23" src="http://www.temasekreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/yogshow23.jpg" alt="yogshow23" width="484" height="338"></p>
              <p>8. Home viewers were forced to watch advertisements (sponsors I
              think) even it means depriving us our one and only YOG experience. We
              missed a portion of the opening each time after an ad. I think we even
              missed 80% of a piano recital after one ad. I didn’t know what went on
              there?</p>

              <p>The “infectious” apathy of Singaporeans has afflicted the doomed
              Youth Olympic Games right on the very first day as there were plenty of
              empty seats galore at the stadiums hosting the competitions.</p>
              <p>The badminton match between India and China was played to an almost
              empty indoor stadium with the camera crew trying desperately hard to
              avoid the empty seats to no avail:</p>
              <p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29143" title="yogbadminton" src="http://www.temasekreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/yogbadminton.jpg" alt="yogbadminton" width="471" height="256"></p>

              <div id="id_4c67d468d57666247824b"><span><span><span>Over at the Singapore Sports School where the swimming competition was held, there were plenty of empty seats too.</span></span></span></div>
              <p>There were also some problems with the official YOG webcast as highlighted by netizen Rurik Aurvandil:</p>
              <p><em>“Schedule is still all screwed up. YOG 2 for example still
              reflecting taekwando when they are in fact playing a badminton match.
              They seem to have some problems filling up the time. According to
              schedule, got 1 hr “no transmission” from 5 pm to 6pm. The empty seats
              are so embarassing that they are doing everything they can to avoid
              showing the seats. As a result, the camera shows the match from
              “unconventional” angles which make it hard to follow what is happening.
              Match officials and technical staff still outnumber audience in the few
              shots where you can see the empty seats.”</em></p>

              <p>The PAP regime’s desperate attempts to promote the YOG in the HDB
              heartlands floundered spectacularly as well. Contrary to Channel News
              Asia’s earlier boast that Singapore’s heartlands have “joined” the YOG
              “celebrations (read article <a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/1075223/1/.html">here</a>),
              few Singaporeans bothered to participate in the YOG publicity gimmicks
              or watch the competitions on the giant TV screens set up at community
              clubs.</p>
              <p>Only a couple of Singaporeans were seen at Anchorvale Community Club
              yesterday evening watching the LIVE telecast of the YOG competition
              with a few aunties appearing more interested to chat with one another
              than the proceedings on the screen in front:</p>

              <p>Let me see if I get this right.</p>
              <p>1. The school has “volunteered” the boy to be a spectator for a Youth Olympic Games Track and Field event on a SATURDAY.</p>
              <p>2. Then, tells the parents that the kid will not be given any
              refreshments so the parents have to bear the cost of pocket money. On a
              Saturday.</p>
              <p>3. Then, tells the parents that the kid is ALLOWED to bring [sic] a
              water bottle (how FREAKIN’ KIND of you!). Presumably this is so that he
              doesn’t die of thirst and cause the school any administrative headache.</p>
              <p>4. However, said water bottle must not have “Nike” or “Adidas” logos.</p>
              <p>Since when did school children forced to be spectators at a sporting
              event have to adhere to branding guidelines? I understand if the
              athletes are covered by sponsor restrictions but SPECTATORS too?</p>
              <p>Next you’ll be telling parents that the kids can only wear certain brands of UNDERWEAR to spectate YOG events too.</p>

              <p>In a sign that the PAP regime is getting increasingly desperate to
              drum up flagging support for its inaugural Youth Olympic Games (YOG),
              not only are Singapore students being FORCED to watch the games, they
              are slapped with a $5 refundable deposit to ensure that they turn up
              for the games.</p>
              <p>Students from Kuo Chuan Presbysterian Primary School were COERCED to
              watch the YOG Preliminary swimming competition at the Singapore Sports
              School on 19 August 2010.</p>

              <p>To ensure that they actually turn up for the event, the school even
              COMPELLED them to pay $5 deposit upfront which will be returned they
              turned up on the actual day and confiscated if they do not do so:</p>

              <p>The high-handed and arbitrary manner in which Singapore schools are
              forcing their students to support the YOG is peeving many Singaporeans
              off and degrading the Olympian values of “excellence, respect and
              friendship” as well.</p>
              <p>While secondary, junior college and polytechnic students are forced
              to volunteer for YOG under long hours and being fed DOG food, primary
              school students are taught how to “cheer” at the games.</p>
              <p>According to one netizen, the students were actually divided into
              groups and instructed to cheer for different countries to “spice up”
              the event.</p>
              <p>The inaugural YOG is becoming a farce with such massive astroturfing
              engineered by the state to generate fake grassroots support for it.</p>
              <p>The International Olympic Committee and the international media
              should look into this matter and take the PAP regime to task for
              damaging the good name of the Olympic Games after all the money spent.</p>

              <p>Now I know really why the YOG is a utter failure, been hearing on
              Talkback on 938 live on how people are upset over the budget of 300
              over million from the initial 100 million.</p>
              <p>Many are also upset over the delay of the sports facility delayed
              which are supposed for the YOG due to whatever reason. I am a
              volunteer/temporary staff working for YOG.</p>
              <p>This is not my choice but many students like myself are being forced to work for the games saying failing which, <strong>you will not get your testimonial and/or may affect your grades. </strong>Is this ethical?</p>
              <p>[Get instant updates and discussions about the YOG on our Facebook page <a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?v=info&amp;ref=nf&amp;gid=153492722129#%21/pages/The-Temasek-Review/190806675782?ref=sgm"><em>here</em></a>]</p>
              <p>I was tasked to work night shift (I will not say who I am working
              for) because I am a guy and they say its better for guys to take the
              night job as it is unsafe for girls. We were supposed to work for <strong>19 days straight with 2 days off only</strong>. With all the tight security, how can it be unsafe for the girls?</p>
              <p>Many of the workers I spoke too said <strong>they were forced to come to work for the games and they do not have a pay increase although they got transport allowance. </strong>What
              they told me is that they say we should be proud of serving the country
              rather than asking for more money and its an experience of a life time
              that money cannot buy.</p>
              <p>Budget wise, when I sit on the shuttle bus, I spoke to a few
              athletes and talked to them heartily. What I found out from some is
              that all foreigners invited to attend the games would be provided with
              a SIM card with unlimited local calls. The higher ranks one even gets a
              cell phone. So, is this where are they spending the money instead of
              promoting it? The marketing of YOG needs improvement where you can
              hardly hear any promotion being done. So, where did the money of 300
              odd million went to?</p>
              <p>The way they are treating the staff is horrendous. <strong>We are not allowed to take breaks for more than half hour. </strong>If
              we wanted to drink, we can only do so in the workforce canteen and if
              we happened to be in the canteen and wanted a drink, they told us
              cannot even though there are no atheletes and will reprimand us
              continuously. We are not allowed to sit anywhere near the canteen
              otherwise it is a violation of rules. The officials however are allowed
              to sit down even if there are athletes. This is double standard. The
              YOG committee keeps walking around to scold all kinds of workers and
              many which I spoke off is very fed-up and they are not sure they will
              stay on with the current situation or rather they do not know how long
              they can tolerate this. To me, even if I am not well,</p>
              <p>I will not force myself or tell myself to hold on for the games, after all, are we recognised or appreciated?</p>
              <p>So ironically, they treat the foreigners so well but the locals
              badly. Many places are short-handed and those there are force to work
              harder to make up for the short-fall otherwise they may get a pay cut.
              So must rules to follow, many are unhappy. Another factor is I know
              from the place I work is many who are working for YOG are Malaysians or
              Chinese and not many Singaporeans except we the students and a few top
              guns. To me, the games is really a failure at one angle.</p>
              <p>Please keep my letter confidential if not my personal particulars to
              be personal as I am afraid to be black-marked (you know what I meanï¼‰. I
              am really afraid to write this letter as if they know I wrote it, they
              will blacklist me.)</p>
              <p>After all, this is just my personal feelings and what I gathered
              after chatting with many of the various individuals working there. I am
              writing this just to inform you about happenings from the YOG to vent
              my frustrations and let people know about it. The more I am scared to
              write, they more they people would bully the workers. I will be really
              happy to tell you more by phone if necessary.</p>

              <p>In yet another embarrassing blow to the credibility of the Singapore
              YOG Committee (SYOGOC) and the PAP regime, a free shooting event at YOG
              venue *SCAPE Youth Space was stopped abruptly when the canvas roof
              covering the basketball court fell apart under heavy rain.</p>
              <p>According to the official Singapore 2010 YOG website, the YOG’s
              FIBA33 (basketball) will be the first international street basketball
              event to be held in the *SCAPE which will also be one of the venues for
              the Culture and Education Programme.</p>
              <p>The shocking incident was reported in the afternoon by an auxillary police officer Mr Mohamad Zen on his Facebook:</p>
              <p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29211" title="yogzen" src="http://www.temasekreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/yogzen.jpg" alt="yogzen" width="523" height="321"></p>
              <p><strong>[Source: </strong><a href="http://www.facebook.com/mohd.zen?v=info&amp;ref=ts#%21/mohd.zen?v=wall&amp;ref=ts"><strong>Mohd Zen</strong></a><strong> Facebook]</strong></p>
              <p>Mr Mohd Zen wrote that the roof canvas gave way suddenly due to the
              heavy downpour and the water came down hard into the spectator stand.</p>
              <p>His account was corroborated by a report by Yahoo News just minutes ago.</p>
              <p>When contacted by Yahoo News, SYOGOC said the incident occurred at 4.2o pm.</p>
              <p><strong>“The canvas roof in front on the sideline had given way due
              to heavy pooling of rainwater. Some FIBA officials and SYOGOC staff got
              wet but, no one was injured. The Skills Challenge for Basketball at
              *scape Youth Space has been cancelled today [Tuesday] due to weather
              conditions. It was originally scheduled to take place from 4pm to 6pm,”</strong> the spokesperson added.</p>
              <p><strong>[Source: </strong><a href="http://sg.yfittopostblog.com/2010/08/18/canvas-roof-falls-apart-at-yog-basketball-venue/"><strong>http://sg.yfittopostblog.com/2010/08/18/canvas-roof-falls-apart-at-yog-basketball-venue/</strong></a><strong>]</strong></p>
              <p>The identity of the contractor responsible for putting up the roof
              canvas is not known, but SYOGOC probably has some explaining to do as
              the incident could pose a grave danger to the participants at the event.</p>
              <p>This is the first YOG event which has been cancelled as a result of dismal weather condition.</p>
              <p>There were no immediate comments from Dr Vivian Balakrishnan, the
              PAP minister  in charge of the YOG. Neither did the state media carry
              any reports on it.</p>
              <p>In an interview with BBC News a few days ago, a smug Dr
              Vivian proclaimed that the YOG is “a chance to extend Singapore’s image
              as an efficient globally connected city.”</p>
              <p>Besides showcasing the very real infectious apathy of Singaporeans,
              it has now displayed the utter incompetence, ineptitude and impotence
              of the PAP regime to the entire world with this disastrous screw-up
              which should not have happened in the first place.</p>

              <p>The inaugural Youth Olympic Games (YOG) hosted by Singapore has lost its Olympian values of “<strong>excellence, friendship and respect</strong>”

              made to stand in the rain for almost two hours to ”cheer” for the YOG
              torch rally.</p>
              <p><strong>“What to do? The instructions come from the top. We have to
              welcome the YOG procession even if there are thunderstorms. I just hope
              that my students won’t fall ill from standing in the rain for so long,”</strong> she said in exasperation.</p>
              <p>The shocking story was picked up by the foreign media who asked
              Singapore YOG Organizing Committee Chairman Ng Ser Miang for
              clarifications. (<a title="Permanent Link to Ng Ser Miang denies that Singapore children were forced to attend YOG torch rally" rel="bookmark" href="http://www.temasekreview.com/2010/08/15/ng-ser-miang-denies-that-singapore-children-were-forced-to-attend-yog-torch-rally/">Ng Ser Miang denies that Singapore children were forced to attend YOG torch rally</a>)</p>
              <p>Mr Ng denied flatly that Singapore school students were ever FORCED to support the YOG and claimed that they did so willingly:</p>
              <p><strong>“There will always be stories flying around. Just look at
              the faces of the children that are there, the sparkle in their eyes and
              the smile on their faces. Those are not things you can force. I don’t
              think anyone will be forced to come to watch the torch relay or the
              games. So I don’t think there is any coercion,”</strong> he was quoted as saying in Associated Press last week.</p>
              <p>We have received scanned copies of letters from two primary schools – <strong>Queenstown and Zhenghua</strong>, and a secondary school <strong>St Patrick’s, </strong>proving
              once and for all beyond any reasonable doubts that Singapore school
              students are indeed COERCED by their schools and MOE to welcome the YOG
              torch rally even in the rain to generate FAKE GRASSROOTS SUPPORT for
              the YOG:</p>

              <p>(Above) <strong>St Patrick’s School:</strong> Stated clearly in the letter that attendance is COMPULSORY. Parents have no choice to opt their children out of the YOG event.</p>
              <p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29225" title="yogzhenghua" src="http://www.temasekreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/yogzhenghua.jpg" alt="yogzhenghua" width="544" height="693"></p>
              <p>(Above) <strong>Zhenghua Primary School:</strong> Have no qualms dismissing students later should the YOG torch rally be delayed by bad weather.</p>
              <p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29227" title="yogqueenstown" src="http://www.temasekreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/yogqueenstown1.jpg" alt="yogqueenstown" width="560" height="695"></p>
              <p>(Above)<strong> Queenstown Primary School:</strong> The preliminary examinations for Primary Six students were re-scheduled for the YOG.</p>
              <p>If the enthusiasm for the YOG is indeed very “real” and “infectious”
              as proclaimed by PAP Finance Minister Tharman or has really struck a
              “chord” with Singaporeans according to Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong,
              why must Singapore schools make it COMPULSORY for their students to
              welcome the YOG torch rally? Shouldn’t the response be spontaneous with
              the students attending their events out of their own free will?</p>
              <p>Despite the overwhelming evidence showing that there is little or no
              support from ordinary Singaporeans for YOG and the scenes of
              students ”cheering” the YOG torch rally captured on screen and reported
              in the Singapore media have been cleverly and carefully ORCHESTRATED
              from above to generate fake support for the YOG, the PAP minister in
              charge of the YOG Dr Vivian Balakrishnan remains DIVORCED from the
              reality on the ground.</p>
              <p>When asked by The Brunei Times on the lukewarm response from Singaporeans for the YOG, Dr Vivian retorted:</p>
              <p><strong>“The answer lies on the ground, what people do and how they
              feel. At this point of time, I am quite confident that Singaporeans are
              proud of this and want to show our best to the world.”</strong></p>
              <p>Yes, the answer lies on the ground – Singaporeans do not care a damn
              about the YOG which is fast becoming a $387 million dollar FLOP and an
              international disgrace and disaster for Singapore.</p>
              <p>PAP Education Minister Dr Ng Eng Hen must explain to Singaporeans
              why our primary school students are being COERCED to support the YOG
              when it has nothing to do with them at the detriment of their health
              and studies. Shouldn’t the consent of the parents be sought at the very
              least and the students given the option to opt out? Are we becoming
              like North Korea where thousands of its people are being forced by the
              regime to lend support its annual <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNDAFegkdkA">Arirang</a> mass games?</p>
              <p>The Youth Olympic Games is a good initiative by the International
              Olympic Committee to inculcate good sporting values in the youth.
              Unfortunately, under the repressive PAP regime, it has now become the “<strong>Youth Arirang Games</strong>” and a laughing stock to the world.</p>

              <p>According to unverified rumors circulating around in cyberspace, a
              mass food poisoning outbreak occurred at a YOG venue yesterday
              afflicting more than 30 people who ate the food, including the on site
              doctor.</p>

              <p>The Ministry of Health has reportedly launched an investigation into
              the case with the food caterer suspended. The incident was first posted
              on mycarforum yesterday evening by a former Cerano:</p>

              <p>The inaugural YOG was besieged by problems and controversies even
              before it was officially opened last Saturday. A few days earlier,
              there were reports of volunteers being fed inadequate and substandard
              food, sparking a massive outcry among Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>There were also reports of Singapore students being forced to
              volunteer for the YOG which were dismissed by the Singapore YOG
              Committee Chairman Ng Ser Miang as mere “stories flying around.”</p>
              <p>Yesterday, a roof canvas at one of the YOG venues, *SCAPE, collapsed
              under a heavy downpour forcing the basketball match held there to be
              cancelled. Fortunately, nobody was injured.</p>
              <p>The Singapore media has censored all negative news about the YOG and
              its articles on it are completely divorced from the reality on the
              ground.</p>
              <p>If you have any information on the above mass food poisoning
              outbreak at a YOG venue, please email us immediately or post a message

              <p><strong>OPINION</strong></p>
              <p>The Singapore 2010 Youth Olympic Games is becoming an embarrassing
              farce for the PAP regime which has spent nearly $400 million dollars on
              it.</p>
              <p>Despite the mammoth efforts taken to publicize and promote the YOG,
              the response from ordinary Singaporeans has been most disappointing so
              far.</p>
              <p><span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #000000;"><span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #000000;"><em>[Get instant updates and discussions about the YOG on our Facebook page </em><a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?v=info&amp;ref=nf&amp;gid=153492722129#%21/pages/The-Temasek-Review/190806675782?ref=sgm"><em>here</em></a>]</span></span></span></span></p>
              <p>The competitions on the first two days suffered from low attendances
              with so many empty seats galore that the camera crew had difficulties
              avoiding capturing them completely on screen.</p>
              <p>The number of volunteers far outnumbered that of the participants
              at YOG celebrations held in the HDB heartlands with the live bands at
              Marina Bay performing literally to rows of empty chairs.</p>
              <p>To compound matters, the YOG was hardly reported in the
              international papers which have largely focused on the ballooning costs
              and the general apathy displayed by Singaporeans at the event.</p>
              <p>While the state media has tried desperately hard to hype up the YOG
              with PAP leaders putting up a brave denial in front of the depressing
              response, the fact remains that no amount of money, publicity or
              astroturfing can generate genuine enthusiasm, affection and passion
              from Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>We have been challenged repeatedly by PAP trolls here to provide
              photos to substantiate our claims that there is little interest in the
              YOG from the citizenry.</p>
              <p>We now show you a series of photos taken by Leonard Soosay on Sunday, 15 August 2010 to set the record straight:</p>
              <p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-29191" title="yogmarina01" src="http://www.temasekreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/yogmarina01-640x428.jpg" alt="yogmarina01" width="519" height="285"></p>

              <p>You can view all the 59 photos on Leonard’s Facebook <a href="http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=207260&amp;id=635221961#%21/album.php?aid=207260&amp;id=635221961">here</a>.</p>
              <p>A picture speaks a thousand words, let alone 59 pictures showing the
              level of interest in the YOG from ordinary Singaporeans. The TRUTH is –
              the YOG is a FLOP. Nobody cares a damn about it as reflected by the
              online poll conducted by Channel News Asia lately in which 88 percent
              of some 6,400 respondents indicated clearly that they are “not
              interested at all” in the YOG.</p>
