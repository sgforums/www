              SINGAPORE - Two of sport's biggest names will not be in Singapore for the inaugural Youth Olympic Games.<br><br> The International Olympic Committee (IOC) told MediaCorp on Friday that
              swimming superstar Michael Phelps and track phenomenon Usain Bolt
              (picture) are unable to attend the Games.<br><br> Along with Olympic
              pole vault champion Yelena Isinbayeva, the pair were appointed Games'
              ambassadors by the IOC for more than 3,600 young athletes from the 205
              National Olympic Committees that will compete in Singapore from Aug 14
              to 26.<br><br> "We just heard from Michael and Usain, and they will not
              be able to join us in Singapore because of their competition
              schedules," IOC media relations co-ordinator Nimtaz-Tanya Noordin said.<br><br> American Phelps, 25, has 14 Olympic gold medals to his name, the most
              in the history of the Games. Jamaica's Bolt is the reigning 100m and
              200m Olympic champion and world-record holder.<br><br> It was hoped the
              presence of the two biggest stars of the 2008 Beijing Games would help
              hype up the Youth Olympic Games, but both athletes confirmed they will
              miss out on their Facebook page.<br><br> "Even though I can't make it
              in person, because I'll be competing at the US Nationals and
              (hopefully) Pan-Pacific (Championships), I will definitely be there in
              spirit," wrote Phelps, who won a record eight golds at the 2008
              Olympics.<br><br> "I wish all the athletes good luck and most of all have fun!"<br><br> Bolt, who clinched three golds in Beijing, billed the Youth Olympics as
              important for the development of young athletes. Said the 23-year-old
              on his Facebook page: "My advice to the athletes going to Singapore is
              to first of all have fun. Just remember all the hard training you did,
              do what you enjoy and you will always succeed."<br><br> Without them,
              Isinbayeva will be the only Games ambassador coming to Singapore. She
              will be joined by 46 athlete role models selected by the IOC as part of
              the Games' culture and education Programme.<br><br> The group includes
              four-time Olympic gold medallist and 10-time Chinese women's diving
              champion Guo Jingjing, Moroccan middle-distance great Hicham
              El-Guerrouj, Russian swimming legend Alexander Popov and pole vault
              legend Sergey Bubka of Ukraine.<br><br> The Youth Olympics will feature 201 events across 26 sports and feature athletes aged between the ages of 14 and 18.</p>

              has given the Jamaican government its assurance to pay the
              US$550,000.00 needed to resurface the run-down Stadium East mondo track
              at the Independence Park Complex, according to the Jamaica Observer

              to sports minister Olivia Grange, the arrangement will see a few of
              Jamaica's top athletes, including triple World and Olympic gold
              medalist Usain Bolt, helping Singapore to market the Youth Olympics set
              for August 14<sup>th</sup> to 26<sup>th</sup> in 2010.</span></p>

              have been offered the funds, but we have to sign off on the
              arrangements," Grange said on Thursday. The estimate of US$550,000.00
              (or about J$49 million), was provided by Mondo America Incorporated.</span></p>

              Singapore, expense paid by Singapore, to consummate the arrangement,"
              said Grange, noting further that the delegation could make the trip by
              the end of October.</span></p>

              further added that "We have finalised the date with the other athletes,
              but we are awaiting a date from Usain (management team). I know they
              are interested and keen because Usain personally spoke with me about
              the track, saying we (the athletes) really can't train on the track
              because of the condition it's in, and Glen Mills also spoke with me
              about it." </span></p>

              <p>The supposed village suppose to house them was to be the NUS new town project at the previous warren golf country club, but its still under construction. It was scheduled for completion before the YOG games this year, but as you know usually construction projects of such large scale get their schedules screwed up. Take MBS and RWS for example, don't care even if the people in charge are NUS or their consultants.</p>
              <p>The new completion dateis scheduled for next year august, but there are some major milestones to meet at the end of this year and next march.</p>

              <p>Due to lack of public support for the Youth Olympic Games (YOG), the
              PAP regime has resorted to forcing Singapore students to “volunteer”
              for the event to generate fake grassroots support to save its own
              “face.”</p>
              <p>According to netizens, students from schools in Ang Mo Kio were
              “asked” to line the streets last Saturday to “welcome” the YOG torch
              before it arrived at Nanyang Polytechnic.</p>
              <p>One irate teacher, who wished to remain anonymous, wrote:</p>
              <p><em>“My school students are going to be made to stand around, under
              the 3pm-hot sun, to pretend that we support YOG. How is that fair? It
              is like as if we are a communist state – forcing the children to do
              something that is not only agaisnt their will, but it is also something
              that would not affect our lives greatly. If the students want to watch
              and support the YOG torch, they can watch it on their own! Why force
              the other students to fake support under the sun? 90% of the students
              in Singapore don’t even care about the YOG, and yet we are forced to
              pretend that we do.”</em></p>
              <p>Another student complained:</p>
              <p><strong>“I am from Temasek Poly and I am forced to take part in YOG.
              It is made so compulsory that in the event that i do not take part, I
              will not get a testimony at the end of my graduation. That is the most
              irritating thing right now.”</strong></p>
              <p>Not only are the YOG “volunteers” required to spend long hours doing
              “sai kang” (hokkien for shit work), they are also served “dog food”.</p>
              <p>One obviously peeved YOG “volunteer” sent us a photo of the food the volunteers were given:</p>
              <p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-28953" title="yogfood" src="http://www.temasekreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/yogfood.jpg" alt="yogfood" width="540" height="720"></p>
              <p><strong>“This is what I am eating everyday. Even my dog is fed better food!”</strong> she wrote.</p>
              <p>In the meantime, public anger over the YOG continues to boil over with nearly a thousand Singaporeans joining the “<a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Temasek-Review/190806675782?ref=ts#%21/group.php?gid=106184679437182&amp;ref=ts">I hate YOG</a>” Facebook to express their disgust and disdain for the PAP’s “vanity fair”.</p>
              <p>Have you been “volunteered” for the YOG? Please share with us your unpleasant experience here.</p>

              <p>They must have got cheapest of the three quote for the food catering.</p>
              <p>So, the food catering company have also learned to make lots of profits by maintaining a healthy diet for the volunteers.</p>
              <p>Since the food is FREE, the volunteers should NOT complain since the big boss have mentioned before that there is NO FREE LUNCH.</p>
