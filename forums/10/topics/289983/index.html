            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Higher ERP charges kick in but traffic still heavy on some roads</strong><br><br>Several changes were made to the Electronic Road Pricing system today.<br><br>Along the CTE, ERP charges went up and along the Bukit Timah expressway a new gantry is in place<br><br>However, the introduction of new gantries did not seem to ease this morning's massive traffic jam along the BKE.<br><br>It usually takes Madam Chuang an hour to drive from her home in Johore Bahru to her office in Singapore but today's congestion added a whole hour to her total travelling time.<br><br><span style="color: red;">"It took me almost 2 hours. That's because there was a heavy traffic jam along Woodlands Causeway, as well as BKE. Probably this is due to a lot of drivers like me who try to leave home a bit later so that we can avoid paying ERP".</span><br><br>Another driver, Madam Sutini was stuck in the same congestion.<br><br>The jam, she said, was terrible.<br><br><span style="color: red;">"Normally I travel from Jurong to Thompson and I leave home normally at 8.45, and I reach my office the latest by 9.15. Today I left at the same time, I reached at 9.45".</span><br><br>That is why some motorists feel that the ERP gantry at the BKE has not fulfilled its purpose - to ease traffic flow.<br><br>It has done nothing to clear the expressway of vehicles, says irate taxi driver, Mr Anba.<br><br>"Traffic - you can't clear. Especially that hour. All peak hours. People want to go to work, they rush. Once they have the ERP, only the price is going up, but the problem is not solved. The traffic jams are still there".<br><br>Motorists who purposely set out late to avoid paying ERP charges could be one of the causes of this jam but Mediacorp Radio's Traffic Watch says the massive bottleneck was more likely to be caused by three separate road accidents that occured within metres of one another.<br><br>One of the accidents took place on the BKE, near the satellite station at around 7.45 am.<br><br>A few minutes later, a vehicle pile-up occured on the PIE near the Stevens Road exit just down the road.<br><br>Traffic Watch says the congestion was cleared shortly after 9am.<br><br>While traffic was heavy along the BKE, the situation at Central Expressway was very different.<br><br>Unlike previous peak hours, driving on the CTE between 8.30 to 9 was a breeze this morning.<br><br>This could be due to the 50 cents increase in ERP charges.<br><br>Mr Chong, a taxi driver was very pleased with this development but he does not think this change will be permanent.<br><br>"I think they will come back. They still need the convenience travelling on the CTE".<br><br>A reminder to motorists travelling from the city towards Ang Mo Kio this evening:<br><br>A new gantry along the north-bound CTE just before the PIE exit will be operational today.<br><br>Evening ERP hours on the CTE are from 5.30pm to 10.30pm.<br><br>Also starting today are evening ERP charges on the east-bound ECP from 6pm to 8pm on weekdays.</div>
