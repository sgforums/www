              <p>HE had closed his popular Asian restaurant in the heart of Copenhagen's shopping district for a private birthday party - his own.</p>
              <p>But the birthday boy, Mr Roland Tan, 61, never got to celebrate on Monday night.</p>
              <p>The Singaporean, who's a Permanent Resident (PR) in Denmark, was shot in the shoulder as he stood at the bar of Restaurant Bali at Kongens Nytorv Square at around 7pm.</p>
              <table border="0" cellspacing="3" cellpadding="0" width="300" align="right">

              <p>He was described as the most powerful Chinese businessman in Denmark by Danish tabloid Ekstra Bladet.</p>
              <p>Mr Tan was not the only victim of the shooting.</p>
              <p>His relative, a 53-year-old Singaporean man who had flown to the Danish capital from Singapore last Saturday, was shot in the chest.</p>
              <p>He remains in a critical condition at the Rigshospitalet, where Mr Tan is also warded.</p>
              <p>The relative is believed to have gone to Copenhagen specially to attend Mr Tan's birthday party.</p>
              <p>Inspector Ove Dahl of the Copenhagen police told The New Paper yesterday that the shooting was over a 'personal matter' between the gunman and Mr Tan.</p>
              <p>He said the two Singaporeans were alone in the restaurant's dining area when the gunman shot them at point blank with a handgun.</p>
              <p>'They were standing at the bar when he fired four shots at them,' said Inspector Dahl.</p>
              <p>'By the time we arrived, they were already on their way to hospital.'</p>
              <p>He also said that the police found about six restaurant staff, including cooks and waiters, huddled in the kitchen.</p>
              <p>The Danish police have released the name and picture of the suspect, Mr Nguyen Phi Hung, 47.</p>
              <p>He has lived in Denmark 'almost all his life', Inspector Dahl said.</p>
              <p>He has a previous heroin-related conviction, for which he spent more than three years in jail.</p>
              <p>The gunman entered from the front of the restaurant - a small door that also functions as the exit.</p>
              <p>He was dressed in a yellow-hooded jumper and later fled along Little Kongensgade street, reported Politiken.</p>
              <p><strong>Rise in street shootings</strong></p>
              <p>Politiken reported that the shooting looked to have been an assassination attempt, and that there had been a brief exchange between the two men before the gunman fired the shots at Mr Tan and his relative.</p>
              <p>Mr Tan had previously been questioned by police in connection with several serious crimes, including drug dealing, blackmail and murder, according to Danish news reports.</p>
              <p>'We are looking for him (Mr Nguyen) and we will find him,' said Inspector Dahl.</p>
              <p>There has been an increase in street shootings in Copenhagen in recent months, Danish media reports said.</p>
              <p>Politiken reported in September that the street shootings appeared to be the result of a turf war between immigrant gangs and the Danish branch of the Hells Angels biker gang for control of the drug trade.</p>
              <p>The Hells Angels originated from the US and its operations in Denmark are based in Copenhagen. The Denmark group's activities revolve around drugs and prostitution.</p>
              <p>The New Paper understands that Hells Angels parties have been hosted at Mr Tan's restaurant, but it is not known if he has any connection with the gang.</p>
              <strong>
              <p>Inspector Dahl said that Mr Tan was likely to be discharged in a few days.</p>
              </strong>
              <p>But his relative was in 'a very bad condition and is in a coma'.</p>
              <p>Danish media reported that both men remain under police protection but Inspector Dahl refuted the reports.</p>
              <p>'No, the police are not guarding them anymore,' he said.</p>
              <p>Danish media also reported that about 40 young people turned up at the hospital on Monday night after the two men were admitted.</p>
              <p>It is not known who the visitors are, though it is understood they were there to support Mr Tan.</p>
              <p>Mr Tan, who has lived in Denmark for about 30 to 40 years, is believed to be married with children, said Inspector Dahl.</p>
              <p>Apart from Restaurant Bali, a mid-priced restaurant serving Indonesian and Malaysian food, he also owns a few other restaurants in Copenhagen.</p>
              <p>According to a travel website , the restaurant specialises in spicy food such as curries and its signature dish is Peking duck.</p>
              <p>The website also advised restaurant patrons to be dressed in business attire.</p>
              <p>The 50-seater restaurant is located at the end of one of Copenhagen's main shopping streets.</p>
              <p>The New Paper understands that the restaurant has been there for at least 20 years.</p>
              <p>It has hosted events by the Malaysian-Danish Association there.</p>
              <p>Mr Tan is also a frequent sponsor of the association.</p>
              <p><strong>Shocked</strong></p>
              <p>Mrs Rozita Buang Andersen, president of the Denmark Singapore Club there, told The New Paper that she and her Singaporean friends were shocked when they heard news of the shooting.</p>
              <p>'I was just there recently as I was scouting for a venue to hold our club's Chinese New Year celebration,' she said.</p>
              <p>'On Sunday, I was discussing the restaurant with one of my friends, who told me that the owner is a Singaporean,' she added.</p>
              <p>The club decided not to hold its celebration there because the restaurant does not serve Chinese dim sum, which the club's executive committee prefers.</p>
              <p>She said the restaurant is in a busy downtown area that is equivalent to Orchard Road in Singapore.</p>
