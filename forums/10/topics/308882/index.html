              <p><strong>NO HOLIDAYS <br>NO CABLE TV <br>NO INTERNET<br> <br>NO CHOICE  <br>Incomes are increasing, but not always fast enough to make up for the rising cost of living. Today, we find out how a 3-room flat family copes <br>By Genevieve Jiang <br>February 26, 2008</strong>       <br> <br>TO keep up with the rising cost of living, Mr Sunil Sharma has been working overtime for the past five months to earn extra income. <br>  <br>The 40-year-old office assistant at a despatch company used to earn about $1,000 every month.</p>
              <p>But now, with overtime pay, he can earn up to $1,500.</p>
              <p>To save money, Mr Sunil and his family have been cutting down on indulgences such as family holidays, shopping trips and meals out.</p>
              <p>Despite belt-tightening measures, the family still owes close to $300 in utility bills and about $130 in town council conservancy charges.</p>
              <p>Mr Sunil said: 'Most of my pay goes to daily expenses and we have little savings.'</p>
              <p>His wife, Mrs Kiran Sharma, 45, is a housewife.</p>
              <p>The couple and their 14-year-old son Jaikishen live in a three-room flat in Bedok. The bulk of Mr Sunil's pay is spent on his son.</p>
              <p>Although the boy has been getting a $800 bursary for the past four years from the Southeast Community Development Council, the family spends another $300 on Hindi lessons, which Jaikishen attends on weekends.</p>
              <p>The teenager also gets a weekday allowance of $6, which comes up to $120 monthly.</p>
              <p>Previously, Mr Sunil also spent $200 on tuition fees, but starting this year, he decided to rely just on free remedial lessons after school.</p>
              <p>Mr Sunil said: 'We've decided to cut back because his grades seem to be improving. If he slips, I'll have to find some way to make sure he gets extra help.'</p>
              <p>With the latest Budget changes, the family will get some help in the form of Goods and Services Tax Credits, amounting to about $500 in total. They also get a one-off $800 grant from welfare organisation Family Life Centre.</p>
              <p>However, there are some expenses that have gone up inevitably.</p>
              <p>Previously, when Jaikishen was in Bedok Green Primary School, he was able to walk to and from school. Now, he has to take a bus every day to Bedok Green Secondary.</p>
              <p>Transport comes up to between $30 and $40 every month.</p>
              <p>The couple has a 11-year-old daughter, who has been living in India with Mr Sunil's parents.</p>
              <p>CAN'T COPE FINANCIALLY</p>
              <p>They sent her away when she was born because they couldn't cope financially then.</p>
              <p>These days, Mr Sunil sends between $2,000 and $3,000 a year to India for her education and living expenses.</p>
              <p>Jaikishen was diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder when he was in Primary 1, but he goes for free medical checkups every three months at the Child Guidance Clinic.</p>
              <p>Indulgences for the family are few.</p>
              <p>Previously, they would visit relatives in India and Indonesia at least four times a year. Last year, there were no family holidays.</p>
              <p>They used to treat Jaikishen to meals at nearby fast-food joints at least two to three times a week. They have since been reduced to once a week.</p>
              <p>Mrs Kiran's shopping budget at the nearby town centre has also been cut from about $50 a month to $20.</p>
              <p>She said: 'Previously, I would buy Revlon makeup, and some clothes and shoes. But now, I try not to buy makeup at all. I also count on hand-me-downs from Jaikishen's cousins, so he doesn't need to buy new clothes.'</p>
              <p>She used to enjoy occasional massages which cost her about $40 per session, but that, too, had to go.</p>
              <p>And while she would previously spend up to $30 a week on lottery, she now spends only $3 a week.</p>
              <p>This is to make up for more money spent on their son's transport and daily groceries.</p>
              <p>While food would previously cost them at most $200 a month, it now costs up to $300.</p>
              <p>And utility bills have gone up from about $60 to $80.</p>
              <p>The family doesn't subscribe to cable TV, nor the Internet.</p>
              <p>Jaikishen was given a handphone early last year, but his subscription plan was reduced to a cheaper one this year.</p>
              <p>Mr Sunil said: 'He had previously abused the service by subscribing to various games without my knowledge. He even made overseas calls to his cousins in Indonesia.</p>
              <p>'I was shocked when I got the bill of more than $300. It was because of his bills that we couldn't pay our utilities and the town council.'</p>
              <p>So starting this year, Jaikishen is on a basic mobile plan which allows only incoming calls.</p>
              <p>Mrs Kiran, who studied up to Secondary 3, said she is now considering taking up courses so that she can return to work when Jaikishen is older.</p>
              <p>She said: 'It's hard on my husband supporting the family alone, but at this point, we want to be around for my son.</p>
              <p>'Once he's more mature and independent, I'll try to return to work.'<br> <br> </p>

              <p>solution:</p>
              <p>- minimum wages.</p>
              <p>- scrap tv license.</p>
              <p>- cut off absolutely all sort of luxury stuffs; hp, cable tv.</p>
              <p>- scrap overseas travel. no $$$, still want to travel?!</p>
              <p>- rent out 1 room. about $400/mth</p>
              <p>- do day care of other people's children. another $300/mth.</p>
              <p>- promote cottage industry. i used to help my mom to sew those clothings while in pri 3. damn thing was 1 piece for 1 frigging cent!</p>

              <p>I have that experience, growing up. My parents had 3 children, I was the one not too smart type. My mother not educated, everything depended on my father, didn't speak english. I know what is it like. For that I am proud of my parents and are always grateful to them.</p>
              <p>The problem is the title of this thread "LIfe in First World SG", and the TS is one whose only aim in this forum is to run down SG. Apparently he build his happiness on any misfortune of SG or Singaporean. It is good to let him know that as standard of Singapore goes up, expectation of basic necessities has also gone up. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"></p>
