            <div class='col-md body'>their pay in their original jobs are also around this level what...so its not that they change job and get a pay boost, please remember. Similar to MP's pay, most MPs are doctors, professors, CEOs, etc....so switching jobs should give about the same pay too...like opportunity costs in ECONS.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>For CEOs in private sector to get that kind of salaries, many of them are simply bosses who got their own directors to approve the highest possible salaries to themselves to avoid overpaying the taxes. To earn that kind of monies like the ministers are paid $1,500,000.00 - S$1,900,000.00 and a lifetime annuities of about S$1,000,000.00 pa the businesses would have to make huge profits in hundreds of millions. Taking into consideration the lifelong annuities the ministers are easily paid S$2,000,000 - $3,000,000.00. Ask anyone in the private sector this question: how many of such companies can afford to pay their CEO this kind of monies except the MNCs and GLCs who are relying on public monies for such purpose of which monies is no object.<br><br>Do anyone of our ministers have tracked records of building up MNCs like Toyota or GM to be truly entitled to this kind of salaries based on substantiated previous companies they were working for before they became the ministers.<br><br>After these ministers left the government and took up jobs in the private sector (not GLCs please which is public funded using tax payers monies) have any of these ministers succeeded in turning around ailing MNCs or public listed companies which were not doing well to prove the point that they were highly capable people as presented by MM Lee in Parliament?<br><br>There was one of two ex-ministers who after leaving the government was struggling without any headway. So how could the ministers be worth millions if none of them in reality was able to make this kind of money as they are paid. Is it right legally and morally to propose their own pay increases or bonuses under the general company laws or penal code without the sanction by an independent body of some sort in the first place.<br><br>If these questions cannot be answered truthfully objectively and accountably how could they have the legal or moral authority to lead the people or look after the interests or welfare of the citizens.</div>

Even after he lost the lawsuit, if he and the board do not resign by themselves,  just keep the post for a few months,  do not allow new member enter the board, the other corrupt issues will never be public, am I right? in my memory, until the day he innitially resign,  he still sit side by side with a minister, correct me if I am wrong.<br><br>I think Mr. Clinton should migrate to Singapore,  if he live here,  the Lewinsky case will never be uncovered, am I right?
