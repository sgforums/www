It's all supply and demand<br><br>But the Kangaroo rt, defintely it has to stop at SEA<br><br>As for ports, Dubai isn't going to make much inroads against SG... It itself is already facing compeition from Oman's port of Salalah... Salalah is actually nearer to the shipping rt...

But the only unfortunate result of the gantry system is the 'bunching up' effect of traffic at the critical times and our brilliant govt's follow-up to introduce <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>MORE GANTRIES </strong></span>to address the bunching up effect.<br><br>In short, their only solution to any problem is to make you pay...and pay more and more and more and more....<br><br>None of them have yet to suggest a solution that does NOT involve pumping in ridiculous amounts of money or make the people pay to support it.</div>

Have you strolled along East Coast park on weekends by the beach? Have you visited the average hawker center during a peak hour period?<br><br>It seems you have not witnessed drivers blatantly tossing their still lit cigarette butts out of the driver's window, nor the open littering of tissue paper in plain view of the 'no-littering' sign.<br><br>Before you offer the govt another 'pat on the back', check whether people actually do strap themselves in at the back, or whether people still pirate movies and music from bit torrent, in direct contravention of SG copyright laws.<br><br>And before you even claim SG is relatively crime free, review the last two years on serious crime in the country, and you will notice it has actually spiked. It does not appear the police are doing a good enough job in a small enough country. Maybe they are sufficiently burdened by protocol and red tape...Oh did you also know they require a magistrate's court to authorize them to carry out an investigation when someone is beaten up by a gang &gt;4 ? Penal section 323 for your reference.</div>
