            <div class='col-md body'>PTP records 2.24m TEU in first half-year<br>EYEFORTRANSPORT - August 11, 2006<br><br>PTP chief executive officer, En Harun Hj Johari, said the increase in container throughput was partly due to the integration of Maersk &amp; P&amp;O Nedlloyd, which has brought about new services at PTP, and the continuous growth by Evergreen Marine Corp. This has also resulted in an increase in PTPÂ’s global connectivity to 70 weekly services throughout the world.<br><br>Harun said that the increase in connectivity will further enhance PTPÂ’s position as a transhipment hub.<br><br>He said that development for phase 2 of the terminal expansion is ongoing and according to schedule. Berth 9 is currently being commissioned, whilst berth 10 will be ready by end of August 2006. The completion of berths 9 &amp; 10 will increase PTPÂ’s annual handling capacity to 8 million TEU.<br><br>PTP has recently purchased eight super post panamax quay cranes, three of which are currently being commissioned and will be operational by end of the year; the remaining five are to be delivered in stages next year. PTPÂ’s crane productivity stands at average of 33 moves per hour, which is the highest in the region and way above the industry average.<br><br>According to Harun, development of PTPÂ’s free zone is also progressing well, and plans are currently in place to further develop PTPÂ’s Free Zone land in tandem with the demand shown by interested parties.<br><br>Harun remarked that shipping lines are already considering alternative routes because most ports in the world constantly face congestion and capacity constraints.<br><br>Harun pointed out that PTP has available excess capacity, and also has the capacity and ability to handle the new breed of 10,000+ TEU vessels.<br><br></div>
