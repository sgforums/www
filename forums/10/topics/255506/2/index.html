            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by oxford mushroom:<strong><br>haha...GCT and LKY were once chiefs of PAP...they don't have to leave and start a new party, do they? Very telling of the quality of WP leaders and the disunity within the Party. First, resignations by new WP leaders over the internet, now this.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> </strong></blockquote><span style="color: darkred;">Is the WP the only political party that saw its party disintegrate ?<br><br>It was very convenient and easy for you to be dishonest - in your usual characteristic way - with your preferred skewed view of Singapore's political history that are twisted to favor your Political Master.<br><br>The Ruling Party was disintegrated when the other Party Members split along the lines that divided those who were locally educated and Mandarin speaking, and those who were educated overseas and English speaking.<br><br>The disintegration of the PAP saw the birth of the Barisan Sosialist under Dr Lee Siew Choh in the early 1960s, and another disintegration saw Singapore under PAP being kicked out of Malaysia, with its DAP Malaysian branch being separated in all political relationship.<br><br>Another fact that was not observed and just as telling is the fact that -<br><br>if LHL was not diagnosed for his cancer, GCT would never had the opportunity to win the trust from LKY - to relinquish the Secretary-General position to GCT.<br><br>When GCT took over as PM from LKY, GCT did not automatically takeover the Party Sec-Gen position; and when LKY was asked by the Foreign Press if he had given away too much power by relinquishing the PM position - LKY replied that <strong><span style="font-style: italic;">"he maybe the PM, but I am the Party Secretary-General... " </span></strong>.<br><br>This itself is even more telling of the mistrust of LKY towards his own inner circle, that he has to maintain his grip on political power.<br><br>It is even more telling that when LHL took over as PM, the Party Secretary-General position was immediately relinquished by GCT - all under the watchful eye of the Old Man himself.<br><br>The mistrust within the Ruling Party continues, with the continued powers of LKY as a Minister Mentor, allowing LKY to continue as the Guardian of Singapore's Politics, as well as to retain the Chair in GIC.<br><br>There are more that our eyes and minds are allowed to know - for the continued existence and insistence of LKY in his mid-80s to continue being involved in managing the Singapore Reserves, as well as in all spheres of Singapore Politics - (that covers wages to Ministers, to SIA Pilots, to workers' employment contracts, to family life, to marriages, etc).<br><br>Can we blame LKY for his deep mistrust when we have incapable PhD, who think with a hollowed out brain, and can only indulge in petty politics ?<br></span><br><blockquote>Originally posted by oxford mushroom:<strong><br>haha...what else to expect from losers like Atobe?

Lke the cantonese would say, "No eyes to see" <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> </strong></blockquote><span style="color: darkred;">When you have "No eyes to see" - what can you learn, and without learning anything, how can you speak with anything from your brain ?<br><br>No wonder you prefer to be a mushroom - there is a saying in Hokkien - <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>'Kay Kiang... " - "trying to be smart "</strong></span> .<br><br>Unfortunately, losers are those who pretend to be bigger than what they are capable of, as what we have seen in this Speaker's Corner.<br><br>What else can we expect from a useless mushroom, but to spit poison at the efforts of strengthening and building a credible Alternative Political Force ?<br><br>Can we expect you to be generous towards the efforts made by the Alternative Political Force, when it is clear that your declaration of not being supportive of the politics from the Ruling Party is nothing but more of your characteristic dishonesty ?<br><br>JBJ's decision not to return to the Workers' Party is a reflection of his generous character towards a Party that he has not guided since he became a bankrupt; and with the party in the capable hands of Low Thia Kiang and Sylvia Lim, why will he want to usurp powers from these two persons by returning to the Workers' Party ?<br><br>Why will he want to ignite an internal power struggle, and cause further fractures or widen the fault lines that have characterised the Alternative Political Parties since the 1950s ?<br><br>Were you showing your dishonest self again by short changing the Cantonese in quoting them short with  "No eyes to see" ?<br><br>Did you not know that the Cantonese also have the saying -<br>"Heaven have eyes" .... ?<br></span><br><br></div>
