Btw, i skate regularly in East coast park.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Actually there are several organisation in Singapore who are managing groups of us using Malaysian tracks (sepang and PG).  SMSA also organises mini 'races/rallies' in Kallang and sometimes in Marina south (in car parks due to lack of a proper track).  Basic organisational structure is already in place.  A semi-private group is even willing to fund, build and manage a FIA approved track in Tuas.  Unfortunately, due to high land cost demand by JTC (to the tune of $100K/mth) puts the project on hold.<br><br>There is no question motorsports is an expensive affair.  However, it is interesting to note a race car can cost alot less than a regular car that we drive on SG roads.  Race cars are not taxable, no COE, no road tax.  Thus, you can buy a track car from as little as $5k and have lots of fun in it.<br><br>For those who like to know more, click <a href="http://angmohbeng.multiply.com/journal/item/4" rel="nofollow">http://angmohbeng.multiply.com/journal/item/4</a></div></blockquote>Ahh..thats a good idea.. and a very interesting link u have there... thanks!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

Real racers are much safer than your average driver on the road..<br><br>So the right thing for your PAPa to do is to build a proper race track and make these wannabe real racers.</div></blockquote>Racing glamourizes a lifestyle which the young wants to emulate but cannot afford. If we do F1 races here, the police will need to step up enforcement actions and we should increase the penalties for speeding. Those who participate in illegal races should have theor licenses suspended indefinitely. They are a menace to society.<br><br>The plan now is to do a dry run with a race in August to celebrate National Day. That will give us the experience with hosting such an event, highlight problems and assess the disruption. According to the Straits Times, downtown will have to be closed for almost a week. However, the average costs of hosting the event is about USD35m whilst the returns are in excess of USD100m. Most F1 races are conducted in racetracks and Monaco which hosts street races does not have a big financial sector like us, so there is some uncertainty as to the profit margins for Singapore.<br><br>However, if we stand to gain USD100m for an outlay of USD35million for an event that takes a week, I think that is worth it.</div>
