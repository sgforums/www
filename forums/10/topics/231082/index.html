            <div class='col-md body'>Singapore set to join F1 family<br><br>From correspondents in Singapore<br>January 12, 2007<br><br>AFP - FORMULA One supremo Bernie Ecclestone is in talks with at least two Singaporean groups to host a grand prix around the streets of the city-state as early as next year, a report said today.<br><br>In preparation, Hermann Tilke, the German architect who designed the circuits at Sepang in Malaysia, Manama in Bahrain, Istanbul and Shanghai, has designed one for Singapore, the Today newspaper said.<br><br>It said the talks with Ecclestone, the powerful commercial rights holder of Formula One, were spearheaded by a prominent, but reclusive, local business czar who was prepared to back the venture.<br><br>"Yes, we have been talking to various parties about a race in Singapore but as it is, nothing has been firmed up yet," Ecclestone was quoted as saying.<br><br>"When we have something, you will definitely know about it."<br><br>The cost of hosting a race in Singapore would be at least $50 million , but the returns have proven to be vastly more in tourism receipts.<br><br>Singapore's wide streets are seen as ideal for hosting a race and it would mean no expense on building a circuit.<br><br>Last year Max Mosley, president of the Federation Internationale de l'Automobile, said Singapore would be a welcome addition to the calendar.<br><br>"Singapore is a vibrant business region with a huge motor sport fan base and it would be a welcome addition to the sport," Mosley said.<br><br>A source told the newspaper that talks between the unnamed business czar and Ecclestone were at an advanced stage, but another party has since come into the picture.<br><br>"We were close, 99 per cent there with Ecclestone," the source said. "We can't afford to miss the boat again because Singapore may not be given another chance to host Formula One."<br><br>Mosley and Ecclestone have been working to move more grand prix around the world and away from their traditional European roots, and Asia is in their sights.<br><br>China is now on the calendar, as is Malaysia, Japan and Australia, while South Korea last year signed a contract to stage a race in Yeongam county for a seven-year period starting in 2010.<br><br>Agence France-Presse<br><br><a href="http://www.foxsports.com.au/story/0,8659,21048414-23770,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.foxsports.com.au/story/0,8659,21048414-23770,00.html</a></div>

But i believe since its usually held over the weekend, we can do something like Monte Carlo track, past Esplande down Marina like how the route for Big Walk.  You have the waterfront track (along Esplande).  But I doubt the track will go into Orchard due to weekend traffic.  Maybe can go into housing estate, racing along the straight stretch of Lim Chu Kang road will be fun, like the home stretch like that....<br><br>wow, exciting - hopefully they don't price the tickets higher than Sepang...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>As I said, I am not convinced that there is a business case for holding F1 motor racing in Singapore and certainly I haven't seen a detailed impact analysis on the adverse effects on traffic and ordinary economic activity.

A large part of F1 racing proceeds come from ticket sales. How are you going to charge if the race is on public roads? What about the noise it generates? Public roads run through residential areas in land-scarce Singapore. Why should ordinary citizens be subject to unnecessary noise pollution? You do not just close the road once for the big race.

            <div class='col-md body'>actually I wouldn't read too much into yesterday's triumph against Laos.  Its not against strong opponents.  Lets see we carve out a win against Indonesia and stronger foes like Thailand or even arch-rivals - Malaysia, thump them soundly 3-0 or 4-0 to really see the strength.  Of course, this victory will boost confidence but we have seen from past, the Lions needs more consistency.<br><br>Back to the Formula 1, I think we 'missed the boat' previously because we deemed racing as a vice and it will encourage youngster to speed and all the negative influence.  But I think we are forced to changed, otherwise we won't be building casinos in town.  Compared to racing, I think the vice of gambling is more severe and detrimental, yet the government has no choice but to proceed.  Its becoming like "either you join us or you get left behind".<br><br>Unfortunately, this world today is driven purely by economics, things like noise pollution or inconveniences to residents has taken a backseat.  The race is going to held on weekends in CBD, which ordinarily, is empty or half dead on weekends.  Inconveniences are secondary, as seen from the IMF meeting.</div>

Funny thing is that I never even suffer a cut from track driving since i started in 1995.<br><br>Actually there are several organisation in Singapore who are managing groups of us using Malaysian tracks (sepang and PG).  SMSA (Singapore Motor Sports Association) also organises mini 'races/rallies' in Kallang and sometimes in Marina south (in car parks due to lack of a proper track).  Basic organisational structure is already in place.  A semi-private group is even willing to fund, build and manage a FIA approved track in Tuas.  Unfortunately, due to high land cost demand by JTC (to the tune of $100K/mth) puts the project on hold.<br><br>There is no question motorsports is an expensive affair.  However, it is interesting to note a race car can cost alot less than a regular car that we drive on SG roads.  Race cars are not taxable, no COE, no road tax.  Thus, you can buy a track car from as little as $5k and have lots of fun in it.<br><br>For those who like to know more, click <a href="http://angmohbeng.multiply.com/journal/item/4" rel="nofollow">http://angmohbeng.multiply.com/journal/item/4</a></div>
