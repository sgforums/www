In the most extensive answer to date on online electioneering, Dr Balaji Sadasivan noted that streaming of 'explicit political content' by political parties or individuals is banned under election advertising rules set in 2001. He also had news for bloggers: They can discuss politics, but will have to register their sites if they consistently espouse a political line." The unconstitutional ban on podcasting had affected the campaign of the opposition and thus affecting the outcome of voting.<br><br>why litat..ban this ban that gg la</div>

When the Universal Declaration of Human Rights speaks of suffrage as universal, it means all citizens of a given state, who are not reasonably restricted by law, have the right to vote. A primary concern of the right of suffrage is participation and international norms favour expanding rather than restricting this right.<br><br>Principle of non-discrimination<br><br>Hence, Singaporeans who have no direct or indirect affiliation with the government staying overseas and are not allowed to vote are arbitrarily denied a basic human right. This violates the principle of non-discrimination in the treatment of votersÂ’ eligibility, which is an essential characteristic of a free and fair election.<br><br>Some jurisdictions/democracies (India, Taiwan, Chile) do not grant their citizens residing outside the country voting rights. There are two basic reasons for this.<br><br>First, the setting up of systems and procedures on how the overseas citizens can vote on election day is in itself an administrative nightmare to the electoral body. Then there is the difficulty of designating the electoral district/constituency to which the votes will be assigned. Both reasons may not apply to Singapore. It is a known fact that the technological advance of Singapore is the envy of its Asian neighbours. Hence, setting up systems for overseas voting that will cover all Singaporeans should not pose any problem.<br><br>Secondly, the city/state has a limited number of districts/constituencies (23 SMCs and GRCs), unlike India, which is the biggest democracy in the world. Again, designating the district of an overseas voter should not present any problem given SingaporeÂ’s level of technological sophistication.<br><br>Some countries have certain restrictions on overseas voting but these restrictions are not on the right of citizens to vote. The restrictions are on their participation in a given election. France and the Philippines for instance, allow their overseas citizens to vote in some elections (national elections as against local elections) or for some positions (national versus local constituency). This avoids the difficulty of designating specific constituencies for the overseas votes.<br><br>Singapore restricts the rights of certain voters; the two examples cited restrict the type of election and the position to be voted upon. The former violates the basic principle of equality before the law and therefore discriminatory. The other two do not.<br><br>Discouraging support<br><br>The provisions of the Parliamentary Election Act that defines overseas voting is not only discriminatory to the overseas citizens but denies the political contestants who do not belong to the PeopleÂ’s Action Party a level playing field. Voting rights to overseas Singaporeans are limited to those with ties or affiliations with the government.<br><br>The PAP has been the dominant party - a virtual hegemony - since Singapore became independent. Those allowed to vote, since they are overseas by reason of their ties to the government are presumed if not expected to vote for the PAP. This certainly places the other parties at a distinct disadvantage.<br><br>The restriction on overseas voting to Singaporeans with ties to the government tends to confirm the perception that the PAP as the ruling party, has thrown at the opposition every possible obstacle to grow and develop as viable parties.<br><br>Too often changes in policies have almost always made it more difficult for opponents of the PAP to compete. The provision of block voting for the Group Representation Constituencies, the redrawing of political districts, and now the discriminatory provision of the overseas voting, all tend to confirm the impression that indeed the PAP has done everything to discourage support for the opposition.<br><br>The graduate student in Vancouver, Canada has a legitimate grievance in that the law is discriminatory. Hence, either the law allows all overseas citizens the right to vote or confine the right of suffrage only to citizens residing in the country. This is equality before the law!<br><br>DAMASAO G MAGBUAL is attached to the Bangkok-based Asian Network for Free Elections (Anfrel).<br></div>

You sound - pardon me for being rude, which I usually aren't - like a bloody foghorn sounding at night. Firstly, recently, there have been quite a no. of complaints of how the legal system is biased toward the prosecutor, in this cas the Father and the Son. I don't doubt Ravi would have asked for an adjournment, it's juz tt the ST didn't report THAT fact; ST never tells the complete truth on local affairs. And if he didn't, it's probably because he wasn't informed of teh date until the eleventh hour. SO you can't really blame the poor lawyer.<br><br>And regarding PAP, LKY fought in a clean manner? Oh, pls give a break. Stop reading those triumphalist local histories, including the Great Man's memoirs, and search for sth a little more objective, such as the DIscovery Channel documentary. LKY ditched his supporters - the Commies - when it suited him to do so. He had manipulated them to win support of the Chinese-ed people, then he threw them out when he decided to throw his cushions in with the Brits, whom our school history syllabi have enjoyed derogating for years. CSJ follows the rules, no matter how sparingly; it's the PAP-established system that violates the Constitution.<br><br>Lol, Mr Lionniosy, you are really becoming headache in this forum. You are so lucky that people here are much milder (except ATOBE) than those in Sintercom, which I remember you were there. You aren't going to find much support for your fanatic pro-PAP views here, man. SGForums is not YP BBs. I would advise you, please moderate your sentiment, and engage in more fruitful discussion.<br><br>Cheers,<br>the (dissappointed) pikamaster</div>

Devan Nair wrote in  1994:<br><br>quote<br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><strong><a href="http://policestate.blogspot.com/2004/07/lee-kuan-yews-betrayal-of-pap-and.html" rel="nofollow">[quote]Indeed, my fellow detainees and I had as legal counsel a brilliant lawyer and vocal freedom-fighter by the name of Lee Kuan Yew</a></strong>, who has publicly borne witness to the comfortable circumstances in which we lived under detention, and how he was able to visit us, without supervision, to discuss, among other things, strategies for bringing the colonial rule of our jailers to an end.<br><br>After the statutory period of 21 days' solitary confinement, my fellow detainees and I were allowed to live together in camp conditions, whether in Changi or, even better, on salubrious St. John's Island. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Our lawyer, Lee Kuan Yew, was freely allowed to visit and talk to us, without Special Branch supervision, and to plan with us the downfall of the British colonial power.</span> So free were we as political detainees to pursue our own interests and studies that we light-heartedly referred to our places of detention as "St. John's" University and "Changi" University.<br><br>4. <strong><a href="http://www.hsse.nie.edu.sg/staff/kahack/cc%205.3.1%20%20(PAP).htm" rel="nofollow">Lee was central to this combination, since his work representing unions and radical students had provided a bridge</a></strong>. This work had rapidly increased in 1954 to 1955. This work included helping:<br><br>Â·        leftwing (see below) students who had been arrested in May 1954 because of their protest against National Service<br><br>Â·        University of Malaya socialists accused of publishing Â‘seditiousÂ’ Fajar article, and<br><br>Â·        legal advice for leftwing unions such as the Singapore Bus Workers Union.<br>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>5.u think Special Branch or the Government  then dunt want LKY<br>disappear or caught him making mistakes?or course they wanted.<br>all communist or their supporter,incl LKY,must be kept under<br>control.<br><br>LKY,unlike mr Ravi,fought for his clients carefully.what<br>would happened to LKY if SP knew his activities,plotted to<br>overthrow the government?LKY just settle in Mount Pleasant<br>for good if he get caught.No joke.<br><br>Unlike Mr Ravi in 2006,just write a letter to AG,cc media,if he made<br>a mistake. </blockquote><span style="color: darkred;">To be fair to Mr Devan Nair, perhaps you could also have quoted the following :</span><br><blockquote><br><a href="http://www.singapore-window.org/sw99/90329gm.htm" rel="nofollow"><strong>Former President criticise suppression of dissent</strong></a><br><br><span style="color: blue;">But as Singapore grew prosperous and stable and the communist threat faded, Mr Nair began to have doubts about his captain's iron-fisted methods. Perhaps sensing his ally's doubts, Mr Lee asked Mr Nair to leave his power base as head of the trade union congress and move into the presidential palace. As Mr Nair puts it, "He kicked me upstairs."<br><br>Being president, he says now, was "the silliest job in the world. All you had to do was cut ribbons." His frustration grew.<br><br>But before he could speak out, Mr Nair found himself at the centre of a rumour-mongering campaign that labelled him a drinker and womanizer. He says he was neither, and he suspects that Mr Lee had government doctors slip him hallucinatory drugs to make him appear befuddled. "Lee Kuan Yew decided: This man is going to be a threat, so I'd better begin a total demolishment of his character. He's very good at that."<br><br>Why didn't Mr Nair challenge his leader at the time? That question has haunted him ever since. "I was prone to hero worship and he was our captain," he says, lowering his head. "Even when I began to feel uneasy, loyalty to the captain superseded all other feelings. That was my weakness."<br><br>Mr Nair is not bitter. He gives Mr Lee credit for making Singapore a wealthy, stable place, an accomplishment in which he is proud to have shared.<br><br><strong>But how much greater that accomplishment would be if Singapore were a wealthy stable democracy. To him, </strong></span><strong><span style="color: red;">Singapore today is a soulless place whose only ideology is materialism</span>.<span style="color: blue;"> Whether he could have changed that, Mr Nair wishes now he had spoken up earlier</span></strong></blockquote><span style="color: darkred;">MM LKY seems to have a colorful history of working with partners and dumping them after they are no longer of any use.<br><br>Where could LKY picked up such ruthless leadership ideology, other then his admitted admiration while working as an interpreter for the Japanese Imperial Army during WW-2 ? Is it amazing to learn of the common thread that bind LKY so closely to a trusted <a href="http://www.sfdonline.org/Link%20Pages/Link%20Folders/DearSingaporean/1999/nathan.html" rel="nofollow"><strong>SR Nathan</strong></a> - who performed so well in the ISD ?<br><br>With the British, LKY was working with the Left Wing PAP members to gain the support of the larger Chinese educated population, while at the same time plotting with the British Special Branch to have these men arrested.<br><br>Do we need younger Singaporeans like Ravi to learn from such a Mentor ?</span><br><blockquote><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">u think ur grand/parents voted for pap for no reasons or<br>just voted for oppositions?<br><br>LKY and his commrades hv done many things.read more<br>lah.<br><br></span>yes,i am pro pap.i just support party which have done good<br>for sg or the party show it will do good for sg.<br>u can call me running dog of pap etc.<br>but i and my kids just hope to be running dogs of<br>stable lifes. </blockquote><span style="color: darkred;">Yes, LKY and his comrades - Devan Nair included - have certainly done many things; and here is an admission of two who have served as LKY's faithful <a href="http://www.stoneforest.org/sociology/tocatchatartar.html" rel="nofollow"><strong>Servants</strong></a>, before finding themselves at the other ends of the ropes held by LKY.<br><br>Is the <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/1507" rel="nofollow"><strong>Singapore Way</strong></a> so unique and a creation of MM LKY's thinking, or is a left-over from the Colonial Past, which we are supposed to have freed ourselves from since Independence ? Could we have gone to a higher level of political, social and economic development - if we allowed ourselves the opportunity to Freedom ?<br><br>Back in 1979, others in the <a href="http://www.wp.org.sg/news/news_articles/pap_socialistint.htm" rel="nofollow"><strong>International Community</strong></a> - whom we had proudly identified ourselves with - have seen the shortcomings of the POWER OF ONE, and have decided to expel us. In the usual calculated way, in order to pre-empt local public discussion, the situation was cleverly turn around to make ourselves look better then the real outcome.<br><br>Singaporeans were told a convenient 'white lie', and the lie continues.<br><br>Dogs are supposed to be intelligent animals, well trained, and can even attend to the needs of the handicapped.<br><br>What use are a pack of dogs that run aimlessly at useless commands to entertain the Master's Voice ?</span><br></div>
