The cabin most likely first class or business class. What happened to the paying passengers who had to give up the seats?<br>Also wonder if the economy class seats were also empty of passengers just to bring one patient home?<br>ItÂ’s quite a substantial loss of income even for one way flight, isnÂ’t it?<br>And why didnÂ’t transfer to private hospital in London when doctors suggested she stay for 3 weeks. Flying is risky for stroke patients. Private hospitals in London too expensive? Or issit treatment in Singapore is paid by the employer as medical benefit?<br>I remember another occasion when a plane was empty of cargo just to bring 2 giant pandas from China to Washington DC, accompanied by veterinarians, scientists and technicians just to monitor the animalsÂ’ condition during the trip.<br>But giant pandas are rare and endangered species, so itÂ’s appropriate to accord that kind of VIP treatment but humans are not endangered species leh.<br><br></div>
