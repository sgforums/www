They are accused of publishing allegedly defamatory remarks in their party newsletter, The New Democrat. The two People's Action Party (PAP) leaders had applied for a summary judgment, which allows the court to reach a verdict without open trial.<br>.<br>Yesterday, Mr Ravi was to challenge the legitimacy of a summary judgment in a defamation suit. After that, Justice Woo was to hear the application made by the PAP leaders.<br>.<br>Instead, after about an hour, Principal Senior State Counsel Jeffrey Chan, who was representing the Attorney General's Chambers, emerged from the closed-door session and said that Justice Woo had decided to disqualify himself, to avoid any perception of bias.<br>.<br>"It was the first time a judge has disqualified himself in my years of experience," said Mr Chan. He added: "We were quite surprised. I never expected the application to be made. Usually, application for the judge to be disqualified is based on bias against the litigant and not the solicitor."<br>.<br>In 2003, Mr Ravi was representing convicted drug trafficker Vignes Mourthi, 22, who had been sentenced to death and had exhausted all avenues of appeal. Despite that, Mr Ravi sought a retrial and insisted on arguing even after the judge explained the case had run its course. He also sat down while the judge was taking notes.<br>.<br>"I find your conduct improper and I have to make a complaint to the Law Society," Justice Woo told him then.<br>.<br>To that, Mr Ravi had replied:<strong> "I have no fears ... I am migrating to Australia next month." Mr Ravi was subsequently fined.<br>.<br></strong>Yesterday, he said he had made the application for the judge to recuse himself on behalf of his clients who felt that Justice Woo might be biased against him.<br>.<br>But Mr Ravi added: "I was assured by Justice Woo that he would not be biased against me". However, the judge accepted that the public's perception had to be taken into consideration, he said.<br>.<br>Said Mr Ravi: "(Due to) the fact that (the exchange) was played out in the media again and again, the judge also felt that it was not healthy in the interest of justice that he continues to hear the matter."<br>.<br>The hearing for a summary judgment against the Dr Chee and his sister and fellow Singapore Democratic Party member, Ms Chee Siok Chin, has been adjourned until a new judge is named.<br>.<br>Mr Davinder Singh, who was representing the PAP leaders and was present outside the chambers yesterday, left shortly after he was informed of the latest development.<br>.<br><strong>Mr Ravi, who has been penalised four times by the Law Society,</strong> also told reporters that he has been served a letter of notice on Wednesday to appear before the Court of Three Judges Â— the legal profession's highest disciplinary body Â— over his latest disciplinary run-in, in which he was deemed to be disrespectful to a female district judge three years ago.</blockquote></div>

The drive to create an autochthonous legal system gained increased momentum in the late 1980s and accelerated with the appointment of the current Chief Justice Yong Pung How in September 1990. This coincided with the period of intensive constitutional remaking to develop an autochthonous government and parliamentary system of Singapore. The departure from the Westminster-inspired parliamentary system was evident through the innovations, which attempted to handle the unique political circumstances here....<br><br>1.2.31    11 July 1994: The landmark Practice Statement on Judicial Precedent declared that the Privy Council, SingaporeÂ’s predecessor courts, as well as the Court of AppealÂ’s prior decisions no longer bound the permanent Court of Appeal. The Practice Statement reasoned that Â‘[t]he development of our law should reflect these changes [that political, social and economic circumstances have changed enormously since SingaporeÂ’s independence] and the fundamental values of Singapore societyÂ’. Increasing confidence in the growing maturity and international standing of SingaporeÂ’s legal system as well as the concern that BritainÂ’s increasing links with the European Union would render English law incompatible with local developments and aspirations gave impetus to the legal autochthony effort....<br><br>SECTION 3     COMMON LAW IN SINGAPORE<br><br>The Doctrine of Judicial Precedent<br><br>1.3.2     In essence, the common law system of Singapore is characterised by the doctrine of judicial precedent (or stare decisis). According to this doctrine, the body of law is created incrementally by judges via the application of legal principles to the facts of particular cases. In this regard, the judges are only required to apply the ratio decidendi (or the operative reason for the decision) of the higher court within the same hierarchy. Thus, in Singapore, the ratio decidendi found in the decisions of the Singapore Court of Appeal are strictly binding on the Singapore High Court, the District Court and the MagistrateÂ’s Court.<br><br><strong>The court decisions from England and other Commonwealth jurisdictions are, on the other hand, not strictly binding on Singapore. Other judicial statements (obiter dicta) made by the higher court in the judgment which do not directly affect the outcome of the case may be disregarded by the lower court. </strong><br><br>1.3.6     Two recent examples shall suffice at this juncture as a manifestation of SingaporeÂ’s desire to develop an autochthonous legal system and body of laws. In the law of torts, the Singapore courts<strong> have consciously deviated from the exclusionary rule in the English case of Murphy v Brentford District Council (1991) so as to allow recovery for pure economic losses arising from negligent acts or omissions based on Anns v Merton (197 8 ) .</strong> More recently, in the law of contract, the Singapore Court of Appeal in Chwee Kin Keong v Digilandmall.com Pte Ltd (2005) has chosen not to adopt the position in the English Court of Appeal decision in <strong>Great Peace Shipping Ltd v Tsavliris Salvage (International) Ltd (2002) </strong>on equityÂ’s jurisdiction in the case of unilateral mistake. This need for the autochthony of Singapore law is further driven by the European Union legal developments and their impact on the British system.<br></blockquote>5.so Spore do not change the law now  just to fix CSJ.<br>Sg has deviated for long time from common law,scrap jury system,<br>not follow case law so blindly etc.There are few famous cases deviated<br>from common laws.Pl share here.<br><br>CSJ should not look himself so high that sg need to change<br>the rules of game to fix him.<br><br>search'' common law cases + singapore''<br><br>6.i would be sad and suprised  if qualified lawyer wrote<br>the article in SDP site.a first year law student should<br>know sg law has deviated from common law for some time.<br><br>But judging form the format of the article,it seems it<br>was written by a' learned' lawyer.<br><br>7.Why<strong> <span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sg was higher than US and UK etc for so many years.</span></span></strong><br><br></div>
