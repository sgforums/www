Is this not another brilliant Gazelle attempt to divert attention by starting another new irrelevant line of thinking ?<br><br>b] Sugar - how much sugar is used in a glass of coffee, tea or aerated drinks - that justify increases in prices at such amounts ? Supermarket is already making profits by selling aerated can drinks at 0.45 cents per can, and yet the Food Courts are not satisfied selling the same at $1.10 to $1.30 but will still increase to ever higher amounts at the slightest opportunity.<br><br>c] Distribution cost - Oil has yet to reach its all time high of over US$70 per barrel, and had slid down to as low as US$65 per barrel during July 2007. Even as petrol is fluctuating, most distribution vehicles are running on diesel which has remained relatively stable. COE for goods vehicle has continued to go down compared to the early days when COE was first implemented.<br><br>d] Rental - the cost of rental are NOT affected by property prices, as rental contracts are tied over a term period.
