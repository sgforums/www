Eventually, the competitiveness and higher costs are just gonna drive the hawkers to up their own prices. Everyone is paying more for the same; why should hawkers think differently?<br><br>Fairprice has announced short-term price control measures for necessities such as condensed milk, bread and other items; this pro-active gesture serves only to muzzle the detractors that cost of living is slowly but surely going up. Fairprice, being a 'govt' sponsored supermarket chain has no choice but to hold prices to create the facade of altruism. This 'noble' act only delays the inevitable and shows that even govt-run organizations are not immune of the laws of simple economics.<br><br>The results of the survey are predictable but skewed; for example, why weren't data obtained from food courts - the direct competitor of hawker centers? Had that happened, ST would not dare publish the comparative statistics, because it WILL REFLECT a truer image of the overall price hikes for food.<br><br>It continues to reinforce the point that statistics that serve the govt's interest will continue to be published. It will take a collective effort to convince those in power to 'GET REAL' - prices have gone up. Even the vain and arrogant emperor had to concede to the common peasants, who laughed at his 'new invisible robes'.<br><br>This piece of information merely serves notice to Hawkers that they are already 'behind the times'. If anything, it will expedite their plans to jack up hawker prices.<br><br>Watch for it in the coming months.</div>
