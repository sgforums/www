Copenhagen-based Maersk has jumped 33 per cent this year, outperforming the 8.5 per cent gain in the Bloomberg European Industrials Index of Europe's 78 largest companies by market value.<br><br>'Container rates continue to develop better than we thought, and we expect positive news flow from competitors this autumn,' said Mr Nielsen, who has a 78,500 kroner 12-month price target on the stock.<br><br>Maersk shares rose as much as 2.6 per cent yesterday and were up 1 per cent to 70,600 kroner at 11.35 am in Copenhagen, valuing the company at 308.6 billion kroner (S$86 billion).<br><br>The shipper said its container rates will rise on average 4 per cent this year. It also said it transported 3 per cent more containers in the first half of the year, compared with global market growth of 8 to 9 per cent.<br><br>'The container margin was better-than-expected as Maersk sacrificed market share to lift profits,' David Hallden, analyst at Cheuvreux in Stockholm, said. He raised his nine-month price target to 82,000 kroner from 80,000 kroner.<br><br>Soeren Thorup Soerensen, Maersk's chief financial officer, reiterated the oil and gas division will reach its 2009 production goal of 525,000 barrels a day in Al Shaheen, its US$6 billion Qatar investment.

            <div class='col-md body'>European Steel Producers Reported Record Profits in 2007<br><br>Notizia pubblicata in rete il 24/08/2007 07.48, tempo medio di lettura previsto 2 minuti e 47 secondi<br><br>LONDON, August 24 /PRNewswire/ -- European steel producers have reported record profits in 2007, while margins in the US steel market have fallen. This is according to Integer Research's latest publication that gathers quarterly and interim financials for 60 leading global steel producers, the Steel Financial Bulletin.<br>"Global demand and prices for steel remain at historic levels into 2007," says Integer Research Director, Philip Radbourne. "For example some European companies, SSAB, Salzgitter and voestalpine have shown record operating and net profit margins in 2007. This is due to the strong positive global economic trend that has persisted into 2007."<br>"However, as can be seen in the Steel Financial Bulletin, it was not as easy for the Asian and US producers," says Integer Research analyst, Andrea Valentini. "In the US, the economic momentum has slowed, triggered by the crisis in the US real estate market. The softer US economy meant that stocks have built up, particularly of flat steel sheet. Consequently margins for companies like Nucor and AK Steel have fallen. Margins had also been squeezed by imports and prices; however imports have recently dropped, leading to a healthier business environment. This has resulted in a stronger performance in the US steel market in Q2 2007."<br>Radbourne continues, "In China the cost pressure among some players, and pressure on prices, hit margins for many of the steel producers early in 2007. This was despite the continued strong demand. The only companies that have been able to sustain their profitability are those producing quality flat products, such as Angang, Tangshan and Shougang. They have been able to sustain their profit margins because strong economic performance in China. This has underpinned demand for flat steel products used in a range of consumer goods."<br>In Japan, Nippon Steel Corp. and JFE Holdings Inc have both been able to post strong quarterly profits margins, helped by higher steel prices. Nippon Steel, the world's second largest steel producer has benefitted from strong worldwide sales of Japanese cars, helping its pre-tax profit increase by 21% year-on-year to Yen148.7 billion (US$1.26 billion). JFE, sold nearly half its steel products to customers in South Korea, Thailand and China However, both Sumitomo Metal Industries Ltd. and Kobe Steel Ltd., which rely less on booming car sheet production than the bigger two rivals have seen their margins squeezed over the last few months.<br>"South Korea's POSCO announced a 55% increase in its quarterly net profits in Q2 2007, as it saw rising demand from car companies and shipbuilders," says Radbourne. "Arcelor Mittal also reported a strong performance. It saw a 50% increase year-on-year in net profits, based on its pro-forma 2006 results. However, it will be interesting to see how Arcelor Mittal performs, once we are able to look at the company on a like-for-like basis through next year. It will also be interesting to see, in future editions of the Financial Bulletin, whether the company has been able to gain from consolidation."<br>Integer Research: Kingsley Maunder +44-207-503-1265</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Why is this thread so laughable?<br><br>If common sense prevails, then the issue of inflation triggered by the GST hike is a no-brainer.<br><br>1) If there is a price increase of items overall, then costs have gone up. All businessmen, whether subjected to GST a not, would increase their prices<br><br>2) "Everyone is doing it, why not me? I can't be so stupid right"<br><br>Which businessman would allow the govt to raise their business costs and then not react to it? No business is a charity.<br><br>Just ask the girls who frequent certain fashion outlets. They can tell you better.<br><br>Very simple logic.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The channel u program called  'Just Shoot 3'  had CASE head as guest to talk about how gullable singaporeans are to get cheated by conmen.<br><br>He admitted on live national TV that  there are loopholes in commercial law that allows unethical businessmen / conmen or evil men to profiteer and get away with it.<br><br>One such example is a Travel agency boss can be in the reds or loose a lot of money due to personal mistakes or extravagances or gambling or shares.<br><br>there are examples of  travel agencies which make use of the commercial loophole and publish below market price, impossibly low prices to attract huge number of customers. With this sales, the boss can close shop and declare bankrupt and get away with the money and unethical practise.<br><br>The CASE head said that singapore is open policy for commerce and imposing law on this can affect business.<br><br>I do not completely agree with this thinking as specific laws can target this form of unethical practise that do not affect ethical business , i believe.<br><br>But they are taking the view from another angle.<br><br>The main thing I like to message here is that if you want to earn money and really desperate for it, the commercial system seems to have several loopholes for unethical people to explore and get away. Meaning, in this case, being unethical and profiteer is not illegal.<br><br></div>
