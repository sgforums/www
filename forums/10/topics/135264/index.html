            <div class='col-md body'>China must confront dark past, says Mao confidant<br><br>Communist party veteran says Tiananmen students were right to demand more democracy and less corruption<br><br>Jonathan Watts in Beijing<br>Thursday June 2, 2005<br>The Guardian<br><br>His giant portrait still hangs in pride of place over the entrance to the Forbidden City, his embalmed body lies in a mausoleum in the middle of Tiananmen Square, and his visage is the only one to adorn the latest set of banknotes.<br><br>Almost 30 years after his death, Mao still remains the central figure in China. While the legend and legacy of Mao Zedong is now under fresh, and intense, scrutiny overseas, there is no debate here.<br><br>Article continues<br>A new English biography of him by Jung Chang, the author of Wild Swans, describes Mao as the biggest mass murderer in history, yet the book will not be the talk of Beijing's coffee shops and restaurants, nor will its claims fill the pages of Chinese newspapers. For the book will not be published in China, and references to it are hard to come by on the internet.<br><br>According to a confidant of Mao - a retired senior member of the Communist party - it is this refusal to confront and reassess the darkest episodes of China's past that is preventing the country from achieving its potential in the future.<br><br>In a rare interview, Li Rui, Mao's personal secretary during the Great Helmsman's most murderous period in power, told the Guardian that the biggest problem facing modern China was its inability to face up to history.<br><br>Few people know the horrors it contains more intimately than the 88-year-old, whose outspoken views have taken him in and out of the centre of power in Beijing and the political wilderness of gulags in freezing Heilongjiang province.<br><br>Most of the punishments were meted out by his mentor and chief tormentor, Mao, whose worst crimes are still a taboo subject.<br><br>"That's China's biggest problem," Mr Li said. "Mao was too autocratic. He couldn't bear to hear disagreements. He had a superstitious belief that he was always and absolutely right. But Mao's problem is also a problem of the system. It was caused by the party system."<br><br>Mr Li has yet to read the new work on his former boss, but its claim that Mao was culpable for the deaths of tens of millions of people during the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution is likely to come as no surprise.<br><br>"Mao's way of thinking and governing was terrifying. He put no value on human life. The deaths of others meant nothing to him," said Li, who shakes with fury when asked about the chairman's personality. "I really didn't like him."<br><br>Despite his unusually blunt criticism, Mr Li is no dissident. On the contrary, he is a party man through and through, a cadre who survived some of the roughest political turmoil of the 20th century with his reputation intact.<br><br>His Beijing home in "Ministers House", an apartment block reserved for senior communist pensioners, is proof of that.<br><br>But his fierce public comments are entirely consistent with a life history that is filled with rebellions, often at great personal cost, against those who abused their power. As a high school student in Hubei, he led student protests against local warlords, at university he threw himself into the movement against Japan, and soon afterwards he was thrown into prison by Chang Kai-shek's Kuomintang authorities for distributing Marxist textbooks.<br><br>Upon his release he joined Mao's communist forces in Yanan, where he wrote stinging editorials for the party newspaper, Liberation. The attention proved dangerous. After a brutal purge against "reactionaries" he spent a year in prison on charges of spying.<br><br>His independence of thought initially won him promotion to Mao's inner circle, where he held the advisory position of personal secretary. But in 1958 the same outspokenness got him thrown into a gulag for two years when he dared to publicly criticise the disastrous Great Leap Forward policy and, by extension, a leader who was starting to project himself as infallible.<br><br>"As early as 1958, Mao said the personality cult was necessary," Mr Li said. "By the time of the Cultural Revolution, this had become an evil cult.<br><br>"Mao's methods were even harsher than the emperors of ancient times. He tried to control the minds of the people."<br><br>Yet, despite this and his own suffering, Mr Li accepts the official Communist party judgment that Mao was three parts bad, seven parts good, because his revolutionary achievements in expelling the colonial powers outweighed his failures once in power.<br><br>Since the insanity of the Cultural Revolution, China has also changed almost beyond recognition. Its people are richer and far freer to travel and express their views in private and to foreigners, if not to the domestic public.<br><br>"Now I can talk to you. In the past, if I talked like this, I would have been killed or jailed," Mr Li said.<br><br>None the less, his poems and essays, which attack corruption, environmental destruction and domestic censorship, are published in Hong Kong. When a mainland newspaper, the Southern Metropolitan, printed his proposals for a tripartite division of power, the authorities blocked its distribution and changed the editor.<br><br>Though the gulag is no longer a threat, there are considerable risks in speaking out. This has been shown by the frequent arrests of journalists, most recently Ching Cheong of the Straits Times, who faces charges of spying because he tried toacquire notes of secret interviews with the late premier Zhao Ziyang, who opposed the Tiananmen Square killings on June 4 1989.<br><br>Mr Li is as disturbingly and admirably frank on this most sensitive of subjects as he is on every other.<br><br>"The leadership did not understand the students. It worried that they were organised by foreign powers and were part of an attempted takeover by someone inside the party. The leadership's measures were wrong. The students' calls for more democracy and less corruption were right."<br><br>Last year, on the 15th anniversary of the Tiananmen protests, there were reports that prominent officials were calling for a review of the crackdown, which the government has always justified as a necessary measure to put down a revolt that threatened stability.<br><br>Mr Li is one of the few to risk retribution from the authorities by going public with such a call.<br><br>"We should talk about it. We should reassess what happened on June 4. But we must do it properly, not now," he said. As for Nazism in Germany, or military dictatorship in South Korea, a judgment would eventually be made by history. "But it is hard to say if it will take five, 15 or 20 years."<br><br>Chairman's legacy<br><br>The Long March<br><br>Mao was among several leaders of a protracted retreat that started in October 1934 and took the communist army 9,000km. Although it ensured the survival of the party, only 20,000 of the 90,000 who started out on the march in Jiangxi province made it to the end in Yanan in Shaanxi. As well as disease, exposure and battles with the Kuomintang, the high rate of fatalities was a result of repeated inner-party purges.<br><br>Hundred Flowers Campaign<br><br>Emboldened after the early successes of the republic, Mao decided in April 1957 to relax censorship and invite constructive criticism about his rule. "Let a hundred flowers bloom" in the arts, he said. But such was the flood of complaints that the Great Helmsman quickly changed his stance. Within six months, 300,000 intellectuals were either killed, imprisoned, sacked or branded "rightists" in need of political re-education.<br><br>Great Leap Forward<br><br>Mao was personally responsible for this disastrous attempt to jumpstart the economy by collectivising agricultural production and establishing smelting kilns in every village to match Britain's industrial output in 10 years. The radical experiment started with the attempted abolition of money and private property, and ended with a famine that killed between 30 million and 60 million peasants after the failure of harvests in 1959 and1960.<br><br>Cultural Revolution<br><br>An aging Mao attempted to build a new political base through the spread of a personality cult. From 1966 devoted students across the country formed Red Guard units, which spearheaded a vicious purge against Mao's opponents - real and imagined. Anything related to the Four Olds - old ideas, old customs, old culture and old habits - was a target. Millions died. When the students threatened to move out of control, Mao used the People's Liberation Army to crush dissent.</div>

Whislt I support the robust economic reforms in China I also believe that it should also be accompanied by cautious and graduated political reforms. Unfortunately, failure of Hu Yaobang and Zhao Zhiyang to carry out earlier reforms has deterred current leaders from going in this direction.

Hu Jintao had to step gingerly during the early days of transition before Jiang was eventually forced to step down by the other members of the CCP. The point is that political succession is still very much a dicey business and potential for things going in the wrong direction is still there.<br><br><strong>Â“I really want to know what kind of political system can address the urgent risks of social unrest due to great income gaps, the continuing threats of flood that destroy farms and houses, and the rampnant corruption in all sectors in China.

To address the problem of the rising income gap, China need to adjust towards more socialist policies; eg by improving the rights of farmers and the working class, introducing minimum standards of healthcare, housing and education, etc.<br><br>Corruption has been one of the major complaints leading to the Tiananmen incident. Although there is a legal system governing issues of corruption, the problem is one of supervision, identification of corrupt officials and successful enforcement. For those interested, the following link advocates political reform in order to solve the countryÂ’s problem of unemployment, corruption and environmental degradation.<br><br>http://www.usembassy-china.org.cn/sandt/poll-reform.htm<br><br><strong>Â”If china changes their leaders the way they did in the last 30yrs, we may see a new leaderships in another 10 yrs and I hope the new leaders could lead the country in political reform, but for now, as far as I know, the mandate of the Hu and Wen is not that of political reforms and the jury should be the people of china, not the ppl outside.Â”</strong><br><br>Unfortunately, the mandate for Hu/Wen is not derived from the citizens of China but from Deng and his colleagues in the CCP.

There is merit in that there is leeway for more diversity and that more autonomy can be readily given to regions such as Tibet and Xinjiang. Finally if and when Taiwan chose to reunite, there will already be a successful model for reunification.<br></div>

One of the important means of getting there is education, formal and informal. Majority of the chinese population have no idea what a federation is all about and many thought that the provincial governments are good enough. The older chinese are fighting hard to forget the inhumane lives they went through during cultural revolution, and they fear any kind of political changes.  To them a good government is the one that give the ppl the basic necessities, "black cat or white cat, the cat that catches the rat is a good cat.".<br><br>The younger generation, born in the eighties, from well to do families and are better educated, will be the force to recog with. I believe it will not take more than 50 yrs before changes take place.<br><br>Will be away on holiday, will catch up on this discussion next week.<br><br>Cheers.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Not many govt would want to admit their mistakes.  But what is impt is that they don't repeat their mistakes and strive to do more good for the country. In this respect the PRC govt has done a great job.  In the past 25 years its has moved 300 million people out of poverty and quadrupled the average person's income. It has to some extent dropped its ideological stand and adopted a pragmatic approach.</div>
