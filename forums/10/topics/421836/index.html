              Singapore jails outspoken party chief
              
              http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2oL81Tum3I
              
              Singapore claims to be a democracy. In reality, however, the ruling PAP maintains oppressive control over the city-state.
              
              Its latest efforts to suppress political dissent include the impending imprisonment of Dr Chee Soon Juan. His crime? Speaking in public.
              
              In Singapore, speaking in public requires a government permit. But the PAP government does not freely grant such permits to political opponents.
              
              The prison term means Dr Chee cannot stand in this yearâ€™s parliamentary elections. The PAP presently controls 82 of Singaporeâ€™s 84 seats.
              
              PAP also suppresses dissent by suing its opponents for libel. Where in other democracies politicians expect to be criticized, PAP politicians are thin-skinned.
              
              For example, it is a libel to suggest nepotism is the reason why Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has his job â€“ after his dad held it for 31 years. 
              
              Dynastic government? Kind of reminds you of Asiaâ€™s other political dynasty.

              Yeah, jail his stupid ass so he can make noise no more. Shameless fool can't even afford to bail himself out. Being bankrupt only renders him more worthless. He should learn to manage his own finances instead of going about speaking about nonsense.
              
              PAP restricts political freedom, so what? Everyone government does that. At least PAP can prevent CSJ from tarnishing the image of Singapore by acting like a retarded fool.
              
              I'm surprised Vote PAP OUT to Save SG hasn't started a post to bash LKY and blame him for arresting CSJ.

              <p>Correct !</p>
              <p>governorship = serving the interest of the citizen.</p>
              <p>Not citizen serving the governor. Why is Singapore ministers so important tat they get paid CEO salary rates? Are they running a corporation bent on making profit and efficiency? No ! Their job is to serve the voters and help us to make better lifes. Not earn high scale salary. If the Ministers feel tat they r lowly paid, they r most welcomed to join the private service, we do not need money mongering people like tat. Singapore has enuf talent n citizen who r hungry to serve to replace these Super highly paid Ministers.</p>

              It's not as if they are billionaires or something. It's just about a million per year, which is less than 0.0000...01% of Singapore's GDP. Like I said, any party that is elected will also want to be paid that much since it has now become a 'tradition'. Has any minister ever complained about a dismal salary? I don't think so. Yes, Singapore has enough talents and citizens who can replace the current crop of ministers, but do you think they will settle for less?

              <p>I find it alarming that some people seem to support or agree to the jailing of Dr Chee.</p>
              <p>The topics here in this forum, and the ideological and philosophical spectrum of some people have confused me totally.</p>
              <p>On one hand, they disapprove of ministers salary, housing prices, and wanted to have minimum wage rule. There are some who even seem to fall hook, line, and sinker, and swallow some cheap political propaganda and posturing from opposition regarding Thaipusam ruling recently, which in my mind is treacherous and is playing the racial card. Strangely some people seem to want to play that game enthusiastically and set themselves up as equality zealots.</p>
              <p>Yet, on this issue, there is very little support for Dr Chee, or more to the point, against the nature of this action by the government.</p>
              <p>In my mind, I disapprove and disagree with this action, because it is so heavy handed and neo-fascist to jail someone just because he is an opposition figure.</p>
              <p>Is it necessary to silent him and jail him ?</p>
              <p>This kind of action severely undermine the credibility and moral authority of the government.</p>
              <p>I do not know why the Singapore government likes to shoot itself on the foot like this, and still use 1960s mentality.</p>
              <p>It is regrettable.</p>
