Why is it necessary for anyone to have to apply for a permit to give a speech in public? Why is it necessary to have to apply for a permit from Lee Kuan Yew government to peacefully protest in public? Why is it wrong to criticize a judge when she is shamelessly abusing her office? Why is it necessary to be a PAP supporter to advance in your career and punished if you were an opposition supporter? <br><br>Why are there no free press in Singapore and every single one is state controlled? Why are we not allowed to read real news instead of being dished out this rubbish propaganda? <br><br>It is all these things that makes one's blood boil. It is these things in Singapore that insults your intelligence. <br><br>You don't have to take this garbage anymore. Stand up to your rights. Protest, yell scream, do anything you can to make it known that you simply refuse to be insulted by this tin pot dictator any longer. <br><br><em>Gopalan Nair</em></div>

              <p>I think logically everybody should be able to speak, and then if the content of the speech is inflamatory or is hate speech, then there should be a law against it.</p>
              <p>But it is not right to have a rule which says before you speak you must seek a permit first.</p>
              <p>This is totally heavy-handed.</p>
              <p>Also I wish people would stop quoting a certain person named Gopalan Nair, because he is precisely a counter example of what a good freedom of expression is. He is a perfect poster boy for stringent and heavy handed state control, because he has indeed uttered hate speech and inflamatory speech.</p>
              <p>It is therefore counter-productive to use him to help promote freedom of speech.</p>
              <p>You may remember him as someone who has uttered verbal abuse to policemen based on their ethnicity. You may also be familiar with some of his online writings, which in my opinion is very racist, extremist, inflammatory, primitive, and gutteral.</p>
              <p>Someone who harbours such racial extremism and vitriol is unsuitable to be put up as a champion of freedom of speech.</p>

              <p>I find it alarming that some people seem to support or agree to the jailing of Dr Chee.</p>
              <p>The topics here in this forum, and the ideological and philosophical spectrum of some people have confused me totally.</p>
              <p>On one hand, they disapprove of ministers salary, housing prices, and wanted to have minimum wage rule. There are some who even seem to fall hook, line, and sinker, and swallow some cheap political propaganda and posturing from opposition regarding Thaipusam ruling recently, which in my mind is treacherous and is playing the racial card. Strangely some people seem to want to play that game enthusiastically and set themselves up as equality zealots.</p>
              <p>Yet, on this issue, there is very little support for Dr Chee, or more to the point, against the nature of this action by the government.</p>
              <p>In my mind, I disapprove and disagree with this action, because it is so heavy handed and neo-fascist to jail someone just because he is an opposition figure.</p>
              <p>Is it necessary to silent him and jail him ?</p>
              <p>This kind of action severely undermine the credibility and moral authority of the government.</p>
              <p>I do not know why the Singapore government likes to shoot itself on the foot like this, and still use 1960s mentality.</p>
              <p>It is regrettable.</p>

              <p>The people of Egypt starve more than those in SG, so they do not fear death by getting crushed by armoured vehicles. Better than going hungry for their entire life.</p>
