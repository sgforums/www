            <div class='col-md body'>The Straits Times (Singapore)<br><br>August 10, 2005 Wednesday<br><br>Singapore<br><br>Presidential hopeful may face suit;<br>Ex-member seeks apology, damages for comments made by presidential<br>aspirant<br><br>Lynn Lee<br><br>PRESIDENTIAL hopeful Andrew Kuan's troubles over the time he served on<br>his condominium's management council grew yesterday.<br><br>A former council member has launched proceedings to sue him for<br>alleged defamation.<br><br>Lawyer Chia Boon Teck, 42, served notice on Mr Kuan yesterday through<br>his lawyer, Mr Edmond Pereira.<br><br>Mr Chia is taking issue with comments Mr Kuan made and documents he<br>circulated at a press conference on Monday which imply that he is<br>guilty of forgery, Mr Pereira said.<br><br>He is asking, among other things, for a public apology, damages and an<br>undertaking from Mr Kuan never to repeat the comments again.<br><br>A lawyer's letter from the firm of Edmond Pereira &amp; Partners was<br>served by a staff member at Mr Kuan's home some time after 2pm<br>yesterday.<br><br>It was received by one of Mr Kuan's family members, Mr Pereira said.<br><br>Mr Kuan could not be reached for comment yesterday. But his principal<br>election agent, Mr Francis Goh, said that he could not confirm if such<br>a letter had been received as it was a public holiday.<br><br>This is how matters leading to Mr Chia's launch of legal proceedings<br>yesterday unfolded.<br><br>The Aug 7 edition of The New Paper on Sunday reported on the May 2001<br>minutes of a council meeting of The Tanamera condominium. These<br>indicated that Mr Kuan was ousted as chairman as members were unhappy<br>with his management style.<br><br>Responding to the article that day, Mr Kuan said certain council<br>members had tabled a resolution to remove him. That happened after he<br>made a police report that a fellow council member forged someone's<br>signature.<br><br>The former JTC Corporation group chief financial officer, who now runs<br>his own business consulting firm, maintained his story at a press<br>conference on Monday.<br><br>Reading a prepared statement, he claimed that he and the condominium<br>manager discovered that the member forged signatures on three<br>occasions. A police report was later filed.<br><br>Mr Kuan did not name the member when he spoke on Monday.<br><br>But he described him as 'a litigation lawyer from a well-known local<br>law firm' who 'admitted to forging the signatures' when queried by the<br>management council.<br><br>Mr Kuan also said that 'the police had closed the case without<br>prosecution despite the clear evidence and admission of forgery'. He<br>then gave copies of the police report to reporters.<br><br>The police report contained the names of Mr Chia and his sister, Ms<br>Chia Lee Kheng.<br><br>Mr Chia said he decided to act following a report on Monday's press<br>conference in the Today newspaper which had his and his sister's<br>names, and the comments on forgery.<br><br>He told The Straits Times last night that he never admitted having<br>committed any forgery.<br><br>The signatures in question related to documents that his sister, who<br>had an apartment at The Tanamera, asked him to sign on her behalf as<br>she was working in London at the time.<br><br>He said Mr Kuan raised the matter at a council meeting and refused to<br>accept his explanations.<br><br>He added that even back in 2001, his lawyers began compiling material<br>arising from comments that Mr Kuan allegedly continued to make about<br>him. But he let the matter rest when Mr Kuan left the council in May<br>2001.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Mr Chia, like Mr Kuan, is a member of the People's Action Party but<br>said his current action has nothing to do with the party.</span><br><br>He had served as a grassroots leader in Fengshan until the end of last<br>year when he decided to focus on his career and his role in the Law<br>Society.<br><br>Mr Chia's lawyers have given Mr Kuan seven days from yesterday to<br>respond and publish an apology. If not, the matter will go to court.<br><br></div>

Why- because he had had the temerity to ask for a statement of Singapore's assets.<br><br>It looks as though the PAP government will go all out to ensure that only Mr. Nathan is appointed President. He has been a very good President for the PAP government.<br><br>The Prime Minister's call for openness is hollow.<br><br>Does the PAP claim a record for openness and accountability.<br><br>If the PAP government succeeds in keeping out any other candidate to take on Mr. Nathan, the election becomes a farce.<br><br>When the Bill for the Elected President was introduced in Parliament, Goh, the then Prime Minister spoke of the need for the President to be elected by the people so as to give him the moral authority.<br><br>The PAP government says one thing and then immediately forgets what it<br>has said and does the very opposite.<br><br>J.
