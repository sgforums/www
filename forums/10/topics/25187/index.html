Using Newater... we are talking at the molecular level of purity ( not even your 999.9 gold bar can compare) the pore of the filter paper is so small.. even petroleum by product like methane and ethane cannot get through...  (these by product are pretty abundant in the sea around singapore)<br><br>Desalinated water is next in terms of purity... buts its energy intensive in production... Desalinated water is however likely to be contaminated by low weight, low boiling point molecules... which means that it is very likely that when you drink desalinated water.. chances is... you are drinking some molecules of petroleum byproduct like methane and ethane as well....plus other nasty chemicals which may harm your body in the future... but we cannot removed it using desalinating method...  especially if the chemical has a boiling point close to that of water +/- 25 degrees....<br><br>Lastly... the filtered water that we currently are using... lets just say..... if tomolo i go to the singapore reserviour and pee... i can guarantee that ... using the present system...everyone in singapore will get to taste the Uric acid, Urea and other waste in my urine ... though at a highly diluted level... but... its there... i guarantee it... dont believe send the water for chemical analysis....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Any minerals like irons in water is in such small amounts you get more from the food you eat even if you have only one meal per day. Even if there is a need to have the minerals in the water you can always add them later by mixing the treated reserviour water to Newater which is if I remember correctly what will be done to improve the taste of the water.</div>
