            <div class='col-md body'>Nguyen case will damage Singapore/Aust relations, says opposition<br><br>20.11.05 1.00pm<br><br>Singapore has treated Australia with contempt over the case of condemned drug smuggler Nguyen Tuong Van and the issue will damage relations between the two countries, the Australian Labour Party says.<br><br>Opposition foreign affairs spokesman Kevin Rudd says Australia must immediately lodge a formal diplomatic protest against Singapore's handling of the matter.<br><br>"It will have an impact on Australia's bilateral relations with Singapore," Mr Rudd told ABC television.<br><br>"The Singaporean government has treated Australia with contempt on this question.<br><br>"We've had representations from the Pope, the prime minister, the governor-general, the opposition, a resolution of the Australian parliament and representations from a huge cross-section of the Australian people.<br><br>"And the Singaporean government's response to that is to tell us all to go jump in the lake.<br><br>"It's time the Australian government raised a formal diplomatic protest with the Singaporeans to explain the fact that this country thinks that Singapore's handling of this has simply been appalling."<br><br>He said executions by hanging were particularly cruel.<br><br>"Execution by hanging is repugnant," Mr Rudd said.<br><br>Singapore has ignored a concerted campaign seeking clemency for Nguyen, 25, who was arrested at Singapore's Changi airport in late 2002 and found to be carrying 396 grams of heroin.<br><br>He is due to be hanged on December 2.<br><br>Nguyen's lawyers have signalled they may make a last ditch appeal to the United Nation's International Court of Justice (ICJ) to stop his execution -- any application to the ICJ must be through the Australian government.<br><br>Mr Rudd said he had spoken with one of Nguyen's lawyers, Lex Lasry, who returned from Singapore this morning, and was told of even more disturbing details.<br><br>"He tells me also that in the week or so ahead when young Mr Nguyen's mother will be visiting him in these extraordinary, ugly circumstances, that Singaporean processes don't even allow his mum to give him a farewell cuddle," he said.<br><br>"I mean they don't allow physical conduct.<br><br>"What sort of government are we dealing with here?<br><br>"This deserves and demands a formal diplomatic protest by the Australian government to try to get some sense and some compassion out of the Singaporean government."<br><br>- AAP <a href="http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/story.cfm?c_id=2&amp;ObjectID=10356116" rel="nofollow">http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/story.cfm?c_id=2&amp;ObjectID=10356116</a></div>
