            <div class='col-md body'>PM denies vote buying after grants audit<br><br>By Sandra O'Malley, Melissa Jenkins and Maria Hawthorne<br><br>November 15, 2007 08:01pm<br>Article from: AAP<br><br>PRIME Minister John Howard's re-election chances have been dealt a blow by a damning report which finds the regional grants program has been used for pork-barrelling in Coalition electorates.<br><br>Just over a week out from polling day, and with a new poll showing little reduction in Labor's lead, the Coalition's reputation for economic management has been called into question in a scathing report by Auditor-General Ian McPhee.<br><br>The report is critical of the administration of the Regional Partnerships Program (RPP) and says ministers often went against public servants' advice by giving money to Coalition electorates.<br><br>And in one 90-minute period on the eve of the 2004 federal election campaign, parliamentary secretary De-Anne Kelly rushed through approvals for 16 projects worth more than $3.3m.<br><br><strong><br>Opposition Leader Kevin Rudd said the report revealed another example of an arrogant and out-of-touch Government which had used taxpayer funds to buy votes in the run-up to the 2004 poll.</strong><br><br>And Mr Howard may face further fall-out with one of his senior advisers, Peter Langhorne, an ex-chief of staff to former Nationals leader John Anderson, caught up in the row.<br><br>Mr Langhorne was found to have had a role in pushing for funding for an ethanol plan in Gunnedah, in Mr Anderson's electorate of Gwydir, even though the project was assessed as high-risk.<br><br>Mr McPhee examined $400m allocated by the Government's controversial RPP between 2003 and 2006 and found it fell short of "an acceptable standard of public administration".<br><br>His three-volume, 1200-page report found dozens of instances where ministers had overridden departmental recommendations to give the tick to projects in Coalition electorates.<br><br><strong><br>And in many instances, ministers blocked grants in Labor seats even though the department deemed them worthy.</strong><br><br>Mr Rudd demanded the Prime Minister accept responsibility for the pork-barrelling scandal.<br><br>"Mr Howard must today accept responsibility for the arrogant abuse of this $328m program," Mr Rudd said.<br><br>"Mr Howard on the eve of an election must at least explain to the Australian people how these abuses of a $328m taxpayer program have occurred."<br><br>Of the $400m allocated to the program, only $328m was spent.<br><br>Mr Rudd said the report showed the Howard Government had arrogantly ignored the advice of independent public servants and abused taxpayers' dollars to get themselves re-elected in 2004.<br><br>"I presume they are doing the same again today," he said.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Coalition today continued to defend the regional grants program and Mr Howard, campaigning in far north Queensland, told reporters he had not seen the report.<br><br>But he said more grants had gone to Coalition electorates because they held all the rural seats in Australia.<br><br>"The Labor party doesn't hold one seat in Australia that can be called a rural seat and most of the regional seats in Australia are held by the Coalition at present," Mr Howard said.<br><br>"That's got to mean that if you are to have a fair application, you are going to end up with more of these grants going to Coalition seats than Labor seats simply because we hold most of them."<br><br>Nationals leader Mark Vaile refused to apologise for the program, which he said had delivered jobs to the bush.<br><br>"This is a very good program that has delivered some fantastic outcomes to regional Australia and I don't apologise for it Â– not for one minute," he said in Taree.<br><br>The damning revelations were a gift to Labor, which was basking in the positive headlines following its campaign launch in Brisbane yesterday.<br><br>And the latest Nielsen Poll, to be published in Fairfax newspapers tomorrow, showed Labor maintaining its election-winning lead with 54 per cent of the two-party preferred vote, down one percentage point. The Coalition was on 46 per cent, up one point.<br><br>The Government continued to attack Labor over its economic credentials but its criticisms, along with the announcement of a $250m aged care plan, were drowned out today by the regional grants scandal.<br><br>The revelations also overshadowed a gaffe by Mr Howard, who forgot how many days there were to the end of the campaign.<br><br>The long-suffering public has lived through months of phoney campaigning and a lengthy six-week official campaign but Mr Howard appeared keen today to extend it by three days.<br><br>He mistakenly told journalists there were 12 days to election day, when there are in fact nine.</div>
