            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'><span style="font-style: italic;">After a bit of digging, IÂ’ve found a respectable newspaper that has done research on roughly how much the Singapore govt-linked companies have invested in Burma. ItÂ’s about $3,000,000,000 (yes, 3 billion) and surprise, surprise, itÂ’s not published by the Straits Times, or any of its related media (in fact, I don't think the S'pore media has said that it's perhaps 'business' links that made S'pore's response to the Burmese to be so meek: PM Lee was 'disturbed' by it, while the UN and other world leaders 'condemn' it).<br><br>The article is written by Eric Ellis of the Sydney Morning Herald (<a href="http://www.smh.com.au/news/business/singapore-a-friend-indeed-to-burma/2007/09/30/1191090945019.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.smh.com.au/news/business/singapore-a-friend-indeed-to-burma/2007/09/30/1191090945019.html</a>), and published on 1 Oct 2007. IÂ’ll take the liberty to re-print the entire article here, because Singaporeans should read about this:</span><br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Singapore, a friend indeed to Burma</span><br><br>The island-state may have much to lose if BurmaÂ’s generals donÂ’t retain control, writes Eric Ellis.</strong><br><br>SINGAPORE is not just skilled at mandatory executions of drug traffickers, running an excellent airport and selling cameras on Orchard Road. It also does a very useful trade keeping BurmaÂ’s military rulers and their cronies afloat.<br><br>Much attention is focused on China and its hosting of the Olympic Games next year as a diplomatic trigger point for placing pressure on BurmaÂ’s junta. But there is a group of government businessmen-technocrats in Singapore who will also be closely - and perhaps nervously - monitoring the brutality in Rangoon. Were they so inclined, their influence could go a long way to limiting the misery being inflicted on BurmaÂ’s 54 million people.<br><br>Collectively known as Singapore Inc, they gather around the $150 billion state-owned investment house Temasek Holdings, controlled by SingaporeÂ’s long-ruling Lee family. With an estimated $3 billion invested in Burma (and more than $20 billion in Australia), Singapore Inc companies have been some of the biggest investors in and supporters of BurmaÂ’s military junta - this while its Government, on the rare times it is asked, gently suggests a softly-softly diplomatic approach toward the junta.<br><br>When it comes to Burma, Singapore pockets the high morals it likes to wave at the West.<br><br>SingaporeÂ’s one-time head of foreign trade said, as his country was building links with Burma in the mid-1990s: Â“While the other countries are ignoring it, itÂ’s a good time for us to go in. You get better deals, and youÂ’re more appreciated. SingaporeÂ’s position is not to judge them and take a judgmental moral high ground.Â”<br><br>But by providing BurmaÂ’s pariah junta with crucial material and equipment mostly denied by Western sanctions Singapore has helped keep the military government and its cronies afloat for 20 years, indeed since the last time the generals killed the citizens they are supposed to protect with industrial efficiency and brutality, as now.<br><br>Without the support from Singapore, BurmaÂ’s junta would be greatly weakened and perhaps even fail. But after two decades of profitable business with the generals and their cronies, that is about the last thing Singapore Inc is likely to do. ThereÂ’s too much money to be made.<br><br>From hotels, airlines, military equipment and training, crowd control equipment and sophisticated telecommunications monitoring devices, Singapore is a crucial manager and supplier to the junta, and BurmaÂ’s economy.<br><br>It is impossible to spend any meaningful time in Burma and not make the junta richer, via contracts with Singapore suppliers to the tourism industry. SingaporeÂ’s hospitals also keep its leaders alive - the 74-year-old strongman Than Shwe has been receiving treatment for intestinal cancer in a government hospital in Singapore, in a ward heavily protected by Singapore security.<br><br>Much of SingaporeÂ’s activity in Burma has been documented by an analyst working in AustraliaÂ’s Office of National Assessments. Andrew Selth is recognised as a leading authority on BurmaÂ’s military. Now a research fellow at QueenslandÂ’s Griffith University, Selth has written extensively for years on how close Singapore Inc is to the junta.<br><br>Often writing as Â“William AshtonÂ” in JaneÂ’s Intelligence Review, Selth has described how Singapore has sent guns, rockets, armoured personnel carriers and grenade launchers to the junta, some of it trans-shipped from stocks seized by Israel from Palestinians in southern Lebanon.<br><br>Singaporean companies have provided computers and communications equipment for BurmaÂ’s defence ministry and army, while upgrading the juntaÂ’s ability to communicate with regional commanders - so crucial as protesters take to the streets of 20 cities in Burma. The sheer scale of the protests is causing logistical headaches for the Tatmadaw, as BurmaÂ’s military is known.<br><br>(to be continued in the following post)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>(continued from the following post)<br><br>Â“Singapore cares little about human rights, in particular the plight of the ethnic and religious minorities in Burma,Â” Selth writes. Â“Having developed one of the regionÂ’s most advanced armed forces and defence industrial support bases, Singapore is in a good position to offer Burma a number of inducements which other ASEAN [Association of South-East Asian Nations] countries would find hard to match.Â”<br><br>Selth says Singapore also provided the equipment for a Â“cyber war centreÂ” to monitor dissident activity, while training BurmaÂ’s secret police, whose sole job appears to be ensuring democracy groups are crushed.<br><br>Monitoring dissidents is an area where Singapore has expertise. After almost five decades in power, the Lee family-controlled PeopleÂ’s Action Party ranks behind only the communists of China, Cuba and North Korea in leadership longevity.<br><br>Â“This centre is reported to be closely involved in the monitoring and recording of foreign and domestic telecommunications, including the satellite telephone conversations of Burmese opposition groups,Â” Selth writes.<br><br>Singaporean government companies, such as the arms supplier Singapore Technologies, dominate the communications and military sector in Singapore. Selth writes: Â“It is highly unlikely that any of these arms shipments to Burma could have been made without the knowledge and support of the Singapore Government.Â” He notes that SingaporeÂ’s ambassadors to Burma have included a former senior Singapore Armed Forces officer and a past director of SingaporeÂ’s defence-oriented Joint Intelligence Directorate. Â“It is curious that Singapore chose to assign someone with a military background to this new member of ASEAN and not one of its many capable professional diplomats.Â”<br><br>Selth writes that after BurmaÂ’s 1988 crackdown, in which 3000 democracy protesters were killed, Â“the first country to come to the regimeÂ’s rescue was in fact SingaporeÂ”.<br><br>In an interview with the chief executive officer of Singapore Technologies, Peter Seah, at his office in Singapore, the Herald asked about the model of an armoured personnel carrier made by his company that sat on his office table. Seah said his company sold the vehicles Â“only to alliesÂ”. Did that include Burma, given Singapore helped sponsor the military regime into ASEAN? Seah was not specific: Â“We only sell to allies and we make sure they are responsible.Â” He did not say how. For its part, Temasek does not respond to questions about its activities in Burma.<br><br>A Singaporean diplomat to Burma, Matthew Sim, wrote a handbook for Singaporean businesspeople, Myanmar on My Mind. It is full of tips for doing business in Burma, although odd given SingaporeÂ’s contempt for corruption and lawbreakers. Â“A little money goes a long way in greasing the wheels of productivity,Â” he writes.<br><br>A chapter headed Committing Manslaughter When Driving describes the appropriate action for a Singaporean if they accidentally kill a pedestrian in Burma. Â“Firstly, the international businessman could give the family of the deceased some money as compensation and dissuade them from pressing charges. Secondly, he could pay a Myanmar citizen to take the blame by declaring that he was the driver in the fatal accident. An international businessman should not make the mistake of trying to argue his case in a court of law when it comes to a fatal accident, even if he is in the right. He highly probably will spend time in jail regretting it. It is a sad and hard world. The facts of life can be ugly.Â”<br><br>Describing SingaporeÂ’s usefulness to Burma, Sim says Â“many successful Myanmar businessmen have opened shell companiesÂ” in Singapore Â“with little or no staff, used to keep funds overseasÂ”. The companies are used to keep business deals outside the control of BurmaÂ’s central bank, enabling Singaporeans and others to make transactions with Burma in Singapore, he says.<br><br>Sim may be referring to junta cronies such as Tay Za and the druglord Lo Hsing Han. Lo is an ethnic Chinese, from BurmaÂ’s traditionally Chinese-populated and opium-rich Kokang region in the countryÂ’s east, bordering China. Lo controls a heroin empire and one of BurmaÂ’s biggest companies, Asia World, which the US Drug Enforcement Agency describes as a front for his drug trafficking. Asia World controls toll roads, industrial parks and trading companies.<br><br>Singapore is the Lo familyÂ’s window to the world, a base for controlling several companies. LoÂ’s son Steven, who has been denied a visa to the US because of his drug links, is married to a Singaporean, Cecilia Ng. The two reportedly control a Singapore-based trading house, Kokang Singapore Pty Ltd. The couple transit Singapore at will. A former US assistant secretary of state for the Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs, Robert Gelbard, has said half of SingaporeÂ’s investment in Burma has been Â“tied to the family of narco-trafficker Lo Hsing HanÂ”.<br><br>Tay Zar, who is linked romantically to a daughter of Than Shwe, is also well known in Singapore. His fleet of Ferrari, Lexus and Mercedes cars was shipped to Burma from Singapore. When on the island, he likes to stay at the tacky Meritus Mandarin hotel on Orchard Road, close to the hospitals favoured by his senior military patrons from Burma.<br><br>Tay Za was featured in the Singaporean media last year toasting the launch of his new airline, Air Bagan, with the head of SingaporeÂ’s aviation authority. Dissident groups say the trade-off for Tay ZaÂ’s government business contracts in Burma is to fund junta leadersÂ’ medical trips to Singapore.<br><br>So when the Australian Prime Minister, John Howard, vows to impose financial sanctions on BurmaÂ’s regime, as he did this week, perhaps he should be calling SingaporeÂ’s bankers rather than AustraliaÂ’s.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>from a very right wing point of view, Singapore has to survive and she sees this pot of gold in Burma that no one wants to touch because of the political instability in the country, but nevertheless goes in to make good investments. And so too does Malaysia and other ASEAN nations. nevermind the ruling military junta, nevermind the oppression.<br><br>This is a very pragmatic stance by the government, a very practical way of doing business. Ethics and business don't really mix well, neither does compassion and other higher virtues.<br><br>ASEAN remains inactive towards the glaring oppression towards the saffron robes march, because too much is at stake, too much money have flowed between borders. To remain 'NATO' is perhaps the best ultilitarian option.<br><br>Although you can feel the injustice, you can feel angry why the world talks about being 'disturbed' by the violence... economic threads run deep in this issue, and no one will sacrifice billions upon billions just for a few monks.<br><br>the sad truth, but it's the world today.</div>
