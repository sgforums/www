Its an insult to taxi drivers. Being a taxi driver is like being an entrepreneur. In buisness, there is bound to be losses arising from poor sales and stiff competition. If a taxi driver has been consistently losing money, I believe it would be wise of the taxi driver to either devise a strategy or adapt to the competitive environment of the buisness. If the taxi driver is unable to do any of the following, then it would be wise for him to withdraw from the buisness and call it a day. Slavery and Buisness are two different subjects.</div>
