              <p>Singaporeans are now faced with the unsavoury choice of exorbitantly-priced HDB flats not cos it was the lack of planning or oversight on the part of the govt. On hindsight, it appears so. The main reason seems to be (or was) that of getting as many foreigners to take up PR/citizenship and of course, even an imbecile can guess – that it is (and was) from the outset a political ploy to hopefully, later elicit or garner votes n at the same time shore up the eroding support of native Singaporeans for PAP.<br>However, the floodgates of PR/citizenship and new arrivals buying flats (don’t forget the often-repeated mantra of exlcusivity of Singaporeans ''come first'' and ''coming first'' seems more  like mere lip service and the policy (ies) has had such repercussions that now, the impact is so tangible and palpable – the blame game has begun in earnest.<br>Singaporeans need to know, and imbibe this anomaly, inequity and unsubscribe to this recalcitrant, heck-care/condescending/know-all attitudes of the incumbent govt.<br>The days of one-nation, nation-buiding was talk lar, talk cock has all evaporated and seems like we have unwittingly by unwise voting allowed their stay in power for too long and painted ourselves to a corner.</p>
              <p>The wise thing and the sane thing is to undo the mistakes by resoundingly giving them a vote – a vote lah, a vote that jarringly ends this stifling, stultifying ''tyranny'' of a one-party strangehold that is slowly but surely manifesting as an ignominy to be Singaporean</p>

              <p>Because Singaporeans are getting more complacent, the high housing price will makes them wake up and work for it. Therefore, real wage will alway lag behind price increases leading to a 2 to 3% inflation with 7% last year being one of the highest.</p>
              <p>Govt knows that Singaporeans work in a way of reach a KPI or target, from school to working life, these target or goal had always being emphasized greatly. Once target reached, peoples will set the next target, now if the prices like home do not increase, people may get complacent and do not set further target leading to laziness and more obesity on the street. Therefore price of goods increases is actually a man(govt) pulling a string on the bull nose toward it target, if the bull dun move, it dun get to eat, live and rest happily, so it will move, and if it move fast, we get a bull run.</p>

              <p>This is a tragedy in  the making....</p>
              <p>Our founding fathers' policy had ALWAYS been to house every citizen, after being kept in slums by our British Colonial overlords. Every Singapore citizen since independence started from zero, for none of us were of royalty and probably only a few brit bootlickers got it made, but very few. Many only knew of slums and grew from there.</p>
              <p>HDB had not only been a national pride, it was also praised by the world, for giving a roof over the heads of us peasants, with modern facilities.</p>
              <p>But over time, greed had overtook us, thanks to FOREIGNERS. First it had been the Hongkies prior to 1997, who came in droves to make a killing, bought up our public housing, thanks to the idiotic and stupid policy of opening our doors wide to them, only to realize that Spore was only a stepping stone for them to flee to Canada.</p>
              <p>But it was too late when the realization came. They jacked up the prices, and sold off even higher before they left, and the policy makers could not back track back to the former prices, as it would mean many of those who bought at high prices would face foreclosure on loans, and a significant portion of them, being voters, was feared by the policy makers. So much for the boast of not fearing to make 'difficult decisions'!</p>
              <p>They next generation suffered and watched even public housing out of their $1000 plus salaries. Worse when the policy makers tried to PANDER to the intellectuals - the new grads, for fearing that they would leave the country, and created Executive Condos using PUBLIC FUNDS!.</p>
              <p>Grads are important to societies, but they must NOT presume that with the diploma, they are entitled to a condo, a car, an office room with a secretary upon graduation. Just like everyone else, we all must work, learn and prove ourselves capable before such rewards fall into place. There is no difference between a mechanic and grad. Both are humans, both earn a living to survive, both are specialist in their field, but most critically, both are contributiong members of a society.</p>
              <p>Not everyone can become a grad, or earn high salaries, not because they are stupid, but because the room at the top is limited, no matter what society one hails from. And no society can survive if all are grads, and neither can it if all are mechanics. There is a mix and both classes of grad and non-grads contribute to the evolution of a society. There is no need to pander to any class or cause elitism to exist. We need each other.</p>
              <p>But today, the contributing members of society who are non-grads have no hope of buying a home of their own, or face steep loan premiums, even with hard work and accepting their low salaries. Where are they going to sleep and money left for a quality and meaningful life if not a prosperous one?</p>
              <p>Or is this another way of nonsensical Eugenics policy - only the intelligent survives? But then who will clean the streets and repair the machines? Foreigners? Be at their mercy? They too come from bigger countries and one day will evolve, then what - our grads and their children become their maids?</p>
              <p>I proposed that for the next plots of land earmarked for public housing with 30 storeys and above should be sold below $100,000. No frills.</p>
              <p>Privatise the existing HDB blocks of flats and let their valuation rise or fall according to market forces. This will please the existing owners as well as the ever insanely hungry overflowing treasury.</p>
              <p>But for true new public housing, such flats be maintained below $100,000 throughout, perhaps at pace with inflation rate at 4% annually, regardless if re-sold.</p>
              <p>It is NUTS and a joke for 'a box in the sky' to cost more than a hundred grand!!!!</p>
              <p>We must not let the non-grads or low wage earners whom are contributing to society feel they are neglected and have no stake. Nor should we treat them on charity case by case basis.</p>
              <p>They need no charity, only honest concern for their honest contributions. These too are the children of our forefathers whom had made our nation great and what it is today.</p>
              <p>It is with hope that the PAP policy makers realize this, admit their errors and be courageous to make true 'difficult' decisions that will give hope to a significant portion of our society. If not, the alienation and neglect will lead to far worse consequences than can be imagined today.</p>
              <p>If the PAP cannot or refuse to acknowledge the housing issue and be true to its founding policies, then members of the society must courageously think of their next generation's livelihood and not be selfish, and will have to vote for whomever cares enough on the plight of the common people, whom form the majority of our society, and whom are the biggest and largest contributors to our society. We must avert this tragedy of neglect today.</p>
              <p>Please inform your family, relatives and friends. Talking about it here is NOT enough. If our basic needs are not met, then there is no point of thinking or supporting the future given by the PAP. Only the elites will survive, but they will be paying a high price to survive. Utilitarianism is a policy of regression back to the jungles, never one of evolution..</p>

              <p>Do you think the sg government will listen to us complianing of the HDB high price? Do you really believe that sg government will stop in taking the rich as PR into Sg? If the world welcome the rich, why sg government should act differently.</p>
