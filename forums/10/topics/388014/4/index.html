              <p>@goofyzell</p>
              <p>as a house owner myself i suggest you better calculate again on the 3 room</p>
              <p>firstly:HDB have a max age of 65 years for loan for 1st time owners which means if your 35 and your wife is say 30 then you can apply for a 30 year loan based on the younger age.</p>
              <p>secondly: there is also an income rebate if say both of you earn less than 3k a month combined, this is in several segment,e.g less thab 1k(combined) abt 30k rebate iirc,1.1 to 1.5k abt 15k etc etc, as your combined earnings is more closer to 3k, the rebate is smaller in amount.</p>
              <p>thirdly: living near parents is already gives you a 40k rebate</p>
              <p>lastly: this is the most important factor but it's under HDB control, since HDB will calculate your combined earnings and see from there if you can afford the flat, since this calculation is broken up right up to the monthly amount to be deducted from your CPF .</p>
              <p>lastly: this rule was implemented in 2007(since i got my house earlier i managed to skip this step) you need to have a cert to qualify that you can take HDB loan. previously before 2007 this cert was issued from HDB i think to people who wanted to or cannot take loan from HDB but have to go to banks  for the loan.</p>
              <p>so thats as much as i know. if btw you are malay , i suggest you recheck the HDB for any other rules or procedures since it might be different fromt the one i stated above.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
