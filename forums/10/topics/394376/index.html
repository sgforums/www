              <h1>PAP has trained 25,000 election officers ahead of the next general election</h1>
              <p><strong>Written by Our Correspondent   </strong></p>
              <p>In a sign that the next election will probably be called sometime this year, the PAP-controlled Elections Department told Straits Times yesterday that “some 25,000 public servants have been trained in preparation for the next general election.”</p>
              <p>Since October 2008, the Elections Department had sent out letters to civil servants informing them to attend the training sessions which involves workshops, E-learnings and simulated exercises on the electoral processes.</p>
              <p>During a parliamentary session last month Deputy Prime Minister Wong Kan Seng said the Electoral Boundaries Review Committee had not convened yet and it takes two to four months for it to complete its electoral boundaries report.</p>
              <p>He was responding to a question by NCMP Sylvia Lim on when the electoral boundaries would be revealed.</p>
              <p>The PAP has the knack of announcing the electoral boundaries only in the last minute on the eve of the polls to thwart the plans of the opposition parties.</p>
              <p>Single wards and even GRCs can “vanish” into thin air suddenly without warning and get “absorbed” into neighboring wards.</p>
              <p>For example, Singapore People Party’s Chairman Sin Kek Tong garnered a respectable 47.1 percent of the votes at the single seat of Braddell Hill during the 1991 general elections.</p>
              <p>He had been actively working the ground there for six years till it was announced a month before the 2007 general election that Braddell Hill had been “absorbed” into Marine Parade GRC.</p>
              <p>The same case happened to Eunos GRC which was only narrowly won by the PAP in the 1988 and 1991 elections. It was literally “wiped off” from the electoral map in subsequent elections.</p>
              <p>Though it is not known when the next election will be, some predicted that it may be held either in the June or December school holidays.</p>
              <p>With public unhappiness against the PAP’s disastrous liberal immigration and pro-foreigner policies at an all time high, it is likely to lose more seats in the next election including GRCs.</p>
              <p>The PAP has been trying hard to include as many new citizens on the electoral register, having updated it twice in the last 12 months alone.</p>
              <p>According to figures from the Home Affairs Ministries, there are about 60,000 new citizens in the last three years who will form an increasingly influential voting bloc.</p>
              <p>Not surprisingly, the PAP has gone out of the way to court the new citizens including splurging a massive $10-million dollar Community Integration Fund to make them feel welcomed in Singapore.</p>
              <p>The next general election is the last time for native Singaporeans to make themselves heard after which they will be completely drowned out by the immigrants whom the PAP is actively importing to replace them in order to perpetuate its political hegemony forever.</p>
