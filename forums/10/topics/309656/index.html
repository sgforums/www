              <p>Anyone receiving the news last week that a dangerous JI detainee had
              escaped from custody would have had an immediate question: How in the
              world did he escape?</p>
              <p>The question is so natural and so obvious that you’d think anyone
              barely paying attention would ask it. Unless, apparently, one worked
              for the national news media – in which case the question of how Mas
              Selamat Kastari escaped was immaterial.</p>
              <p>At least, that’s how it seemed right up to Thursday morning last week. <a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/331477/1/.html"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Channel News Asia</span></a> did not raise the question in its online report, posted a few hours
              after the escape. The Straits Times went to town with the story the
              next morning, carrying dramatic details of the ongoing manhunt in a
              page one story deemed worthy of five bylines, with the news editor
              himself leading the charge. But, apparently, none of them considered
              the “how” question to be newsworthy.</p>
              <p>ST’s competitor <a href="http://www.todayonline.com/articles/240059.asp"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Today</span></a> had a strikingly similar approach on day one, covering the story as if
              it was the National Day Parade: a big show, not requiring the
              activation of any grey cells. Today brands itself on reporting the
              meaning behind the news, because it believes that the mere facts of the
              news are commodities already circulating through electronic media.
              Today's attempt to show that it had something more current and
              value-added than ST – whose headline read, "Massive manhunt" – was the
              headline "Manhunt continues". Like ST, Today's page one story,
              appearing next to its slogan “we set you thinking”, neglected to ask –
              let alone answer – how Mas Selamat escaped.</p>
              <p>Thus, following the mainstream media over the first 24 hours was
              frustrating and farcical. Not because the public must get answers
              instantly – I don’t believe that government or anyone else must serve
              the 24-hour news cycle at the expense of more urgent tasks – but
              because people deserve to know that questions of public interest are
              taken seriously by the journalists who serve them. Journalists can’t
              always find the answers, but they can at least anticipate readers’
              questions.</p>
              <p>You already know this instinctively if you are a professional
              journalist. There’s a standard way of handling unavoidable gaps in your
              story, such as when newsmakers are not ready to answer questions by
              press time: you simply raise the question in your story, and state that
              answers are not yet forthcoming.</p>
              <p>This is exactly what other media did in its initial reports. The
              Associated Press news agency quoted the brief Ministry of Home Affairs
              statement about in the third paragraph of its report, adding
              immediately after, “It did not say how he escaped.”</p>
              <p>Similarly, Canada’s CBC said in the third paragraph of its report,
              “The statement did not say how he escaped.” The International Herald
              Tribune said, “Singapore has one of the tightest security systems in
              the world, and the government gave no details on how he escaped.”</p>
              <p>In Singapore, in the first 24 hours following the escape, it was left to the bizarre combination of <a href="http://theonlinecitizen.com/2008/02/28/bloggers%e2%80%99-reaction-to-ji-leader%e2%80%99s-escape/"><span style="color: #0000ff;">independent bloggers</span></a> and <a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/331726/1/.html"><span style="color: #0000ff;">PAP MPs</span></a> to ask the question that was on everyone’s mind. Singapore’s mainstream media acted as if they didn’t want to know.</p>
              <p>When the national news media are so uniformly guilty of a lapse that
              puts them so clearly out of sync with other opinion shapers – in this
              case, the foreign media, local bloggers and even PAP backbenchers –
              there can be only one logical explanation: media management by the
              government. Editors must have been instructed not to raise the “how”
              question publicly.</p>
              <p>Muffling the media in this way may not have much of an effect on the
              outcome of this particular case. The relevant questions will surface
              anyway, as they already have. Home Affairs Minister Wong Kan Seng has
              already promised an independent inquiry. Foreign Minister George Yeo
              has assured that "what can be made public, will be made public".</p>
              <p>If other fiascos – ranging from the Nicoll Highway disaster to the
              NKF affair and SAF training mishaps – are any guide to how this one
              will play out, citizens will eventually get pretty detailed answers,
              and can then assess for themselves whether there’s been enough
              accountability, transparency and learning on the part of government.</p>
              <p>So, the main impact of the national media’s failure will be felt by
              the media themselves. Every time officials use their political power to
              force the press to act in a way that’s plainly counter to public
              expectations, it will lose credibility – the resource that even
              ministers acknowledge is something the media cannot do without. And
              this at a time of proliferating choice, when the only sensible policy
              option is to invest in the credibility of the nation’s mainstream
              media, as I've tried to argue <a href="http://journalism.sg/2008/02/02/government-needs-to-invest-in-the-credibility-of-the-press/"><span style="color: #810081;">elsewhere</span></a>.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, the die appears to have been cast: political control
              of the national press will be used to ensure that the tough questions
              about the great escape story are asked ever so gently, if at all.
              Journalists will instead give us blanket coverage of the manhunt,
              showing the impressive Singapore law and order system in action.</p>
              <p>On Sunday, day four of ST's coverage, news editor Carl Skadian
              finally acknowledged, "To most people, the questions uppermost in their
              minds were 'how did he do it?' and 'how could something like this
              happen in Singapore?'" Not that this made a jot of difference to ST's
              coverage. This statement was buried in the 4th leg of an article on the
              last of six pages of a package otherwise devoted to such minutiae as
              the use of MMS to spread the Wanted man's picture and how Mas Selamat
              got his limp.</p>
              <p>Treating citizens as if they were brain-dead will not make them so;
              they will simply migrate to other media that take them more seriously.</p>

              <p>2. On day five of its coverage, <a href="http://www.todayonline.com/articles/240769.asp"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Today</span></a> finally runs a hard-hitting (by mainstream media standards) column by
              its chief P N Balji, criticising the government for its bunker
              mentality in releasing information.</p>

              <p>Their definition of a constructive media is one that constructive in covering their asses when they make mistakes or give biased coverage of neighbouring countries such as Taiwan.
