            <div class='col-md body'>there is definitely a decline in moral standards in singapore whether criminals or not!<br><br>Better education,<br>Smarter criminals<br>A decline in street crimes; replaced by big-money white-collar offences.<br>By Seah Chiang Nee, littlespeck.com<br>Jan 27, 2007<br><br>THE rapid transformation of Singapore into a global city with a large influx of foreigners has resulted in social disruptions, but a feared upsurge in crime is not one of them.<br><br>This is one of the better stories to emerge from this rapidly changing country and its fast-rising population in recent years.<br><br>Newsweek last week succinctly asked a question that is in the mind of many people: Â“The island's economy is booming. So why are so many citizens worse off than they were 10 years ago?Â”<br><br>The cause is a rising level of poverty and a stagnating middle class income in the past five years Â– while costs have gone up Â– all of which had raised fears that crime would dramatically worsen.<br><br>Besides, new technology today allows crooks from abroad to cheat the unwary without even setting foot here.<br><br>Well, miraculously it hasnÂ’t happened.<br><br>In fact, the latest police statistics showed a significant 10% decline in crime in 2006, with cases falling from 37,093 (in 2005) to 33,393.<br><br>They covered all index crimes, especially rioting, housebreaking, robbery and cheating as well as car theft, most of which are usually associated with poverty.<br><br>Even mobile phone crimes, the 21st century curse, fell. Youth offences, which account for one-fifth of the total, dropped by 30%.<br><br>SingaporeÂ’s pattern of crime has been changing in the past 20 years in tandem with the rise in education, wealth and new technology.<br><br>But as criminals became worldly-wise, the trend has ostensibly moved from violent offences, which bring less money and stronger punishment, to more profitable white-collar crimes.<br><br>They include fraud, product piracy, deception, commercial scams, computer offences, and bribery.<br><br>There are fewer hard drug offenders, secret society members (replaced by teenage gangs) and robbery syndicates which used to operate in large numbers during the less developed era.<br><br>Today the crooks are more likely to be suit-wearing CEOs and directors, lawyers, bankers or computer experts who dine in five-star hotels and travel first-class.<br><br>According to the latest statistics, computer crimes (unheard of 20 years ago) now number about 60 a year.<br><br>A new breed of white-collar criminals has been grabbing world headlines in recent years, stirring its very core tenet of protecting investorsÂ’ interests.<br><br>One of SingaporeÂ’s selling points has been its low-crime, stable environment for businessmen and citizens.<br><br>Recent instances of misuse of funds amounting to tens of millions of dollars by CEOs of charity bodies have dealt corporate image and trust a serious blow.<br><br>Some mega-frauds include the following:<br><br>Â·Singapore Airlines supervisor Toe Cheng Kyat embezzled some S$35mil (RM80.5mil) from his company. He was sentenced to 24 years' jail;<br><br>Â·A bigger cheat, casino high-roller Chia Teck Leng, an executive of Asia Pacific Breweries (Singapore) was found guilty of cheating four banks, siphoning off a staggering A$190mil (RM513mil). His crime spree spread over four years;<br><br>Â·Next Kwek Chee Tong, 53, former managing director of public-listed Kian Ho Bearings, got nine years' jail for misappropriating more than S$5mil (RM11.5mil) of company money;<br><br>Â·In 2004 China Aviation Oil (CAO) chief executive Chen Jiulin was sentenced to 51 months' jail in connection with the companyÂ’s US$550mil (RM1.9bil) trading scandal; and<br><br>Â·Earlier, Nick Leeson, a 28-year-old derivatives trader at the Singapore office of Barings PLC, BritainÂ’s oldest merchant bank, lost over US$1.4bil (RM4.9bil) betting on Nikkei futures. It wiped out the bank's equity capital.<br><br>Not all white-collar thieves are managers or the well-heeled; the majority, in fact, are ordinary employees like clerks, IT workers or bank employees who have something in common, the trust of the company.<br><br>Some time ago, for example, a secretary was convicted of forging more than 70 cheques totalling S$1.5mil (RM3.45mil) over two years and was jailed six-and-a-half years.<br><br>This trend indicates that, unlike many developing countries, the crime motivation in Singapore has more to do with human greed than poverty. But it also marks a decline in moral standards.<br><br>Secondly, the influx of foreigners has had an impact on crime since they caused 19% of it, but this was less than popularly believed. Foreigners make up 28% of the population.<br><br>Singapore has always taken a tough punitive stand on the belief that crime and the ambition to be a global hub cannot live side by side.<br><br>So has the spate of major commercial cases cut business trust?<br><br>In a 2005 global survey, international PricewaterhouseCoopers looked into the impact of rising commercial crime on international business confidence, and has a section on Singapore.<br><br>Â“Fraud (is) a significant and growing threat worldwide,Â” the survey said in a synopsis.<br><br>The survey found that 45% (2003: 37%) of international companies reported having suffered fraud in the last two years. The number of victim companies rose by 22% since 2003.<br><br>Singapore was in better shape, with only 16% of companies surveyed reporting having fallen victim Â– compared with 39% region-wide.<br><br>The republic saw a sharp 50% decline in the number of victim firms; two years ago it was 32%.<br><br>Although the numbers are down, the survey found the republic recording the biggest frauds (in money terms) than most countries in the world, on a per capita basis.<br><br>Â“The average cost of economic crime in Singapore was US$4mil (RM14mil), significantly higher than the global and regional averages of US$1.7mil (RM5.95mil) and US$1.6mil (RM5.6mil),Â” said the global professional services firm.<br><br>With the proposed large foreign influx, the future could change when its population reaches seven million in 20 years.<br><br>And the social impact of becoming a casino city remains uncertain.</div>
