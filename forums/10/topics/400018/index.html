              <p>Do Singaporean males have to step up if we want more babies?</p>
              <p>In a letter to the <em>Straits Times </em>forum on Thursday, <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=AWARE&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz"><span style="color: #334499;">women’s rights group AWARE </span></a>wrote that Singapore has not seen a reversal in the decline of fertility rates because Singaporean fathers are not rising to the task of child rearing. It also believes that state support for equal parenting roles is not adequate.</p>
              <p>New executive director of AWARE, <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=AWARE+Corinna+Lim&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz"><span style="color: #334499;">Ms Corinna Lim</span></a>, expressed that while many people think that Singaporean women have achieved greater gender equality, compared with other states like Australia and Britain where the Total Fertility Rate (TFR) is now increasing, Singapore is lagging far behind.</p>
              <p>Her views echo that of  noted <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=Hans+Rosling&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz"><span style="color: #334499;">Swedish Professor Hans Rosling</span></a>, who was recently interviewed by the same paper. In his interview, he suggested fairer employment and government policies would lead to greater gender equity, which in turn, would boost Singapore’s birth rate.</p>
              <p>Rosling compared Singapore’s situation with that of pro-family, pro-baby Sweden, a close cousin to Singapore in terms of income and infant mortality rate. He pointed out the two countries are moving in opposite directions when it comes to fertility rates — Sweden climbing to a 16-year high of 1.94, while Singapore plummeting to a mere 1.23.</p>
              <p>In her letter, Lim writes this is because “in the last 30 years, women have entered the workplace in droves. More girls graduate from our universities than boys. However, these changes are asymmetrical. Men have not moved into the domestic sphere at the same rate.” </p>
              <p>She adds that this makes raising a child “less attractive” for career women if she has to “bear the bulk of the childcare burden”.</p>
              <p>In contrast, she writes, “Her husband does not lose sleep about balancing work and family life.”</p>
              <p>Sharing Professor Rosling’s calls for fairer work-place policies, Lim goes on to ask why the government only mandates four months’ paid maternity leave, but not a day of paternity leave. She also called for better support structures for flexi-work arrangements and family-friendly work environments.  </p>
              <p>A recent question we asked on Yahoo! Answers on “<a href="http://sg.answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Ah_kqW6PdhoTN88SKPAiLVDty6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20100225204641AAyhKyF"><span style="color: #334499;">Why are Singaporeans not having enough babies?”</span></a> drew over 1,000 responses.</p>
              <p>Now’s your turn. Do you agree with Ms Lim?</p>
              <p>Is greater gender equality the solution to Singapore’s Big Baby problem?</p>

              <p><br>wha lau, aunty also want...hahaha...</p>
              <p>Why take a european professor to comment on our Asian birthrate problem?? I bet lots of Singapore men are sharing family burden now a day too, even tho as a lady, i think singapore men are better than taiwanese or china guys.</p>
              <p>Take for example in taiwan, a wife have to serve the husband nicely, come home, take off his shoes, prepare his food and water for bathing, massage for him, and allow him to go out to enjoy if he wish to go out. The men there really enjoy life. Here the sing men are better, they listen to wife, bring family out, give money to wife, take care and fix  all household problem.</p>

Since gender is getting more equal, why should women be the ones going through pain of delivery a baby ? Women blame men not taking care of babies, yet they want men to work and supply them with money.</p>

              <p>In traditional rural societys, women accept their role as women, staying at home giving birth, looking over the house, while the men strike it out and bring the bacon home. In society now, women are more educated, why stay at home for 9 months when they can go out and earn money ? Do you really understand what the passage is talking about ?</p>
