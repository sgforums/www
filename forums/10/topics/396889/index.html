              <p>Some time ago, in France, there was a political controversy when the son of the president, named Jean Sarkozy, a 23 year old young man, put forward his candidacy for a mayorship of one of capital city's most prestigious area.</p>
              <p>At that time, there was some pro and con voices.</p>
              <p>The con voices, said, that it is an example of nepotism, and that the young man is obviously inexperienced and incompetent for the job.</p>
              <p>However, there are also some important people who voiced their support.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For example,</p>
              <p>The previous chief of that region said : "In souls nobly born, valour does not depend upon age"</p>
              <p>The president of the employer union, said : "fantastic that a young and motivated man may want to be at the head of the largest business district in France"</p>
              <p>Likewise, Nicolas Sarkozy defended his son by saying that:</p>
              <p>"it's never
              good when someone is attacked in an excessive manner for no reason",<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Sarkozy#cite_note-8"></a></sup> not long however after having been mocked by some French medias for
              having fiercely underlined during an unrelated speech on high school
              reform that "what matters in France to succeed does not anymore relate
              to birth privileges, rather, to succeed, it is important to work hard
              and to have demonstrated significant skills at school, at work."</p>
              <p>There were also voices from his party, UMP Party,  who supported Jean Sarkozy candidacy.</p>
              <p>I personally think that this French saga is interesting. It is interesting to me because here it is spread wide open in broad daylight, a drama and a show. We can observe and glean some important pointers on how people's minds work. For me it is ridiculous and it's an example of a silver-spoon-fed blue blooded "prince" being helicopter-dropped for no reason other than his hereditary line. Obviously he is not suitable for the job. He barely even graduated from University yet at that time.</p>
              <p>But whats interesting is that there are some bigwigs and serious people, who rationalized and internalized some wicked and twisted logic, to becoming the supporters of Jean Sarkozy. This is funny and somehow, it reminds me of some similar cases in some other countries.</p>
