Last few elections I voted PAP but now I changed becous PAP are too arrogant, they just demolish the opponents (strong one like Francis Seow, JBJ, Tang Liang Hong, Chee Soon Juan) and the recent one Gomez, because these opponents are good oratory speakers which I think PAP candidates cant fight with them. For now I will support the oppositions until PAP change their attitude, if I have problems I wont find the MP in the meet the ppl session becos they cant help us, they can write letters only, which I know how to write only, all the laws are already fixed by the parliament, so they cant help us, they only can write letter on behalf of us to the relevant authority, so no point queue up few hours to see them.</div>
