Very very affordable: $16/mth per $100,000 sum assured. Best in the market.<br><br>Maybe the SAF should do more to educate all NSFs, regulars and NSmen the importance of insurance. After all, so many Singaporeans stil hold a negative view of insurance.</div>

I don't think the average man in the SAF quite simply has no means to afford such expensive insurance. Do not forget that that a good bulk of NSFs in the army who do not possess poly education whatsoever. In fact, I am curious as to how many BMT courses are conducted for people below poly.

So even if a serviceman is permanently disabled on the left arm but he can still be a cleaner, yeh....no TOTAL payout. However, there will be a partial payout, maybe 30-50%.</div>

An officer or key appointment holder now rakes in a monthly allowance of &gt;1K. Knowing how this govt works, the likelihood of any 'complimentary coverage' on personal insurance will be offset by a reduction of wages paid to the NSF.<br><br>In essence, the NSF will likely end up paying for his own insurance, carefully crafted to look like the govt is providing 'free insurance'' coverage. Take with the left and give with the right is surely the best way to balance the books with this govt.<br><br>It will be wishful thinking on our part if we expect MINDEF to extend a blanket insurance coverage for all NSF, including reservists.</div>
