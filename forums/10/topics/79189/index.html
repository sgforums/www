Most think it is cool to have a bf/gf at age 15/16. Some are even very open abt. being gay. Shouldn't they be taught it is better to wait?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i think its futile to try to stop them. the more u do so the more they are likely to wan to try. and peer pressure may be great too.<br><br>i would recommend these - u can tell them u hope they dont do it now, but if they wan to carry on, yes they can, but set boundaries - like wat they can and cannot do, and make sure their studies are not affected, etc. and in fact, it would be better if u ask them to bring their frens back - at least then u would noe wat kind of company he/she is mixing with.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yup. I agree with wuming. These kind of affections are natural in teenage years and is definitely not totally controllable.<br><br>We definitely can set rules. Like making sure your studies are stable and doing well and the relationship with their family is still going strong. It is not encourageable for youngsters to make their boy/girl relationship a leading part of their current lives.<br><br>Barring them from these kind of things even made worse, because they just want to satisfy their own curiosity, they will still go ahead with parents' acknowledgement.<br><br>Worst, without parents' acknowledgement, parents may not even know what their kids were doing till they found out and make big fuss over it. But what can the parents do then? Ground them for life?<br><br>Although the amount of maturity sense in youngsters nowadays is still superficial, it is an important learning process in how they handle their relationships.<br><br>Hence there is often "breaking up and patching up" in which these kind of things are often seen in the youngsters relationships depicts that the maturity sense in them is still not mature. The threshold of withstanding and understanding in them is still not strong.<br><br>But they will defintely learn from these BGR events as milestones of their lives.<br><br>Teaching them to wait is one possible family moral that parents can input, but when these kind of young affections come into a youngster's life, they come. So parents should also learn to accept that this kind of things come naturally.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi, i'm a 16 year old guy who has been in a relationship since sec2. my current gf is my first and we've been together for about 3-4 years now. from my own personal experience, there are two main groups of ppl going to relationships. one is those that go for lust without thinking of anything. the other group is those who are serious in love. i have many friends who, unlike what most older adults think, stay in their relationships for many many years without a major incident. however, there is the other group who f**k and throw kind. these go for lust only. the approx ratio of those serious to non serious, in my class at least, works out to be 50:50.<br><br>when parents feel that BGRs at this age is not good at all, it is not totally true. speaking about the ppl who are serious(those who aren't, obviously isnt  a good thing), BGRs that affect studies are rare to find. in fact, among my friends who have relationships, their results actually improved steadily, as both encourage each other. in my case, i can safely say that my gf helped me alot in studies as well. when i was down, she would encourage me to study and taught me maths and science. if she was down, i would do the same back to her. for these ppl, BGR actually teach the guys how to act more maturely and more gentlemanly. girl our age tend to be more...cultured, and thus to please them, we make small sacrifices like dressing more neatly and shaving cleanly.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br>however, i have got nothing to say about ppl who don't treat relationships seriously. i don't have much respect for these ppl who jump girls or guys after only a week or two.</div>

Yes, it is the duty of the parents to communicate with the kids abt. the consequences of going into a relationship early eg abortion, depression, sch. work distraction etc. But sad to say, not many parents have the time &amp; energy as they are busy working.

            <div class='col-md body'>i think these are all pure generalisation.<br>there are kids who are matured, adults who are matured, and who say adults cannot be immatured?<br>why are there raping cases, lust, and whatever indecency portrayed by adults? Even adults hit and abuse their "life long" mates?<br>as in the case of one of the replies above, i can say that he is true. he has a gf of 3 yrs to 4 yrs, which we may not know any intimacy is on, but no matter whether you are adult or kid, a relationship is still a relation where intimacy is also part of it. Its all about if you respect the opposite or not.<br>i personally feel that BGR is not a big issue that our schools has made it out off. But these are due to people who still do not take them seriously. We may have a western culture, but still i think responsibility and respect plays a big part. Therefore, BGR is not a problem on its own, it's the mind of the kids.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hahaha looking at you older generations makes me laugh<br><br>Are we as oldies bi-t-c-hi-ng about the young simply because we are jealous that they have it good now when we had it bad when we were young? Are we simply just pissed off that they can get dates at such a young age when we lost our virginity at 25? Are we simply envious because our younger generations appear to have more fun than us?<br><br>Or is it that we as older generations have this instinctive need to control and repress percieved inferiors (young people)?<br><br>Well it seems that way. As long as 2 people are happy and the relationship is feasible in a way that they both are satisfied, let it go on. Its not our relationship, its theirs.<br><br>"So stfu, unless your bigger than me to change my mind with physical authority (which is what most authority is)." That is my philosophy in life.</div>
