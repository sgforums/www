It is supposed to be a system called meritocracy (also recently told to the Russians), leadership or talent system.<br><br>We are seeing a lot of cock and bull, drama, look-good policies like asset enhancement scheme or CPF retirement scheme which came to naught.<br><br>Yet the leaders are proudly telling the Russians that our meritocracy has been widely successful by talking about a few statistics without mentioning the negatives in our domestic front and all the assets failures and highest mortgage debts suffered by the people and our highest costs of living as compared to the falling level of wages.<br><br>The same double talk hypocrisy happened to bus fare increases and refusals to lower the high medical cost too. When challenged by the people who asked for facts, they refused to give facts to justify more increases but then come election time, someone would quietly re-do the whole calculations which showed that actually there was no problems not to include land costs or rentals which were already paid by taxpayers in the first place.<br><br>Then after some more creative accounting, Buangkok station does not incur that much loss any more or that medical costs need not be that high if they take out the consultants' high costs or other over-charge created due to creactive accounting. Of course, even layman can easily understand that a system that runs on recovering all costs is not government but a business corporation. If government wants to run Singapore like a business corporation then it cannot collect tax but offers itself for bidding of ministers' positions to save more costs.<br><br>So the system is one based on hypocrisy so people have to judge what is correct or truthful news all the time and all some good news may come with hidden motives which at the end spell disasters for the whole population.<br><br>Hypocrisy is the system of our governance which may be ultimately worse than all the authoritarianism and totalitarianism put together.</div>

It is supposed to be a system called meritocracy (also recently told to the Russians), leadership or talent system.<br><br>We are seeing a lot of cock and bull, drama, look-good policies like asset enhancement scheme or CPF retirement scheme which came to naught.<br><br>Yet the leaders are proudly telling the Russians that our meritocracy has been widely successful by talking about a few statistics without mentioning the negatives in our domestic front and all the assets failures and highest mortgage debts suffered by the people and our highest costs of living as compared to the falling level of wages.<br><br>The same double talk hypocrisy happened to bus fare increases and refusals to lower the high medical cost too. When challenged by the people who asked for facts, they refused to give facts to justify more increases but then come election time, someone would quietly re-do the whole calculations which showed that actually there was no problems not to include land costs or rentals which were already paid by taxpayers in the first place.<br><br>Then after some more creative accounting, Buangkok station does not incur that much loss any more or that medical costs need not be that high if they take out the consultants' high costs or other over-charge created due to creactive accounting. Of course, even layman can easily understand that a system that runs on recovering all costs is not government but a business corporation. If government wants to run Singapore like a business corporation then it cannot collect tax but offers itself for bidding of ministers' positions to save more costs.<br><br>So the system is one based on hypocrisy so people have to judge what is correct or truthful news all the time and all some good news may come with hidden motives which at the end spell disasters for the whole population.<br><br>Hypocrisy is the system of our governance which may be ultimately worse than all the authoritarianism and totalitarianism put together.</div></blockquote>You are just thinking too much<br><br>Why are your mixing politics and this?<br><br>In the 1st place, if your think it is easy to reopen a closed station, go work with the rail operator and those ppl that does the printing for the MRT map<br><br>In the 1st place, this and politics dun mix...<br><br>Anyway, if your are talking abt inflations, who caused it? It is not the govt, but it is us citizens... How? We have been asking for higher wages which brings up higher cost and higher food, transport cost</div>

It is not just about one problem - difficulty in opening the Buangkok station which the minister refused to open earlier. The decision not to open it until 2008 has not been very open or accountable in the first instance. So, I don't see anything wrong with my comments about creative accounting and hypocrisy in making such a decision which then was changed nearer election time with a double-talk that the original calculation about losses was not so right.<br><br>Anything wrong with citizens expressing views from an overall perspetive which you term as "thinking too much". Don't you think that when you present any views or opinions in any argument or topic, you have to be objective from the overall perspective ?<br><br>While citizens might have asked for higher salaries, the government is in charge of policies and actions of government.<br><br>So you must realize that it is the responsibility of government not to run away from any problems like high costs and they themselves must not implement policies like the Goh Keng Swee doctrine to cause our high costs and losses of economic competitiveness.<br><br>We as people are not in charge except that we should not give up efforts in getting the wrongs right and getting the government to listen to reason. That has been the main stumbling block to all the problems as posted in PGPB. Only when a person is part of government or beneficiary in some way or another we can understand why he is saying things to keep to the status quo. But such a person also cannot deny the  truths.</div>

The only thing are making noises is because they say they are willing to walk or whatever, but when the station opens, would ppl really do that? They just want the thing available when they needs it...</div>
