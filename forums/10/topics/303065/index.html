Why does the government not listen to our concerns?" said a protester surnamed Guan, adding the extension would pass within 100 metres (328 ft) of her house.<br><br>As police cordoned off the city government in People's Square, once home to a race track in Shanghai's colonial heyday, demonstrators took off down the fashionable Nanjing Road shopping area.<br><br>The protest was the largest the cosmopolitan and wealthy city has seen since thousands took to the streets in sometimes violent anti-Japanese demonstrations in 2005.<br><br>"I'm marching against the proposed line as it's too close to town. It's going to be noisy and emit pollution," said another protester, who would only give his family name, Liu.<br><br>"If you have a house near the line, you will not be able to sell it for as much money," he added.<br><br>Some demonstrators handed out anti-Nazi resistance poems in German, while others sang the Chinese national anthem.<br><br>In a prepared statement, a spokesman for the Shanghai city government said authorities had "persuaded" the protesters to disperse because they were affecting public order.<br><br>He said the government was still in the process of showing to the public a proposal for the maglev project, which would help to improve the transport system of the city and the whole country.<br><br>"We hope city residents will go through legal channels to express their opinions rationally, and not use methods that affect public order," he added.<br><br>The protest gradually dispersed peacefully under a light drizzle in the early evening. The police kept their distance as people left.<br><br>The country is grappling with an acknowledged rise in unrest, driven by anger at illegal land grabs, corruption, environmental woes and a rising rich-poor gap, though large scale protests in big cities are rare.<br><br>"Yes, it's an illegal protest. But we've been pushed into a corner," said another protester.<br><br>EXTENSION PLAN "SAFE"<br><br>China has the only commercial maglev in operation in the world, developed and built by the government and a German consortium including industrial giant Siemens.<br><br>Launched in 2003, the maglev floats on a magnetic cushion over a distance of 30 kilometres between an outlying part of Shanghai's financial district in Pudong and the international airport.<br><br>.........................................................................................................................<br>.........................................................................................................................<br><br>Source: <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUKPEK32757920080112?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=worldNews" rel="nofollow">http://uk.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUKPEK32757920080112?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=worldNews</a></div>

Police will 1st tell them to go away..... only arresting them is if they refuse..... they will then be question and release on bail. Most time, they are fine a few thousands bucks. The reason that these protester are in prison was because they refuse to pay and want to be Martyr for their cause..... the sentence is mostly 1-2 weeks jail. Non are beaten up or killed.......<br><br>The reason S'poreans are scare to protest is mainly due to fear of losing their Jobs if they are arrested....... <strong>Without money in S'pore, U are a NOBODY  </strong><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" title="Exclamation"><br><br>Sadly, It is NOT the Govt which is preventing S'porean to protest..... <span style="color: red;"><strong>but S'porean themselves who doesn't wants to RISK their present lifestyle</strong></span>.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>

When I asked them they said they are here to earn $ and when time is up they will go back.   Some of them expressed that they prefer the way the china govt is treating the people of China.   So far feedback from the china chinese is that they prefer to be paid pension but PAP gahmen don't practise this and they find that the china govt take better care of the nation.     Anyway, I am surprised to know about the China govt taking better care of the people compared to PAP.  Before receiving these feedback and info, I thought China govt are  worse than PAP where taking care of the people is concerned.</div>
