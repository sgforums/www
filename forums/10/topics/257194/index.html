Here's what he said:<br><br><blockquote>The Palestinian people does not exist. The creation of a Palestinian state is only a means for continuing our struggle against the state of Israel for our Arab unity. In reality today there is no difference between Jordanians, Palestinians, Syrians and Lebanese. Only for political and tactical reasons do we speak today about the existence of a Palestinian people, since Arab national interests demand that we posit the existence of a distinct "Palestinian people" to oppose Zionism.<br><br>For tactical reasons, Jordan, which is a sovereign state with defined borders, cannot raise claims to Haifa and Jaffa, while as a Palestinian, I can undoubtedly demand Haifa, Jaffa, Beer-Sheva and Jerusalem. However, the moment we reclaim our right to all of Palestine, we will not wait even a minute to unite Palestine and Jordan. </blockquote>think about it <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Plenty of ignoramus in Sgforums. Read this BBC article:<br><br>"Forty years after the Middle East war of 1967 and nearly 60 since the establishment of Israel, there is no Arab-Israeli issue that remains as utterly divisive as the fate of Palestinian refugees.<br><br>In the course of Israel's creation in 1948 and its occupation of the West Bank and Gaza in 1967, more than half the Arabs of pre-1948 Palestine are thought to have been displaced.<br><br>Today there are millions of Palestinians living in exile from homes and land their families had inhabited for generations.<br><br>Many still suffer the legacy of their dispossession: destitution, penury, insecurity.<br><br>Palestinian historians, and some Israelis, call 1948 one of the biggest, most comprehensive examples of ethnic cleansing in history - perpetrated by the Haganah (later the Israeli Defence Forces) and armed Jewish gangs.<br><br>Official Israeli history, by contrast, says most Palestinian refugees left to avoid battle or at the behest of Arab leaders, though it admits a "handful" of expulsions and unauthorised killings.<br><br>What is undisputed is that the refugees' fate is excluded from most Israeli-Palestinian peace efforts because, given a right of return, their numbers endanger the future of the world's only Jewish state.<br><br>The issue of the refugees is therefore seen by many Israelis as an existential one.<br><br>Massive displacement<br><br>Four million UN-registered Palestinian refugees trace origins to the 1948 exodus; 750,000 people belong to families displaced in 1967 - many for the second time. Palestinian advocacy group Badil says another million and a half hail from pre-1948 Palestine but were not UN-registered, while an additional 274,000 were internally displaced inside Israel after 1948, and 150,000 were displaced in the occupied territories after 1967.<br><br>That makes more than six million people, one of the biggest displaced populations in the world.<br><br>Israel steadfastly argues that all refugees - and it disputes the numbers - should relinquish any aspirations to return to what is now its territory, and instead be absorbed by Arab host countries or by a future Palestinian state.<br><br>It disavows moral responsibility by arguing that 800,000 Mizrahi Jews were displaced from Arab countries between 1945 and 1956 (most of whom settled in Israel) and insists Palestinians left willingly.<br><br><strong>But that view is at odds with UN General Assembly Resolution 194 and Article 13 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.<br><br>Resolution 194 asserts the refugees' unconditional right of return to live at peace in their old homes or to receive compensation for their losses. </strong><br><br>Disputed status<br><br>Whatever the rights and wrongs of their cause, the practicality of return and questions of moral justice, in Mid-East diplomacy the refugees' fate has been largely ignored.<br><br>This has been achieved by a dual process pegging all solutions to the Arab-Israeli conflict to the 1967 war, and discounting the events of 1948 as a element of the conflict.<br><br>Israel has effectively deployed a number of arguments to justify this, such as saying that it is the only Jewish state, the refuge of Jews from around the world, while there are 22 Arab countries where the refugees could go.<br><br>It also points out that UN General Assembly resolutions have no force under international law and says the unassimilated refugee population has been held hostage by frontline Arab states waiting for Israel's destruction.<br><br>The diplomatic focus on 1967 has been advantageous for Israel: territory occupied at that time is regarded as the entire problem, and solutions can therefore be limited to dividing up that land.<br><br>This is problematic for Palestinians, however, because it sidelines the Nakba, the "catastrophe" of 1948 - an issue that for them lies at the heart of the conflict.<br><br>Demographic prerogative<br><br>Palestinians accuse Israel of a kind of "Nakba-denial", absolving itself of liability, but thereby condemning itself to perpetual conflict with its Arab neighbours.<br><br>Israel vigorously denies such a characterisation. Official histories justify what happened in 1948 by saying the new Jewish state was threatened with annihilation by invading Arab armies.<br><br>But so-called revisionist Israeli historians say Israel's founding prime minister, David Ben-Gurion, exaggerated the Arab threat, so he could implement a covert plan to expel Palestinian civilians and grab as much of the former Palestine as possible.<br><br>Demography - the need to have a large majority of Jews to sustain a Jewish state - has certainly been a key concern for Israel since its foundation.<br><br><strong>Under a 1947 UN-sanctioned plan to partition Palestine, Israel would have been established on 55% of the former territory, and without a significant transfer of population the Jews in that territory would have scarcely have exceeded the Arab population there. </strong><br><br>The 1948 war ended with Israel in control of 78% of the former Palestine, with a Jewish-Arab ratio of 6:1.<br><br>The equation brought security for Jewish Israelis, but emptied hundreds of Palestinian villages and towns of 700,000 inhabitants - the kernel of the Palestinian refugee problem today.<br><br>With the justification of not wanting to jeopardise its Jewish majority, Israel has kept Palestinian refugees and their descendants out of negotiations on a settlement to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.<br><br>But for most Palestinians, their fate remains an open wound, unless there is a Middle East peace deal that acknowledges what happened to the refugees."<br><br>(http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/6659239.stm)<br><br>Israel will never allow the refugees back, many of whom are still holding the title deeds to theor homes. Neither will the palestinians give up their homeland nor should they. The israel-palestinian problem will never be solved unless Israel commits genocide and wipe out every single palestinian (which it cannot do) or the palestinians succeed in driving every single Jew out to the sea (even more unlikely). Therefore, these two people are fated to continue the daily tit-for-tat targeted killing, suicide bombing, missle attack, kidnapping.....<br><br></div>

Israel achieved its independence from Britain after years of launching terrorist attacks. How quickly have people forgotten that Zionist terrorists of the Stern Gang assassinated Lord Moyne, the British Minister of State with responsibilities for Middle East. Israeli terrorists (the Irgun) blew up the King David Hotel in Jerusalem in 1946, killing or injuring more than 200 persons.<br><br>The Irgun was a terrorist organization based on the premises formulated by Ze'ev Jabotinsky that "every Jew had the right to enter Palestine; only active retaliation would deter the Arabs and the British; only Jewish armed force would ensure the Jewish state". (Howard Sachar: A History of the State of Israel, pps 265-266 ). Guess who ordered the bombing of the King David Hotel? None other than Menachem Begin, who became the prime minister of Israel. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_David_Hotel_bombing)<br><br>Might is right. Terrorists become freedom fighters and monsters become prime ministers provided they win the war. As for the future, at the rate Palestinians are reproducing, the time will come when they can send half the population as suicide bombers and yet have more than enough left over to produce another generation to take over.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, I think the majority of Palestinians and Israelis would like to lead simple, peaceful, secure and prosperous lives. However, the Palestinian diaspora have nothing on which to build their lives on. They have no land, and they have no rights. Such a situation tends to breed despair, which leads to anger, which turns to hatred, which is the path to the dark side....</div>
