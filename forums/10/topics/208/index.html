Their life is more shit than yours and they dun get better treatment than you...maybe with exception of those who wear the jungle hat one {u noe who i mean lah}. Since you did not go through the commander course than your BOZO and PS go thru', means u cannot take part in the planning and organisation that they do in the signal's office...just take it in stride...2 1/2 yrs can one lah...I just think of how much my other collegues have to suffer in S Company compared to myself...Take small comfort in little blessings and ur NS life will be easier<br><blockquote><strong><br>In fact,you can even catch them slacking in the company mess while my platoon and I are doing senseless sai-gang.<br></strong></blockquote><br><br>Well...like laying wires around the camp ? You don't expect your BOZO and PS to do that right...put yourself in their shoes<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>I remember once when we had to forego our night-off in order to prepare stores for some large-scale exercise the next day.But our blood boiled when we saw our PC booking out in CV.His reason? Grandmother's birthday...naaaabeh!<br></strong></blockquote><br><br>Be thankful that you don't need to do stores until 2 a.m. in the morning...crawl up at 4 a.m. for exercise.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>The bad thing about being a signaller is that you will be activated even for exercises at commander level...(to be signallers for the PSOs mah...).As a result,my platoon had several weekends burnt.<br></strong></blockquote><br><br>THAT is not activation ....it is called attachment. But come on....compare to the rifleman staying in the self scrap in the pouring rain...while you are in some nice shelther manning commns for them....who has a better life ?<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>But my PC and PS would always find excuses not to le us clear all those extra off days.<br>Reason 1:no time,got a lot of exercises coming up<br>Reason 2:OC don't allow<br>yeah...lame...<br>I've got a friend who has up to 10 days of off being burnt and not 1 single day has been returned to him.<br></strong></blockquote><br><br>Although your father pay taxes for the army, he does not own the army. Do you think it is possible to give off and lieave just like that? There are so many proper channels to go through from BOZO side to S1 side just to get your leave<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>Ever since injuring my knee for SOC,I hav been in and out of the medical centre for a few months until recently,I got a permanent downgrade to PES C2L2.Even though I'm no longer fit to hav a combat vocation,my PC is still trying his best to keep me inside the platoon.To do what,u tell me?In fact,I am still deployed to go outfield to lay D-10 cables.(C2L2 still must go outfield,but can only be in rear party)That was when my injury got worse and I had no choice but to go for a knee operation,which explains why I can be at home now relating my NS experiences to u all.(ATTC mah)<br></strong></blockquote><br><br>Uncle....I got a platoon mate who fractured his arm and still has to be a PSO signaller and WALK. He does not mind the pain and try to fit in with the platoon and share in their woes...this is what I call professional soldierism. As a line man...you don't even need to walk...can't you just help out your poor suffering platoon mates a little by doing what little you can ? I am not asking you to carry two cottage cheese and run 15 km you know...but just to lay CP commns etc...And to add insult to the injury...your friends are undergoing ATTC while you are shaking leg at home and typing this mail...come on...this makes you no better than your BOZO.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>Frankly speaking,all my good impression of SAF and NS was shattered by the people in my unit,X,especially my PC and PS.They get all the credit for our hard work(believe me,I've seen S3 and CO praising them in person b4),but they,in turn,never commend us for a job well done after a siong exercise,not even once.<br></strong></blockquote><br><br>You think this is JC or Poly izzit where teachers praise you for little nice projects done? This is the first step to the real world friend...Just take pride in your work...why must other's praise matter that much?<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>U know what,after entering the army,I have degenerated into this conniving,bo chap slacker,always thinking of ways to siam sai-gang which I no longer take pride in doing because of the actions of my commanders....I was never like that in JC.....<br></strong></blockquote><br><br>You allowed yourself to degenerate as such...don't blame the system for your woes.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>But to be fair,not all officers and sergeants are like that.In fact,I've come across many dedicated commanders who really care for their men during my time in BMTC and School of Signals.<br></strong></blockquote><br><br>Read the word there : SCHOOL. You are allowed to make mistakes and learn there...but now u are a unit man with responsibilities....how can you expect to be spoon fed and treated like a baby...The SOS trainning caters to make Signallers an independent breed who can do all things w/o a commander....In that case you failed your trainning<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>I guess it's just bad luck,coming to the wrong place at the wrong time and meeting the wrong people....</strong></blockquote>AS the saying goes: Why blame the enviroment for changing you when you did not attempt to change the enviroment? Take the first step by helping your friends and taking pride in your work and enjoy the little blessings that come occasionally. This will allow you to pass by these 2 1/2 years easily.<br><br>BTW I am signaller as well so I know what you are talking about.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Rudin (edited 05 April 2002).]</div>

Approval for clearing off / leave do have to go through the proper chain of command.<br><br>The commander do have to maintain the unit operational readiness. If you had performed well, I do believe they would let you clear your off days where permissable.<br><br><blockquote><br>I've got a friend who has up to 10 days of off being burnt and not 1 single day has been returned to him.<br></blockquote>Off days are a priviledge, *NOT* an entitlement. 10 days off burnt? My dear friend, I burnt way way much more than that.<br><br><blockquote><br>Ever since injuring my knee for SOC,I hav been in and out of the medical centre for a few months until recently,I got a permanent downgrade to PES C2L2.Even though I'm no longer fit to hav a combat vocation,my PC is still trying his best to keep me inside the platoon.To do what,u tell me?In fact,I am still deployed to go outfield to lay D-10 cables.(C2L2 still must go outfield,but can only be in rear party)That was when my injury got worse and I had no choice but to go for a knee operation,which explains why I can be at home now relating my NS experiences to u all.(ATTC mah)<br></blockquote>Although I feel sorry for your injury, but I do agree with Rudin. You are no better of those behaviour pattern you despise.<br><br>I have my fair share of those wires, rear end comms is not that tough. Work as a team with your fellow platoon mates.<br><br>Take more pride in what you do. Learn to look  at the bright side of things, and take things in stride. 2.5yrs is not really that long.<br><br>Nobody gonna spoon feed you, especially when you go into the working world.<br></div>
