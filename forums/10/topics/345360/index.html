              <div>Here in New Zealand we have ‘a thing’ for Tibet, far out-weighing out respective countries historic relations.<br><br>This may down to simply one person, Sir Edmond Hillary, more likely though, the affinity small isolated countries have for one another.<br><br>There is also a great deal of good will towards Tibet’s spiritual leader, the estranged Dali Lama.<br><br>The ‘good press’ he receives amongst the New Zealand public are largely founded on two factors…..<br><br>1.) The sympathy vote. Tibet was a utopia in the mountains until the evil-doing Chinese Red-Army arrived, bent on some ethic cleansing Asia style.<br>2. ) Asian religions are docile, less dogmatic than those we have here. Religion ‘Tibetan Style’ is some-what the equivalent of a cuddly serene ‘house-hold cat’.<br><br>Sorry to spoil the party here fellas, these widely-held views are a misinformed load of crap.<br><br>Forget what you have seen in Hollywood movies, read in books by ex SS officers, take-off those rose-tinted glasses one second.<br><br>Here’s the reality check.<br><br>Until the Chinese invaded Tibet 90% of the population lived-lives the equivalent of medieval serfs (called tralpa) who lived at the mercy of the ruling classes, and the aristocratic Dali Lama sat pretty, high-up in his 1,000 room palace.<br><br>Here’s how the arable land in Tibet was distributed, last time The Dalai Lama was in power: 30.9 percent was owned by government officials, 29.6 percent by nobles, and 39.5 percent by monasteries and upper-ranking lamas. Zip for the plebs, who mostly worked without pay.<br></div>

              <p>Just to add my two pence worth, Tibetan students are also given preferential treatment by the Chinese educational system. If a Chinese and Tibetan both applied to a university with the same results, the Tibetan will have piority in entering the university. This apply to all minority groups within China. </p>
              <p>The Qingzang railway has also boosted tourism in Tibet, allow more industrial products to be transported more cheaply from developed regions into Tibet.</p>
              <p>I won't say the Chinese are morally superior but they have a lot of history and experience with empire building. Historically (To my knowledge), they give preferential treatment to border regions in order to make the indigenous population more friendly to them, avoiding the troubles and hassles of maintaining troops to suppress revolts and uprisings (Unlike Iraq and Afghanisatan) and to serve as a early warning system against the more aggressive tribes on their Northern Borders.</p>
              <p>And strategically, i don't see Tibet ever going to be independant of any foreign influence. It has hardly any natural resources to support an independant economy and military but it sits on the water supply for about 1/3 of the world's population (India, Thailand, Vietnam, China, Myanmar, Nepal)</p>
              <p>If China gives it independence, i'm pretty sure India will move in.</p>

              spring the world’s attention was drawn to Tibet, where on 10th March
              this year the people commemorated the 49th anniversary of the Tibetan
              upheaval against the Chinese occupation. The protests spread from Tibet
              across the whole world and along the route of the torch relay for this
              year’s Olympic games people demanded: “Free Tibet!”.<br><br>In the
              Southern part of the Himalaya another occupied territory did not
              attract any attention at all: Sikkim. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The Kingdom which had defended
              its independence for 300 years against powerful neighbours was annexed
              by India in April 1975 and became the 22nd state of the Indian Union.</strong></span> The 85th birthday of the 12th Chogyal of Sikkim gives me the
              opportunity to focus on the fate of the tiny Himalaya Kingdom. <br><br><em>Chogyal Palden Thondup Namgyal</em>, Twelfth Consecrated Ruler of Sikkim, was born in Sikkim’s capital Gangtok on 22nd May 1923. <a href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_d1Bzk_Gi7MU/SDZOBALs6bI/AAAAAAAAAFg/qlMkzV0T3LA/s1600-h/Chogyal+5.jpg"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5203432198609103282" style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer;" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_d1Bzk_Gi7MU/SDZOBALs6bI/AAAAAAAAAFg/qlMkzV0T3LA/s400/Chogyal+5.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a>The <em>Denzong Chogyal </em>was the second son of the late illustrious <em>Chogyal Sir Tashi Namgyal</em>, who will always be remembered as Sikkim’s gracious, enlightened and benevolent ruler.<br>In
              1935 he continued his studies at St. Joseph’s College, Darjeeling, and
              completed his studies at Bishop Cotton School, Simla, in 1941. <br><br>As the Heir Apparent, <em>Gyalsay Palden Thondup Namgyal</em> undertook the Indian Civil Service Training Course at Dehra Dun in 1942
              and thereafter returned to Sikkim to look after the administration so
              that the needs of the people could be taken care of. <br><br><em>Chogyal Palden Thondup Namgyal</em> was keenly alive to the needs of the people and as Heir Apparent had
              exercised direct personal supervision over various departments of the
              government of Sikkim. He was his father’s adviser on external affairs
              and led the Sikkim team, which negotiated the Treaty with India in
              1949-1950. By contract Sikkim became India’s “protectorate” on 5th
              December 1950, not unlike Nepal and Bhutan that were forced to sign
              similar treaties after the British had left the subcontinent. So far
              the other two Kingdoms could maintain their independence. If Nepal will
              be able to keep the two greedy neighbours outside the borders should
              the country be declared a republic, is in doubts.<br><br>The Chogyal
              was connected with a number of cultural and academic bodies in Sikkim,
              India and abroad. He had been the President of the Mahabodhi Society of
              India since 1953 and he led the Sikkim delegation to the Sixth Buddhist
              Council that was held in Burma in 1954. He participated in the 2500
              Buddha Jayanti Celebrations in India in 1956, and was the only member
              of the Working Committee from Sikkim. In March 1959 he attended the
              2500 Buddha Jayanti Conference in Japan and represented Sikkim at the
              Sixth World Fellowship of Buddhists conference in Cambodia in 1961. In
              1958, under the patronage of Maharaja Sir Tashi Namgyal, he set up a
              centre for Mahayana and Tibetan studies at Gangtok , and this world
              famous centre bears the name of “Namgyal Institute of Tibetology.” <br><br><a href="http://bp2.blogger.com/_d1Bzk_Gi7MU/SDZO-gLs6dI/AAAAAAAAAFw/zeCsOeqK7BU/s1600-h/Hope+Cooke.jpg"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5203433255171058130" style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer;" src="http://bp2.blogger.com/_d1Bzk_Gi7MU/SDZO-gLs6dI/AAAAAAAAAFw/zeCsOeqK7BU/s400/Hope+Cooke.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a> In August 1950, he married <em>Sangey Deki</em>, daughter of <em>Yapshi Samdu Phodrang </em>of Tibet. <em>Sangey </em>died in June 1957. In March 1963 he married <em>Hope Cooke</em>, grand daughter and ward of Mr. and Mrs. <em>Winchester Noyes </em>of
              the United States of America, which drew a huge media attention to the
              tiny Kingdom. The Chogyal had three children from his first wife,
              namely <em>Tenzing</em>, <em>Wangchuk </em>and <em>Yangchen</em>. His second wife bore him <em>Palden </em>and <em>Hope</em>. After his father’s death, <em>Palden </em>was crowned as the Twelfth Chogyal of Sikkim on 4th April 1965.<a href="http://bp1.blogger.com/_d1Bzk_Gi7MU/SDZQNQLs6eI/AAAAAAAAAF4/IPINCgEONQY/s1600-h/Chogyal+Coronation.jpg"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5203434608085756386" style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer;" src="http://bp1.blogger.com/_d1Bzk_Gi7MU/SDZQNQLs6eI/AAAAAAAAAF4/IPINCgEONQY/s400/Chogyal+Coronation.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a> (Please note the photo, where his US-born wife <em>Hope Cooke </em>is sitting at his right on a lower throne.)<br><br>Among
              the honours and distinction the Chogyal held were: The Order of the
              British Empire (1947), Padma Vibushan, India (1954) and Commander de
              l’Ordre de l’Étoile Noire, France (1956). <br><br><strong>The Indian invasion</strong><br>Small
              numbers of Nepalese had been migrating to Sikkim from about the 15th
              century, but it was only under the British that the Nepalese began
              entering Sikkim in great numbers, entirely upsetting the traditional
              ethnic balance of Sikkim. This social engineering was done by the
              British to weaken the traditional Lepchas – Bhutia strength. The
              Eleventh Chogyal and representatives of two of Sikkim’s largest
              parties, the Sikkim State Congress and the Sikkim National Party,
              agreed in May 1951to a <em>parity formula </em>. According to this
              formula, the seats in the state council were to be divided equally
              between the Bhutia-Lepcha group, and the Nepalese. The Sikkim State
              Council was then institute in 1953. <br><br>In April 1973, after
              making allegations that elections had been rigged, ethnic Nepali
              protested in front of the King's palace, demanding civil rights and the
              sidelining or even removal of what they called the "feudal" monarchy. <em>Palden Thondup Namgyal</em>, the King of Sikkim, ultimately gave in and signed an agreement on 8th May 1973. <br><br>The
              document called on India to provide a chief executive, and to hold
              elections for an assembly. The agreement was the first step in the
              disappearance of the Kingdom of Sikkim. The inhabitants of the Kingdom
              are in no doubt that the Indian Prime Minister <em>Indira Gandhi</em> and her local agents fomented the unrest. <em>Indira Gandhi’s</em> dictatorial and imperialist attitudes were are a major concern in the 70s. Asked in 1998 by the German daily <em>Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung</em>,
              why the Sikkimese army did not resist the Indian invasion, a former
              captain of Sikkim's army replied: "The Indians soldiers had joined the
              army because they were hungry and received a warm meal; to shoot at
              them would not have been in accordance with our Buddhist faith. We knew
              four days in advance about the invasion, but the King had ordered not
              to fight."<br><br>In 1975, Sikkim’s Prime Minister “appealed” to the
              Indian Parliament for representation and change of Sikkim's status to a
              state of India. In April 1975 the Indian Army moved into Sikkim,
              seizing the capital city of Gangtok, disarming the Palace Guards and
              putting the Chogyal under house arrest.<a href="http://bp2.blogger.com/_d1Bzk_Gi7MU/SDZV1gLs6fI/AAAAAAAAAGA/CUGfnGg2TAw/s1600-h/Chogyal+Brief.jpg"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5203440797133629938" style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer;" src="http://bp2.blogger.com/_d1Bzk_Gi7MU/SDZV1gLs6fI/AAAAAAAAAGA/CUGfnGg2TAw/s400/Chogyal+Brief.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a> <br>A “referendum” was held in which 97.5% [<strong>!</strong>]
              of the votes cast (or counted!) agreed to join the Indian Union.China
              did not recognize Indian’s occupation of Sikkim until 2003, which led
              to an improvement in the Sino-Indian relations. In return, India
              announced its official recognition of Tibet as an integrated part of
              China.<br><br>The Chogyal never renounced his throne and hoped till the end that justice would win. <br><br>On 29th January 1982 <em>Chogyal Palden Thondup Namgyal</em> died a heartbroken man from cancer in New York. His second son <em>Wangchuk</em> inherited the rights to the throne after the Chogyal's eldest son <em>Crown Prince Tenzin</em> had died in a car accident in 1977</p>
