            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Steve,<br><br>I hope you don't mind me addressing you by your first name when we do not know each other. Let me cut to the chase and state that I have emailed you to express my appreciation and gratitude for your efforts and blood-and-sweat over the last few years, culminating in the recent Elections 6th May in which you won a 39.6% of votes in CCK.<br><br>I have heard that you plan to quit politics if you fail to win a MP seat this time round. Let me first state that I understand your frustrations, pains and distress that might have led you to make such an "all-or-nothing" decision. And that whatever your choice you will still have the sincere support of an ordinary Singaporean like me.<br><br>However, I really feel that it would be a huge pity for an established and talented person as yourself to leave the current political scene as it is, after all the efforts that you have put in over the last few years. 5 years ago, you were relatively unknown, even within the circles where express sentiment and sympathy for the Opposition was strong. Today, your name rests on the tips of tongues of people like me and my peers, as a symbol for intellectual and gentlemanly politics.<br><br>Who am I, then? What demographic do I represent? Let me introduce myself shortly.  We just never had a chance to vote for you as most of us live in GRCs which were never contested.<br><br>We understand the sacrifices you have made in the course of politics, including the pain and shame of having your personal and private affairs brought out into public, scrutinised under the microscope, and then riddiculed for it. But let me assure you that I, and many of my peers, feel that such activities of yours do not reflect on your ability and capability to represent and speak for us. What matters to us is your passion, your courage, your commitment and your ability to speak up and argue about meaningful issues and matters which are questionable and dodgey.<br><br>And in this respect, Steve, you have excelled. You have done far more than you should have done, paid a heavier price than what many of us will ever have to pay, and we appreciate that. And we would really hate to see you go, to see you leave, and to see a good, courageous and intelligent man like yourself leave the political scence, just right at the moment as the bubbling cauldron that is the Singapore political arena is starting to boil over!<br><br>An alternative could be for you to join the Worker Party, for reasons which are obvious. I will leave the reasoning and motivations and benefits of this move to you. Or you could stay in your current party and continue the good fight which you have been fighting and are fighting. It doesn't matters.<br><br>What matters is that you are a hero, the unsung hero of ordinary Singaporeans without a voice like myself, by choice, by fear or by circumstances. And know that if we do ever have a chance to vote for you, our voices will be resounding and travel far and wide.<br><br>On a parting note, I wish you well in whatever you do and your endeavours ahead. All the best, Mr Chia. You will be remembered whatever you do.<br><br>Best Regards,<br>XXX<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>All i can say is, the man's got GUTS. I mean, he still stood for election after all the scandal surrounding him. Honestly speaking if it was me, i would have hid at home. The fact so many people voted for him shows that we Singaporeans are maturing. Bravo and well done Mr Chia. Hope to see you in 5 years time under the banner of the WP.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>SDA and WP are opposition parties with different motto. Some voted for SDA for the MOTTO or some may flavor particular member/s within. The same goes for WP. A merger may mean a stronger oppo...it may also be our only oppositions parties' demise. I suggest fighting on separate grounds first. Now is not the time to merge. 2 party against one is a better strategy for now.<br><br>As for Steve Chia i believe he already has his own plans. I, too, hope he stays but its a choice he has to make for his own. He will understand that serving a constituency (or even a nation) takes many sacrifices yet may not earn all the votes from the residences or the ppl of Singapore. He is after all human and may have his own carrer path to take.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Steve....let me also write you a letter.......I wanted to write to ST forum page but my friends say forget it....it will never see daylight so here I am.<br><br>First I admire you - a simple ordinary citizen of Singapore WITH GUTS. Very few Singaporeans, including myself, would dare to step into the limelight and say things that "Papa" consider disobedient.<br><br>The results are out.  CONGRATULATIONS for getting such a high percentage of votes despite such incredulously harsh conditions imposed by your rivals. The political climate here is not conducive for people who believe in true  democracy but coming down to earth; the society as a whole is doing fine. The common folks are more concerned with their houses and food on their table. Unless we come to a crisis like some countries, where there is little to eat, I dont think many will go for philosophy or principles. These are simply too far fetched.<br><br>Continue your social work. Help the less fortunate. Lend your voice to the disadvantaged. Make friends with like minded individuals. However you should consider your future. Get settled down and look after your family first.<br><br>Perhaps you may wish to join the Workers Party. Five years from now probably your combined efforts will make history in our political scene.<br><br>ALL THE BEST. Once again. Congratulations and Thank You.<br><br><a>  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>He has done something well above most ordinary S'poreans. Not easy to have someone like him nowadays. Saw him buying food for his helpers during the campaigning.<br><br>It would be a pity if he plans to leave the political scene. He's still young. Anyway, I wish him all the best for his future endeavors.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>
