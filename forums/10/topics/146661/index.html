            <div class='col-md body'>PM Lee 2005 ND message keeps talking about past 40 years' of achievements. There is nothing about solving problems like high costs of living or overcoming the lack of technological competitiveness or self-reliance in our domestic sector of the economy.<br><br>He is encouraging everyone to stay complacent and remain where they are to be contended with having a good life. (for the elites and upper classes)<br><br>I notice that in recent ND messages our leaders have always been talking about past achievements or some difficult external conditions beyond their control and nothing about what we are doing to overcome problems.<br><br>There is the same underlying ND message this year - that we have developed, have arrived reminding all how fortunate we are in this or that implying there is nothing to complain or ask for. This has been led by this kind of laid-back mentality year after year over the past 20 years.<br><br>There is no sign of building up technological capabilities or restructuring the economic plans in all our major sectors or industries to bring in value-adding advanced models to compete with the world, like Finland, Switzerland, Denmark (despite the smallness and resource scarce economies), Korea, Taiwan etc.<br><br>No wonder we are so short of our own economic progress except for world-dependent blips of recovery or corrections of previous downturns for which the government is now claiming to be their doings.<br><br>Our leaders who have constantly claimed to be world-class should be forward looking, visionary and able to solve our existing problems as posted and not keeping covering up problems by talking of past achievements. What a look-good kiasu mentality.<br><br>PM Lee should solve the 20 major problems with autocracy facing the people as posted:<br><br><a href="http://www.ospforohsopolite.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.ospforohsopolite.blogspot.com</a><br><br></div>

Today, the third-generation citizens are more educated and know that life is not so simple as to trust the leaders completely. The leaders might have their own agenda like promoting themselves as good talents and elites to enjoy higher pays and all the excessive bonuses like being paid to the CEO in NKF case. There are many problems caused by lack of accountable good corporate government since the 1980s. Unless these problems are solved fast by new policies as posted in the 7 points of true democracy, Singapore will lose out in economic competitiveness in the coming yeas.<br><br>The leaders now make claims for creating jobs because of world recovery not their genuine efforts, entrepreneurship or creativity in managing the economy. For more suggestions read the various posts given by forumers.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In reality no leader will say his organisation is in bad shape.<br><br>I have stopped listening to the motivational messages by leaders from companies or countries. Why? Because its all creative writing. For another example of creative writing, you can read Enron's ex-CEO letter to the shareholders (year 2000) here: <a href="http://www.enron.com/corp/investors/annuals/2000/shareholder.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.enron.com/corp/investors/annuals/2000/shareholder.html</a><br><br>To get the best gauge of the financial health of a company, I look at the salaries and the number of months of bonus. The same applies for country. I look at how much money is in my pocket. It is a simple gauge. Others might not agree, saying it is too simple and want to do all the GDP per capital, total wealth, blah blah analysis. In a perfect world with totally honest statistics, those analysis are fine. But in this world, I only trust my own statistics. That is how much $$ I have in my pocket.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hello Cindyfeh<br><br>Thanks for the enlightened Enron Letter To Shareholders now reproduced below:-<br><br>QUOTE: "EnronÂ’s performance in 2000 was a success by any measure, as we continued to outdistance the competition and solidify our leadership in each of our major businesses. In our largest business, wholesale services, we experienced an enormous increase of 59 percent in physical energy deliveries. Our retail energy business achieved its highest level ever of total contract value. Our newest business, broadband services, significantly accelerated transaction activity, and our oldest business, the interstate pipelines, registered increased earnings. The companyÂ’s net income reached a record $1.3 billion in 2000.<br><br>Enron has built unique and strong businesses that have tremendous opportunities for growth. These businesses Â— wholesale services, retail energy services, broadband services and transportation services Â— can be significantly expanded within their very large existing markets and extended to new markets with enormous growth potential. At a minimum, we see our market opportunities company-wide tripling over the next five years.<br><br>Enron is laser-focused on earnings per share, and we expect to continue strong earnings performance. We will leverage our extensive business networks, market knowledge and logistical expertise to produce high-value bundled products for an increasing number of global customers." UNQUOTE<br><br>A country is of course a much bigger social and economic entity than a corporation like Enron. Yet from all the statistical and GDP point of view, the government like Envron seems to be only interested in telling what it wants its citizens to know.<br><br>Its ND shareholder report have avoided mention of problems like people's struggles with high costs of living and the shape of the economy ? How long can the government continue to withold truths like the NKF case especially I am sure when it wants to avoid being compared with Enron type of look-good corporate governance.<br><br></div>

It's just a fact, he didnt mean to blame us(the younger generation) for not fully understand wat they went thru, but he just wish that we know more, like a rich dad who is not born rich will always want to tell his son how he worked hard in the past to assure such comfortable ilfe for his son now.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">"if u think a leader is very lousy, let say u think PM Goh is one lousy leader, go ahead and write an essay with the title "if i am PM Goh". in your essay u should state wat he has done wrong and wat would u do if u were him. But dun talk about problems that have already been solved, talk about how do u solve the problems he and the country is facing now. Publish this essay and see how ppl comments on your essay" </span><br>For this, it's actually a very general idea that apply to many areas in life. like in a company, if u think ur boss is a useless bastard, just think if u were him, can u make the compnay better? when u watch soccer, that stupid italian guy with little pony tail cant even shoot on target in that PK shoot out, if u were him, are u sure u can do it with that kind of pressure and do u really have better soccer skill than him?<br><br>ya, it' true that no leader will say his organisation is in bad shape, that will drive away the ppl, the ppl that the organisation needs them to make things better. It's the ppl that plays the most important part to make soceity better, not the soceity itself or the leaders. That's why they hide the truth, in order to keep the ppl from going.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My own NDP speech to the Singaporeans online here:<br><br>Dear friends, fellow citizens, young and old. It's now without a doubt that we have reached a milestone in our youthful country. We are only 40 years old. We are indeed lucky to be here. 40 years ago, no-one would have gave a chance in succeeding- but here we are.<br><br>But my dear friends- and even to my opponents, I say this to you: although we have succeeded in the last 40 years, we still have challenges ahead of us. And while I do share the Prime Minister's optimstic view of the future, I do share a big concern that we, as a people, as a nation, we are not doing it together. We aren't walking the talk and we aren't practicing what we preach.<br><br>Our challenges in the near and long term future are vast, large and quick. Each challenge will come down so fast that we will not know clearly when it starts and when it ends. Our challenges will need not just the government, but also the people. This means we, as politicians must work together- hand-in-hand, brothers-in-arms, as a community to face the challenges that lies ahead of us.<br><br>Our economy, even if it is posting a 3.5% to 4.5% growth- which Mr. Lee has stated just 24 hours ago, has a big problem. The ordinary people are facing rising costs and increasing taxes. In addition, global challenges to the world in terms of economic policy, politics, religious terrorism and increasing oil prices will ensure that the world economy will not be very stable for the short term period.<br><br>Another problem is that a 3.5% GDP growth will not benefit every Singaporean as the economic policy now is a "trickle-down" policy, not an "invest-and-grow" policy. As long as the ordinary people- which is you- remains in huge public debt due to increasing costs and taxes, the economic growth will not benefit the ordinary population- especially at a period when unemployment remains at an surprisingly high 5%.<br><br>The ordinary people also faces an extraordinary load of challenges in these days as well. In addition to costs, they face problems in their healthcare, in their education and also their jobs. Unlike in the past, where people could have a job which they will find security in, now they face the sack anytime and anywhere. And when they lose it, their immediate future- already cloudly- becomes even worse. While we cannot go back to the days of the iron rice job, we, the politicians, the private companies(both local and foreign) and the people must work together to solve the problem of unemployment.<br><br>Because it's true. If a man cannot have a job or can't have a job, not many in a society will view him as a useful person.  So it should be our main priority: to help all ordinary Singaporeans find a job with decent pay- so as to allow him and/or his family to survive in these trying times.<br><br>That's why, on this day when we got our independence, I only want to hear this: I don't resort to just talking. Because talking doesn't solve anything if you don't do anything. I only ask of this from Singaporeans: If we are to continue to let the future generations to enjoy Singapore in another 40 to 50 years time, then we must work together. Hand-in-hand and like brothers and sisters. There's no-one to waste and no effort wasted. We must recognize ourselves as a community and we are all in this together, and we are all going up or down together.<br><br>My fellow Singaporeans, on this day, the 9th of August, let this be our message: To have a brighter future, we are all together as one. Let it be our cause to make Singapore a better place, let it be our cause to give every child in Singapore a country that is coming together, and not coming apart. A country of boundless hopes and dreams, a country that will inspire the rest of Asia and the world once more.<br><br>Let it be our cause in this year's National Day and other future National Days and our committments. My fellow Singaporeans: Somehow I still believe in a place and time called Hope. I hope you will too.<br><br>God bless Singapore and God Bless you.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally spoken by PM LHL on TV:<strong><br><span style="color: blue;">PRIME MINISTER LEE HSIEN LOONG'S NATIONAL DAY MESSAGE 2005</span><br><br>On 9 August 1965, Singapore became an independent and sovereign nation. Suddenly, we were on our own, with no natural resources to exploit, no hinterland to fall back upon, and no army to defend ourselves. But we were determined to survive, and started building a nation from scratch. We worked hard to improve our lives, and create a future for our children.  </strong></blockquote>Did we not overcome these problems with the solutions from the First and Second Generation Leadership - and that we have jumped over the restrictions placed on us by Malaysia and Indonesia to hem in this 'Little Red Dot' ?<br><br>Hopefully, the PM believe that his reference term '<strong>WE</strong>' means the Singaporean Citizens and the Ruling Party; and that the term '<strong>WE</strong>' does not refer to the members of the Ruling Party that form the Elite Group forming the Government of Singapore.<br><blockquote>:<strong><br>Today, we have every reason to rejoice. In 40 years, we have succeeded beyond all expectations.<br>a. Our economy has developed and prospered. After each downturn we have bounced back, to create more jobs and a better life for all.<br>b. Our society is harmonious and cohesive. We have built mutual trust between different communities, and drawn all Singaporeans closer to one another.<br>c. We are attracting investments and talent from around the world, to live in a safe, clean, and dynamic city.<br>d. The SAF and our Home Team are strong and tested. Because of them, we can sleep peacefully at night.<br>e. We are deepening our sense of shared destiny, and maturing as a nation.  </strong></blockquote>a. Has our economy prospered after the 1987, 1997 and 2001 recessions ?<br><br>Were more jobs created after each downturn, and if so - why is the unemployment rate still hovering at 4.5% after three years, since the recession of 2001-2002 ?<br><br>b. Are Singaporeans closer to one another, with mutual trust between different communities, or is it a matter of tacit tolerance and not acceptance ?<br><br>c. We have certainly attracted investments and talent from around the world, but how many jobs did the foreign investments kept for their foreign talents, and how many jobs were created for local talents ?<br><br>d. Are we deluding ourselves in believing that the SAF and our Home Team are strong and tested - by merely serving on Peace Missions, and taking on NON-COMBAT roles in support of the US War on Terror ?<br><br>e. We are certainly deepening our sense of shared destiny, and maturing as a nation - as Singaporeans begin to wake from its long slumber towards the abuses to our charitable hearts, when we discovered the NKF scandals - which represent a bigger scandal in the undying subject of Ministerial Pay.<br><blockquote>:<strong><br>Despite many years of peace, we must remain vigilant against threats to our security. The bombings in London and in Egypt remind us that the war on terror continues, and despite the tightest precautions, the terrorists sometimes get through. We must be psychologically prepared for this, so that if they ever strike here we will be resolute and indomitable, refusing to be cowed by the terrorists and staying one united people.  </strong></blockquote>If there is social cohesion, and mutual trusts between communities, and if there is a vision of shared destiny, how did the JI terrorist cell became an aberration in this 'feel good' message ?<br><br>If there is social cohesion, and mutual trusts between communities, and a comfort level of shared destiny has been achieved, will the Ruling Party a.k.a the present Singapore Government - then proceed to dismantle the GRC system of election - [which was originally designed to protect the Minority Race] ?<br><br>Will the Ruling Party a.k.a the present Singapore Government also abandon the HDB housing policy of ensuring each block in each neighbourhood shall have an approved mix of the different racial groups of Singapore ?<br><br>Will this policy also be extended to the resale flats - in which the flats of certain ethnic group cannot be sold to a different ethnic group, so as to ensure the approved population mix ?<br><blockquote>:<strong><br>This year, our economy continues to grow steadily. Growth in the first half was 4.0%. For the whole year, we can expect growth to be between 3.5% and 4.5%. We added 45,500 jobs in the first half, many more than in the same period last year. This has made it easier for displaced workers to find new jobs. Our efforts to re-design and re-create jobs for older, less-skilled workers have also helped.  </strong></blockquote>With the growth numbers being so exhilerating, why is UNEMPLOYMENT still hovering at 4.5% since the end of the recession in mid-2002 ?<br><br>At the rate of 45,500 new jobs being created per year, it will take at least TEN YEARS before all the 4.5% unemployed will get a chance to be interviewed for a job.<br><br>Re-design and re-create jobs for older, less-skilled workers have resulted in the older workers taking on menial jobs - as toilet keepers, fast food retailers, dish-washers, road sweepers.<br><br>Is this anything new from the many destitutes and poor, who eke out a living collecting tin cans and paper cartons ?<br><blockquote>:<strong><br>Looking ahead, we face a totally different world. China and India are emerging as strong, competitive economies. Globalisation is intensifying competition and speeding up the pace of change. Faced with these common challenges, the countries of ASEAN are working more closely together. We will form an ASEAN Community by 2020. In fact, today, August 8, is ASEAN Day. Together with our ASEAN partners, we will raise awareness of ASEAN among our citizens. Greater ASEAN integration will help us to tackle these challenges and seize the opportunities before us.   </strong></blockquote>With each ASEAN country attempting to cut a piece of the pie for the interest of each individual country, can there be any lesser competition ?<br><br>Conflict of interests already arise between Thailand and Malaysia, where both of these ASEAN member countries have vested interests in their respective National Car Industries.<br><br>Relationship between the rest of ASEAN and Myanmar will be strained as long as the Europeans and USA put pressure on ASEAN to resolve the dictatorship role of the Myanmar Government.<br><blockquote>:<strong><br>SingaporeÂ’s strong fundamentals enable us to face the future with confidence. Our main priority is to grow and upgrade the economy. We need to develop new skills and capabilities, open new markets abroad, bring in investments and seed new areas of growth. We did not start off as a financial centre, an electronics manufacturing base or an air and sea hub, but we made ourselves all these. We cannot stop here; we must continue to reinvent ourselves and build new competencies, as we are doing in bio-technology and multi-media. We must also continue growing our external wing, and seek opportunities in ASEAN, China, India and the Middle East. Then we will create new jobs, and more than make up for the old jobs that are phasing out.<br></strong></blockquote>What size of employee numbers should we train with the new skills and capabilities so as to prepare ourselves for the new markets abroad ?<br><br>Will the Singapore Citizens benefit from the new investments and 'seeding of new areas of growth' ?<br><br>Can Singaporeans benefit from any success in bio-technology ?<br><br>How much of the 'External Wing' economy has affected us ?<br><br></div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'><br><blockquote>:<strong><br>To achieve all these we must equip ourselves with the right skills and attitudes to thrive in the face of uncertainty and change. Hence our emphasis on a first class education system. Every Singaporean ?and not just a select few ?must receive the best education that he is capable of. So we are investingence oHeHH heavily in polytechnics and ITEs, and not just in universities. We are paying attention to Normal stream students, and not just those in the Express and Special streams. We are emphasising lifelong learning, and not just pre-employment education.  </strong></blockquote>With the education system that hamstrung a high performing student with the boogey of having to pass Chinese Language, is there any will from the Government for a revamp on the education system ?<br><br>Does 'lifelong learning' also require a retired person at 75 years old to continue to work out a living by himself.<br><br>Will there be changes to the the NUS, NTU, USIM, SMU admission policies that require at least two years working experience from Polytechnic graduates before being accepted for a job ?<br><blockquote>:<strong><br>We also need to remake our city, so that it is vibrant, cosmopolitan and throbbing with energy, with our own distinctive X-factor that makes us stand out from other cities. Global cities like London, Paris, New York and Shanghai are continuously re-making themselves, so all the more must we. This is the deeper reason, beyond attracting tourists, why we are developing integrated resorts.   </strong></blockquote>Our own distinctive X-factor ?<br><br>Did the Government discover our X-factor so soon after complaining that Singaporeans and Singapore lack a certain X-factor to give the BUZZ that is so desparately needed ?<br><br>Remaking ourselves seems to be a catch word to justify the pouring of billions of dollars [of taxpayers' money] into taller buildings with even more grand designs, and opulent finishing. Will there be more NKF type of scandals ?<br><blockquote>:<strong><br>Last month, the International Olympic Committee met in SingaÂ­pore, to choose the city for the 2012 Olympic Games. Eventually London won. For a few days, under the international spotlight, Singapore played the gracious host. We did well, and must do even better on future occasions, for example next year, when the IMF and World Bank hold their meetings here. This is part of our transformation into a leading city, a first class environment for talent and enterprise, and a home for Singaporeans of all races and faiths.  </strong></blockquote>PM LHL certainly have much to showcase of the succesful Singapore story, with the glorious hard assets built up by the sweat and sacrifices of Singaporeans, and for the Ruling Elite to bask in their self-assumed success, while Singaporeans continue to listen, obey, and slave.<br><br>While the numbers game continue with each international convention held in Singapore, how will the $$$ from these conventions will actually 'trickle down' to finally reach into the pockets of the Singaporean minions ?<br><blockquote>:<strong><br>Economic growth is the best social welfare programme. Prosperity provides us the resources to tackle many difficult challenges. One challenge is the <span style="color: red;">widening income gap</span>. We cannot reverse this worldwide trend, but we can help lower income Singaporeans to keep up and find new opportunities. We are training them in useful skills, re-designing their jobs to pay better, educating their children well, and <span style="color: blue;">helping them with their utilities and transport bills</span>. And we have the ComCare fund, which helps the needy to get back quickly on their feet again.  </strong></blockquote>Is economic growth considered to be social welfare programme ?<br><br>'Prosperity certainly provides us (the Government) the resources to tackle many difficult challenges' - by accumulating the monies collected from income taxes, and from charity fund raising.<br><br>At last, for the first time - the challenge of the WIDENING INCOME GAP - has been acknowledged, but it is blamed on the worldwide trend, and is not considered to be a unique Singapore aberrations - where Ministers are paid MILLION DOLLAR ANNUAL SALARY, while the bulk of the work and sacrifices are performed by the Singaporean Citizen minions paid at Third World Salary.<br><br>PM LHL certainly sounded generous in mentioning the assistance given to the lower income group - helping with their utilities and transport bills.<br><br>Unfortunately, he fail to mention that the lower income group will have to use PRE-PAID CARD that allow utilities to be supplied according to the amount that the lower income can afford. Also not mention, is the fact that most lower income minions do not even know of the existence of the help that is available, as the administrative work involved is too mind boggling for the Singaporean minions.<br><br>It is too embarrassing to mention NKF on such an auspicious day, so there exist a 'ComCare Fund' to help the needy to get back on their feet; but what is the proportion of Government funding compared to that received from Public Charity and Donations ?<br><blockquote>:<strong><br>A second challenge is our aging population. Singaporeans must keep active, stay healthy and work for as long as possible, so that as they age they can enjoy financial security, afford good medical care, and live more fulfilling lives. Senior citizens are valued members of our society, and we must tap their collective experience and wisdom.   </strong></blockquote>Can the aged Singaporean minions have any financial security, when the bulk of their life savings in the CPF is used to purchase an overpriced HDB unit ?<br><br>Can the meagre Medisave and Medishielf Funds be sufficient to pay for any unforeseen hospital and surgical expenses ? After one such event, will there be any funds left for any subsequent repeat stay in the hospital ?<br><br>So "Senior Citizens are valued members of our society, and we must tap their collective experience and wisdom" - is this to justify keeping on a longer basis, all the retired Ministers and co-operative MPs from the Ruling Party ?<br><blockquote>:<strong><br>Third, we must continue to look after the health of all Singaporeans, young and old. I know many of you worry about your medical expenses. But our healthcare system delivers a high standard of care for all. We will strive to make healthcare services more affordable for all income groups. But you must do your part too, to look after yourself and keep fit and healthy, because staying well is the best way to keep medical costs down. </strong></blockquote>With so little information available to Singaporeans, who will know how much of the medical bills are inflated before being subsidised by the Government - as claimed so proudly ?<br><br>If only a few fall sick, will there be sufficient numbers for the hospital to achieve 'economies of scale' - so as to make the cost lower, and more affordable to Singaporeans ?<br><blockquote>:<strong><br>These are hard issues with no quick and easy solutions. But we will learn from the experience of other countries and avoid their mistakes, and I believe that we can manage these challenges.  </strong></blockquote>After two change-over of leaderships, have we not learned accumulated enough experience and knowledge from the past, in order to chart our path into the future ?<br></div>

Corruption remains rife amongst petty bureaucrats that administers Government rules and regulations that dictates the business community.

Let us dedicate ourselves anew, as one united people, to securing this bright and enduring future for Singapore.  </strong></blockquote>Is there any bright and enduring future for Singaporeans, when the country, its reserves, its electorial systems, its governmental policies are all in the tight control of ONE SINGLE Political Party that manipulate the legal system to thwart any alternative representation choice for the Singapore Minions.<br><br><a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/nationalday/message/message_eng.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.channelnewsasia.com/nationalday/message/message_eng.htm</a><br><br></div>
