There are also high-end products that we manufacture and export overseas. We do things that are high in value chain such as semi-conductors, chips and computer parts. In what way are we lagging behind the Asian Tigers?<br><br>We remain very competitive with Hong Kong and Taiwan. If you are not aware, technology like the thumbdrive orginated from Singapore. The proliferation of this technology with so many countries producing it was a result of the company not patenting the technology. (see ST Digital Life- July) </blockquote>To whoever who had make the above statement, I would advise him to update himself on Taiwanese domination in semiconductor, LCDs, IC design, memory devices, Automobile Electronics devices... in their Economic Daily News ( <a href="http://udn.com/NEWS/FINANCE/" rel="nofollow">http://udn.com/NEWS/FINANCE/</a> )<br><br>80% of global notebook sales were manufactured, assembled and distributed by Taiwanese firms (in China).<br><br>They are now 2nd (after South Korea) in global LCD displays manufacturing. Their dominance and strength in value chain (PC and LCD) had recently attracted Corning and many participated parties (material suppliers, equipments vendors) to invest heaily in Taiwan (not China).<br><br>Unlike our Biopolis, the Taiwanese built their semiconductor empire from the ground up.<br><br><blockquote>The Biopolis will need more such anchor companies that act as magnets for other major companies - both rivavl and allied firms. Because anchor companies buy goods and services, they also attract numerous companies in related and supporting industries, which help strengthen and mature the cluster.</blockquote>Equate Novartis with TSMC, UMC and equate GSK with Quanta, ACER, Benq....,<br>the only difference, Novartis and GSK were incentised, attracted, lured to invest in Singapore, Novartis and GSK are not Singapore companies, inventions and patents by Novartis and GSK are not Singapore inventions and patents. If Malaysia, Taiwan or South Korea put more efforts they could emulate a Biopolis in their countries and lured those Giants.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In the first 30 years of nation building, Singapore had indeed benefited tremendously due to our resource rich but management poor neighbours. We had used to the days when Singapore was the only investor friendly nation in SE Asia, where our Orchard Road and Shenton Way was packed with AngMo and Jap. Our stock index was in the Bull Mode and kept rocketing upwards, with new investments and FDI from overseas investors.<br><br>Why? The reason was simple. Singapore was the beach-head  for the foreign investors to tap the resources from our neighbours using the so-call Singapore Networking with Malaysian and Indon elites.

She refused to listen to others, spun up her own set of praise rhetoric, and decried  everyone else as fools. In like fashion, she was slammed down too. My friend, youa re sadly becoming more and more like this obnoxious lady I have just introduced to you. Robert and I, esp. me, have spent numerous posts relating FACTS to you, and you are simply rejecting the FACTS and TRUTH over and over again. In short, your quality of discussion is degenerating.<br><br>Is it right for you to call others losers, when you yourself are a bigger loser than any of the oppo, simply by the virtue that you haven't contested in any GE before? Not that I defend CSJ or Sylvia Lim or anyone - but seriously, your character assassination attempts are just as low-class at that of the Straits Times or of stooges like Caroline.<br><br>Singaporeans actually have not really been able to show their true level of support for the govt, and are not even allowed to vote for the President now. The extreme percentage of voters in walkover constituencies in the last GE prove ambiguity in the true national popular support the govt has. Fine, p'raps you find that existence of walkovers does not prove anything, but even then, it shows EMPIRICALLY - tt is, by figures - how small the definite PAP support is as a fraction of our 4m people.<br><br>And anyway, Mr Kuan didn't exactly "cry foul" or "attempt to discredit the winners", whom I guess is Mr Nathan. Even the opposition haven't been character-assassinating Nathan in their own press releases although they are the ones most often character-assassianted by the PAP. They have responsibly criticized the electoral process, as many concerned citizens writing to the press have. Because seriously, the eligibility criteria need to be reviewed. GO and read them yourself, and if you are as rational as you (implicitly) claim to be, then you will agree with me on this point.<br><br>The only one who is having illusions, my dear friend, is you. To claim that the govt has done NOTHING wrong a a blatant lie, and only a blind person cannot see that. Even LKY acknowledged that certain policies he pursued in the past, like dual-language and (robert, this is for you too) inviting MNCs to set up here were mistakes in their own way. He hasn't apologised for EVERYTHING yet, but at least he is starting to claim responsibility. You are sadly living in a pipe dream if you still believe the govt has done nth wrong. Hmm.. I think I shall support a govt initiative to ban smoking...<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>jeez.*sigh* If you can't understand me after all this, you're a real thicko.<br><br>Please, I beg you, step out of your twilight zone into the New Morning of the Reality.

PAP co-optation of talent: the moment you're an elite who shows an inclination toward opposition viewpoints, you are called for a "tea party". Look at what happened to former RoundTable leader Raymond Lim and Ex-national-debates-champion Vivian Balakrishnan. It pains me to see how a national-class medal-winning opposition debater cannot even see the relevance of the anti-Casino points in this year's debate, when that was what he won gold medal for - debating against the construction of a Casino - in 1993.  His pro-casino arguments, particularly the one about maturity, were super-pathetic, and do not bring good face to the National Debates Association. Similarly, look at the difference between Raymond Lim of the RoundTable, an organization similar to ThinkCentre, and the Raymond Lim of Now, Minister Of State for Trade and Industry. It is shocking how he has changed.<br><br>And note, the word co-optation implies that there was no choice for those men, or very spurious choice in the least. At least for Mr Lim, it was probably the only guarantee of survival as a free citizen; none of us knows what is his PRIVATE view though.<br><br>iii. PAP's control of the economy: Does Singapore have a free market? Only on paper. No MNC or large company will be willing to finance the opposition if it means they might risk losing operating licenses or worse, go through long trials like the one NKF has just gone through. No MNC in the country wants to be SIngapore's next Enron. In the case of small business operators, they run the REAL risk of losing their business licenses ie. not having licenses renewed, if they do not support the PAP, or so my friend heard from her local grocer. In such circumstances, which money-earning firm would support the opposition?<br><br>And don't forget, the most major firms, the GLCs like Temasek Holdings and A* Star, are run by government associates anyway. Seriously, would Madam Ho not vote for her husband's Party?<br><br>iv. SPH's Media-slander campaigns: You can easily contrast the newspapers' treatment of Opposition with their treatment of government figures. TODAY is slightly more objective than the Straits Times, but the government is still covered more favourably. This is significant not only in what they report, but also in what they don't report. for instance, PAP's anniversary is given at least 4 complete pages of coverage in ST; WP's anniversary is given at most 1/3 of a page.<br><br>Given the deplorable slant the media has, the opposition lose their final avenue of appeal for funds, whereas obviously funds for the PAP would flow in. Everyone likes to have a good image.<br><br>b -&gt; the media-slander campaigns.<br><br>c -&gt;  The GRC system: seems racially equitable? Since PAP is the largest party, it can obviously afford (not in monetary terms) to put at least 8-9 candidates up for election in each constituency. but the opposition, having much dwindled in numbers, are unable to obtain such a large group for each constituency, esp. when you factor in other election requirements. To compound to the opposition's woes, they have to meet the racial quota of the GRC-election system. Given all these constraints, how the heck are they supposed to be able to contest in the major constituencies? isn't it then no surprise that all the major constituencies are walkovers?<br><br>As for the PE, you really need to think out of the box here: Have you ever even considered considering the thought that the guidelines themselves are flawed? I'm sure you probably would have, unless you don't read the forum pages on the Straits Times. Of course, the government is the only agency capable of amending the guidelines, since the guidelines are in the Constitution.<br><br>3) The fact remains that the majority of citizens did not even vote in the GE, so henceforth the true level of support the people have for the government is indeterminate. Not to mention the fear of lack of HDB upgrading etc possesed by those electors in non-walkover constituencies.<br><br>Most honest? I seriously doubt any politican in the world can be considered honest in his/her field of work. If the government were honest, we might perhaps learn the full objective history of Operation Spectrum and Operation Coldstore, complete with undedited international opinion, instead of having both entirely obiliterated from the school syllabus. (this excludes uni) If the government were honest, there should certainly be more admissions of mistakes rather than shelving the blame of faults to the people or to "the international situation" or to "the terrorists" or to "the decadent west". And clearly, shelving the blame is what the PAP does best. So, they are honest?<br><br>Best? Again, like I said before, best in economics perhaps, but not best in social management; even this happens to be one of the rare admissions of failure LKY himself has made.<br><br>Regards,<br>the pikamaster</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hello Iamgoondu,<br><br>The report you referred to will not be published in our press for the purpose of nation building as bad news of this type about our property collapse might destabilise the people.<br><br>Years back our leaders like PM Mr. Goh Chok Tong asked people to put in their hard-earned monies and CPF into properties. He believed that property prices have no where to go except up. Then came the crash with the same leaders making every move to push down prices by increasing purchase deposits, prohibiting further bank financing.<br><br>The Singapore's property experience is one created by not entirely by greed of people but by political leaders pushing people with incentives and liberalizing of purchase conditions etc resulting in the property prices going skyhigh which made no sense whatsoever.<br><br>When prices dropped drastically in 1997/1998, billions of CPF savings were wiped out. Today, people lost their retirements because of this property gamble that leaders took the gamble in and failed. People jumped into property bandwagon like no tomorrow, pushing up HDB flat prices to increase government's profits and releasing CPF monies for this purpose unlike Ireland.<br><br>Even though Ireland has enjoyed a frenzied property boom and prices have climbed more than 130 percent, the steepest curve in Europe and its construction industry now employs a massive 12 percent of the work force, it is unlike our own government's case of pushing citizens into a massive property gamble.<br><br>Even though the Irish property boom was caused by some forms of government's involvements their property boom and corrections were not attributable to government to the same extent as has happened in our case which is largely due to government's actions.<br><br>Our world-class leaders have again outperformed Irish leaders who have merely allowed property boom in Ireland to take its own natural course.<br><br>Meanwhile, even if Irish growth and industrial output are slowing and there is a realization that booming real-estate construction and consumer demand can carry the economy only so far, Ireland did not suffer the kind of property drop as Singaporeans have suffered. Hundreds of thousands have their retirements wiped out and are now trying to eek out a living by working in odd jobs with no help from the anti-welfare government.<br><br>Ireland might be suffering from over-priced property and is trying to make amends, in our case, our property prices are now at the bottom or sliding further due to government actions.<br><br>I agree with correspondent Diarmaid MacDermott (Dublin) that Ireland has been slow to make certain transformation of its economy but generally its property experiences are not as worse as has happened to Singapore.</div>

Our present generation of leaders have not succeeded in upgrading the economy to value-adding advanced technological base talked about for years because they lack the x-factor. They only know that by certain academic qualifications and some years of service among the upper elites they can easily step into position of powers and earning high salaries without creating new technology start-ups or upgrading of the economic competitiveness.<br><br>Given another 10 years they will still be inducting and talking about talents and unable to uplift the economy. It is time they step aside and let some non-talented people who have done something good in private sector to show them how to run the country better with lesser salary costs to the citizens.</div>
