              <h1>World's most wanted 'hiding in Australia'</h1>
              <p class="published">Posted <span class="timestamp">Mon Jun 1, 2009 5:00pm AEST</span></p>
              <p class="first">Police say 16 of the world's most wanted fugitives could be hiding out in Australia.</p>
              <p>Crime Stoppers has launched an international campaign to track down
              100 of the world's most notorious criminals, including South African
              paedophile George Prinsloo.</p>
              <p>Police believe Prinsloo, who is alleged to have sexually abused
              numerous children he took from orphanages, is one of 16 fugitives who
              have entered Australia and could still be here.</p>
              <p>The list also includes Canadian Hells Angels bikie David MacDonald Carrol, who is wanted in connection with 13 murders.</p>
              <p>The head of Crime Stoppers Australia, Peter Price, says the
              organisation hopes to catch as many fugitives as possible during its
              month-long campaign.</p>
              <p>"We're looking for 16 people and there's 20 million Australians
              living here and 45,000 police, so one would hope that we have a better
              than fair chance. But if we get one, we will regard that as
              successful," he said.</p>
              <p>"The 16 people we are featuring today may be in Australia or may
              have been here at some point in time and may go by a different name.</p>
              <p>"They're all hardened criminals, some of them using physical force
              and some of them laundering money and being involved in organised
              crime, and we have co-ordinated this internationally to try and capture
              these people."</p>

The amount later ballooned to more than RM140,000. <br><br>'Now he has gone into hiding and I don't know where he has gone to. I hope the loan sharks will leave me and my daughter alone and not ask us to pay for him,' she said, adding that her daughter was living in Kuala Lumpur. <br><br>She added that she was no longer working and had no money to settle her son's debt. <br><br>Madam Foong, who is no longer living in her house for fear of the loan sharks' threats, said she had tried raising funds to help her son pay up the debts but failed to come up with the money. <br><br>'Now I want to tell the loan sharks that I have severed all ties with my son and there is no point in demanding payment from me,' she added. -- The Star/ANN.<br><br><a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/Latest%2BNews/S-E%2BAsia/STIStory_253837.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #417e15;">http://www.straitstimes.com/Latest%2...ry_253837.html</span></span></a></p></div>

              <div class="post-body">
              <p> </p>
              <a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_XtsjYwdj2Ic/SehhOJoYv3I/AAAAAAAAAy4/cv5HfQE4UWQ/s1600-h/loanshark.jpg"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5325613455096987506" style="display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; width: 320px; cursor: hand; height: 156px; text-align: center;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_XtsjYwdj2Ic/SehhOJoYv3I/AAAAAAAAAy4/cv5HfQE4UWQ/s320/loanshark.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a> Times are bad and the number of loanshark harassment cases has climbed sharply. Police had to deal a total of 4000 cases in the first 3 months of this year. But don't worry our Home Affairs Minister has come up with a brilliant solution to reduce the number of cases our police have to handle:<br><br>
              <div><em>"The ministry will also consider <strong>making</strong> <strong>borrowing from loansharks an offence</strong>."</em></div>
              <div><em>- DPM Wong Kan Seng.[<a href="http://news.asiaone.com/News/AsiaOne+News/Crime/Story/A1Story20090417-135750.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #6699cc;">Link</span></span></a>]</em></div>
              <div><em><span style="color: #ffffff;">.</span></em></div>
              <div><em>"This would be good news for us. If the police arrest those who borrow, they won't dare to report us when we harass them," - Loanshark who welcomes the move[<a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/print/Free/Story/STIStory_214945.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #6699cc;">Link</span></span></a>]</em></div>
              <div><span style="color: #ffffff;">,</span></div>
              <div><em></em></div>
              <div>If you still don't understand how brilliant this solution is, let me explain. The police has to handle so many cases of loansharking because the victims go to the police for help. By criminalising borrowing from loansharks, the victims of loanshark harassment now cannot go to the police for help because they themselves will be arrested for borrowing from the loansharks. The police will see a sharp drop in the number of cases and the govt can say the problem is solved! Briliant! Bravo! Now victims of loansharks have to suffer quietly. This will free up vast amounts of resources - there will be more police to handle those pesky opposition members and peaceful protestors who break our new our public order laws. I thought sending our old folks to JB was the best idea for the year -I was wrong.... this one is a lot more brilliant!</div>

              <p>hmm... filming an illegal event is criminalized, borrowing money from illegal loansharks may be made a criminal offense.. What's next? Maybe they'll penalize victims from rape, theft, murder.. etc in future.</p>

              <p>Why not extend this superb idea to all cases?<br><br>Make everyone who makes a police report post a bond of $10k. It will be returned to the victim only when the perpetrator has been found guilty by the courts.<br><br>A more brilliant solution is to charge a fee for using law enforcement services. Want that robber caught? Pay $3k to the police. Want loanshark caught? Pay $5k. Can pay by CPF and installments also.<br><br>These solutions will reduce the official crime rates and make Singapore the safest city in the world!</p>

              <p>Dr Ong Seh Hong who borrowed 60K (the equivalent of an annual pay of an ordinary Singaporean) from Ming Yi.

He knew that the PAP wants to take over his hospital organization to service the lucrative healthcare tourism (same reason for Khaw to want to kick old Singaporeans out to JB).<br><br>Ming Yi should do the next best thing: to declare himself as a loanshark who cannot say 'NO' and kill this greedy MP Ong once and for all.</p>

              <p>Making borrowing from loanshark illegal, I see.<br><br>What a clever way to free PAP from its responsibility to the society without finding out why more and more are resorting to this type of credit.<br><br>Better solution for Wong Kan Seng is since loansharks are doing a roaring business, lets beat them to it ... just like PAP beats illegal 4D operators hands down. <br><br>Well if you don't remember, in the 70's illegal 4D operators were rampant and PAP constantly raided them. Then a brilliant idea came to PAP, lets create state-run 4Ds betting franchises. <br><br>Now you can see them all around. And PAP and some critics are worried the IRs will bring a gambling scourge to Singapore. <br><br>Open ya eyes! For that matter, these 4D outlets partly or even largely explain why loanshark business is booming in Singapore.<br><br>So you see that's how PAP "resolved" the betting problem by making it legal, hehe. No wonder it is praised around the world for being such a great government. <br><br>So I am sure PAP with its brilliant advisers will come up with something like that. <br><br>The news already reported that permits have been issued to high interest money lenders when formerly such permits were refused. <br><br>PAP just have to impose a high licence fee or even get DBS into the same act to reap from this business and thus PAP will also have "resolved" this loanshark problem.<br><br>Hey in the US it was such high-interest loans through credit cards that did their economy in; here PAP might well think otherwise.</p>

              <p>Simple but yet brilliant analysis by lucky ! lol<br><br>And perhaps PM,MM and SM should pool their wealth and start a scheme that provides loans to PAP MPs and grass-roots supporters. Their combined wealth should be more than 200M $ ! The other multi Million $ ministers can also contribute to make loans available to all PAP members. Such loans should be interest-free, repayable over 20 to 30 years and of course whilst serving party interests. <br>This is a lot better than having PAP members borrowing from monks or loansharks which is not good for PAP's image and it is perfectly LEEgal. lol</p>

              <p>Whether or not it is a good idea depends on the composition of borrowers. Are they mostly irresponsible spenders/gamblers or genuinely needy people?<br><br>If it is the former, then I support criminalizing borrowers. As for the needy, once they borrow from loan sharks, it is very unlikely they will be able to repay. In fact, I would imagine the debt will grow because of the ridiculous interest rates (correct me if I am wrong). So, this source of borrowing should not be encouraged in order to prevent them from falling further into the pit.<br><br>However, for the needy, criminalizing them is no fair because loan sharks are probably their last resort.<br><br>So, if there is a way to separate the irresponsible ones from the needy, it would be great. Also, more thought has to go into how to prevent the needy from borrowing from loan sharks or helping them repay the sum.<br><br>As for existing borrowers, if it is possible, maybe they can decide on a cutting-off date, so only those who borrow after the implementation will be charged.<br><br>The only concern I have is that loan sharks may resort to trickery to trap people into borrowing because they have to keep their income channel alive.</p>

              <p><strong>I actually support the idea of making borrowing from loansharks an offense</strong>Just recently, a neighbour of mine had his window poured with red paint.

People not relating to the borrower suffering from the consequences<br>3. People related to the borrower suffering from the consequences<br><br>If I'm in charge of passing this law, I'll pass it instantly without blinking an eye.<br><br>About people suffering in silence?

              <p>In the US, there's all kind of money lending/borrowing business, such as payday loan.

              <p>Maybe MHA did not do enough research before releasing this news. <br><br>Drawing a decision tree will help to know possible decision that will be made by the people who is directly or indirectly involved. <br><br>This policy, I think it will make matter worse.<br>For example, if I am in deep shit and need money, what would I do? Borrow first then decide what to do next. <br><br>Next, if I do not report my ”crime”, there won’t be any case on me. I believe my family will not report loan sharks cases to the police because I will get into trouble. What’s next? Suffer in silence.(Just think that most families won’t want their members to put in jail.) <br><br>Lucky, by now the loan sharks must be celebrating!! There is no way or hardly a way the police can track them down without the borrower's family reporting it. <br>The loan sharks will just have to pick on the right family. I think this is obvious.<br><br>Lesser number of loan sharks case might just be an illusion. The number of loan sharks might increase. The only difference is, the cases are not recorded.<br>Nail down the loan sharks and eliminate them should be the only way to solve the problem.<br>Agree totally agree with lucky's post.</p>

              <p>this reminds me of another recent law from MHA.<br><br>There's been a rise in contraband cigarettes in singapore. So instead of better policing at the borders, they decided to mark every single cigarette in Singapore with the duty paid logo.<br><br>Citizens, well smoking ones, get punished, instead of working harder to to catch the smugglers.<br><br>Now we'll likely go into a slippery slope argument.. if borrowing money from loansharks is illegal, then we should then make everything that leads to debts illegal too eg addictive gamblers should be fined or jailed. <br><br>or every form of vice in our society should also be made illegal like alcoholism. <br><br>it must be the MHA - the same people who say that ONE person gathering can be deemed an illegal gathering.<br><br>absurd, absolutely absurd.</p>

Might be better for you to be stopped from falling into the pit.<br><br>"...if I do not report my ”crime”, there won’t be any case on me."<br><br>The loan sharks will use it to blackmail you to extort more until you tak boleh tahan and report yourself.<br><br>"Nail down the loan sharks and eliminate them should be the only way to solve the problem."<br><br>Definitely, this should be the priority. I believe making borrowing a criminal act in meant to be supplementary.</p>

              <p>"what if u borrow ah long and ur daughter or wife was forced to or out of love sell herself secretly help u pay off ur debt???"<br><br>It is your irresponsibility that causes your wife's or daughter's "suffering" and you blame others for being heartless?<br><br>No wonder they have to criminalize borrowing - some people just do not have conscience and they expect everyone else to tolerate that (including being victims of ah long's debt collection tactics when you do not pay up and waste of police resources that can be deployed for better uses).</p>

              <p>the way i see it: the main reason is to protect innocent pple who are harassed by the loansharks when real borrowers clear out of the old place. however even with the new law, the loan sharks will still continue to harass the new owners what.<br><br>the question is why polic cannot catch these loan sharks - why are they so elusive even when security cameras are installed by the new owners? the police shld tell us.<br><br>the other angle we can do, is for hdb or relevant authorities to keep new owners advised of the new hdb address of the real borrowers. this transparency is only fair, not just in the case of loan shark harrassment. it also helps if there is a hidden defect in the unit for which the previous owner is accountable for.<br><br>if you ask me, the real reason why wks wants this is because of the coming ir. they anticipate a lot of social problems, and they simply want to wash their hands of it. this is "you die, you business" - the same strategy in healthcare, housing and law and order.</p>

              <p>Actually I don't see what's wrong with making borrowing from loansharks an offense. If providing an illegal loan is an offense, why shouldn't taking the illegal loan be an offense as well? For those people afraid of this new law, here's a simple solution: Don't take money from loansharks.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Two weeks ago, taxi driver Philip Toh opened his letterbox and found a brown envelope lying inside. Typewritten in Chinese and broken English, the letter, written by someone called "Ah Soon", warned that his gate would be locked and paint would be spilled on his door.<br><br>It was not as if Mr Toh, who lives on the ninth floor of a Hougang Avenue 7 flat, owed the loanshark money. But one of his neighbours on the 10th floor apparently did. To put pressure on the man to pay up, the loanshark mass-mailed his threat to all residents who lived within a floor of him.<br><br>This is not the only recent case where a loanshark has dragged in a debtor's neighbours and threatened them with locks and paint to arm-twist his real target.<br><br>Over the last few weeks, residents in Clementi, Ang Mo Kio and Bukit Panjang have also received similar letters.<br><br>In each case, the letter carries the same message and words of threat, suggesting it could be the same loanshark using this technique in different parts of the island. The only thing to distinguish the letters in different neighbourhoods is the name and address of the debtor.<br><br>The threatening letters are accompanied by hell bank notes – burnt by the Chinese during prayers as offerings to the netherworld – as well as a mobile phone number, which presumably belongs to the loanshark. The debtor's neighbours have been invited to call 'Ah Soon' should they spot the debtor.<br><br>Sources pointed out that the phone number could have been registered using the identity card of a debtor to conceal the loanshark's real identity.<br><br>When Today visited the flat of the debtor – a fishmonger who is said to have borrowed as much as $40,000 to settle gambling debts – he was not at home. Neighbours have not spotted him for some time but his gate and the walls of his flat have been vandalised with paint.<br><br>The letters have evoked mixed reactions among those getting dragged into disputes between their neighbours and loansharks.<br><br>Said Ms Tan GH, 46, a businesswoman living in Bukit Panjang: "I wake up every morning wondering if my door has been locked. I wonder what will happen if they really carry out the threat. This is affecting a lot of innocent people."<br><br>Similarly, Mr Guan Teck Seng, whose mother have received a letter – also from Ah Soon – at her Ang Mo Kio block, has asked several of his brothers to take turns staying at her house.<br><br>"These people are capable of anything. Remember what happened to the woman who suffered a miscarriage after a loanshark pushed her?" said Mr Guan.<br><br>Other residents have turned to the police for help.<br><br>One of them, Lim Sui Yon, a businessman who lives in Clementi West Street 2, said he and several other neighbours had made separate police reports.<br><br>"I would catch them if I could, but I don't have the power," said Mr Lim, 60.<br><br>The police, however, warned the public against confronting the loansharks or their runners.<br><br>"The affected residents and their neighbours can help the police with their vigilance and expeditious reporting and descriptions of suspicious persons in the neighbourhood and unlicensed moneylending activities," said police spokesman Assistant Superintendent Victor Keong. "However, they should not put themselves at risk of harm in any way in the course of doing so."<br><br>In at least three major police swoops this year, 80 people were arrested between January and March for unlicensed moneylending activities.<br><br>The number of reports complaining of harassment by loansharks has also increased. In the first three months of this year, police received 2,520 reports. For the same period last year, there were 1,444 reports of harassment.<br><br>Yesterday, Ah Soon was not answering the phone number he had offered so brazenly. But Mr Toh, the Hougang resident, said that one of his neighbour's had called the loanshark recently.<br><br>"When asked why was he doing this to us, he laughed and said, 'bo bian lah (Hokkien for no choice)'," said Mr Toh. cna/rose</p></div>
