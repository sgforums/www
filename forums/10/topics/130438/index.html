My Opinion ? Abullah talks sense.And let's not forget, just because it doesn't look like corruption (paying MPs high salaries) doesn't mean the Authortarian role of the ministers haven't taken place. In effect, its like telling the citizens that we ought to pay them more to have their hearts and minds right in running the country</div>

High salaries could indeed curb corruption, but only for a short while. The funny thing about money is that the more one has it, the less one tends to be satisfied with the amount one has.
