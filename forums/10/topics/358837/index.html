              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>"What we would call capitalism he despised"</strong><br> <br> <strong>By Noam Chomsky</strong><br> <br> Excerpted from Class Warfare - 1995<br> <br> <strong>May 04, 2009 "</strong><a href="http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/"><strong>Information Clearing House</strong></a><strong>" -- David Barsamian</strong>:
              One of the heroes of the current right-wing revival... is Adam Smith.
              You've done some pretty impressive research on Smith that has
              excavated... a lot of information that's not coming out. You've often
              quoted him describing the "vile maxim of the masters of mankind: all
              for ourselves and nothing for other people."<br> <br> Noam Chomsky: I didn't do any research at all on Smith. I just read
              him. There's no research. Just read it. He's pre-capitalist, a figure
              of the Enlightenment. What we would call capitalism he despised. People
              read snippets of Adam Smith, the few phrases they teach in school.
              Everybody reads the first paragraph of The Wealth of Nations where he
              talks about how wonderful the division of labor is. But not many people
              get to the point hundreds of pages later, where he says that division
              of labor will destroy human beings and turn people into creatures as
              stupid and ignorant as it is possible for a human being to be. And
              therefore in any civilized society the government is going to have to
              take some measures to prevent division of labor from proceeding to its
              limits.<br> <br> He did give an argument for markets, but the argument was that under
              conditions of perfect liberty, markets will lead to perfect equality.
              That's the argument for them, because he thought that equality of
              condition (not just opportunity) is what you should be aiming at. It
              goes on and on. He gave a devastating critique of what we would call
              North-South policies. He was talking about England and India. He
              bitterly condemned the British experiments they were carrying out which
              were devastating India.<br> <br> He also made remarks which ought to be truisms about the way states
              work. He pointed out that its totally senseless to talk about a nation
              and what we would nowadays call "national interests." He simply
              observed in passing, because it's so obvious, that in England, which is
              what he's discussing -- and it was the most democratic society of the
              day -- the principal architects of policy are the "merchants and
              manufacturers," and they make certain that their own interests are, in
              his words, "most peculiarly attended to," no matter what the effect on
              others, including the people of England who, he argued, suffered from
              their policies. He didn't have the data to prove it at the time, but he
              was probably right.<br> <br> This truism was, a century later, called class analysis, but you don't
              have to go to Marx to find it. It's very explicit in Adam Smith. It's
              so obvious that any ten-year-old can see it. So he didn't make a big
              point of it. He just mentioned it. But that's correct. If you read
              through his work, he's intelligent. He's a person who was from the
              Enlightenment. His driving motives were the assumption that people were
              guided by sympathy and feelings of solidarity and the need for control
              of their own work, much like other Enlightenment and early Romantic
              thinkers. He's part of that period, the Scottish Enlightenment.<br> <br> The version of him that's given today is just ridiculous. But I didn't
              have to any research to find this out. All you have to do is read. If
              you're literate, you'll find it out. I did do a little research in the
              way it's treated, and that's interesting. For example, the University
              of Chicago, the great bastion of free market economics, etc., etc.,
              published a bicentennial edition of the hero, a scholarly edition with
              all the footnotes and the introduction by a Nobel Prize winner, George
              Stigler, a huge index, a real scholarly edition. That's the one I used.
              It's the best edition. The scholarly framework was very interesting,
              including Stigler's introduction. It's likely he never opened The
              Wealth of Nations. Just about everything he said about the book was
              completely false. I went through a bunch of examples in writing about
              it, in Year 501 and elsewhere.<br> <br> But even more interesting in some ways was the index. Adam Smith is
              very well known for his advocacy of division of labor. Take a look at
              "division of labor" in the index and there are lots and lots of things
              listed. But there's one missing, namely his denunciation of division of
              labor, the one I just cited. That's somehow missing from the index. It
              goes on like this. I wouldn't call this research because it's ten
              minutes' work, but if you look at the scholarship, then it's
              interesting.<br> <br> I want to be clear about this. There is good Smith scholarship. If you
              look at the serious Smith scholarship, nothing I'm saying is any
              surprise to anyone. How could it be? You open the book and you read it
              and it's staring you right in the face. On the other hand if you look
              at the myth of Adam Smith, which is the only one we get, the
              discrepancy between that and the reality is enormous.<br> <br> This is true of classical liberalism in general. The founders of
              classical liberalism, people like Adam Smith and Wilhelm von Humboldt,
              who is one of the great exponents of classical liberalism, and who
              inspired John Stuart Mill -- they were what we would call libertarian
              socialists, at least that ïs the way I read them. For example,
              Humboldt, like Smith, says, Consider a craftsman who builds some
              beautiful thing. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Humboldt says if he does it under external coercion,
              like pay, for wages, we may admire what he does but we despise what he
              is. On the other hand, if he does it out of his own free, creative
              expression of himself, under free will, not under external coercion of
              wage labor, then we also admire what he is because he's a human being.
              He said any decent socioeconomic system will be based on the assumption
              that people have the freedom to inquire and create -- since that's the
              fundamental nature of humans -- in free association with others, but
              certainly not under the kinds of external constraints that came to be
              called capitalism.<br> <br> It's the same when you read Jefferson. He lived a half century later,
              so he saw state capitalism developing, and he despised it, of course.
              He said it's going to lead to a form of absolutism worse than the one
              we defended ourselves against. In fact, if you run through this whole
              period you see a very clear, sharp critique of what we would later call
              capitalism and certainly of the twentieth century version of it, which
              is designed to destroy individual, even entrepreneurial capitalism.<br> <br> There's a side current here which is rarely looked at but which is also
              quite fascinating. That's the working class literature of the
              nineteenth century. They didn't read Adam Smith and Wilhelm von
              Humboldt, but they're saying the same things. Read journals put out by
              the people called the "factory girls of Lowell," young women in the
              factories, mechanics, and other working people who were running their
              own newspapers. It's the same kind of critique.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> There was a real battle
              fought by working people in England and the U.S. to defend themselves
              against what they called the degradation and oppression and violence of
              the industrial capitalist system, which was not only dehumanizing them
              but was even radically reducing their intellectual level. So, you go
              back to the mid-nineteenth century and these so-called "factory girls,"
              young girls working in the Lowell [Massachusetts] mills, were reading
              serious contemporary literature. They recognized that the point of the
              system was to turn them into tools who would be manipulated, degraded,
              kicked around, and so on. And they fought against it bitterly for a
              long period. That's the history of the rise of capitalism.<br> <br> The other part of the story is the development of corporations, which
              is an interesting story in itself. Adam Smith didn't say much about
              them, but he did criticize the early stages of them. Jefferson lived
              long enough to see the beginnings, and he was very strongly opposed to
              them. But the development of corporations really took place in the
              early twentieth century and very late in the nineteenth century.
              Originally, corporations existed as a public service. People would get
              together to build a bridge and they would be incorporated for that
              purpose by the state. They built the bridge and that's it. They were
              supposed to have a public interest function. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Well into the 1870s,
              states were removing corporate charters. They were granted by the
              state. They didn't have any other authority. They were fictions. They
              were removing corporate charters because they weren't serving a public
              function. But then you get into the period of the trusts and various
              efforts to consolidate power that were beginning to be made in the late
              nineteenth century. It's interesting to look at the literature. The
              courts didn't really accept it. There were some hints about it. It
              wasn't until the early twentieth century that courts and lawyers
              designed a new socioeconomic system. It was never done by legislation.
              It was done mostly by courts and lawyers and the power they could
              exercise over individual states. New Jersey was the first state to
              offer corporations any right they wanted. Of course, all the capital in
              the country suddenly started to flow to New Jersey, for obvious
              reasons. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Then the other states had to do the same thing just to defend
              themselves or be wiped out. It's kind of a small-scale globalization.
              Then the courts and the corporate lawyers came along and created a
              whole new body of doctrine which gave corporations authority and power
              that they never had before. If you look at the background of it, it's
              the same background that led to fascism and Bolshevism. A lot of it was
              supported by people called progressives, for these reasons: They said,
              individual rights are gone. We are in a period of corporatization of
              power, consolidation of power, centralization. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">That's supposed to be
              good if you're a progressive, like a Marxist-Leninist. Out of that same
              background came three major things: fascism, Bolshevism, and corporate
              tyranny. They all grew out of the same more or less Hegelian roots.
              It's fairly recent. We think of corporations as immutable, but they
              were designed. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">It was a conscious design which worked as Adam Smith
              said: the principal architects of policy consolidate state power and
              use it for their interests. It was certainly not popular will. It's
              basically court decisions and lawyers' decisions, which created a form
              of private tyranny which is now more massive in many ways than even
              state tyranny was. These are major parts of modern twentieth century
              history. The classical liberals would be horrified. They didn't even
              imagine this. But the smaller things that they saw, they were already
              horrified about. This would have totally scandalized Adam Smith or
              Jefferson or anyone like that....<br> <br> David Barsamian: ....You're very patient with people, particularly
              people who ask the most inane kinds of questions. Is this something
              you've cultivated?<br> <br> Noam Chomsky: First of all, I'm usually fuming inside, so what you see
              on the outside isn't necessarily what's inside. But as far as
              questions, the only thing I ever get irritated about is elite
              intellectuals, the stuff they do I do find irritating. I shouldn't. I
              should expect it. But I do find it irritating. But on the other hand,
              what you're describing as inane questions usually strike me as
              perfectly honest questions. People have no reason to believe anything
              other than what they're saying. If you think about where the questioner
              is coming from, what the person has been exposed to, that's a very
              rational and intelligent question. It may sound inane from some other
              point of view, but it's not at all inane from within the framework in
              which it's being raised. It's usually quite reasonable. So there's
              nothing to be irritated about.<br> <br> You may be sorry about the conditions in which the questions arise. The
              thing to do is to try to help them get out of their intellectual
              confinement, which is not just accidental, as I mentioned. There are
              huge efforts that do go into making people, to borrow Adam Smith's
              phrase, "as stupid and ignorant as it is possible for a human being to
              be." A lot of the educational system is designed for that, if you think
              about it, it's designed for obedience and passivity. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">From childhood, a
              lot of it is designed to prevent people from being independent and
              creative. If you're independent-minded in school, you're probably going
              to get into trouble very early on. That's not the trait that's being
              preferred or cultivated. When people live through all this stuff, plus
              corporate propaganda, plus television, plus the press and the whole
              mass, the deluge of ideological distortion that goes on, they ask
              questions that from another point of view are completely reasonable....<br> <br> David Barsamian: At the Mellon lecture that you gave in Chicago... you
              focused primarily on the ideas of John Dewey and Bertrand Russell
              [regarding education]...<br> <br> Noam Chomsky: ... These were highly libertarian ideas. Dewey himself
              comes straight from the American mainstream. People who read what he
              actually said would now consider him some far-out anti-American lunatic
              or something. He was expressing mainstream thinking before the
              ideological system had so grotesquely distorted the tradition. By now,
              it's unrecognizable. For example, not only did he agree with the whole
              Enlightenment tradition that, as he put it, "the goal of production is
              to produce free people," -- "free men," he said, but that's many years
              ago. That's the goal of production, not to produce commodities. He was
              a major theorist of democracy. There were many different, conflicting
              strands of democratic theory, but the one I'm talking about held that
              democracy requires dissolution of private power.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> He said as long as
              there is private control over the economic system, talk about democracy
              is a joke. Repeating basically Adam Smith, Dewey said, Politics is the
              shadow that big business casts over society. He said attenuating the
              shadow doesn't do much. Reforms are still going to leave it tyrannical.
              Basically, a classical liberal view. His main point was that you can't
              even talk about democracy until you have democratic control of
              industry, commerce, banking, everything. That means control by the
              people who work in the institutions, and the communities.<br> <br> These are standard libertarian socialist and anarchist ideas which go
              straight back to the Enlightenment, an outgrowth of the views of the
              kind that we were talking about before from classical liberalism. Dewey
              represented these in the modern period, as did Bertrand Russell, from
              another tradition, but again with roots in the Enlightenment. These
              were two of the major, if not the two major thinkers, of the twentieth
              century, whose ideas are about as well known as the real Adam Smith.
              Which is a sign of how efficient the educational system has been, and
              the propaganda system, in simply destroying even our awareness of our
              own immediate intellectual background.<br> <br> David Barsamian: In that same Mellon lecture, you paraphrased Russell
              on education. You said that he promoted the idea that education is not
              to be viewed as something like filling a vessel with water, but rather
              assisting a flower to grow in its own way...<br> <br> Noam Chomsky: That's an eighteenth century idea. I don't know if
              Russell knew about it or reinvented it, but you read that as standard
              in early Enlightenment literature. That's the image that was used...
              Humboldt, the founder of classical liberalism, his view was that
              education is a matter of laying out a string along which the child will
              develop, but in its own way. You may do some guiding. That's what
              serious education would be from kindergarten up through graduate
              school. You do get it in advanced science, because there's no other way
              to do it.<br> <br> But most of the educational system is quite different. Mass education
              was designed to turn independent farmers into docile, passive tools of
              production. That was its primary purpose. And don't think people didn't
              know it. They knew it and they fought against it. There was a lot of
              resistance to mass education for exactly that reason. It was also
              understood by the elites. Emerson once said something about how we're
              educating them to keep them from our throats. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">If you don't educate
              them, what we call "education," they're going to take control -- "they"
              being what Alexander Hamilton called the "great beast," namely the
              people. The anti-democratic thrust of opinion in what are called
              democratic societies is really ferocious. And for good reason. Because
              the freer the society gets, the more dangerous the great beast becomes
              and the more you have to be careful to cage it somehow.<br> <br> On the other hand, there are exceptions, and Dewey and Russell are
              among those exceptions. But they are completely marginalized and
              unknown, although everybody sings praises to them, as they do to Adam
              Smith. What they actually said would be considered intolerable in the
              autocratic climate of dominant opinion. The totalitarian element of it
              is quite striking. The very fact that the concept "anti-American" can
              exist -- forget the way it's used -- exhibits a totalitarian streak
              that's pretty dramatic. That concept, anti-Americanism -- the only real
              counterpart to it in the modern world is anti-Sovietism. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">In the Soviet
              Union, the worst crime was to be anti-Soviet. That's the hallmark of a
              totalitarian society, to have concepts like anti-Sovietism or
              anti-Americanism. Here it's considered quite natural. Books on
              anti-Americanism, by people who are basically Stalinist clones, are
              highly respected. That's true of Anglo-American societies, which are
              strikingly the more democratic societies. I think there's a correlation
              there...As freedom grows, the need to coerce and control opinion also
              grows if you want to prevent the great beast from doing something with
              its freedom....<br> <br> ... Sam Bowles and Herb Gintis, two economists, in their work on the
              American educational system some years back... pointed out that the
              educational system is divided into fragments. The part that's directed
              toward working people and the general population is indeed designed to
              impose obedience. But the education for elites can't quite do that. It
              has to allow creativity and independence. Otherwise they won't be able
              to do their job of making money. You find the same thing in the press.
              That's why I read the Wall Street Journal and the Financial Times and
              Business Week. They just have to tell the truth. That's a contradiction
              in the mainstream press, too. Take, say, the New York Times or the
              Washington Post. They have dual functions and they're contradictory.
              One function is to subdue the great beast. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">But another function is to
              let their audience, which is an elite audience, gain a tolerably
              realistic picture of what's going on in the world. Otherwise, they
              won't be able to satisfy their own needs. That's a contradiction that
              runs right through the educational system as well. It's totally
              independent of another factor, namely just professional integrity,
              which a lot of people have: honesty, no matter what the external
              constraints are. That leads to various complexities. If you really look
              at the details of how the newspapers work, you find these
              contradictions and problems playing themselves out in complicated
              ways....<br> <br> This interview was excerpted from Class Warfare, 1995.</span></p>

              <p>Excellent post Ah Chia, I didn't notice this one.  It almost seems as if Chomsky has switched over to Marxism at some parts of the interview.</p>
              <p>Honestly, I've never read "Wealth of Nations" at all.  Everything I knew about is what the textbooks tell me, that Adam Smiths advocates Capitalism, the free market and a laissez faire approach to handling the economy.   Hearing that he actually denounces capitalism, especially from the interpretation of Chomsky is a quite a shock to me. </p>
              <p>I suppose the contents of this interview draws heavy relevance to today's global economy, where we see the rise and fall of private corporations, particularly financial institutions, literally knocking down the economies of states. This shows how much people as individuals have, as countries, have surrendered economic rights over to private corporations.  Essentially, economic sovereignty has been ceded to corporations, particularly TNCs. </p>
              <p>"<span style="color: #333333; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">He said as long as there is private control over the economic system, talk about democracy is a joke."  When we no longer exercise sovereignty over our economics, we no longer exercise any real political sovereignty since economic interests from massive private corporations will attempt to dictate economic policies made by states.  Not acceded to economic dictates, would mean marginalization from the global economy that is dominated by private corporations.  That alone can spell downfall for peripheral or semi-peripheral countries that rely heavily on the global economy for survival.  It is essentially, the domination of a global bourgeoisie over the global proletariate. </span></p>
