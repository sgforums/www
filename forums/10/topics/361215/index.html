              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Is it possible to be a generic Singaporean? <span> </span></span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>For most of the threads in this forum complaining on foreign immigrants namely PRC, there are always negative undertone beneath the superficial behavior issue of language, or jobs issued. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>For most Chinese Singaporean, the newly arrived immigrant will contest that they are more Chinese than the Chinese Singaporean while Chinese Singaporean are trap by being ethnically connected. Similarly to Indians grew up in Singapore. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>One deeper undertone is about -- Fighting Identity. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>LKY coined the word Singaporean as national identity, part of nation building. Identities created for generations. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Although superficially Chinese/Indian appearances are similar, 5000 yrs ago we might be one family. But Really…Da……Does the current Singaporean really have the desire to be put in that One family. Singapore evolved and has its own political history and regional cultures. So just as 5000 yrs ago we might be one family. Our points of references are as further apart as the distance on the Great Wall of China. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Perharps we might want to start to rethink Singaporean to be more generic, Rather than ethnically divide such as. Chinese Singaporean, Indian Singaporean, we should just name ourselves as 2nd generation, 3rd generation Singaporean. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>After all does it really matter if you are a Chinese, Indian, malay….or Just being Singaporean. If you are willing to call yourselves Singaporean You have already cross the identity line. For those who still call yourself as Chinese Singaporean or Indian you might want to get in the line. </span></p>

              <p>Five or six thousand years of civilisation and traditions are not going to change over-night. We may temporary dump such traditions in a moment of anger, desperation or frustration, but we will still return like a prodigal son to the traditions that had nutured us and our forefathers, for in its somewhat rigid values which goes against the grain of our very modern and perhaps undeliberated perceptions of how we should we live, its wisdom gives us strength and courage to face uncertainties of life.</p>
              <p>There is no harm to be a chinese Singaporean, Malay Singaporean, Indian Singaporean or '_x' ethnic group Singaporeans. It is such ethnicities and the ability to live together in peace that makes SINGAPOREANS special, an oddity of the world which should fail but somehow, largely thru the strenous efforts of our forefathers, it worked.</p>
              <p>We retain our traditional roots and beliefs within our own ethnicity, but<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> swear allegience to the greater whole</span> - our society, whom are made up of your family, relatives, different ethnic grouped friends and mine.</p>
              <p>No matter the differences, we stand upon a common ground of traditional core values which included are <span style="text-decoration: underline;">our ingrained need for pragmatic economic order, rational deliberation of policies, and peace with each other above all, regardless we are locals, foriegners/Talents/PRs or new valued citizens.</span>.</p>
              <p>It may not be as rosy as it seems, and conflicts may arise from time to time, economic crisis get us down, but it is our responsibility to ensure such disagreements or disillusionment never be allowed to cross the line of no return or end of hopes. Solutions must and CAN always be found if we put our rational heads together.</p>
              <p>We are still a young republic, with much more maturity to grow before we can truly understand the philosophies of freedom and its responsibilties to each other, but with patience and new subsequent generations, Singapore can be better place for all, including new immigrants.</p>
              <p>Thus generic or not, perhaps in a 100 years from now, a new religion or political order may arise known as the Singaporean Republic, the way Plato's ideal republic had been known for centuries.</p>
              <p>That journey can begin with you and me today, if we put in our efforts together, with patience.</p>

              <p><br>i am not sure 100 yrs from now things will change. If you look at the earlier recorded history. Singapore already a trading post that is known in Greek,....than it is reasonable to assume that Arabs, Indians would have sail thru SG. Back than it was smaller but a melting pot.</p>
              <p>nothing has change until the Brit came, and the catalyst of LKY.  Singaporean have only been binded for 3 generation. We are still doing the same thing since 3rd century "Trading"  but with computers. As you said we are young roots, but It is perharps the right time to consolidate the identity.  </p>
