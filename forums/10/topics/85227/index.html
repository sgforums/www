            <div class='col-md body'>This may not our nation's issue but the things he raises inside are quite universal.Take a look and see what I mean. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><strong>The True Fourth of July 2004<br>By Muhammad Nasser Bey<br>Mnbey@yahoo.com</strong><br><br>Forty years ago this week President Johnson, a southern signed into law<br>the Civil<br>rights Bill of 1964 despite the filibustering of white, southern racists.<br>Within four years the most celebrated civil rights leaders and  social<br>reformers of the<br>20th century, Martin Luther King, Malcom X and Robert Kennedy would be<br>assassinated. Men who had not fire a shot in anger.<br>On this 4th of July night the nation is engaged in a  frenzy of merry making ,<br>celebrations, parties and  thanksgiving over that most blessed gift, Human<br>freedom<br>and dignity.  But this evening as the fireworks fill the skies over our<br>cities and<br>citizens nation wide eat their barbecue not all Americans are celebrating.<br><br>I am an African-American, I live in a major city in the east of the<br>nation, I have<br>never waved a flag or sung the pledge of allegiance willingly even as a<br>child and yet<br>I am native  born to this land, as American as any American!<br><br>I am not celebrating anything. While most Americans are swept away on a carpet<br>of red, white and blues, dazzled by fire work and TV shows, speeches and public<br>pronouncements proclaiming our freedom, My eyes have yet to see the glory that<br>they now rejoice over.<br><br>On Television there are programs showing immigrants talking about how happy<br>they are to be Americans, thatÂ¹s fine, but in America tonight there are<br>those like my<br>self who burn not fire crackers but a light in our windows in the hope<br>that justice will<br>find us.<br><br>In the nation tonight a million are in American jails, many of them the African<br>Americans who could never look up at the statue of liberty like some<br>grateful roman<br>freedman and say thank you for your gift to me, we acknowledge that things have<br>improved but they have not improved enough and in some ways the situation is<br>worse, made worse by the current presidency of George bush and his crime<br>family.<br>Slaves for 200 years in America, disenfranchised for a further 100 from<br>the end of<br>the civil war to 1964 and made to fight the civil rights movement over and over<br>again  with each new generation of conservative, southern racist in<br>Washington and<br>local politics we the despised of this guilty nation can not look on any<br>period of<br>American history and say Â³those where the good old days".<br><br>NO it is not the forth of July for all of us, no matter how much you<br>would ignore<br>my words or drown me out with SuezÂ¹s band music, the burning truth is that<br>America has not lived up to it's creed for all citizens and does not plan to.<br><br>Last Year in Philadelphia the city fathers have opened to the public a new<br>Constitution<br>center. Lost in this dedication is the sad fact that this new showcase of the<br>constitution was built on top of a grave yard of African slaves!<br><br>The irony of this is lost on no one who knows about!<br>Even now the insult is added to by still another injury to the collective<br>dignity of my<br>people and fewer than 1 person in 10,000 in America is even aware of it.<br>It's not the sort of thing you talk about while engaging in a festival of self-<br>congratulations.<br><br>The True Forth of July will not dawn for my people nor for America as a<br>whole until<br>the sins of racism and bigotry is washed away, apology and compensation made to<br>the descendants of American slave holding and Jim crow and until the<br>nation as a<br>whole, not just her government stays their hand from domestic and global<br>racism.<br>Until then there is nothing to celebrate as a nation but the swelling<br>vanity of a short<br>sighted and small minded people.<br><br>America can kill Malcolm X, assassinate Martin Luther King, send cops to murder<br>Fred Hampton in his bed, or shoot Robert F. Kennedy in a  hallway , but you can<br>not kill their message,  nor make us forget their example.  These men<br>never fired<br>a shot in anger but were silenced because they dared to try to make<br>America a place<br>of equality.  Instead America continues to be ruled not by a true rule of<br>law but by a wealthy elite who support George Bush and his cronies in<br>Texas and Saudi Arabia.<br><br>America is becoming  a place were moral bankruptcy was a kind of religion, were<br>corruption at the highest levels IS the order of the day and the ignorant<br>mob is kept is a perpetual state of alarm over r the threat of mostly<br>non-existent terrorist threats.<br>In George Orwells book 1984, the writer speaks of a process where the wars<br>a nation fight are not meant to cease but to go on year in, year out,<br>decade in , decade out for the sole purpose of maintaining the status quo.<br>George Bush call him self a war president, the real term is Â³war-time<br>president, meaning a president during a time of war. No president is in<br>office to wage war but to wage civilization. The point is that  while war<br>is furthered poverty grows, while our court system become macabre finance<br>companies for the states, squeezing the poor and indigent of Moines in the<br>form of  parole fees and court fee, justice go wanting. True Justice is<br>NOT justice at someone elseÂ¹s expense.<br><br>Our nation locks up and locks down millions but the broader justice<br>remains elusive, a justice where those responsible for creating or<br>perpetuating condition in which crime a corruption flourish remain<br>unpunished. An awareness of the Larger Injustices of our nation is what is<br>needed now.<br><br>Still, there will be those who say  America, love or leave it or go even<br>further as many have and say  "go back to Africa" or where ever, but those<br>are the cries of small, frightened men clinging to their fears, Afraid<br>that THEY may have to change in order for America to become America.<br><br>It is a necessary thing to criticize America for her short comings  without<br>loosing faith in her essential potential to go beyond  being a nation of<br>hucksters,<br>hustlers ,snake oil sales men, casual or institutional racists or  crime<br>families<br>committed to making their lives better at someone elseÂ¹s expense.<br><br>This thread of "take what you can-when you can-from whom  you can" runs<br>through our entire history as Americans and explains much of our conduct<br>as a nation<br>, from the wanton holding of slaves in the 18th and 19th centuries, to the<br>support of<br>dictators for oil and strategic metals today.<br><br>2000 years ago there was an idea that was Rome, a place where men  and<br>women fought and died for the idea that people could live together in<br>peace and equality.<br><br>Rome's true self was lost to greed and corruption often masked by displays of<br>ceremony and grandeur to keep the population miss directed.  It is still<br>the same<br>today in Washington were men speak words they have not written to<br>selected crowds in staged media events, they talk a kind of word speak<br>where they use hot button terms to get people fired up to do their bidding<br>on issues which are used merely to disguise their intents to covet  what<br>the world has in the name of democracy.  DonÂ¹t think for a moment that the<br>elite care about you because your white or a veteran, they need you and<br>you are expendable.<br><br>We in America claim to be the  inheritors of that once great republican<br>idea that undergurded the foundations of Rome, the question now is, is<br>that idea worth working toward. I say that it is .<br><br>But the quest for the True forth of July in the True America must begin<br>with mutual<br>respect for one another, for the truth and for our collective right to<br>live a better, more<br>meaningful life, not just a life with more or bigger possessions .<br><br>My original concerns still stand, what I believe is that America is<br>intolerant of the<br>demand for full participation by minority groups in general and  by African<br>Americans in particular. The deliberate removal from the voting roles and<br>subsequent labeling of persons in Florida as felons during the 2000<br>election, many<br>of them African Americans is a prime example of my argument.<br><br>That there be a frank discussion of issues of fundamental, entrenched<br>bigotryÂ¹s so<br>pervasive as to be invisible, so invisible as to be pervasive, be put on<br>the table  and<br>discussed not with rancor and fist shaking but with an epic calm.<br><br>Because we are a nation of schemers, go-getters, rugged individualists and<br>hustlers<br>we are often unable to work together as a nation until there is a crisis<br>and than we<br>usually work against our own interests, we  point fingers at one another ,<br>blame<br>someone else, blame the poor, the Italians, the Germans or the Japanese as<br>we did in<br>the second world war. In the south the white man blamed the black man for his<br>troubles after the civil war, resulting in 100 years of disenfranchisement, the<br>economic and cultural equivalent of placing a 100 pound mill stone around<br>a mans<br>neck and then expecting him to run a foot race uphill. The happy<br>inheritors of this<br>legacy can be found today in the mean spirited, money motivated politics<br>of the ultra-right wing of the republican party. Their hoods replaced with<br>dark , blue suites.<br><br>As for reparations the discussions of reparations cannot begin with<br>questions of<br>money, the issue is not about money and it is an insult to suggest that it<br>is. The<br>question of reparations is a  multi-dimensional pursuit  to become who we<br>can become as a nation. Within those dimensions is the question of<br>admitting of the facts, that these things did happen  and their result is<br>still with us today.<br>Only then can the nation  purge itself of guilt for its crimes, disgorge<br>itself of racism and begin the true healing process, a process which will<br>take many years if not decades to complete.  The true forth of July is<br>then something which we living now should not hope to celebrate but hope<br>that our children shall, for when the day spoke of in this text does dawn<br>it will be the forth of July not just for America but for the world, no<br>matter what date it falls on......<br><br>One Year ago, on the Fourth of July 2003 I published this article on the<br>internet<br>resulting in some debate on my comments about our values as a people, on the<br>meaning of the fourth of July in the United States and itÂ¹s deeper<br>meaning. Every<br>year for the rest of my life this article shall be published anew with<br>additional<br>commentary about the state of race relations and justice in the United<br>States. Until<br>the United States scrubs it self  clean of the stench of  Racism,<br>Oppression and<br>injustice in all of its contrived forms, this discourse shall go on  and<br>on ...and on.<br><br>MUHAMMAD NASSER BEY<br></div>
