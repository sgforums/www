              <p>Let me tell you why you have failed to understand why people complain about the ERP system - because 150,000 / 4,000,000 is approximately 4% of Singapore's population, not 0.05%. So next time, before questioning others' ability to think, ask yourself the same question first.</p>

              <p><strong>By Li Xueying</strong></p>
              <p>Meeting residents to get feedback on PM Lee's National Day Rally speech
              are Marine Parade GRC MPs (from left) Dr Fatimah Lateef, Mr Lim Biow
              Chuan, SM Goh, Dr Ong Seh Hong and Mr Seah Kian Peng. -- ST PHOTO:
              DESMOND WEE <br> <br> THE sight of demonstrators barging into the office grounds of Thai
              Prime Minister Samak Sundaravej, in a bid to oust his government, had a
              telling effect on MP Lim Biow Chuan. <br> <br> The incident on Tuesday led the Marine Parade GRC MP to declare last
              night: 'I'm not in support of allowing protests at Speakers' Corner.' <br> <br> But his fellow GRC MP, Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong, took a different view. <br> <br> If a government is good and fair, he said, it need not fear such
              scenes. So, in turn, it need not worry about opening up the political
              space like allowing demonstrations at the Speakers' Corner in Hong Lim
              Park. <br> <br> 'There will be some demonstrations here and there, but with a fair and
              transparent government, it won't get out of hand,' he said at a
              dialogue with grassroots volunteers in Marine Parade. <br> <br> On the other hand, if a government is incompetent and corrupt, people
              are not likely to confine their demonstrations to the park. <br> <br> Instead - never mind what the laws are - they would march down to Parliament House to change the government. <br> <br> So, said Mr Goh, what is ultimately important is good governance that produces results. <br> <br> 'Once you do that, you can allow people to demonstrate in Hong Lim Park. <br> <br> 'What do demonstrators want? To get public attention to a cause which
              they have, maybe the animal lovers' cause or the green movement.' <br> <br> And while there may be initial public and media interest, this will eventually die down, he added. <br> <br> Mr Goh, with the other four MPs of Marine Parade GRC, were at the first
              public discussion by a senior leader to garner reactions to the
              National Day Rally last Sunday. <br> <br> For more than two hours, they discussed the four main topics that Prime
              Minister Lee Hsien Loong had raised: cultivating a gracious society,
              procreation, the economy and political liberalisation. <br> <br> Asked by an undergraduate if the move towards more political openness
              was done out of 'necessity', Mr Goh replied: 'Necessity, in a way.
              Because to be relevant as a government, you must know the aspirations
              of the people. <br> <br> 'We can control you, oppress you. But we'd lose you - you'll move elsewhere. So we have to move with the times.' <br> <br> Other participants were concerned about rising prices. <br> <br> They were most excited by a point made by Mr G.V. Nathan, 56, from Kaki Bukit. <br> <br> Aiming it squarely at MP Seah Kian Peng, managing director of
              supermarket chain NTUC FairPrice, Mr Nathan said: 'FairPrice sometimes
              is not fair.' <br> <br> When he buys milk powder for his granddaughter from different FairPrice outlets, the prices differ, he said. <br> <br> Mr Seah denied it, prompting a loud chorus of 'no' from the audience. <br> <br> He explained that the chain practises standard pricing, except when its
              various outlets offer their promotional prices at different times. <br> <br> When the topic turned to the parenthood package, the lack of paternity
              leave and the need for better-quality childcare centres took the
              spotlight. <br> <br> Mr Nukoorsha Kadir, 33, lamented the shutdown of the childcare centre at his workplace. <br> <br> Mr Goh suggested that employers team up to provide childcare centres, with the help of government subsidies. <br> <br> And the last issue - how to cultivate a more gracious society - was one which the SM endorsed as most important to him. <br> <br> 'If you have all the wealth and all the babies, but all very ungrateful and ungracious, then this is not the place for me.'</p>

              <p>But fortunately for us citizens, we have PM Lee who recommended
              the ERP system, so that anyone can buy a car, if he can afford it,
              and pay for the use, and such payments do not line anyone's pocket,
              but go to our national treasury for social programmes like improve
              transportation.</p>
              <p>Just think, if 3million+ citizens own cars. our economy will
              collapse overnight. Our limited roads will be choked and grid
              locked. The 99.95% of citizens who take public transport will
              suffer to get from one point to another.</p>
              <p>We all desire cars, but have we thought about how misaligned
              that wish will be and the hurt it will do to our society in
              economic wealth gathering?</p>
              <p>Why should we 99.95% citizens support and be moved by herd
              instinct of the selfish 0.05% who owns cars? Have we lost our
              mind???</p>

              <p>Hmm... whats ur adgenda here?<br><br>How you get 0.05%, one glance u know it is wrong statistic. Pls trying to bluff who har?<br>No. of Private cars in sg=421904<br>No. of residents                    = 3,609,000<br>Rough proportions of population with care= approx 11%<br><br>The above stats is from LTA website on 2007 statistics.<br><br>11% is a 220 times more than ur 0.05%...... haix so who has lost their mind?</p>
              <p>And good vehicles are also not spared ERP, means it also contributes to inflation. its nt 0.05% like u said. The effect is broad.</p>
