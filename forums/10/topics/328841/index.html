              <p>DIRECTOR Jack Neo is quick to capitalise on topical issues, like the
                  current inflationary climate and the increase in Electronic Road
                  Pricing (ERP) rates, in his latest movie, Money No Enough 2.</p>
              <p>However, the Government, while not as fast, is certainly 'I Not Stupid', quipped Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.</p>
              <p>His remark - punning on the film-maker's two hits - was in his
                  Mandarin National Day Rally speech delivered at the University Cultural
                  Centre yesterday evening. It was used to illustrate the fact that the
                  Government has indeed taken steps to 'mitigate the impact of the
                  increase' in prices.</p>
              <p>
              
              </p>
              <div id="imu11">
              <table style="height: 26px;" border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2" width="16" align="right">
              <tbody>
              <tr>
              <td><br></td>
              </tr>
              </tbody>
              </table>
              </div>
              <p>On
                  the ERP topic, which he acknowledged has generated much public debate,
                  he said: 'With more cars on the road, we need to increase ERP to keep
                  traffic flowing. When ERP was increased, we also reduced road tax and
                  improved public transport.</p>
              <p>'Jack Neo did not mention the overall picture nor the steps by the
                  Government to help Singaporeans, so I will explain further in my
                  English speech.'</p>
              <p>His English speech will be telecast at 8pm tonight, while the Malay
                  and Mandarin speeches were shown last night. This was so that
                  Singaporeans could watch the historic women's table- tennis team play
                  at the Beijing Olympics.</p>
              <p>On inflation, PM Lee said: 'We have been monitoring prices since
                  last year. We have taken concrete measures to help Singaporeans to
                  cope.'</p>
              <p>For example, he pointed out: 'The Ministry of Finance has
                  distributed part of the Growth Dividend and GST Offset. A further
                  Growth Dividend package will be given out in October.'</p>
              <p>The Government has also given out $3 billion - 'enough to make big impact'.</p>
              <p>He added that some increases have been held back. There has been 'no
                  increase in Town Council and service and conservancy charges in PAP
                  wards this year, (and) increases in water tariffs have been held off'.</p>
              <p>Still, 'some increases cannot be prevented because energy and other
                  operating costs have increased, (and) workers also need salary
                  increments, but the Government will try its best to keep any increase
                  small'.</p>
              <p>In addition to speaking on such measures to help combat inflation,
                  he also urged young people to see marriage as an important part of life.</p>
              <p>He said that while inflation is an acute concern, Singapore needs to
                  address longer-term challenges, such as the country's low birth rate.</p>
              <p>He advised young people to 'achieve the right balance between career and marriage'.</p>
              <p>'Otherwise, (they) may miss out on chances to find love and
                  happiness, may miss (the) best window to have children and the
                  happiness of family life,' he explained.</p>
              <p>He also spoke about the now-'extinct' mei po, or matchmaker, who enabled singles to meet their partners more effectively.</p>
              <p>He added: 'I hope parents will encourage their children in a
                  sensitivemanner and that children will take this matter seriously.
                  Ultimately, this is a personal matter and the Government can only
                  facilitate.'</p>
              <p>Besides this, PM Lee also touched on the topic of foreign workers.</p>
              <p>He assured Singaporeans that 'the Government's responsibility is to Singaporeans'.</p>
              <p>'Our duty is to improve the lives of Singaporeans. We allow in
                  foreign workers and new immigrants because doing so will benefit
                  Singaporeans.'</p>

              <p>In Jack neo's movie, I was surprised he was bold to include the problems the common folks face.     ERP signages were "disfigured" in his movies, friends of his were talking about the carpark coupons.   One of them stated that the govt employ scholars to come out with the stupid carpark coupon with so many holes on them.   </p>
              <p>It did touch on the number of problems we are currently facing.   Thumbs up for this time.</p>
              <p>No wonder the lee ah loong not very happy with Jack Neo's latest movie.</p>
              <p>Lee ah long never want to evaluate himself but keep on his bloodsucking business.  Evil man, oops, or should I say evil woman??</p>

              <p>I failed to understand why people harp so much about the ERP system. It is only 0.05% ( 150,000) of the population that drives cars. Why turn it into an emotive issue?</p>
              <p>Have Singaporeans lost their ability to critically think and would rather be used by this 0.05% to hate the country?</p>
              <p>If MM Lee had his way, only the richest in Spore will drive cars through high punitive purchase and registration taxes.</p>
              <p>But fortunately for us citizens, we have PM Lee who recommended the ERP system, so that anyone can buy a car, if he can afford it, and pay for the use, and such payments do not line anyone's pocket, but go to our national treasury for social programmes like improve transportation.</p>
              <p>Just think, if 3million+ citizens own cars. our economy will collapse overnight. Our limited roads will be choked and grid locked. The 99.95% of citizens who take public transport will suffer to get from one point to another.</p>
              <p>We all desire cars, but have we thought about how misaligned that wish will be and the hurt it will do to our society in economic wealth gathering?</p>
              <p>Why should we 99.95% citizens support and be moved by herd instinct of the selfish 0.05% who owns cars? Have we lost our mind???</p>
