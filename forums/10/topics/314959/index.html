              <div id="story_body">
              <p>ASUNCION, Paraguay — For 61 years, the
                  Colorado Party's recipe for holding on to power in this impoverished
                  country has never failed.</p>
              <p>First, the world's longest-ruling political party <strong>built an army of
                  loyal supporters with a patronage system that obliterated any
                  distinction between the government and the party.</strong> The Colorados then
                  <strong>created a near-religious mythology that equated defying the party with
                  treason.</strong> If all that didn't work, the <strong>party simply stole elections.</strong></p>
              <p>In
                  the run-up to Paraguay's general elections this Sunday, however, the
                  recipe no longer seems be working. Polls suggest that the Colorados
                  will be ousted from power and that the new president will be former
                  Catholic bishop Fernando Lugo, who was a political nobody two years ago.</p>
              <p>It's
                  an amazing turnaround for a party that's been in power longer than most
                  people in <strong>this nation of 6.8 million can remember.</strong> A Lugo victory also
                  would continue a regional trend that's seen leftist or outsider
                  candidates end decades of rule by establishment elites, which in
                  Paraguay includes the 35-year regime of dictator Alfredo Stroessner.</p>
              <p>While
                  many fear that the Colorado Party may once again cheat its way to
                  victory on Sunday, expectations for change are so high that any
                  revelation of fraud could ignite political chaos, including street
                  violence, said analyst Alfredo Boccia Paz.</p>
              <p>"There have never been
                  distinctions between what's the party and what's the electoral system,"
                  Boccia Paz said. "On election day, it's like you're competing against
                  the Paraguayan state if you're in the opposition. But there's a big
                  fatigue factor now with all of this. <strong>There's a big demand for change."</strong></p>
              <p>The
                  latest poll by the newspaper Ultima Hora found Lugo winning 34.5
                  percent of the vote, with the Colorado candidate, former Education
                  Minister Blanca Ovelar, in third place with 28.5 percent. Paraguay has
                  neither a run-off nor a re-election system, so whoever wins the most
                  votes Sunday will serve one five-year term as president.</p>
              <p>Public
                  discontent with both the Colorados and the state of the country has
                  fueled the party's misfortunes this year, polls show. Conflicts within
                  the party also have crippled its electoral machinery.</p>
              <p>Slightly
                  smaller in area than California, this land-locked country is South
                  America's second poorest, with about a third of its residents living in
                  poverty.</p>
              <p>The country also is known as a haven for fugitive Nazis,
                  smugglers and drug traffickers, and it ranked in the 25th percentile of
                  the world's most corrupt countries in an index compiled last year by
                  the watchdog group Transparency International.</p>
              <p>For poor
                  Paraguayans such as Trifina Escobar, a housewife in the capital of
                  Asuncion, more than 60 years of Colorado rule is to blame, and she said
                  that many of her poor neighbors planned to vote for Lugo this Sunday.</p>
              <p>"We
                  are in bad shape, and we need change," the 59-year-old said. "We have
                  people who don't eat, who are poor, poor, poor, people who live in
                  tents.</p>
              <p><strong>"But Paraguayans are so stupid that if you give them just
                  some sugar during election season, they stop being Paraguayans. They
                  vote against their interests."</strong></p>
              <p>Lugo has captured disillusioned
                  voters by playing up his story as a former bishop who worked for years
                  in the country's poorest state and entered politics only after he was
                  invited to speak at a massive anti-government rally in March 2006.</p>
              <p>The
                  58-year-old declared his candidacy last year after he left the
                  priesthood, and he's led in the polls ever since. He leads a coalition
                  of parties, the Patriotic Alliance for Change that spans the
                  ideological spectrum.</p>
              <p>In a Friday press conference, he said that
                  he'd try to renegotiate unpopular energy treaties with neighboring
                  Brazil and Argentina and redistribute land more equitably to peasant
                  farmers. He said that Paraguay, under his leadership, wouldn't "fall
                  into submission to any other bigger country."</p>
              <p>Seizing on such
                  positions, critics have speculated that Lugo would ally himself with
                  Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez and other leftist governments that
                  have denounced U.S. influence in the region. As a bishop, he was a
                  proponent of the Roman Catholic Church's leftist Liberation Theology
                  wing.</p>
              <p>Lugo rejected such speculation, saying, "We believe in our own project with our own policies."</p>
              <p>Sen.
                  Juan Manuel Marcos, a leader of Lugo's coalition, said that fixing the
                  country's corruption-saddled government would be a top priority for a
                  Lugo administration.</p>
              <p>"The size of Paraguay's economy is tiny
                  compared to what it could be," Marcos said. "Nobody wants to invest
                  here because there's no legal security here."</p>
              <p>Colorado leaders
                  also have promised change even as they defend current President Nicanor
                  Duarte Frutos and decades of one-party rule.</p>
              <p>Sen. Martin Chiola,
                  a Colorado leader, pointed out that the country's economy grew by 6.4
                  percent last year, largely fueled by rising soybean exports, and he
                  predicted more growth.</p>
              <p>"The macroeconomic situation is good, and
                  our house is in order," Chiola said. "We just need more social programs
                  that can bring up people's quality of life."</p>
              <p>Nonetheless, Chiola
                  and other Colorado leaders have fretted about their party's chances on
                  Sunday, and they've shifted the Colorados' political apparatus into
                  high gear.</p>
              <p>In Asuncion, thousands of public employees have hit
                  the streets flying the party's crimson flag to show their support for
                  Colorado candidates. The federal government commands a bloated
                  bureaucracy of some 200,000 people, with the vast majority belonging to
                  the Colorado Party.</p>
              <p>The party also runs hundreds of neighborhood
                  chapters that deliver government aid and even operate college
                  dormitories that are open only to party members.</p>
              <p>While attending
                  a Colorado rally in the central Paraguayan town of Carapegua this week,
                  security guard Carlos Ivarola said the party has always taken care of
                  him and his family. Four years ago, the party even paid for a coffin
                  and a funeral when his mother-in-law died.</p>
              <p>"We will never change our party nor our church," Ivarola said. "It's unthinkable that we could lose."</p>

              <h1>Leftist ex-bishop ends Colorado Party rule in Paraguay</h1>
              <p>ASUNCION (AFP) — Leftist former bishop Fernando Lugo won Paraguay's
                  presidential vote Sunday, beating rival Blanca Ovelar by 39-33 percent
                  and ending her Colorado Party's 61-year rule in government, according
                  to official preliminary results.</p>
              <p>Lino Oviedo, 64, a retired army
                  chief who helped stage a coup that ended the 35-year miltiary
                  dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner, trailed in third place with 21
                  percent, according to the Electoral Tribunal's Quick Preliminary Result
                  Broadcast hotline (TREP).</p>
              <p>Lugo, addressing jubilant supporters at
                  his campaign headquarters, said the election showed that "the little
                  people can also win."</p>
              <p><strong>"You are responsible for the happiness of
                  the majority of the Paraguayan people today,"</strong> he said as supporters
                  chanted his name. <strong>"This is the Paraguay I dream about, with many
                  colors, many faces, the Paraguay of everyone."</strong></p>
              <p>Exit polls earlier
                  gave Lugo, 56, a 43-37 percent lead over Ovelar, 51, of the ruling
                  Colorado Party who was vying to be Paraguay's first woman president.
                  Oviedo had 16 percent, according to ABC/Nanduti radio.</p>
              <p>There is no runoff vote in Paraguay.</p>
              <p>Polling
                  stations in this landlocked South American nation of six million people
                  were open nine hours, in an election that also selected a new congress.</p>
              <p>The
                  left-leaning opposition spearheaded by Lugo, 56, who was suspended from
                  his religious order by the Vatican in late 2006 for his entry into
                  politics, had feared fraud would mar the vote.</p>
              <p>But as 70
                  observers from the Organization of American States monitored ballot
                  stations, electoral court chief Rafael Dendia said voting went smoothly.</p>
              <p>Former
                  Colombian President Alfredo Pastrana, one of the observers, said
                  turnout in the election among the 2.9 million eligible voters was high:
                  "it's going to reach 60, 65 and hopefully even 70 percent."</p>
              <p>Lugo supporters began celebrating their anticipated victory setting off fireworks one and a half hour after polls were closed.</p>
              <p><strong>The
                  Colorado Party has been in power since 1947,</strong> including 35 years of
                  Stroessner rule from 1954 to 1989. Paraguay chose its first
                  democratically-elected president in 1993.</p>
              <p>Outgoing President Nicanor Duarte constitutionally could not seek re-election after serving a five-year term.</p>
              <p>International Transparency, an organization monitoring for voter fraud, reported some cases of corruption.</p>
              <p>"We've
                  seen voting cards being bought and money going around in some polling
                  booths," one of the group's observers, Pilar Callizo, told Channel 4.</p>
              <p>"We also saw Colorado Party teams inside and outside some polling stations creating an atmosphere of intimidation," she added.</p>
              <p>Lugo's opponents have said he is in line with leftwing presidents Hugo Chavez of Venezuela and Evo Morales of Bolivia.</p>
              <p>But
                  Lugo, while championing the rights of the poor, says he is more
                  centrist as he seeks to overhaul a country with a per-capita income of
                  just 1,900 dollars.</p>
              <p>Ovelar, 51, a former education minister and
                  the first woman to run for Paraguay's presidency, had asked voters to
                  show her the same consideration as her male counterparts.</p>
              <p>"If I
                  lose the election, I will accept the result. But I ask for the same
                  openness and the same objectivity as the other candidates," she said
                  last week.</p>
              <p>Oviedo was released from his last stint behind bars
                  last September by a court that found he had been the victim of
                  political persecution, leaving him able to pursue his long-held
                  ambition of becoming head of state.</p>
              <p>While Paraguay's formal economy relies on agriculture, corruption is pervasive.</p>
              <p>Duarte
                  made little headway in stamping out graft, which also sullied his own
                  administration. Paraguay is a prime source of contraband electronics
                  and cigarettes, most smuggled into neighboring Brazil, Argentina and
                  Bolivia.</p>

              <p><strong>Iraq's gift to Latin America</strong></p>
              <p><em>Trying to figure out who won the Iraq war is a challenging parlour
                      game. Nearly every faction, group and nation has lost. The only evident
                      victors are Iran, the Kurds and a handful of giant American
                      corporations.</em></p>
              <p><em>It is slowly becoming clear, however, that there is another winner:
                      Latin America. With the United States so totally consumed by the Iraq
                      conflict, it has no time, energy or political capital to crack down on
                      challenges south of the Rio Grande.</em></p>
              <p><em> Sensing their historic chance, many
                      Latin nations have embarked on experiments that the US would in past
                      eras have instantly stepped in to crush.</em></p>
              <p><em>The independence that many Latin American countries have shown in
                      the last five years borders on outright defiance of US power. </em></p>
              <p><em>Yet to a
                      degree unprecedented in modern history, Washington is allowing them to
                      do as they please...</em></p>

              <p><strong>Latin America: A Race between Disaster and Reform</strong></p>
              <p> <em>As time remorselessly moves forward through the
              second half of the twentieth century, a major problem for the United
              States is the fate of Latin America, that gigantic portion of the
              Western Hemisphere that is south of the Rio Grande.</em></p>
              <p><em> It is not an area
              that can continue to be ignored, because it is neither small nor
              remote, and its problems are both urgent and explosive. Yet, until
              1960, it was ignored.</em></p>
              <p><em> The Latin America that demanded attention in 1960
              was twice the size of the United States (7.5 million square miles
              compared to 3.6 million square miles), with a population about lo
              percent larger (200 million persons compared to our 180 million in
              1960). Brazil, which spoke Portuguese rather than Spanish, had almost
              half the total area with more than a third the total population (75
              million in 1960).</em></p>
              <p><em> In 1960 Brazil reached the end of a decade of
              economic and population expansion during which its economy was growing
              at about 7 percent a year while its population was growing over 2.5
              percent a year, both close to the fastest rates in the world. (The
              population increase of Asia was about 1.8 percent a year, Russia and
              the United States were less, while Europe was only 0.7 percent a year.)
              Brazil's rate of economic growth fell to about 3 percent a year after
              1960, while its population explosion became worse, apparently trying to
              catch up with the Brazilian cost of living, which rose 40 percent in
              1961, 50 percent in 1962, and 70 percent in 1963.</em></p>
              <p><em>Except for its fantastic price inflation, Brazil's
              problems were fairly typical of those faced by all of Latin America.
              These problems might be boiled down to four basic issues:</em></p>
              <p><em> (1) falling
              death rates, combined with continued high birthrates, are producing a
              population explosion unaccompanied by any comparable increase in the
              food supply; </em></p>
              <p><em>(2) the social disorganization resulting from such
              population increase, combined with a flooding of people from rural
              areas into urban slums, is reflected in disruption of family life,
              spreading crime and immorality, totally inadequate education and other
              social services, and growing despair; </em></p>
              <p><em>(3) the ideological patterns of
              Latin America, which were always unconstructive, are being replaced by
              newer, equally unconstructive but explosively violent, doctrines; and </em></p>
              <p><em>(4) there is simultaneously an unnecessary spreading of modern weapons
              and a growing disequilibrium between the control of such arms and the
              disintegrating social structure and the increasing social and political
              pressures just mentioned.</em></p>
              <p><em> Some of the more obvious consequences of these four problems might be mentioned here...</em></p>
