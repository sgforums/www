            <div class='col-md body'>Dubai World to sell US, UK properties and buy in Asia<br><br>SINGAPORE - Dubai World, the investment holding firm of the Dubai government, plans to sell some of its properties in London and New York next year and raise its Asian investments, a top executive said on Tuesday.<br><br>'Currently, we are slightly too heavily weighted in the States and in Europe. We want to balance the portfolio slightly more towards Asia,' Yu Lai Boon, the group's chief investment officer, told Reuters at the sidelines of a briefing in Singapore.<br><br>Dubai World has teamed with Singapore developer City Developments and Israeli property firm Elad Group to invest in a retail and hotel complex in downtown Singapore costing up to $2.5 billion (US$1.7 billion).<br><br>Mr Yu said Asia was 'slightly more robust' in terms of withstanding the effects of the US sub-prime mortgage crisis, particularly a tightening in global credit.<br><br>The group, which has a multi-billion global portfolio that ranges from British port operator P&amp;O to New York luxury retailer Barneys, has about US$20 billion in real estate assets around the world outside of Dubai.<br><br>Dubai World, which invests via subsidiaries Nakheel and Istithmar, also has stakes in Thai developer Raimon Land and US casino firm MGM Mirage. -- REUTERS<br></div>

Office buildings with a mix of retail and hotels will be popular,' said Mr Ku Swee Yong, director of business development and marketing at Savills Singapore.<br><br>Mr Colin Tan, head of research and consultancy at Chesterton International, agreed there was great potential in the area, but said offices would not likely command Grade A rents like in the CBD.<br><br>'Offices here will be ideally suited for small and medium-sized enterprises,' he said. But more road infrastructure such as broader lanes or expressways are needed to relieve congestion, he added.<br><br>Knight Frank's director for research and consultancy Nicholas Mak welcomed the plans to liven the area, as it 'has always been a bit sleepy', but hoped that the area's heritage and shophouses would be conserved.<br><br>Mr Mak said developers will be interested, although a 'balance of the old and new' was important in retaining the character of the district.<br><br>jcheam@sph.com.sg<br><br>Copyright, 2007, Singapore Press Holdings Limited</div>

I thought to myself that, someday, I would work with him as he has great in-depth knowledge and expertise, which complement CDL's green philosophy,' said Mr Kwek.<br><br>That dream was realised yesterday when CDL and two partners - Dubai World's Istithmar and United States-based Elad Group - signed a contract to build the landmark South Beach project.<br><br>The 3.5ha site with a gross floor area of 146,827 sq m sits on an entire block bounded by Nicoll Highway and Beach, Bras Basah and Middle roads.<br><br>Designed by Lord Foster's architectural firm, Foster &amp; Partners, South Beach won over the authorities with a design that incorporated comprehensive, cutting-edge green features without compromising on aesthetics.<br><br>While CDL's $1.69 billion bid was not the highest, the group clinched the deal based on 'an impressive use of green technologies' and striking designs, said Minister of State for National Development Grace Fu yesterday.<br><br>South Beach will be made up of two towers, 45 and 42 storeys high, with slanting facades that will allow them to maximise ventilation and to channel air flow to ground-level spaces. A huge, wave-shaped 'environmental filter' canopy will cover the open areas that integrate the towers with the low-rise conserved buildings.<br><br>CDL, which already has several Green Mark awards under its belt, will be gunning for the highest accolade - the platinum Green Mark - with this project, said Mr Kwek.<br><br>The Green Mark scheme, launched in 2005, rates buildings for their environmental impact and performance.<br><br>South Beach will cost more than $2.5 billion to build, including the land price, and will be completed in 2012.<br><br>Construction will begin next year.<br><br>Copyright Â© 2007 Singapore Press Holdings.
