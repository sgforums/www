            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>I write with great indignation about the current state of affairs in this country. It remains to be seen how long this country can maintain all itÂ’s achievements over the last 30 years. SM Lee has worked hard with his team to achieve for Singapore what some people can only dream of over a few lifetimes. Slowly and unfortunately all these will soon be wiped out.<br><br>The Singapore social structure has become very unstable. It has lost itÂ’s compassion for each other. The common peopleÂ’s grumbling have grown louder and louder by the day but unfortunately the government and itÂ’s representatives are not listening. But that is not all, they have even grown harsher in treating those that is in financial hardships and unemployed.<br><br>Case 1: My own brother has been sued by the Pasir-Ris Punggol Town Council (TC) for not paying his conservancy charges. He has been battling 9 creditors over the last 3 years and finally succumbed to bankruptcy earlier this year. During the last 3 years the banks will garnish his pay, have writ of seizures or threaten him until he brings home very little money for his own family expenses. Now the TC wants all his outstanding charges back. He owes about $2K and based on his wifeÂ’s recommendation, proposed a 4 installment payment of $500 each but the TC rejected it and wants everything back one shot!!!! Of course there is no way he can pay that kind of money and the TC sent him to the night court. I was with him tonite and guess what, there were about 500 (estimated) people there waiting to be sentenced. Oh my, what has gone wrong??<br><br>It was quite interesting to read that the Pasir-Ris Punggol Town Council (TC) has released a press statement calling those people who donÂ’t pay their S&amp;C charges Â“chau kuanÂ”. A few days later an article came out about taxi passengers running away and not paying. I would call these type of taxi passengers Â“chau kuanÂ” as they know they cannot afford the taxi fare but still they took the cab but run away. Would not paying for something like the S&amp;C charges which are forced upon us whether you can afford it or not be Â“chau kuanÂ”? Think about it<br><br>Case 2: SP services has now adopted a policy of terminating your electricity supply if you are behind in your monthly bills by 2 or 3 months. Call them about it and they become even fiercer over the phone. They are a monopoly. They seem to have a motto Â“If you are not happy with our services, donÂ’t use electricity for the rest of your livesÂ”.<br><br>Remember when they were implementing the millions of dollars SAP system and the system failed resulting in wrong bills being sent? In those days, they just kept quiet when you donÂ’t pay your bills. They just wanted their image to be intact. When everything is completed, starting in mid 2002; they just went out of their way to get all their money back and terminating electricity to households who canÂ’t pay up. You must have read so often in the papers about poor families without electricity. It is not going to end here, these people have their frustrations and they keep bottling it up day after day after day.<br>Case 3: A lot of Singaporeans find that by donating to the NKF during their live shows, they have helped people and they have compassion for others. How wrong they are. Having compassion is to be involved. It has to come from your heart through meaningful actions. You have to listen and be benevolent to those around you, not like those working in the government and govt-linked companies. Great empires like the Romans have even fallen, what gives for a tiny red dot island.<br><br>I am neither mad nor harboring grievances for writing this piece. I am merely trying to open your eyes to a dimension in Singapore that might dangerously one day bring itÂ’s downfallÂ…Â…Â…Â…Â…Â…Â…Â…Â…Â…Â…Â…Â…Â…..<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Is it not they whom you attributed the national achievements also responsible in part for the state this society sunk into? Be it negative repercussions unforseen bore in commercial success or intended 'crowd control' maneuvers, all is built on the back of its people with no sign to ease.<br><br>It's reverie to hope for quick, even palpable changes in authorities &amp; society unless unique events (usually pricey) draws everyone to a common vision. But if each common man rememebers and desires a better future for their coming generation, and make an individual effort towards it, the collective force may just be sufficient to steer us out of what looks like a despairing journey.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Olliechong<br><br>The grand plan of things concocted more than 30 years ago was this -<br><br>Entice investors to set up factories in Singapore, provide jobs.<br><br>Set up a free-fund-for-Government,  call it CPF.<br><br>More jobs  means more money for CPF.<br><br>This is what our Government meant when they kept telling us WE HAVE THE RESOURCES - endless resources!  It used to be so  long as  Singaporeans are employed CPF  will grow.    It did grow - too much and too fast.  Now it doesnt matter if Singaporeans are employed or not because FT also contribute CPF moneys.<br><br>CPF fund is now TOO BIG to leave it alone.  So Government invests and spends it - before  CPF becomes a big economic headache.<br><br>Our crop of leaders are neither exceptionally brilliant people nor great scientists like Koreans, Japanese, Hongkies or even Chinamen  - who invent and sell their inventions.  Anyone can do what Singapore ministers have done -<br>use the enormous CPF to invest overseas, buy companies overseas.... and make more money.  It;s so easy, because of this free flow of money - OUR CPF MONEY!<br><br>Are our often out-of-touch ministers  grateful that Singaporans are providing a constant free flow of money to them - to invest and gamble in overseas purchases<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"> I DONT THINK SO <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" title="Exclamation"><br><br>Just look around you, we  owe HDB huge sums,  PUB rates are questionably high, education is not cheap, looking after children is expensive, hospital fees are OUTRAGEOUS, 100,000 unemployeds... ..the list goes on...<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" title="Exclamation"><br><br></div>

How then will it survive? the abounding compassion will then be in vain...<br>Sadly, money is essential in todayÂ’s life and no one can survive with the existence of compassion but without money.<br>Can a poor man, full of compassion, feed mouths?<br>It is absolutely impossible.<br>IÂ’m not suggesting that we revolve our lives around monetary gains, and dissolve what little compassion we have. IÂ’m merely stating that though compassion is needed in todayÂ’s society, money is more practical. And to survive, we have to be practical.
