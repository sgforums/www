HE SHOULD FUCKING HELL LEARN TO STAND ON HIS FUCKING BALLS AND C O M P L A I N!!!

            <div class='col-md body'>well, how well do you know ur son? parents nowadays, do not really know their children even though they can swear that they know their children.<br><br>i have heard of stories, whereby, NSmen fabricate stories involving NS to explain to their dear parents. so if u really think ur son was really scared and kicked, u should immediately do something, and please, MINDEF is a government body, and it is professinal enuff to handle ur problems and complaints justly, but the problem is more that, the ppl in the army (BMTC) is at fault. furthermore, which must u say a malay sergeant. what r u trying to imply? why can't u just use neutral word like a sergeant omitting the word 'malay'?... it really seem that u think the sergeant was kicking ur son, just becos he is of a diff. race? which generation do u come from? the 1960s? 1970s? now is the new millenium, singaporeans don't see skin colours.<br><br>and yes, i pity ur one and only son. u should get help as soon as possible. i don't understand, how at peace u r with this incident, still can take ur sweet time, using the forum to ask where to complain, i mean, duh! go to MINDEF, take a taxi, and i am sure, if that scar is really as scary as the way u put it, you will just win the case easily...<br><br>anyway, stop being a racist!... no need to use word like a malay barber, a malay man, a malay sergeant, all are the same understand? just use neutral words can? unless u are making a point! which in this case u r, but u dun dare to say it so clearly.<br><br>do u have his pic? if yes, then i think, u could really win this case, as i was involved in an accident in NS myself, and it was due to the incompetency of an officer, and i reported it to my OO (orientatin officer). Singapore is not america, so much conspiracy and cover ups... don't worry... if it really happens, the culprit will get caught. i am with u on this, but certainly not on ur way of differentiating sergeants into diff. racial grps, very disappointing.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Firstly, Heartlander I think you need to re-evaluate the way you think about your son's role in NS. What do you think he's in there for? Girl guide camp is it? NS is not 'super-teen' camp. It's parents like you who spoil their children and send all your bratty little tots to the army expecting the army to treat your little emperors like the way you spoil them, who nurture a whole generation of whiners and kids with an 'entitlement mentality'<br><br>OK so what if he got kicked? I got kicked all the time during BMT, OCS etc. and i doubt that your son was kicked...more like the sergeat prodded your precious kid with his boot when he was sleeping or doing something stupid and your sotong fell over or something.<br>Or more likely, that your son was proning on the ground for firing position and the sergeant prodded him to change his position or something. Whatever it is, there are hardly any more cases of physical abuse in the SAF anymore, and if it is indeed true that the sergeant kicked your little poodle, without justification, then ask him to grow his own dick and report it to the officers or the camp OO.<br>Go and see a doctor and who will objectively assess the wound to see if it is inflicted by a blow.<br><br>As for verbal abuse, don't expect niceties from the people training your poodle. What do you want? Speak BBC english campaign in the army is it? or do you want the army to prefix every command with a 'please'?<br><br>'excuse me recruits, but i was wondering if you'd all be so kind as to come down stairs for night snack now? And could you please hurry up lads, time is of the essence in the army!'<br><br>'recruit tan, i am most displeased with your shoddy behaviour. It is most unbecoming of you to be late.'<br><br>Lastly, wtf did you add the prefix 'malay' before the sergeant? Are you suggesting that malay sergeants have a propensity for violence towards your poodle? or maybe that malay sergeants are incapable of controlling themselves?<br>There is no room for your racist allusions here.<br>Seeing how the situation is, any sergeant would have booted your son's ass anyway.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Excuse me !<br>Before you people are so quick to make judgements, consider the possibility that Heartlander's son could have really been subjected to such abuse and was not bullshitting just for the sake of getting out of NS or something.<br>I know ... because that was what happened to me too. I was repeatedly hit with a rifle butt on the shoulder by my Warrant Officer while I was on course in SAFTI and when I went to report this to the MO, and later on to my CO, they did nothing but to state that the WO2 could not have done such a thing.<br><br>As a result of that a hairline fracture ensured and now I often experience pain in my shoulder whenever I engage in physical activity and my physiotherapy doesn't even help. Sadly, i cannot take part in competitive canoeing anymore because of this.<br><br>Anyway as a precursor to that punishment, all i did was accidentally drop my firing pin on the floor while stripping my MG. They could have just punished me by asking me to run many rounds around the field with rifle overhead or something, why this ?<br><br>So before you accuse Heartlander's son of "keng" or so on, consider how he would feel if his son was really innocent of all these charges you have ignorantly placed on him. Have a heart. We're all fellow Singaporeans and ought to stand behind each other instead of being so quick to judge.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>SAF is an organization that covers up everything, shifting blame else where to protect their arses. You should go and complain to your MP or MINDEF, write a letter to Straits Time forum, etc. No use posting here... Too many SAF supporters here.<br><br>I really pity those who got hurt permanently during their NS. I have 2 friends that torn their ligament and have a slightly fractured knee because of constant jumping down from low ramp. They reported sick again and again to get some rest for their knee to recover but the BMT MO thought they chao keng and gave them Attend A. When he go back to their company, they kanna more strenuous training from their sergeants.<br><br>Until when their torn ligament is proved, then only the medical board gave them PES C. What for? I rather not get injured, be in combat unit, and ORD in one piece...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>actually... from my experience in the SAF (I was a sergeant in an infantry battalion during my NSF days), if an instructor really physically abuse someone, no one will protect him.<br><br>If a complaint is made, the person who is complained against will have his balls shrinked.
