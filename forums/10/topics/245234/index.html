            <div class='col-md body'>Tell u all one short story huh... this story is fictional does not refer to anyone in real life.... any similarities are juz pure coincidences....<br><br>Once a upon a time... there's one ruler in a country... He got 2 sons... One son is released in into the private sector and another into politics... Because of his superior genes... his 2 sons are v smart and competent...<br><br>The son that is into the private sector become the CEO of a telco company... so the Ruler tells his son... "If u does ur job well, money will come find you.... Dun be corrupted... U earn ur own pay check"... So this son managed to expand this telco company into the region... they take over telco companies in aust, india, phillipines etc... they bought some stake into some telco as well.... this local telco reports double digit growth annually.... So this son thought..."I deserved my own pay check... I'm not corrupted ... I made SO much money for the company... Now... I gonna declare for myself multi-million dollar salary, bonus and award himself million of shares in tat company"....<br><br>hmmm.... This son is indeed successful isn't it??<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>so the 2nd son who's in the politics is oso v smart... He become the Prime minister of tat country.... Seeing his brother's success... He can't lose out too... He's the leader of a country... But his pay check is not multi-million dollar... Moreover... no stock bonus for him like his Brother... But He, too, is a v upright man who dun believe in corruption...<br><br>Seeing the large businesses &amp; economy doing well... He decided to tax the people... since he tinks that since he create the environment and the infrastructure for its pple to prosperous in business... He should be get a share too... So he proposed a tax raise and his pay raise ...He thought ..." I deserved my pay check too~!! I ain't corrupted... I dun accept bribes... Since the CEO of major companies are paying themselves so much... And I played a part~!! I deserved my pay check too~!!"<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>On manufacturing type business owner, what they look for is cheap labour, cheap rental of factory space. But the singaporean labour salary is too high already, with that kind of labour cost, they cant compete with other poorer countries. Imagine you manufacture garments and export to US for USD$5 per piece in singapore, and i manfacture the same garments, export to same customer for same price of USD$5, but i am manufacturing it in cambodia/china/sri lanka etc. Guess who can earn more money???The US customer dont care where you manufacture it, what is your cost, as long it's same quality same price, it's ok for them.<br>So, based on the view of a factory towkay in singapore, your salary is too high already. That's why they hire malaysian, PRC chinese to work in their factories.<br><br>For a consturctions company towkay, it's the same, go to a big construction site, only those management level or admin staff with very clean clothes are local. Those who are sweating, with very dirty clothes, thay are all Thai/PRC chinese/bangladesh. On their point of view, singaporean labour are too costly to use.<br><br>On service line, like Mac which u mentioned, i guess they somehow need to stick to using local. Becuase as a service line staff, you should be able to communicate very well, hiring a local chinese, they can speak mandarin,english and some dialets(No racism to local malay/tamil, they are fine too, they have no problem communicating with locals, but chinese is highest population here, so most customers should be chinese, so knowing Hokkien/Cantoese/Teochew might be better), which a better choice than hiring some foreign worker who cant even speak proper english. (hiring ang mo who speak perfect english in not wise also, bcos they are expensive, and they can speak local languanges.)<br>But still ,they want the chapest choice out of local, like elderly and teens.<br><br>On the view of the workers(be it labour/service line/clerk), i understand it's a real pain when u see govt keep increasing price of things like public transport, price of housing keep increasing too, but your salary is not incresing as fast as the cost of your living. But the salaries are decided by the company owners based on some market values. It's a supply and demand thing, when they offer a salary and there's alot of supply(those who willing to work), they have the upper hand, they dont have to pay you so much. When the demand is high, when you post job ads and hardly anyone come to interview, they have to increase the salary to attract more people.<br><br>On the government point of view, it's hard to say, and i have no right to represent them.<br>Who do they care most?investor?local rich business man?High salary tax payer?low salary tax payer?Their own profit to feed the fat minister even fatter?<br>Which way they want to go to boost economy? more industrial buiness? more service line business? tourism? The casino thing? property market?<br>Do they want to make the poor richer to make the gap smaller?or they want to squeeze more out of the rich? Or they dont care about the gap at all??<br><br>Talking about inflation, isn't the goverment playing one important role on it?Many of our daily cost can be controlled by goverment. HDB flat price, public transport price, your PUB bill, even your phone/internet bill.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>On your fictional story, i guess the happiset is neither the brother which is the telco CEO nor the borther who is the minister. It's the god damn daddy. No matter how the minister squeeze the hell out of his brother, it's "left pocket to right pocket" case, it's still his pocket.<br><br>But, as the minister squeeze the hell out of his brother's company, those policy will also squeeze the hell out of other companies too(not owned by his son), so now it's other's money filling up his pocket.<br><br>hmm...... wait, the money that's filling up the pockets, where do they come from initially? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
