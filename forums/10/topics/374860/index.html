              <p><strong>The Age, 9 Sep 2009, Eric Ellis</strong><br> <br> <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>World turns disapproving eyes on Singapore banquet</strong></span><br> <br> WERE every high school as wonderful as Singapore's United World College.<br> <br> Each morning, a convoy of chauffeur-driven Mercedes, BMWs and SUVs
              sweep up to the expansive campus, dropping well-shod students dangling
              all manner of modish teenage bling; mobile phones, computers, designer
              this and that. The sumptuous grounds are more suggestive of a five-star
              resort than a secondary school.<br> <br> With yearly fees of more than $40,000, UWC is where Singapore's well-heeled foreign residents send their kids. <span style="color: red;"><strong>That's
              the common or garden expat professionals on an Asian posting, as well
              as Tay Za, regarded by Washington as bagman to the Burmese junta. Tay
              Za's teenage boy Htet is dropped off in a chauffeur-driven Lamborghini,
              as his father evades US sanctions.</strong></span><br> <br> Some teachers are disquieted by all this but <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Singapore seems to subscribe to a ''don't ask, don't tell'' policy on where money comes from.</strong></span> In recent years, Singapore has actively sought to become Asia's
              Switzerland, the discreet depository of the super-rich, however they
              made their money. That led to a boom in private banking, with an
              attendant boom in property and high-end services for this monied elite,
              including education.<br> <br> While the vast majority of Singaporean depositors are squeaky-clean, as anywhere, some are not.<span style="font-size: medium;"><strong> The Burmese junta banks in Singapore and the money of some of North
              Korea and Zimbabwe's potentates is widely thought to be salted away
              here.</strong></span><br> <br> The big money comes from Indonesia, whose tycoons have regarded
              Singapore as a refuge from volatility at home. The two countries have
              no extradition treaty and there's good reason for it to remain that way.<span style="color: red;"><strong> Merrill Lynch estimated a third of Singapore's 60,000-odd millionaires
              were Indonesian, making the city-state Jakarta's affluent northern
              suburb. </strong></span>Re-elected on an anti-corruption ticket, Jakarta's
              Yudhoyono Government suspects a good few of its countrymen in Singapore
              have salted away tarnished money there.<br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>But while markets were roaring, no one really much cared.</strong></span><br> <br> Singapore's private client relationship managers (RMs) were pushing
              high-margin exotic derivative products created by their investment
              banks, and the rich got richer. The atmosphere was perhaps best
              exemplified by the appearance of UBS executive director James Tulley,
              known to friends as ''Tulley Tubby'', in Singapore Tatler magazine
              boasting about his 30 pairs of spectacles and 100 pairs of shoes.<br> <br> But the financial crisis changed everything. It devastated values,
              banks and depositors, and Western governments sought to crack down on
              tax havens and regimes reluctant to adequately disclose their financial
              affairs. Earlier this year, Singapore was threatened with a blacklist
              of financial shelters compiled by the G20. Germany's Angela Merkel,
              Britain's Gordon Brown, France's Nicolas Sarkozy and the new US
              president Barack Obama linked arms against international tax havens and
              secretive financial regimes, seeking scalps to make up for their own
              economies' failings.<br> <br> Now the Europeans are pressing Singapore and other financial centres to
              open their books. Just 3 per cent to 5 per cent of Singapore's private
              banking clients are regarded as European, most of them thought to be
              Russian. That's incidental in the private banking scene in Singapore
              but the implications beyond Europe are acute.<br> <br> What Singapore doesn't want is the same rules as the EU and the US. It
              also doesn't want to be singled out among Asian financial centres if
              Hong Kong doesn't face the same rules. But Singapore cherishes a
              self-styled reputation as an exemplary international corporate citizen,
              operating by globally accepted norms.<br> <br> Complicating the picture is a spate of court actions in Singapore's
              courts where the big Asian tycoons Singapore loves are at war with big
              international banks it also covets over who's responsible for the
              massive GFC trading losses in their private accounts. <span style="color: red;"><strong>Several
              cases involve ''accumulators'' which involve banks signing clients to a
              long program of buying stocks, often bank stocks, at fixed discounted
              prices. </strong></span>That was great when Citibank was trading at $90 and
              the client bought shares at $45, but not much fun when Citi shares
              slumped to under $10, but the contracted accumulators kept, well,
              accumulating at $45. Banks claim caveat emptor, but no wonder clients
              dub the contracts ''I kill you later''.<br> <br> Private banking consultant Roman Scott of Calamander Capital says
              private banks are in denial over the extent of the problem. And, he
              says, Singapore faces a tricky dilemma. He likens Indonesia and
              countries like it to diners in a restaurant where various regulators,
              unfamiliar with the menu, look to the smaller European table and chorus
              ''We'll have what they're having.'' And, as it struggles to again
              economically re-invent itself, Singapore is hoping everyone somehow is
              well fed. <br> <br> -----------------<br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>Latest updates @ <a href="http://singaporenewsalternative.blogspot.com/">Singaporenewsalternative.blogspot.com</a>:<br> <br> 1.
