            <div class='col-md body'>EVEN though the Singapore Government has been advocating a five-day work week,<br>especially in the Civil Service, it remains to be seen whether it is being implemented on<br>the ground.<br>My wife, a primary-school teacher, has to go back for school-related matters on many<br>Saturdays. I understand that most teachers need to go back to school on Saturday for<br>major school activities (about four Saturdays a year). Besides these, my wife has five or<br>six Saturdays burnt because of Co-Curricular Activities (CCA). So, in total, there are<br>nine or 10 Saturdays burnt in a year.<br>It is even more infuriating when she can't claim time off and travel expenses on the<br>Saturdays she spent on CCA.<br>In addition to her CCA involvement on Saturdays, she has CCA on a normal weekday<br>afternoon. So, at times, she may be involved in CCA twice a week. Thus she ends up<br>having to prepare for the coming week's lessons on Sunday.<br><br>I do not understand how we are going to contribute to the nation's birth rate if she is so<br>stressed out.   &lt;========<br><br>People often comment that she spends more time with her pupils than with our children.<br>It makes me wonder why the five-day work week was implemented in the first place.</div>
