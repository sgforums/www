              <p><strong> Containment bid by the neoconservatives fails</strong></p>
              <p><span>By Wang Yusheng </span></p>
              <p><span>    BEIJING, March 26 -- The long-time
              schemes by some countries to "contain China" have failed because
              reality has proved they were only fantasies. </span></p>
              <p><span>    Nearly two decades after the end of
              the Cold War, the mindset of that era still lingers on in some
              countries. The rightwing politicians and activists have been seeking an
              "Asian version of NATO" to deal with China, but their efforts have
              yielded little results. </span></p>
              <p><span>    To curb China's rapid development in recent years, those people have gambled by hedging their bets on both sides. </span></p>
              <p><span>    In 2006, the US neoconservative
              idealists proposed building a democratic alliance through the reform of
              existing international institutions and the creation of new ones, and
              their main target apparently being China. </span></p>
              <p><span>    Such a proposal received response
              in Japan where some people wanted to design an "Arc of Freedom and
              Prosperity". US-Japan-Australia security talks got underway while the
              US also persuaded India to join them. </span></p>
              <p><span>    However, such efforts were doomed to fail. </span></p>
              <p><span>    First, these plans were not in the
              people's interests nor in accord with their national interests. Asian
              people had been through extreme suffering during two world wars,
              including two atomic bombings. </span></p>
              <p><span>    <br>The end of the Cold War sparked
              hopes of peace, cooperation and development, in opposition to the plots
              of neoconservatives and right-wing politicians. The leaders of Asian
              countries had to think about their own national interests, and those of
              their people. </span></p>
              <p><span>    Second, such alliances were born unhealthy while some were stillborn. </span></p>
              <p><span>    Former Australian Prime Minister John
              Howard was not an enthusiast of the so-called four-nation-alliance.
              Emphasizing that a rising China was both good for Australia and the
              world. Howard reiterated that Australia had no intention to contain
              China. </span></p>
              <p><span>    Kevin Rudd, the current Australian
              prime minister who speaks fluent Mandarin, has made it clear he will
              enhance friendship between Australia and China. The Australian Foreign
              Ministry also said last year's four-nation strategic talks led to
              concern in China, indicating Australia might have second thoughts about
              the alliance. </span></p>
              <p><span>    Despite Japan being a loyal friend
              of the US, the country's new Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda said Japan
              will develop relations with the US and other Asian countries at the
              same time, indicating he might abandon the slogan of "Arc of Freedom
              and Prosperity". </span></p>
              <p><span>    South Korea, not in favor of Cold War rhetoric, is another US ally, but wants to play a balancing role. </span></p>
              <p><span>    The new South Korean President Lee
              Myung-bak may improve bilateral relations with the US, but it is
              doubtful he will join an alliance to contain China. </span></p>
              <p><span>    Third, while the "old friends" have
              become loosely connected in terms of containment of China, "new
              partners" will be harder to lure, not to mention India and ASEAN (The
              Association of South East Asian Nations). </span></p>
              <p><span>    India and China are busying
              building on their new strategic partnership of peace and prosperity",
              while ASEAN is boosting trade with China. All of them are China's
              friendly neighbors who support and help each other. </span></p>
              <p><span>    Although they will need cooperation
              and support from the US and Japan, they are not likely to work as
              partners in an "anti-China" alliance. </span></p>
              <p><span>    While the Western media has
              exaggerated India's participating in some political conferences and
              military exercises with the US and Japan, and referred to it as
              "containment of China", India has kept good relations with China and
              Russia. </span></p>
              <p><span>    China sticks to the road of
              peaceful development and the Good Neighbor and Friendship Policy. China
              not only says so, but also shows it by concrete actions </span></p>
              <p><span>    Furthermore, China's peaceful
              rising has brought unprecedented opportunities to its Asian neighbors
              and the world, and hence forged common interests. </span></p>
              <p><span>    It is time those value-oriented
              idealists leave their dreams behind and create a harmonious society in
              the Asia-Pacific region. </span></p>
