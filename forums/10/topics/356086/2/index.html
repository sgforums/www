              <p><br>Mayb u do not mind, the university has put advertisement in Indonesia asking Indonesian student to come to study. Do not forget other countries are also seeking</p>
              <p>to get our local talent. If I am not wrong, some of the faculty member are from other countries and also the lecturers. Back to the stabbing case, there should b a press conference by the university which should include the investigating officer of the case, together with the head of the university to clarify the matter. If this delayed further, there will b more speculation.</p>
