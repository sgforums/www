              <p><span>The leader of the Verification Team, Iwan Piliang, announced this at</span> <span>the press conference held at Restoran Munik, Jl Matraman Raya, Jakarta</span> <span>Timur, on Monday (13 April 2009). David’s father, Hartono Widjaja, and</span> <span>his wife was present, along with his brother William Hartono.</span></p>
              <p><span>According to Iwan, the team has done a reconstruction of the events</span> <span>surrounding David’s death. From the reconstruction, the team is</span> <span>confident that David’s death was not due to suicide as alleged by NTU.</span> <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span><span>The autopsy that David’s family received indicated 36 gaping wounds,</span></span><span> <span>of which 14 were from stab wounds.</span></span></span></span></p>
              <p><span>“In general, the injury is at the hands. The rest were bruises,</span> <span>including the neck region and internally,” Iwan explained.</span></p>
              <p><span>The team, along with the family and correspondent, have also visited</span> <span>Singapore. The team had wanted to meet with the NTU officials, but</span> <span>were not entertained. A similar request to meet Professor Chan Kap</span><br> <span>Luck, who was reported to have been wounded by David before he died,</span> <span>was also declined.</span></p>
              <p><span>Meanwhile, the leader of Komnas Anak, Seto Mulyadi, and Bung Tomo of</span> <span>Bambang Sulistomo also voiced their support for a thorough</span> <span>investigation to provide satisfactory closure to this case. According</span><br> <span>to Seto Mulyadi, David was an Indonesian asset whose efforts in</span> <span>winning the Mathematics Olympiad should be appreciated by the</span> <span>government.</span></p>
              <p><span>“The Education and National Ministers should have given the family</span> <span>legal help, including financing for a lawyer. But nobody has bothered</span> <span>so far; POLRI (Indonesian Police), Depdiknas (Education Ministry) and</span><br> <span>President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono should be actively involved and</span> <span>aiding the family, since it concerns the sovereignty of the country,”</span> <span>he added.<br></span></p>

              <p>A maid died in Singapore and the filipino's coroner was again very sure that she suffered abuse.</p>
              <p>Than call in neutral party from US(not the country, just some experts from US) to clarify the finding.</p>
              <p>Turns out that the coroners who claimed the maid was abused did not cover the case properly, leading to national disgrace, and the report was overturned..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Think will do the same thing again bah. But seriously, who will want to kill a random student?</p>

              <p>These allegations are actually getting interesting. I don't foresee SG-IND bilateral relations being strained. I doubt Indonesian authorities will get much involved.</p>
              <p>Poor guy comes to Singapore at age 17 to study. Probably couldn't handle it all. In contrast, all our male citizens start at age 21. While our female undergrads are at least 19 years old when they matriculate.</p>

              <p>I also did not do the investigations, so i can't tell you YES, the stab wounds are not deep enough to kill, hence, there must be someone stabbing him 36 times.</p>
              <p>I also don't have info on possible motives, such as hatred, money, desperation of any possible suspect. so i can't tell you YES, the prof killed him to get his money/secret project.</p>

              <p>but i believed you did the autopsy, since you are very sure that the wounds cannot be self-inflicted.</p>
