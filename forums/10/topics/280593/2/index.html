They said they 'peeped' into the house . Apparently they have SOP's . No owners permission to enter premise until they get authorization to do so. Very by the book.<br><br>I mean depends how u look at it. At least u can sleep soundly in your house knowingly that cops just dont come busting into ur house without warrants and stuff. When they surround a person's house that has possible firearms , they actually surround your house , call the Arms Offenders squad and they ring ur house and ask whether u have a gun or not. If u have , they will go in via SOP if u have a gun.. the hard approach. If not , then u come out for them to arrest you. Or they just surround ur house until they get permission and paperwork done to storm your house or u be a good boy come out and let them arrest you.<br><br></div>
