            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>The taxi driver, who caused the death of a financial advisor along Scotts Road in April 2007, has been sentenced to 12 months' jail.<br><br>68-year-old Lee Yuet Kong had earlier been found guilty of causing the death of 29-year-old Alex Lim by a rash act.<br><br>The court heard that on 9 April, Lee and Lim were involved in a minor accident and both had stopped along Scotts Road in front of Isetan.<br><br>During their heated argument, Lee refused to divulge his details. So Lim stood in front of Lee's cab to stop him from leaving the scene.<br><br>But Lee braked suddenly and then drove into Lim, who was clinging onto the cab's bonnet. Lim was knocked unconscious and went into a coma. He died in hospital a month later.<br><br>Lee could have been jailed for up to two years.<br><br>His lawyer had told the court that Lee is suffering from various medical conditions including nasopharyngeal cancer.<br><br>Lee is also said to have a "history of heart failure" and is "waiting for open-heart surgery"</blockquote>From<br><a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/320518/1/.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/320518/1/.html</a><br><br>Actually, I am pretty surprised at the light punishment given to tis Lee for killing a life. The other party loses a life while he only get a year jail. (probably lesser from all the public holidays and good behavior kinda things) If u abuse maids, u get even heavier sentence than tis. If u get caught for being a gay, u even get 2 years jail compared to his one year jail.<br><br>From wat I see, tis Lee wilfully kill another over trivial matters and should be sentence to murder (sad to say is a death penalty but lets just be fair and say if he has committed murder or not) From the look of the case, the victim has the right to get tis Lee particulars after an accident. And he is not even regretful or repentent. Has justice been done here ?<br><br>My understanding of death by rash act goes like tis. If u drive a car and someone actually spring out of nowhere and u kill him. Or u have a flower pot or window tat fell off and kill someone. U r sentenced to tis act and tat explains the light sentence because u r not wilfully killing him.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Culpable homicide is the sameas manslaughter. manslaughter is the layman term.<br>Anyway, some taxi drivers can have real bad attitude, but what happened is too much. Actually, the tragedy is avoidable... Either by the taxi driver relenting and give particulars to the victim, or the victim just taking down the license plate, which will ultimately lead to the taxi driver anyway...<br>The whole issue is tragic, in that a human life had been lost. The taxi driver was probably charged under this:<br><strong>Causing death by rash or negligent act.<br>[b]304A. Whoever causes the death of any person by doing any rash or negligent act not amounting to culpable homicide, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 2 years, or with fine, or with both.</strong>[/b]<br>Which explains the sentence he is getting.</div>

The other party loses a life while he only get a year jail. (probably lesser from all the public holidays and good behavior kinda things) If u abuse maids, u get even heavier sentence than tis. If u get caught for being a gay, u even get 2 years jail compared to his one year jail.<br><br>From wat I see, tis Lee wilfully kill another over trivial matters and should be sentence to murder (sad to say is a death penalty but lets just be fair and say if he has committed murder or not) From the look of the case, the victim has the right to get tis Lee particulars after an accident. And he is not even regretful or repentent. Has justice been done here ?<br><br>My understanding of death by rash act goes like tis. If u drive a car and someone actually spring out of nowhere and u kill him. Or u have a flower pot or window tat fell off and kill someone. U r sentenced to tis act and tat explains the light sentence because u r not wilfully killing him. </div></blockquote>Taxi driver didn't have the intention to 'kill' that bugger la. I believe he was trying to scare or teach that fella a lesson - similar to your 'death by rash act'.  It's not like he ran that fella over.<br><br>Think about it, if someone jumped onto your bonnet of your speeding car, you'll also jam brake what...<br><br>What that cock taxi driver 'didn't' know is that the momentum can be really great to push the poor sod unto the ground. If he's Commando, at least he'll know 'chin-on-chest-strap' and 'push-turn-roll-over' to protect his numbskull what....<br><br>Now the back of the head is very fragile - a light strike to it can cause loss of consciousness. Heavy blow can be fatal. That's why that joker in another thread was complaining about his teacher hitting his empty vessel with an exercise book. Ego and nut all bruised.<br><br></div>
