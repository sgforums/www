              <p class="date">Wednesday, November 26, 2008</p>
              <p class="date"><a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2008/11/26/MNVN14C8QR.DTL">http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2008/11/26/MNVN14C8QR.DTL</a></p>
              <p class="date">The federal government committed an additional $800 billion to two new
              loan programs on Tuesday, bringing its cumulative commitment to
              financial rescue initiatives to a staggering $8.5 trillion, according
              to Bloomberg News.</p>
              <p>That sum represents almost 60 percent of the nation's estimated gross domestic product.</p>
              <p>Given the unprecedented size and complexity of these programs and
              the fact that many have never been tried before, it's impossible to
              predict how much they will cost taxpayers. The final cost won't be
              known for many years.</p>
              <p>The money has been committed to a wide array of programs, including
              loans and loan guarantees, asset purchases, equity investments in
              financial companies, tax breaks for banks, help for struggling
              homeowners and a currency stabilization fund.</p>
              <p>Most of the money, about $5.5 trillion, comes from the Federal
              Reserve, which as an independent entity does not need congressional
              approval to lend money to banks or, in "unusual and exigent
              circumstances," to other financial institutions.</p>
              <p>To stimulate lending, the Fed said on Tuesday it will purchase up to
              $600 billion in mortgage debt issued or backed by Fannie Mae, Freddie
              Mac and government housing agencies. It also will lend up to $200
              billion to holders of securities backed by consumer and small-business
              loans. All but $20 billion of that $800 billion represents new
              commitments, a Fed spokeswoman said.</p>
              <p>About $1.1 trillion of the $8.5 trillion is coming from the Treasury
              Department, including $700 billion approved by Congress in dramatic
              fashion under the Troubled Asset Relief Program.</p>
              <p>The rest of the commitments are coming from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Federal Housing Administration.</p>
              <p>Only about $3.2 trillion of the $8.5 trillion has been tapped so far, according to Bloomberg. Some of it might never be.</p>
              <p>Relatively little of the money represents direct outlays of cash
              with no strings attached, such as the $168 billion in stimulus checks
              mailed last spring.</p>
              <h3 class="subhead">Where it's going</h3>
              <p>Most of the money is going into loans or loan guarantees, asset
              purchases or stock investments on which the government could see some
              return.</p>
              <p>"If the economy were to miraculously recover, the taxpayer could
              make money. That's not my best guess or even a likely scenario," but
              it's not inconceivable, says Anil Kashyap, a professor at the
              University of Chicago's Booth School of Business.</p>
              <p>The risk/reward ratio for taxpayers varies greatly from program to program.</p>
              <p>For example, the first deal the government made when it bailed out
              insurance giant AIG had little risk and a lot of potential upside for
              taxpayers, Kashyap said. "Then it turned out the situation (at AIG) was
              worse than realized, and the terms were so brutal (to AIG) that we had
              to renegotiate. Now we have given them a lot more credit on more
              generous terms."</p>
              <p>Kashyap says the worst deal for taxpayers could be the Citigroup
              deal announced late Sunday. The government agreed to buy an additional
              $20 billion in preferred stock and absorb up to $249 billion in losses
              on troubled assets owned by Citi.</p>
              <p>Given that Citigroup's entire market value on Friday was $20.5
              billion, "instead of taking that $20 billion in preferred shares we
              could have bought the company," he says.</p>
              <p>It's hard to say how much the overall rescue attempt will add to the
              annual deficit or the national debt because the government accounts for
              each program differently.</p>
              <p>If the Treasury borrows money to finance a program, that money adds
              to the federal debt and must eventually be paid off, with interest,
              says Diane Lim Rogers, chief economist with the Concord Coalition, a
              nonpartisan group that aims to eliminate federal deficits.</p>
              <p>The federal debt held by the public has risen to $6.4 trillion from
              $5.5 trillion at the end of August. (Total debt, including that owed to
              Social Security and other government agencies, stands at more than $10
              trillion.)</p>
              <p>However, a $1 billion increase in the federal debt does not
              necessarily increase the annual budget deficit by $1 billion because it
              is expected to be repaid over time, Rogers said.</p>
              <h3 class="subhead">Annual deficit</h3>
              <p>A deficit arises when the government's expenditures exceed its
              revenues in a particular year. Some estimate that the federal deficit
              will exceed $1 trillion this fiscal year as a result of the economic
              slowdown and efforts to revive it.</p>
              <p>The Fed's activities to shore up the financial system do not show up
              directly on the federal budget, although they can have an impact. The
              Fed lends money from its own balance sheet or by essentially creating
              new money. It has been doing both this year.</p>
              <p>The problem is, "if you print money all the time, the money becomes
              worth less," Rogers says. This usually leads to higher inflation and
              higher interest rates. The value of the dollar also falls because
              foreign investors become less willing to invest in the United States.</p>
              <p>Today, interest rates are relatively low and the dollar has been
              mostly strengthening this year because U.S. Treasury securities "are
              still for the moment a very safe thing to be investing in because the
              financial market is so unstable," Rogers said. "Once we stabilize the
              stock market, people will not be so enamored of clutching onto
              Treasurys."</p>
              <p>At that point, interest rates and inflation will rise. Increased
              borrowing by the Treasury will also put upward pressure on interest
              rates.</p>
              <h3 class="subhead">Deflation a big concern</h3>
              <p>Today, however, the Fed is more worried about deflation than
              inflation and is willing to flood the market with money if necessary to
              prevent an economic collapse.</p>
              <p>Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke "has ordered the helicopters
              to get ready," said Axel Merk, president of Merk Investments. "The
              helicopters are hovering and the first cash is making it through the
              seams. Soon, a door may be opened."</p>
              <p>Rogers says her biggest fear is not hyperinflation and the social
              unrest it could unleash. "I'm more worried about a lot of federal
              dollars being committed and not having much to show for it. My worst
              fear is we are leaving our children with a huge debt burden and not
              much left to pay it back."</p>
