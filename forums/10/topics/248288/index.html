I saw in another thread where a East European country's population is dropping because most of its youth are going elsewhere to look for work. In return, it starts to absorb China chinese to top up its labour force. Singaporeans are moving out, but people are also moving in. There are lots of issues to be solve, but the fact remains that we are unlikely to stop the trend of moving around.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The problem is that there is something seriously wrong with us given we are unable to retain our top talent, and are forced to import.<br><br>This means that while Singapore is a good place to work and make money, it obviously isn't a good place to <strong>live in</strong>... and due to what reasons I'll leave you to speculate... but I wonder where so many of our policies come from... these are the <strong>PUSH</strong> factors that lead us to losing our top local talents.<br><br>Anyway, instead of taking steps to reduce the brain drain, it seems that the current solution is simply to top up whatever is leaving with talents from outside which are attracted to the nation because they are currently not subject to any of the <strong>PUSH</strong> factors that true blue locals have to face.<br><br>But then, this means that the <strong>PUSH</strong> factors are made to work more and more on the local population that is still around, as they have to tank the damage and disadvantages of many of the policies that apply only to the locals, the very policies that drive our local top talents away in the first place.<br><br>But it seems that some are happy with the way things are, as long as the policies that have the dark side of having the <strong>PUSH</strong> factors benefit them, so much so to the point that our measure of importing FTs has been regarded as the solution, and not the stopgap, makeshift solution that it is.<br><br>If we can't retain our top talent, then something is seriously wrong with the way we train, teach and treat them, as well as with the with the concept of Singaporean citizenship as well, which seems to become more and more of no one owes you a living, but you owe the nation everything somehow.<br><br>Is it any surprise that some decide to leave altogether?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Very good question - are we breeding quitters? If there is no Lee Hsien Loong, we would have some other. It is circumstances that make the hero according to a old Chinese Saying - "sze zhi chau ing xiong'.<br><br>Under a policy called depolitization, co-option and machination, we have been totally deprived of potential political leaders.<br><br>Potential leaders were either coerced into submission or be absorbed into the system to serve selfish needs of keeping political power and jobs at the expense of national good.<br><br>The few political talents left were crushed by defamation law suits or exiled into extinction. Thousands of young and capable have migrated jumping at the slightest opportunity to accept overseas posting just to get out of such a oppressive place. No amount of money will buy these groups of real talents who have now left for good. In desperation, government now has to induce young people with lots of monies in order to make them interested to join politics.<br><br>Now we then hear our leaders lamenting a lack of political interests or apathy among the young. Whose fault? With the highest salaries will they be able to retain our few talents ?<br><br>Have our leaders done the right thing in the first place in their governance to keep and retain talents?</div>

You gila or wat?<br><br>If what you say about the current gov. is bad, why do u want to vote in an opposition that is "bad" too? It's like telling ppl the food here is bad, but u still wanna eat it [will u?] and worse, telling ppl to eat it too? I find it disgusting!!<br><br>If u find Sg here sucks, y dun u go migrate and live in another country. Why still b in Sg? Or are u worried that the country that u may want to migrate to will give u bigger problems...like kena targeted by racist groupies, treated like 2nd class citizens [u are non-white Sg i presume?] This racist thingy in white countries will onli get worse as the years go by.<br><br>On the other hand, if you are currently living in white man's land [having migrated there due to your dislike for Sg gov.], you should work your butts off living there in peace with your fellow whities etc, and hope no racist groupies find your yellow backs to bang with. Do not entice or goad us who have made Sg our home, come rain or shine!<br><br>As there are quitters in any country, there are also stayers, who bear it and grind through.<br><br>As for u, my guess is if u are still in Sg, u are one of them "middle of the fence" type...neither here nor there....always complaining....suck whatever good that comes your way........but never contributing back to society.

            <div class='col-md body'>Most Singaporeans, like the government, loves to pay lip service. The first chance they get to, says the lady, will probably never come. One will never earn enough to migrate elsewhere.<br><br>The younger Singaporeans are no longer loyal to Singapore. The reason is very obvious. There is always distinction between the different groups of people. Simply put, it's the elite vs average vs below average.<br><br>There's no way you can make them stay when the distinction is very clear-cut.</div>
