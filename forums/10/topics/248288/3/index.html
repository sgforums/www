I realised something.  Singaporeans like to all talk no action.<br><br>I no longer even bother to engage people who speak down of our government (robertteh, andrewpkyap, atobe as well as the other hundred or so of you) nor  those who sits on the other side of the fence (lionnoisy)<br><br>Simply because of one thing.  I rather go out and help the country in my own way than curse the government for not doing this and that, demand they do this and do that.  Doesnt solve anything.<br><br>Those who quit fine. Those who want to but cannot quit .. also fine.  I will be here til the day i die and i will do my best to help those who i can.<br><br>My stance is clear, go out there and do your part.  Help your fellow man however you can.  Talking on the forums is for sharing of ideas for better good not to encourage the manifestation of ill-will that goes nowhere.<br><br>If the big guy dont want to help you, you can quit, or help yourself. If you are well off and can help yourself, help others.</div></blockquote>*Shrugs* my dad once said, don't donate to charity, becoz the more you donate, the less the govt will do. They always say they cannot be a welfare state, so they provide very little help to the poor. They are banking on Singaporeans like you to provide the bridge to the massive gap that they refuse to bridge, and would rather fill their pockets more instead.<br><br>So is what you are doing right or wrong? I can't judge that, similarly when you should not judge others here who are now more vocal and more willing to step up to voice their opinions. You prefer a Singapore of the past, where everyone don't even dare to voice their opinions?<br><br>You can say I am evil (again its up to you), but I DO NOT donate to any charity anymore (except for SPCA and Kuan Yin Temple at Bugis), becoz<br>(1) I don't know what they will do with the money<br>(2) The govt is not doing what they should be doing (ie taking care of the people)<br>Why should I be helping them to do their job when they are earning millions, and I am only earning a fraction of a peanut?<br><br>That said, I do donate to the poor uncle who is handicapped, and selling tissues, or those street performers, becoz I know that ultimately, my money goes to them, NOT to some silly charity</div>

I know its so easy to blame the powers that be but that is the truth. There are some disadvantages that this country can never overturn but they can sure try to improve other glaring disadvantages that this little red dot has....For all the plus points that this country has, its just superficial....<br><br>I am a quitter and am proud of it. There are many others like me and we simply do what our heart desires....We do not stop others from staying in little red dot so no one should stop us from quitting. It's our choice and we treat it as such, a personal decision.....It's not about loyalty or anything but its simply a freedom of choice.....what earlier threads have said is true, simple reason is globalization but other reasons though not so obvious are reasons every Sillyporean who has stayed in here at least 30+ years will know...its all superficial and if you tear away the veneer, there is lots of things that needs to be addressed....<br><br>So adios and so long</div></blockquote>As a quitter, if one can afford to quit there should be no regret. After all this is what the government is trying to do now - to replace their own local citizens with foreigners whom they could count on to solve problems.<br><br>Many property speculators in town are now telling people to buy properties saying that "Not to worry, Just keep buying properties because the government will keep importing foreigners to replace the local quitters.<br><br>It looks like the government has already passed certain laws to give foreigners pr and citizenship as long as they could buy one of the expensive properties in Sentosa or Marina. Now many top GLC CEOs, their families, civil servants and ministers are now buying expensive town down properties at prices which were never before thought feasible.<br><br>It is now looking like a case of insider trading in property.</div>

And what make you so sure that majority of Singaporeans would prefer overseas system?<br><br></div>
