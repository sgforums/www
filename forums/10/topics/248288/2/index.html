What's the point of selflessly providing humanitarian aid (as noble as the cause may be) to poverty/famine-afflicted North Koreans while nothing is done to significantly encourage/effect change in the political climate of that society when politics is the root of the problem? In essence, such aids could potentially merely serve to exacerbate the humanitarian problems through further neglect brought about by the political elite.<br><br>In essence, you aren't nipping the problem in the bud, but could potentially be fuelling the exacerbation of the problem.</div>

Don't talk so much at the end of the day and then let your vote speak differently from what you talk.<br><br>Got your voice? Then use it as well... it does not have to start with having to make big statements on big issues... but often something as simple as talking the path less travelled and sticking up for what your believe in.<br><br>Take up responsibility- as long as we never take personal responsibility for our actions and path in life, then we really have no say in making a lot of the comments on the current regime, be they valid or not.<br><br>At the end of the day, if those do not insist or work for their democratic rights, eventually those rights will be eroded and taken away.<br><br>Simple as that.<br><br>Of course saying is easy, but doing is far more difficult... but I believe if Singapore were to truly survive in the long term, it cannot be a soceity of sheep who make a lot of noise about their living conditions, but yet take no action to resolve them.<br><br>At the end of the day, the government in place is also a reflection of the people who put it in power. Unfortunately democracy means taking up the mantle of personal responsibility for your nation's outcome upon your shoulders, a responsibility that the average Singaporeans sees as a unneeded idea, but yet sees fit to make noise when that responsibility, having been taken up by stronger powers, now set in motion changes that they do not like.<br><br>But if you ask me if some of the people showing dissenting views here are not doing the wrong thing... I'm not so sure. I would dread the day when there are no dissenting views in any soceity... though some people apparently see this as a dream to achieve and will go out to any lengths to "fix" it.<br><br>I don't think it's enough to be a "stayer", you have to be a "changer" and not just a "sheep" as well.</div>

Consciously or not, these people will bring up the next generation to think not for the country, but for themselves.<br><br>No sense of belonging, no sense of patriotism, no national pride.</div></blockquote>Well.... maybe with concrete effort and some flexiblity we can have the best of both worlds?<br><br>At the end of the day what we want is that SG is still the place people call home.  Every time I come back from an overseas assignment, the feeling is nice.  Call me a greedy pig, but I would love to stay in Aus or Jap or Shanghai.  However I still know which flag to salute to.  That's what I hope we can instill in the new generation.  The one I was talking to in Korea, don't have anything good to say except that SG have a great passport (no visa for almost all country).  I think our county is worth more than just a red book.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>For people holding citizenship of two nations, there's a dilemma.<br>ThereÂ’s a conflict in the country where you were born. You are called up to get ready for war. Which option will you choose? Come back  to serve or remain in the other nation? You probably cannot be contacted.<br>Why? And how ?<br>Before it rains, you see dark clouds. You will quickly take shelter (in the other nation) before it pours and you get soaked.<br>Dual citizenship after one completes his military obligations? ThatÂ’s feasible.<br>I believe those who emigrate leave Singapore for good, bringing their families along.<br>DonÂ’t need dual citizenship.<br><br></div>
