That speaks volumes of who I am, and how I view myself. But I don't need to prove to you anything. I just bothered to slow down and am now analyzing the pains of the average Singaporean, since I broke out of the vicious cycle not long ago. You, on the other hand, go on and on bragging about yourself but only shows how self-centred you are.<br><br>Coquitlam, hey, I am also working hard at building up my base here, and then moving outwards to other markets. And then, when I have earned enough, to come back here to see how I can help fellow countrymen. I don't need to be involved in politics (though I was invited twice by young PAPs), there are many ways to solve the pains of the people here.<br><br>Perhaps you and I might even have the opportunity to cooperate in future, who knows? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>PS: Thanks Boy Stratus for being so nice <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div></blockquote>Hey dude, mind sending a link to your survey on the Singapore top 10% earning spectrum, perferably something that is more recent.</div>

In fact, I advocate to my disciples to always think for themselves first, for it is only when you have fed yourself properly, can you help others. Note that I DO NOT advocate hogging wealth, I am advocating making sure you take care of yourself first before you can have the capacity to help others.<br><br>Maybe one day, even you and other ex-Singaporeans might come back to Singapore, to work together with me in helping our fellow countrymen. Probably by then, your life is good, and you have that energy to help. I don't mean helping the stupid govt, I am talking about our people.<br><br>And I will go and find that book.

We ain't planning for one yet. Unlike your's... which was of a different color. Probably by an australian guy, that's what's making you so mad and angry about Australia.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
