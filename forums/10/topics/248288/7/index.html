            <div class='col-md body'>coming back to the topic, I used to think I am cold towards Singapore, and regard myself as a mercenary. With my capabilities, and knowledge, I know I can go anywhere, and I will go to the place where I can earn the most money.<br><br>Recently, I finished my scholarship with a firm, and after getting disillusioned with how the firm worked, moved on to a foreign MNC, which values me much much more, and treats people better.<br><br>The recent govt fiasco of pay hike made me further disillusioned with the society, and the direction it is heading. IT seems like being happy is equated to money money money. I am very disappointed with the way things are going, coz our society is going to become worse and worse in terms of human values and compassion.<br><br>A big assault on the govt then followed with the fellow forum-lites here, and I was honoured to be involved. Though we could not protest physically, at least all of us here had some effect on the govt (LHL had to donate his pay hike grumpily)<br><br>And it made me realize that even though I was disillusioned with Singapore in general, I do have a passion to want to help the general public.<br><br>So, I am planning that in the next few years, I will move out into the world, and gain as much experience, exposure, and wealth, and when I come back to Singapore, to be able to help lessen the pains caused by the govt. I might even emigrate, but come back later on.<br><br>Basically, I don't care what the govt labels me. That's their propaganda. The most impt, is that, so long as we do what we see as right, and move ahead, then no one has the right to judge us.<br><br>PS: I think LKY's analogy of harddisk and memory smacks of ignorance of IT.</div>

I mean, the rich are getting richer, the poor poorer, the income gap between the rich and the poor are widening with every passing day. That's how it is and will always be, we have to be realistic and accept that it is in our nature to outdo and outperform our fellow men, that it is entrenched in our genetic pre-dispositions, and is part and parcel of our evolutionary cycle. Is it so? Or are we made to think so? Hence, are 'quitters' 'quitting' as part of this cycle that they are falling broadwards as they cannot measure up to the demands of society? Or are they seeking another means to attain survivalbility? </div></blockquote>That is how the world functions only if you have a decent system within a society that at least provides the basic social safety net (or some would call it social security) for the majority to operate. In the absence of such measures to safeguard the interests of the majority (think minimum wage in labour terms or social responsibility on the social side of things), that rich-poor gap is just unnecessarily accentuated further...<br><br></div>

Pragmatism? Such thinking in the long run can only lead to problems. Keep giving ground in what it means to be Singaporeans by discarding the very ideas our nation was built on on the altar of pragmatism and survival and soon one might find that the very term "Singaporean" has come to have a value and meaning of nothing.</div>

Nah of course they will not reveal the whole picture for fear of fueling interest. They say that there are 150,000 overseas poreans working or studying. There are at least twice that number who have already left in the past 27 years starting from 1980.<br><br>End of the day, everyone is going to think for themselves and their children...there will be of course that small minority who will serve but people like me who have to think day to day and figure out how to make a better life for myself and my future family....work is more than I can cope esp when I have to think about it even in my dreams.<br><br>Hey Walesa....what are you plans man...<br><br>YEah you are right soulrade, we should collaborate..<br><br>Just finished a book on where the world in business and competitive terms is heading....good book man<br><br>World is Flat by Thomas L Friedman...</div>
