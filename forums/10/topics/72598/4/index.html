Furthermore, as the saying goes...to scold is to care, to cane is to love...<br>w/o him, we may not enjoy such great political and social peace, and we've witness how this lack of peace has led to the country suffering economically...<br>he's a nice man. salute him.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> </div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> i do hope ur not talking crap, <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> .<br><br>no doubt i salute him for bringing order and peace to SIngapore so that we can reach our standard of today. however, it is natural that old pple eventually become stubborn, well it's a part of aging.<br><br>but i do think he has brought his notion of peace too far.</div>
