            <div class='col-md body'>Before you rattle off a long list of "stuff" The Party did right, I wonder if you have considered it to be some kind of a justification of the obvious things they do wrong?<br><br>Is the PAP the only party to give us stabilty and progess? Is the PAP the only party that can run Singapore correctly?<br><br>I'm afriad not, there is no reason to belief why the Party's way of doing things or the highway, is the best Singaporeans deserve so far, or if it's what they truly want at all, given the fact even competent "opposition" politicans are trampled and suppressed and most of the people don't even get a chance to listen to alternative views or ideas, ways of doing things, much less vote.<br><br>If Singaporeans do not want the Party in power, despite it's long list of so called "sucesses", it has no place being in power. That is, if you consider this nation to be a democracy.<br><br>I've noticed that the Party stays in power not from really because it was chosen, hardly, but more of an effect of it building so many barriers towards a fair and just democratic process that they have effectively locked themselves in power and there's little the people can do about it.<br><br>In fact, the very worst things we can do is use the party's so called "sucesses" in doing stuff to justify NOT thinking about the things they so obviously fleece us for, and not wonder if things can righter. After all, any german in the 1930s can defend the Nazi party's stranglehold on power by screaming that it brought sucess and stability to Germany and made it strong, irregardless of all it's flaws.<br><br>The moment we gaze over the flaws in our party, of which are massive, just because they give us stability. We give them free rein to run riot and start doing whatever they want, since they know that as long as they feed the stomache, they can dull the mind. Pull the wool over the sheep's eye's while the sheer it.<br><br>The question remains. Can any other govt. the The Party run Singapore better, more fairly, and efficently then the so-called "best possible party?"<br><br>Does this nation has the capacity in its people to form its own alternative govt. rather then the self-annointed elite bunch who not micromanage almost every aspect of Singaporean life?<br><br>Can this nation be ruled truly by the will of its people, and not a big brother Party that makes its choices for it?<br><br>I doubt there is a lack of alternative political ability in this nation, just that it has been not-so-quietly opressed and squashed whenever it threatens the status-quo. We are fed stories that giving up our rights as a members of a real democracy and handing them over to a defacto big-brother-for-life are a suitable subsitute for the unknown.<br><br>We have been told not to think for ourselves, for we have been constantly lied to that if we were to do that, we would not make it. Those few who see through that lie are rapidly silenced by offical channels or by people of the likes of you, who have so obviously been blinded by various bogeymen used to justify their presence in power.<br><br>Terrorism and the like are real threats, but as reasons why the Party should be in power, is pretty lame as such. Security is the duty of any competent govt. Changing the Party with a competent party that respects basic democracy will not equate with a loss of security.</div>

No. as far as i'm concerned, the PAP of TODAY did not achieve anything for the people at all! the main problem of the PAP is that it is becoming arrogant and resting on its laurels. as such, it is stagnating the progress of Singapore. to phrase it in another manner, the PAP built a system to provide for SIngapore, but gave teh system so much freedom, that now Singapore provides for the system.<br>hence, for Signapore to prosper, we have to remove teh PAP. omly by doing that, can we ahv epple who will CHANGE the system once and for all!<br><br>the wilful and ambitious pikamaster</div></blockquote>wilful ?yes<br>ambitious? maybe<br>but so? i can be wilful and ambitious too, like thats gonna help in anything, what you're saying now is, to tear down the old broken down house you're living in without another new house builded before that, and with no other house in sight, where are you going to spend the night ?<br>i have no love for the govt, but to pull it down would be crazy, its pretty obvious the SDP isn't big enough to fill PAP's boots.this isn't another of those games where you can do everything yourself</div>
