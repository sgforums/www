            <div class='col-md body'>Greetings Gentlemen,<br><br>From the past postings that you have all made, it revealed a little of your personalities and interests, which I thought I could take advantage of.<br><br>CenturionMBT seems to be good for the PresidentÂ’s portfolio in view of his quiet, disrupting but inquisitive foray, and can help to counter balance a strong PM.<br><br>Viper52 seems to be a level headed person with a good measure of patience, able to hold your position and persuade others to come to your point of view; which is a quality that is needed to encourage open thinking and yet come to a common position.<br><br>Gendaken Â– a psychologist with NSF Commando training, will make a good candidate to oversee the development of a lean and mean military machine.<br><br>Oldbreadstinks will take the life out of any unruly domestic trouble maker, but still if you prefer to take over Culture and Arts, its fine, but you will need to change your nick.<br><br>NathanG5 Â– sorry to think that your ethnicity is Indian, just to keep to the tradition of this portfolio - which had been passed on from Rajaratnam to Jayakumar; but still even if you are not Indian, it is fine if you are articulate enough to handle foreign Â‘affairsÂ’.<br><br>CX Â– The crystal ball must have given me an insight that you are the best candidate to tackle SM and the Chief Justice Â– both of whom will be perfect targets of legal background, for you to vent your feelings with passion. With your background training in history, it should not be too difficult for you to handle this ministry that has its own rich background, and should be intellectually challenging for you to nail those lawyers whom you now reveal that you hate so much.<br><br>cavsg has many times shown his resourcefulness in digging out very interesting information, and will make a perfect candidate to liberalise information and arts.<br><br>Bear for Transport Â– it will take the spirit of a Bear to tackle the multi-facetted traffic and transport management problems in Singapore.<br><br>pikamaster Â– it is fine if you prefer to take the Education portfolio, as I thought your name seems to show an inclination towards being a master builder of some sort.<br><br>panja_V Â– with the kind of spirit that you displayed in your postings, this will be the kind of inspiration needed to handle the crap that exist in Environment.<br><br>nismoS-132 seems to be meticulous and careful in your approach, and not as reckless, and will be in a suitable position to provide leadership in Health.<br><br>shutterbug being such a radical will be wonderful to revamp the staid institutions in Education.<br><br>Tripwire being such a loose cannon will make a wonderful vehicle for the PM to be a trouble shooter.<br><br>There are quite a few other sgForum personalities that are Cabinet material Â– such as BillyBong, FireIce, Stevenson101, lsurence82, sgboy2004, and some more others that have slipped from memory Â– but the portfolios could be extended, as and when determined by the PM.<br><br>To those others whom I have left out, my apologies - but it was good fun with this list.<br><br></div>
