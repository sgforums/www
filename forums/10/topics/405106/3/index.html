              <p>I can relate to you. My boss showed me a whole stack of resumes, if there were 50 resumes, only 7 were singaporeans, majority were myanmar nationals, all holding degrees, double degrees, or masters from the same university of mandalay.</p>
              <p>One day i was filtering my HR's email folder for job applications, and I saw the resumes sent in, all the same story. How I got access to their email accounts? I'm the one who set up the network.</p>

              <p>Please bare in mind unemployment is global it is in Europe in N.A and certainly many asian countries. Most Singaporean just don't realized that.</p>
              <p>job search has also gone global thanks to internet. Professionals are mobile as ever its just a matter of backpack.</p>
              <p>The only positive trend i see is that there is a conscious effort by singaporean employer to look at citizens resume first. </p>
              <p>The downside is that they really pressed down on salary. To have good employers in Singapore is a totally different issued altogether. You have to work on it.</p>
