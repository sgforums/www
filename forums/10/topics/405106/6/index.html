              <p><br>From the 60's onward, Asia was heading for growth. The growth gained momentum after the Vietnam War, then the rise of China. Following Japan, Taiwan, Korea, Hong Kong and Singapore grew to be the dragons. The opportunities were there for everybody, not just Singapore.</p>
              <p>In fact, countries such as Indonesia, Philippines and Malaysia, with resources, land and minerals, should grow faster and stronger, but they didn't capitalize on the opportunity.</p>
              <p>We are gald to have the correct leaders.</p>
              <p>The 2nd gen leaders built on the foundations built by the 1st and brought us to where we are today. The 3rd gen are to bring us forward. It appears that they need the high salaries to come forward to lead. What can we do for the ppl who are likely to be better to come forward?</p>
              <p>those who bitch, mourn, whine, KPKB are not worth talking about.</p>

              <p><br>Seriously Singapore was too lucky, one of e very first few together w/ ROC, Hong Kong, Korea to open up aft Japan. It's something ppl would say we're out of mind.</p>
              <p>Else Jurong would never be called Dr Goh's folly plan.</p>
              <p>Well, if the younger gen (post - 65) e better ones has the selflessness to come out and serve as like our forefathers, it would be as kilat as e past. But I guess it's not going to be easy la partly the system, partly life has changed.</p>

              <p>Heard LHL's National Day's speech? More FT is to come. My co is already 90% FT. Feel like a foreigner myself. Malaysian gangs, China gangs, Indian gangs..etc. Am told that Singaporean workers not welcomed as they are picky and cannot take hardships like the FTs. Singapore is their minefield now.</p>

              <p><br> 1. Oh! You know our ministers very well. So when do you think we
              will have our NEXT ENTHNIC MALAY PRESIDENT? And why Singapore has
              such tough policy against asylum seekers or refugees? --- Since we
              are not anti-foreigners. (I can already imagine your excuses about
              not having enough room to contain them in Singapore and other
              non-related excuses to not embracing foreigners =
              Non-Singaporeans.) <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
              <p>There are many others examples I could remind you of
              anti-foreigners, remember our political issues with Dr. Habibi of
              Indonesia and Dr. Mahathir. Building casinos and affecting
              the businesses in JB, do we also embrace these foreigners in
              good faith?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. If Singaporeans truly accepted these foreigners who have
              changed their citizenship to Singapore citizens as true blue
              Singaporeans, then why is there a need to categorise them as new
              citizens and not Singaporeans. Clearly there is a difference in
              everyone's hearts.</p>
              <p>How many non-Singaporeans friends do you have? How many of
              your friends are not born in Singapore provided you are born in
              Singapore? Do your maths and then come and tell me how you have
              embraced these foreigners and how you are not anti-foreigners.

              <p> </p>
              <p>4, 5. If you don't know what I am talking about and yet you
              still go and guess and assume based on your subjective and negative
              impression of me, I can only say you are dumb and stupid if you
              even try to have a baseless argument and expects me to correct you.
              I don't have time to babysit, educate or even accomodate your
              imaginery dispute.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Unlike you, I don't argue for the sake of arguing. Understand my
              posts before you make any ridiculous replies.</p>
              <p>And it's not that I cannot help you, I just don't see the need
              to do so. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>I thought these are some of the categories of foreigners coming to Singapore.</p>
              <p>1) foreign workers and foreign sex workers that are here temporary for construction work once that is done they go back unless they managed to get a wife or hooked a husband. SE Asian. PRC and S Asian. They will returned again for other contract work.   </p>
              <p>2) foreigners who are here for a period of 5 - 10 years who are here to make money and thinking of returning to home country to built a home.</p>
              <p>3) foreigners who want to get singapore PR and transit to America or other countries using singapore passport. These are 2nd or 3rd tier talent but due to family background they may have large financial capital.</p>
              <p>4) foreigners who are highly mobile global citizen goes to where jobs goes. They will leave once jobs dry up.</p>
              <p>5) <strong>Foreign Talent</strong> with specialized skill such as research scientist in extreme  specialized field high level of research knowledge required etc.</p>
              <p>6) <strong>Foreign Talent</strong> who worked and held senior management position in global companies.</p>
              <p>7) Lifestyle foreigners ....there are those wealthy foreigners who enjoyed the freedom of choices and get to choose where they wanted to live will buy their way for a PR. But they are never faithful or Royalty to Singapore since it is a lifestyle choice.</p>
              <p>8) Foreigners entreprenuer startup.....SME.  </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Let me know if there are other categories and In your opinon which group are affecting jobs and which group are consuming singapore resources and contribute little? Which group will eventually help to spur population......</p>
              <p> Please note i only used Foreign Talent in 5 and 6.</p>

              <p>I think categories 2, 3, and 4 most likely displace jobs from Singaporean.  Although 4 could be subjectives to relevant professional experiences.</p>
              <p>Categories 5,6,7,8 most likely contribute the most to Singapore in terms of knowledge, industries, and consumption.</p>
              <p>Categories 1 contributed to infrastructure and property housing...etc.</p>
              <p>Some foreigners in Cat 4,5,6,7,8....... due to work will eventually settledown in Singapore and have kids. While holding dual citizenship. SG Govt is creating a generation of foreign 2nd generation Singapore born citizen. Or I called it "Domestics Import Citizen"</p>
              <p>The challenge i think is how does the govt incorporate the Singapore experience with the foreign local born citizen in Serving NS experience?</p>
              <p>It is also to note that Singapore govt encourage overseas singaporean not to forget Singapore. That is to say they want overseas Singaporean to be internationalised as part of global citizen eventually swim back to Singapore as their roots lies. The composition make up of Singaporean will eventually not be limited to Chinese, Indian, Malay, Eurasian, but Americas, anglo saxon, Arab. latin..... etc.....</p>

              <p>But they will see their margin erode eventually over time.</p>
              <p>This is a real concern for them, as more and more people from the younger generations get to vote, the balance will start to work against them because the new generation is less likely to be that easy to convince, having grown up post-independence and having seen the emptiness of much of the Singaporean dream.</p>
              <p>It is not enough now to provide a house and job to everyone, and even nowadays these things are not secure. If you do not have the freedom and ability to affect change in that, then you're in real trouble. The younger generation is less likely to passively take things lying down.</p>
