              <p>It is a common complaint nowadays among Singaporeans that they feel like strangers in their own country abroad a bus or MRT train, being overwhelmed by the presence of foreigners.</p>
              <p>In a short letter to the Straits Times Forum yesterday, Mr Loh Ngin Seng described his experience on a bus journey:</p>
              <p><strong>“In a bus I recently took from Rochor to Sembawang at 8pm, I felt like a stranger in my own country, so overwhelmed was I by the numerical superiority of foreigners.”</strong></p>
              <p>Mr Loh’s unpleasant experience is apparently shared by many Singaporeans as well.</p>
              <p>Shannon Yu wrote on TR’s Facebook:</p>
              <p><strong>“Oh it’s not THAT bad. My carriage yesterday looked like 4 natives for every 5 passengers. The crowd, however, was an entirely different matter.”</strong></p>
              <p>Russell Teo added:</p>
              <p><strong>“You try 169 from Woodlands Int to Admiralty West.”</strong></p>
              <p>Elliot Chong mused:</p>
              <p><strong>“Sometimes NEL feels like subway from India.”</strong></p>
              <p>Due to the PAP’s ultra pro-foreigner and liberal immigration policies, foreigners now make up 36 percent of Singapore’s population, up from 14 percent in 1990. Of the remaining 64 percent who are citizens, an increasing number are born overseas.</p>
              <p>The PAP ministers and MPs will be unable to understand the plight of ordinary Singaporeans as most, if not all them drive and hardly use public transport. (except for the purpose of public ‘wayang’ from time to time).</p>
              <p>The next election may be the last opportunity for native Singaporeans to reclaim ownership of Singapore after which they will surely be relegated to being second class minorities in their land of birth, controlled, dominated and squeezed dry by the self-serving PAP and its new pets.</p>

              <p>The ratio here is more like 1 sing is to 5 foreigners (according to construction and heavy industrials ratio), so by allowing 100.000 foreigners in, there should be 20,000 jobs for Singaporeans. Like it or not, let take it this way, foreigners are here so that we can jobs. If you remove them, you will go jobless. And alway bear in mind, most Singaporeans are old uncles and aunties now, very less youngs singaporean, and yet many of these young singaporean died in motor accident, army training, commit suicide, leave singapore or simply lost their identity in pubs and discos.</p>
              <p>So, what do you see in singapore future?</p>

              <p>what is this? me bed with a guy and play samurai...oh my God! ninja at play. Too much anime porn, must be..yak!!!</p>
              <p>Now, let me make it clear...first and foremost, sending foreigners here is not only to help us in our overheating economy, but also to curb our total wage so as to remain competitive, if you look at the west, their paid had risen to a stage where corporations have to think thrice before employing them. We must maintain our wages within a competitive basis so as to attract FDI. And it is because the in the begining of industrialisation, we depended too much on manufacturing that we end up having to relook into our economy after the 1997 recession, the govt then decided to fire at all front, from service to pharmacy to financial etc etc instead of just relying on manufacturing, and even if you want to maintain manufacturing, you need to manufacturing higher quality and technology products, not bata shoes or shampoo ya.</p>
              <p>If you look at today STI and our economy quick upturn with an MTI forecast of 13 to 15% growth, do you think foreigners destroyed or helped us??</p>
