              <div>
              <p>It is a common complaint nowadays among Singaporeans that they feel like strangers in their own country abroad a bus or MRT train, being overwhelmed by the presence of foreigners.</p>
              <p>In a short letter to the Straits Times Forum yesterday, Mr Loh Ngin Seng described his experience on a bus journey:</p>
              <p><strong>“In a bus I recently took from Rochor to Sembawang at 8pm, I felt like a stranger in my own country, so overwhelmed was I by the numerical superiority of foreigners.”</strong></p>
              <p>Mr Loh’s unpleasant experience is apparently shared by many Singaporeans as well.</p>
              <p>Shannon Yu wrote on TR’s Facebook:</p>
              <p><strong>“Oh it’s not THAT bad. My carriage yesterday looked like 4 natives for every 5 passengers. The crowd, however, was an entirely different matter.”</strong></p>
              <p>Russell Teo added:</p>
              <p><strong>“You try 169 from Woodlands Int to Admiralty West.”</strong></p>
              <p>Elliot Chong mused:</p>
              <p><strong>“Sometimes NEL feels like subway from India.”</strong></p>
              <p>Due to the PAP’s ultra pro-foreigner and liberal immigration policies, foreigners now make up 36 percent of Singapore’s population, up from 14 percent in 1990. Of the remaining 64 percent who are citizens, an increasing number are born overseas.</p>
              <p>The PAP ministers and MPs will be unable to understand the plight of ordinary Singaporeans as most, if not all them drive and hardly use public transport. (except for the purpose of public ‘wayang’ from time to time).</p>
              <p>The next election may be the last opportunity for native Singaporeans to reclaim ownership of Singapore after which they will surely be relegated to being second class minorities in their land of birth, controlled, dominated and squeezed dry by the self-serving PAP and its new pets.</p>

              <p><br>Singaporeans are so unfriendly and outdated and anti-social ones ... I always thought Singaporeans are adventurous and keen to meet and befriend people from other countries because they were bred and brought up in an open and multi-cultural environment.</p>
              <p>If Singaporeans were keen to go overseas for holidays and able to pretend to be superbly friendly and warm, why do we not see that same warm and friendly attitude and behaviour from these Singaporeans towards foreigners when they were back home in Singapore?</p>
              <p>Truly it must be our bad culture or ugly tradition to put up a false pretense to be classy and sophisticated when we're meeting new people and foreigners overseas.</p>
              <p>Is this the end-product of westernising our traditional mindset that we have all grown up to become a race of fakers and low-class "drama actress/actors"?</p>
              <p>What is so different about the foreigners compared to Singaporeans anyway? As a Singaporean, I can say that Singaporeans aren't as united amongst ourselves as compared to people from other nations, regardless if they are first-world or third-world citizens. Singaporeans have a very low and poorish mindsets in terms of projecting themselves towards people in the World, and there are heaps and plenty which Singaporeans could learn from these foreigners or other people in the World.</p>
              <p>There are always bad, half-crazy, evil, nasty citizens regardless of which nations they represented. People have a choice to become who they want to become, regardless of being true or false towards themselves.</p>
              <p>Why don't we adopt a more positive approach towards our opinions with regards to the foreigners?</p>
              <p>Instead of saving up money to go overseas and meet them, the Government is encouraging these people to come to visit us. I can see that there is a purpose for the Government to do that, because I think this is an important step for the Government to train and toughen up and expose common and uncommon Singaporeans alike to learn how to handle and deal and communicate and blend with the ugliest exports from nations around the World.</p>
              <p>Why are Singaporeans so weak in their mindset and they only want to mix with the high and influential and classy people from nations around the World? We should learn how to cope with this surprising uncertaincies that the Government have brought upon us. It is a common norm that people from other countries and nations DO NOT HAVE THE ABILITIES to socialise well with people who aren't from their countries and nations. Singaporeans have this golden opportunity to be the FIRST to make that change and to PIONEER this mindset and extend it towards people from other nations.</p>
              <p>I'm sure this is good for Singaporeans who are aspiring to be a Global Entrepreneur!</p>
              <p>Think Positive, Singaporeans! Your life is really how you think and imagined it to be. If you had thought lowly of your life, then surely you would have lived a lowly life. If you had thought well of your life, then surely you would have lived a happy life. If you had complete confidence of your life, then surely your life would be filled with unlimited possibilities.</p>
              <p>It's really how you think that matters and is important in your life, not how other people have perceived it to be and certainly not how other people have defined it to be! <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>Aside to the foreigners bashing. Notice that there many S'pore women all over the angmoh men whom they come across and ignore the Asians. S'pore men will get their foreign brides thru marriage agents.</p>

              <p>From what i observed Government needs to make up its mind about what it wants Singapore to be either a "Nation" or a " neutral District" .</p>
              <p>Govt spend the last 45 years doing nation building. so now we have a few generations of Singapore borned citizens.  With an Identity of being "Singaporean" that associated with the island. As a Nation it carry roles of government of protecting the interest of its citizens.</p>
              <p>As an Administrator of "District" you managed the evolution of the District. There is really no citizens roles nor interest to protect its citizen. Its purpose is the functioning of the District.</p>

              <p>One day i was filtering my HR's email folder for job applications, and I saw the resumes sent in, all the same story. How I got access to their email accounts? I'm the one who set up the network.</p>

It is a common norm that people from other countries and nations DO NOT HAVE THE ABILITIES to socialise well with people who aren't from their countries and nations. Singaporeans have this golden opportunity to be the FIRST to make that change and to PIONEER this mindset and extend it towards people from other nations.</p>
              <p>I'm sure this is good for Singaporeans who are aspiring to be a Global Entrepreneur!</p>
              <p>Think Positive, Singaporeans! Your life is really how you think and imagined it to be. If you had thought lowly of your life, then surely you would have lived a lowly life. If you had thought well of your life, then surely you would have lived a happy life. If you had complete confidence of your life, then surely your life would be filled with unlimited possibilities.</p>
              <p>It's really how you think that matters and is important in your life, not how other people have perceived it to be and certainly not how other people have defined it to be!</p>

              <p>there are few flaws in your assumption:</p>
              <p>1. not all singaporeans are anti - foreigners. alot of bloggers are simply mentioning there are unrestricted amount of low quality influx which many uses fake credentials to cheat their way in.</p>
              <p>2. singapore belong to singaporeans, it is not our duty and responsibility to welcome any foreigners into our singapore and threaten the singapore way  of life. I bet most singaporeans when working or traveling to overseas will encounter some form of discrmination in countries such as australia, Japan etc. i bet singaporeans live it and accept it since these countries belong to them.</p>
              <p>3. not all singaporeans are sarong party gals/man. most of my friends do not really look up to angmo or ppl who consider to be superior. in fact these so call real talent seldom make themselves present in hardlanders daily life.</p>
              <p>4. global entreprenuers does not meant we had to employ multinationals workers working into the regional HQ or HQ of singapore. it simply means, we expand business opportunities in other countries, and probably employ most of the staff locally in countries of operation.</p>
              <p>5. singapore govt open arm policy need not mean singaporeans have to embrace it. govt policy could in most cases causes conflict of interest with that of commoners. govt want company to operate in singapore to generate taxes revenue. but if the increase in taxations does not generate enough welfare for the needy, there are bound to be grievences among the locally.</p>
              <p>finally, this is singapore. uniquely singapore. whoever come into this country has to accept whether deem acceptable by any foreigners or not. no one put a gun in their head. Just like you can make friends whom you like, dont whom you dont like.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>2) Sala ar Parnie.... Singapore belongs to Singaporeans (those born in Singapore).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3) What should Singaporean girls call those Singaporean guys who married those mail-ordered whores from overseas?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Answer : Realists lol</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>4) Any government can impose labour laws that companies will have to follow or risk breaching laws. If Singapore can enforce ISA which in many countries is a breach of human rights...I don't see what they cannot impose.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>5) I don't know what the government's plans are but there is a small possibilty it could be to maintain wages low enough so as to ensure they are working to pay for their 99 year lease through their lifetime. Father children so they can do the same for the future generation lol.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Interesting exchanges.</p>
              <p>Most of the S'poreans are grateful and respect the old guards. Our S'pore society has evolved into what it is today 'coz majority of our parents just follow our govt's policies and did not question. Most of our forefathers and parents are illiterate. Even when they were not happy, they only dare to whine within their households. Even then, they were afraid that the could be heard.</p>
              <p>Situation is different now. Most of us are educated and we have our own views and discernment. Govt  needs to consider our views before deciding on some policies. S'pore is a People's Nations, aren't we?</p>
              <p>I think LKY doesn't deserve to be cursed even if he said something wrong or made a wrong judgement. Nobody's perfect. Just hope that govt give us a say in the country's policies.</p>

              <p>to pretend all is well is hypocritical and that would only suppress the underlying problems which should be brought out to public transparency and resolution...if all is well...something is definitely wrong... there are always things to improve...</p>

              <p>the rising trend of foreign wives is mainly due to the rise of SPGs...this correlates from the rise of protectionism given in favour of women uprising....it all started from the silly stupid system that condones and allows such unhealthy trends...

              <p><br>i not against the protecionism given to the women, after all the older generation men more inclined to mis-treat their women isn't it?</p>
              <p>It takes two hands to clap to produce the charter and is working well for the women folks.</p>
              <p>Fast forward few decades, the situation now is reversed, and yet they dun have something to counter the possible abuse of women charter law.</p>
              <p>As with anything, when there is a force, there must be a friction.</p>
              <p>Without this friction i was talking about, you see what u see now..</p>

              <p>I did hear some mumblings among the older folks about the ruthless stories but I rather give them benefits of doubt. I just remember that my mum used to tell me not to ask too much, as there are watchdogs around.</p>
              <p>I see a lot of overcharged emotions here. It's only an exchange of opinions right?</p>

              <p>Yes, and the overcharged emotion here tells us that , even with all the complaining, whining and rambling, we still love Singapore as our land , our home, our country, unlike someone here who said "<span style="color: #ff0000;">Singapore does not belongs to Singaporeans"</span></p>
