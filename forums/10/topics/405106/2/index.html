              <p>Now, let me make it clear...first and foremost, sending foreigners here is not only to help us in our overheating economy, but also to curb our total wage so as to remain competitive, if you look at the west, their paid had risen to a stage where corporations have to think thrice before employing them. We must maintain our wages within a competitive basis so as to attract FDI. And it is because the in the begining of industrialisation, we depended too much on manufacturing that we end up having to relook into our economy after the 1997 recession, the govt then decided to fire at all front, from service to pharmacy to financial etc etc instead of just relying on manufacturing, and even if you want to maintain manufacturing, you need to manufacturing higher quality and technology products, not bata shoes or shampoo ya.</p>
              <p>If you look at today STI and our economy quick upturn with an MTI forecast of 13 to 15% growth, do you think foreigners destroyed or helped us??</p>

              <p>firstly- there is too much foreigners at too short a time, it is doing more hame than good, in a basic bio term if the foreigners were like white blood cells in our body and we are the red blood cells, for a normal human body it's ok since the whiteblood cells keep off infection and sickness by attacking bacteria. however presently the pace is more to like lukemia, where there is more whiteblood cells than redblood cells till the point that is also attacking the redblod cells too, causing the red result of cancer and death, isomia(unable to sleep) is also caused by a slight increase of whiteblood cells<br>over red blood cells. factor that into a country scale- it is doing us more harm than good at this rate of speed -period-</p>
              <p>secondly- samurai FYI is a japanese word for warrior, "samura" is a MALAY word for again, OMG how can you call yourself a singaporean or singapore supporter  if you duno that? surely you must have singaporean frens or clients who did their NS who told you abt it right?? or am  i wrong?? how can you mix japanese with malay unless well you totally know nuts abt malay?? being in singapore, the malay language is in some areas needed to understand others, especially where our neighbouring countries around us is speaking in almost the same language.</p>
              <p>lastly-as a prenakan, aka straits born chinese, the same culture race as LHL and LKY, i do not for one approve the way that they are doing things now as it is making it more worst than for the better, the problems created by foriengers here are pointing to endless and bigger, like a black hole.</p>
              <p>the problem lies in that in a country like this size , the best role model is to either follow taiwan or japan where innovation is the key to survive, if you say the govt has fired in all cylinders, then may i ask why not space?? sure, the US have NASA, china already has sent a man to space, russia also done it, if those countries can , why not singapore, in this area, size is not really the issue, technology is, given on what singapore is capable of, this area is a vast potential for singapore to develop right??</p>

So instead of grumbling, make money out of them, open food stalls cater for them, sell vege or foods suitable for them, drive part time cab on weekend to earn their money, buy and rent houses/rooms to them and make money. As employers can employ them at cheaper rate and trap them under contract of services.

              <p>I just dun understand singaporeans, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">why not take advantages instead of grumbling and grumbling about influx of migrants here, all these new intakes need houses to stay, they also need food, need places to go for relaxation and transport.</span> So instead of grumbling, make money out of them, open food stalls cater for them, sell vege or foods suitable for them, drive part time cab on weekend to earn their money, buy and rent houses/rooms to them and make money. As employers can employ them at cheaper rate and trap them under contract of services. Just like pubs here, so many viet and china gal, so I joint venture with another lady and bought an empty space and open up a steamboat house to cater for them to eat here.</p>
              <p>I urge Singaporean to take advantages of the changing environment instead of sitting in the toilet and waiting for the sun to go down ya</p>

              <p>Hard lar for the avg Singaporean. I outline a few pts that come to mind... lemme noe if u want me to elaborate.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1) Bulk of them come over in hopes of better job.... they compete by offering more value usually at a cheaper rate so ppl hire them.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2) If they are working for a cheaper rate, usually means they are paid less. Their disposable income are low. Therefore they swarm towards value for $ stuff.... i.e. cheap buffets. They also rent HDB but 6-7 cram into one. As a landlord .... renting to them be prepared to incur high depreciation and renovation if you ever want to sell lol. Alot of them also save the money up and stinge so they can bring the money back to their country whereby they get more value. That's the main driving force for this type of FT.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3) Then we have the 2nd type of FT the rich.... they come and once they get the PR = Licence to buy property. Land is scarce and prices in the long term can only go up. So land bank lor.... buy and buy so prices go high. Which is fine for the rich local Sg since they make.... but what about the Sg that only have 1 HDB? Sell and downsize? Then their kids leh? Buy jacked-up priced HDB?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>All is not lost.... there is a way to make $ from FT.... and that is to hire them. They are cheaper, better &amp; faster anyway.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>That problem is occurring in Aus as well to a smaller extent. The current prime minister is cutting down on immigration. Sg is cutting down as well.... but imo the govt is doing it unwillingly. Their wages are tagged to the performance of the economy.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Kind Regards</p>

              <p>i only know of construction workers that are highly being exploited because of quota and levies as such sub contractor pay commission to main contractor for getting labors. in returned sub con deduct pay from workers. Its a shady area.</p>
              <p>companies that are labor intensive will take advantage of the I2E cheaper, faster, and better policy. encourage labor to take a lower salary.  </p>
              <p>At a professional level our MOM has very liberal catergorize the Term "Professional" it varies from countries.</p>

              <p>Singaporean bosses or PAP do not see our ground level plight since they are not affected. If "FT' cant take it, why can't us? they commented, without thinking that "FT" will retire early in their own countries once they earn enough stronger currencies to send home while Singaporeans have to work till we die. SMM just mentioned that there should be no retirement age for us.</p>
