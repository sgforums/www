              <p> Just because you are dishonest about the fact, doesn't necessarily means I'm wrong. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
              <p>1. It's true that all Singaporeans are anti-foreigners. But all Singaporeans are capable of putting up a warm pretense to welcome foreigners. And how they expresses their displeasure comes in different forms, most of it are hardly noticeable, for example like how you have expressed in your post.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">2. Singapore does not belongs to Singaporeans. We are all immigrants once and we all comes from different countries. The only Singaporean is probably the lion that Sang Nila Utama saw when he landed in this Island.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Do you mean that Singapore is not your country? Do you mean that this land dun belong to us true blue? if your answer is yes , please kindly surrender ya red passport to ICA.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">3. SPG is a sexist term founded by stupid sillyporeans guys for Singaporean girls. What should Singaporean girls call those Singaporean guys who married those mail-ordered whores from overseas? Losers perhaps? or Cheap fuckers? Then again, each individual have their own freedom to mix and befriend whoever they wish and should be able to do so without any form of discrimination against them.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">I have said my piece regarding this in the other thread.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">4. You do not know that the Government actually have little or no control over how companies have chosen to operate in Singapore. They can only lay out guidelines but they are unable to enforce anything onto the companies in Singapore.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Why bother to pay them highest ministerial salary in the world? </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">5. The Government have a plan for Singaporeans. Just because Singaporeans are unable to take hardships and have the foresight to see what the government had in store for the future of Singapore, doesn't necessarily means that the government is not doing a good job. Ultimately, only Singaporeans will stand to gain from the end-result from these government policies. I would like to see how many Singaporeans would actually praise the government when they are reaping the rewards in their future. I would say zero or none of the Singaporeans here would even bothered to put in a good word of thanks towards the government. Past and present situations have shown that Singaporeans are really just a greedy and ungrateful bunch. Ask yourself, how many Singaporeans you know that are actually grateful to the present government for what they have done for Singapore in the past? All blinded by senseless hatred and failed to notice the grand difference between Singapore and her neighbours and the rest of the world.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">You sala...it's those at pinnacle of power in SG unable to take hardship, hence the out of the world salary. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">That's fine with me because the Singapore that I know is supporting these ungrateful bunch from falling all over into the oceans and really such Singaporeans truly deserves to be thrown into the oceans to be fed to the sharks without the basic courtesy of being thankful, grateful and appreciative for their own country.</span></p>
              <p>Please learn to be grateful, thankful and appreciative Singaporeans. We all know that we are extremely talented in the complaints department, but when are we going to admit that we have failed badly in the rewards and recognition department? Probably never .... <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p><br>2. True blue Singaporeans? If you truly feel that you should take passports away from non-True blue Singaporeans, then I suggest you go and take away the passports away from your own ancestors first. If you belonged to their family tree and traced your roots, you would know that you are NOT your so-called True blue Singaporeans. Maybe 0.00001% True blue Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>But if you have already decided to disown and denied all your ancestors and where they came from, then feel free and proud to proclaim yourself as a True blue Singaporean. Please do your maths correctly next time.</p>
              <p>4. PAP pays highest salaries to their ministers is because they wish to attract talented people to help to grow and build and carve and pave a good future for the very Singapore that you and I are residing in. The government could've paid themselves more but they didn't. They just make sure that they have paid their ministers more than enough compared to what their opposition and rebel parties could've ever offered to their rogue politicians.</p>
              <p>Imagined if LHL or GCT went over to the opposition when they first became ministers, what would you have done? Would you have voted for opposition or PAP?</p>
              <p>5. I see the main problem in here is that there are many Singaporeans who have little to none financial security which is caused by their little to zero job security. And who do they have to thank for all that? The answer is actually themselves because they are Singaporeans who would not hestitate to steal and rob the lifeline of their fellow Singaporeans and also because of their immoral behaviour to oppress and bully their fellow Singaporeans which has caused great distortion and mistrust and disbelieve among themselves as Singapore citizens.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans who are guilty of such behaviours should be ashamed of themselves and discouraged from such anti-patriotic behaviour which will wreck the very foundational roots of the country from the inside out.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Soon, these people will run out of people to blame and their problems are only going to grow even larger.</p>
              <p>Keep fighting among yourselves ok? Gambette!!!~ <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p><br>From the 60's onward, Asia was heading for growth. The growth gained momentum after the Vietnam War, then the rise of China. Following Japan, Taiwan, Korea, Hong Kong and Singapore grew to be the dragons. The opportunities were there for everybody, not just Singapore.</p>
              <p>In fact, countries such as Indonesia, Philippines and Malaysia, with resources, land and minerals, should grow faster and stronger, but they didn't capitalize on the opportunity.</p>

              <p>1. It's true that all Singaporeans are anti-foreigners. But all Singaporeans are capable of putting up a warm pretense to welcome foreigners. And how they expresses their displeasure comes in different forms, most of it are hardly noticeable, for example like how you have expressed in your post.</p>
              <p>2. Singapore does not belongs to Singaporeans. We are all immigrants once and we all comes from different countries. The only Singaporean is probably the lion that Sang Nila Utama saw when he landed in this Island.</p>
              <p>3. SPG is a sexist term founded by stupid sillyporeans guys for Singaporean girls. What should Singaporean girls call those Singaporean guys who married those mail-ordered whores from overseas? Losers perhaps? or Cheap fuckers? Then again, each individual have their own freedom to mix and befriend whoever they wish and should be able to do so without any form of discrimination against them.</p>
              <p>4. You do not know that the Government actually have little or no control over how companies have chosen to operate in Singapore. They can only lay out guidelines but they are unable to enforce anything onto the companies in Singapore.</p>
              <p>5. The Government have a plan for Singaporeans. Just because Singaporeans are unable to take hardships and have the foresight to see what the government had in store for the future of Singapore, doesn't necessarily means that the government is not doing a good job. Ultimately, only Singaporeans will stand to gain from the end-result from these government policies. I would like to see how many Singaporeans would actually praise the government when they are reaping the rewards in their future. I would say zero or none of the Singaporeans here would even bothered to put in a good word of thanks towards the government. Past and present situations have shown that Singaporeans are really just a greedy and ungrateful bunch. Ask yourself, how many Singaporeans you know that are actually grateful to the present government for what they have done for Singapore in the past? All blinded by senseless hatred and failed to notice the grand difference between Singapore and her neighbours and the rest of the world.</p>
              <p>That's fine with me because the Singapore that I know is supporting these ungrateful bunch from falling all over into the oceans and really such Singaporeans truly deserves to be thrown into the oceans to be fed to the sharks without the basic courtesy of being thankful, grateful and appreciative for their own country.</p>
              <p>Please learn to be grateful, thankful and appreciative Singaporeans. We all know that we are extremely talented in the complaints department, but when are we going to admit that we have failed badly in the rewards and recognition department? Probably never</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>1. You are already dishonest when you mention all singaporeans are anti foreigners.</p>
              <p>at least our ministers embrace them. use your words carefully.</p>
              <p>2. i cannot understand your logic singapore not belong to singaporeans? base on your assumption it seem you deduce, australia doesnt belong to australians, tibetans doesnt belong to china, american doesnt belong to americans. whenyou quote such sentence quote a timeline. if foreigners convert to  singaporeans, i will consider them true singaporeans. our great grandparents are from china, once they decided to stay and migrated to singapore they are singaporeans. i am chinese singaporeans, not chinese from china.</p>
              <p>3. go ahead and make a quote for men who married overseas gals. i dont mind, i can suggest for your cheongsam party men, do you like it?</p>
              <p>4. once again your statement over govt has no control over how companies have chosen to operate in Singapore is vague. can you state clearly which form of regulations? operate KTV need special license you know? hehe.</p>
              <p>5. once again i dont know what you are talking about. singaporeans love our PAP govt. that is why they vote for them in every election. why take criticism so badly? you can choose to look criticism into a positive way, that is one of the way, a govt can improve by listening to feedback, good or bad.</p>
              <p>why not argue on the pt about foreign talent alone and not drag all singaporeans into the chapter. there is no 100% perfect citizens around the world. feel proud to be singaporeans if you are one. If you are not, tell us more what had to done for singapore, if you are not so happy, why stay here?</p>

              <p>1. You are already dishonest when you mention all singaporeans are anti foreigners.</p>
              <p>at least our ministers embrace them. use your words carefully.</p>
              <p>2. i cannot understand your logic singapore not belong to singaporeans? base on your assumption it seem you deduce, australia doesnt belong to australians, tibetans doesnt belong to china, american doesnt belong to americans. whenyou quote such sentence quote a timeline. if foreigners convert to  singaporeans, i will consider them true singaporeans. our great grandparents are from china, once they decided to stay and migrated to singapore they are singaporeans. i am chinese singaporeans, not chinese from china.</p>
              <p>3. go ahead and make a quote for men who married overseas gals. i dont mind, i can suggest for your cheongsam party men, do you like it?</p>

              <p><br>1. Oh! You know our ministers very well. So when do you think we will have our NEXT ENTHNIC MALAY PRESIDENT? And why Singapore has such tough policy against asylum seekers or refugees? --- Since we are not anti-foreigners. (I can already imagine your excuses about not having enough room to contain them in Singapore and other non-related excuses to not embracing foreigners = Non-Singaporeans.) <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
              <p>There are many others examples I could remind you of anti-foreigners, remember our political issues with Dr. Habibi of Indonesia and Dr. Mahathir. Building casinos and affecting the businesses in JB, do we also embrace these foreigners in good faith?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. If Singaporeans truly accepted these foreigners who have changed their citizenship to Singapore citizens as true blue Singaporeans, then why is there a need to categorise them as new citizens and not Singaporeans. Clearly there is a difference in everyone's hearts.</p>
              <p>How many non-Singaporeans friends do you have? How many of your friends are not born in Singapore provided you are born in Singapore? Do your maths and then come and tell me how you have embraced these foreigners and how you are not anti-foreigners. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>4, 5. If you don't know what I am talking about and yet you still go and guess and assume based on your subjective and negative impression of me, I can only say you are dumb and stupid if you even try to have a baseless argument and expects me to correct you. I don't have time to babysit, educate or even accomodate your imaginery dispute.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Unlike you, I don't argue for the sake of arguing. Understand my posts before you make any ridiculous replies.</p>
              <p>And it's not that I cannot help you, I just don't see the need to do so. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
