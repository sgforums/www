            <div class='col-md body'>Agence France Presse<br>March 17, 2005<br>SYDNEY<br><br>AN Australian man on death row in Singapore has pleaded with the island state's president for clemency because he has cooperated with a police investigation into an international drug ring, his lawyer said Thursday, March 17.<br><br>Nguyen Tuong Van, who was born in a refugee camp in Thailand but whose family is Vietnamese, was arrested in Singapore's Changi airport in December 2002 carrying almost 400 grams of heroin strapped to his lower back and in his backpack.<br><br>Since then, he has assisted Australian Federal Police investigations into an Australia-based international drug cartel.<br><br>"We've lodged a petition for clemency with the Singapore president," lawyer Lex Lasry said, adding: "There's been a trial, there's been an appeal, this is the last step in the process."<br><br>Singapore President Sellapan Rama Nathan is currently on an official visit to Australia.<br><br>Lasry said Singapore's constitution allowed for leniency if a co-accused gave evidence that led to the conviction of a main offender.<br><br>In Nguyen's case, this would be if information he provided could be used to arrest members of the syndicate he was briefly involved with, he said.<br><br>Referring to information Nguyen gave investigators, Lasry said: "There was obviously a benefit in that for Australia, but (also) for any Southeast Asian country."<br><br>Australian Federal Police confirmed Thursday that they had interviewed Nguyen in relation to an investigation.<br><br>Police gave Nguyen's defence team a letter generally given to "people who have assisted with investigations," a spokeswoman told AFP.<br><br>The plight of the 24-year-old sales executive from the southern city of  Melbourne has also been taken up by Catholic Archbishop of Sydney Cardinal George Pell who has called on the Pope to plead for Nguyen's life.<br><br>"People who have met him and have talked to him say that his repentance is genuine," Pell told ABC radio.<br><br>"It was his first oversees trip, he has admitted his guilt right from the start. I have sent off the file to the Holy Father, to Pope John Paul II, asking for his support."<br><br>Nguyen, who emigrated to Australia as a child, told police he was smuggling the drugs to help pay off a debt owed by his twin brother. He was sentenced to death last year.<br><br>Lasry said he expected Nguyen to know whether his petition has been successful within three months.</div>

There were always some excuses in the end to justify sparing them from the noose.. i remember one in which the court ruled that the maid had been very stressed cos she had been ill-treated by her employer and that drove her to the murder.. so she was sentenced to imprisonment instead. I don't think any Singaporean if in her shoes would be spared the hangman with this kind of argument.<br><br>And i dun think anyone will forget the Michael Fay incident here in 1994.. After the then US President intervened on his behalf, the Singapore government reduced his sentence.<br><br>When politics clashes with justice, politics will always prevail. I think the government has learnt this lesson after the uproar in the Philippines over the hanging of the filipino maid murderer Flor C__ here back in the 90s. That particular incident led to a cooling of bilateral relations between Singapore and the Phillipines back then. I believe the Singapore government  has been on the lookout to avoid such diplomatic embarrassment since then.</div></blockquote>For all the talk about rehabilitation, here is one prisoner who has cooperated to help in the fight against drug trafficking, and all we cna do is kill him in cold blood?Not as if he's unremorseful..And pray tell, what f*cking deterrant does it serve when the couriers are hanged and the bosses are still out there.<br><br>Commute the sentence I say, and let not the blindness of paper justice serve as a yoke around our shoulders.Punishment should be based on the willingness of the prisoner to repent.And life is not given by us, so it shall not be taken away by us without any decency and moral justification.We need to apply the same standards to our own citizens.I find it extremely disturbing that we are not placed ahead of others when it comes to something of such a serious nature.Talk about every Singaporean counts.Appraently you only count if you are a "model" citizen and a parrot....Kiss my balls.</div>
