            <div class='col-md body'>Based on the Order Paper of the Parliament sitting this Monday (2 days' time), Myanmar-related issues will dominate the session, with nearly 1/3 of the questions on it alone (12 out of 38 ).<br><br>More than half (7 out of 12) are from non-PAP MPs. WP NCMP Sylvia Lim filed 3 questions and NMPs Siew Kum Hong and Eunice Olsen filed 2 each. The other 5 questions are from PAP MPs Irene Ng (2), Lee Bee Wah, Lily Neo and Charles Chong.<br><br>All MPs, ruling party MPs or otherwise, have covered basically all areas that were discussed in online forums, from Asean's stand on action against to trade with Myanmar to Myanmar-related protests in Singapore.<br><br>For those following the Myanmar issue, it could be a sitting to watch. I recommend to read the questions and ministers' replies in the Hansard for the most accurate contents, rather than rely on the printing press.<br><br>Regards</div>

This kind of murky traffic solution packages are being marketed to the world despite more jams being caused with higher ERP fees.<br><br>Now the minister will say he needs more time as not all the solutions are yet finalized holistic is what he said) or even thought about by the million-dollar ministers.</span><br><br><blockquote><span style="color: red;">The Singapore Government has a deeper relationship with the Myanmar Junta then what is seen on the surface and known publicly.<br><br>It is amazing that Jane's Defense magazine was able to uncover the regular electronic surveillance flights conducted by some purpose built RSAF plane, flying in international airspace up the Malacca Straits to land in Myanmar, before making a return journey down the same flight path.</span></blockquote><span style="color: green;">With its own citizens the ministers will be denying every surveillance reports or keeping quiet like the NKF malpractices going on for years, fire risks in wet markets or Hougang but let's see this time what ministers will say to deny US government's satellite surveillance reports of Singapore government's deep involvement with Junta.</span><br><br><blockquote><span style="color: red;">If relation is not thick, how could the Myanmar non-government personalities move so freely in and out of Singapore without any interference from the Singapore Government, when these people are known by Interpol and US Federal Narcotics Bureau to be involved in the drug trade ?<br><br>Ironically, a Singapore Lawyer was permanently detained under the Criminal Detention Legislation, and his recent attempts to have the Singapore High Court to strike down the Detention Order was denied.<br><br>This Legislation allow the Home Affairs Minister to issue an order for the detention of any one deemed as a criminal threat, and will be locked up without evidence being produced, nor charges for conviction by the Judiciary.</span></blockquote><span style="color: purple;">This is called Singapore's version of Rule of Law (My laws) when citizens have to obey drug laws but government does not have to obey the same laws just by quoting selectively some other sections of the law that their interpretations are out of the law like RAF needs training ground and air-space and there is no choice but to exchange some space for drug monies being deposited or invested in our Singapore banks.<br><br>So the Interpol's reports are either non-factual or are not applicable to sovereignty issues or RSAF. What kind of Rule of Law is this?</span><br><br><blockquote><span style="color: red;">The detained Singapore Lawyer was charged for being the Master Mind of an International Drug Operation, but no evidence was produced nor was he formally charged for a trial by the Singapore Judiciary.<br><br>He was simply locked up and only to be released sometime in the future and at the discretion of the Home Affairs Minister.<br><br>If those known Myanmese drug dealers can move so freely in and out of Singapore, while a Singaporeans is locked up for the same circumstance - the relationship surely must be as deep as the ocean floor.<br><br>Can we expect any truth to be heard from the Parliamentary <span style="font-style: italic;">''grilling''</span> ?<br><br></span><br><br>[/b]</blockquote><span style="color: brown;">This difference in treatments between the above-stated case of a lawyer being locked up for involvement in drugs without trial whereas and the drug kings' repeated exchanges of benefits and depositing drug monies in some banks without queries should have been put up as a more relevant topic for recent discussions at the International Conference of Lawyers on Rule of Law as practised in Singapore where MM Lee insisted that Singapore is among the top countries with biggest accountability and rule of law and professor Jayakumar was quick to say Singapore achieved higher social cohesion through practice of rule of law.<br><br>It looks like a person has two mouths to talk and everything said about rule of law in Singapore depends on selective comparison or some other different interpretation of law.<br><br>Where are all the lawyers now ? Do they agree we have a true interpretations of law or interpretational Rule of Law in Singapore in our drug laws (RSAF), fire-risk laws (Hougang Fire) or company laws (NKF)</span></div>
