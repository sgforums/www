              <p>We are a fragile and small country, if you mess up the media, we will be in deep trouble, a trouble that can destroy our 50 years of nation building, others countries can go messing up their media, they are much bigger in mass and population that even their govt lose control of some part, but that is their problem.</p>
              <p>For us, we take care of our backyard, you never understand our fragility, we cannot even withstand a major earthquake nor a tainted milk case, if we lose control of the media and let it free to sell false and untrue infos for individual interest, then we are history.</p>

              <p>Hello, you understand what is a contest, election is a contest, and in a contest, you need to make your opponent lose inorder to win, I have 100% no doubt that if today, SDP is the ruling party, they will do the same, control the media, or maybe even the nets and Iphone just to get hold of wining a contest.</p>
              <p>A general has to protect/defend the gate with all his might, in whatever way, he must not lose, if not, he will be the attacker instead of being a defender. Oppositions are like attackers and the PAP is doing all the best to defend it. That is the name of the game, you dun expect a ruling party to welcome opposition, lay red carpet and tell them they can talk whatever they like??? if that is the case, no political party of sense would win or hold any ruling</p>

              SUCK!" EVER SEEN THAT? EVER SEEN THE PAP USING THE PAPERS AS REAL
              PROPAGANDA? u guys dont have a REAL clue about what REAL propaganda
              is. Wanna talk about the NDP? The YOG? come on ppl! ok, maybe
              the NDP was a bit wierd, but hey, how else do we celebrate
              singapore's independence? the massive coverage on YOG? some could
              say that its the PAP behind this, but i barely see anything
              crediting the PAP to being such a responssible government balh
              blah.... the massive coverage was just more to celebrate
              singapore's accomplishments(personally, i dun think much of that^^)
              wasnt it? stop saying that PAP uses the papers for propaganda, cos
              they dont.</p>
              <p>1.They dont place HUGE, crazy posters abt "VOTE PAP!" in the
              papers, or u guys dun ever see flashy adverts like "PAP. YOUR ONLY
              HOPE^^"</p>
              <p>2.It would be stupid to accuse the PAP of propaganda with the
              NDP coverage, cos wouldnt it be wierd if the papers didnt publish
              anything on the ndp? isnt the NDP supposed to celebrate singapore's
              independence? then? squish the NDP into a tiny column on the news?
              pretend the NDP NEVER HAPPENED?</p>
              <p>3.And so what if yea, if u guys can even find evidence of the
              pap using the media as propaganda? if a opposition party can then
              still beat PAP? that shows that we are looking at a capable
              opposition WORTHY TO VOTE IN wouldnt it? stop with your
              useless excuse of voting in opposition to 'boost' morale, ok? u
              guys may be THAT STUPID to vote in parties u arent even sure of
              their competence, but i can tell u majority of singapore wont be so
              stupid to vote in a party they have no idea if that party wont turn
              out to be a bunch of useless idiots. PROVE yourselves. GET IT?
              Singapore needs capable leaders, not a bunch of crazy donkeys in
              the parliament who will make it even harder for the PAP to put in
              some beneficial policies. It's like italy in the 1920s all over
              again. so-called 'proportional representation', and what happened?
              A LOT of parties, NO DECISIONS EVER MADE. u want a parliament full
              of 'talk but no action?;</p>

              <p>I don't think PAP is using the media as propaganda, but they control it. Meaning they can censor whatever they want.</p>
              <p>Examples such as delaying news, blocking news etc etc. Those news unfavorable to PAP cannot be published, news favorable to the opposition parties cannot be published and etc. So all in all, s'poreans aren't having <span style="text-decoration: underline;">REAL</span> news.</p>
              <p>From your point 3, I can see you are a PAP ç‹—, but I leave you to your opinions. If you read straits times everyday and treat it as a 'bible', wow, I suggest you continue playing maplesea before acting so crazy.</p>

              <p>I was blind, that's why I can see the difference between visual blindness and mental blindness. Alot of Singaporeans have mental blindness.</p>
