            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by BillyBong:<br><strong><br>[bI think Mr BillyBong is either naive or a govt propagator.Do u think we really have only these choices to choose! I don't like the govt, doesn't mean i don't like spore and leave just because ot these group of people(govt)!I love spore(The lasksa,char kuey teow,friends......)but not the govt.<br>We stay doesn't mean spore citizen have the only choice of following govt laws and rules blindly. Fellow singaporean unite and fight for our right!</strong><br><br>Naiveity depends on your understanding of the overall picture. It is simplistic to make outrageous claims and call the response mute when you dun like the answer. Short of the whole population, i can safely say that most ppl want changes but unless there's a radical reform in the political stage, there's little the masses can do accept continue to write and express their various dissatisfactions.<br><br>And before you go mouthing about forum-users as "govt propagator" (actually it should be govt propaganda), read more topics in this forum; you might realise most ppl are just looking for a qualitative, objective argument. And many do not agree with our gahmen's policies either.<br><br><strong>Spore without freedom of expression is a total true fact. What BillyBong mention of the channel of expressing through forums in ST,Streats r self-deceiving.We all know these r govt control,not all letters and complaints send to will be published.Govt will decide what to show and what cannot. Do u call that a right!(except internet)Have any of our complains about those laws that have passed been heard? Wage reform,CPF reduction,GST,increase of public transport fares and.......! In the end ,it just passed accordingly to what the govt want.There shall be a balance of power between people and govt or else why r we call republic? If the power is one side,then one day a group of corrupted people make it to the parliament and control all the important positions.They will just implement anything they like<br>(100% taxes).Yes, our spore past record had shown good management by the govt.Doesn't meant they will always be right in the future!Just like what i mention abt the one day...! Some power needed to be given to the people to check the govt of their policy.Just like what's happening in HongKong,After the handover in 1997,the govt try to be funny and implement 23 laws to control the freedoms and rights of hongkonger.500,000 people gather and protest against them and china backed down. </strong><br><br>How can serving notice to the masses through forum pages be termed as 'self-deceiving'? It is the passing of information or criticism that keeps ppl in check. Knowledge that there are certain elements within our society who abuse power or unscrupulously use them for their own ends is hardly rubbish. It sometimes takes such letters and voices to be heard b4 our leaders sit up and take notice. Yes it might seem relatively futile but at least others know, and isolated incidents will receive more publicity...especially those our leaders wish to sweep under the carpet. (like our SM's recent usage of SIA)<br><br><strong>What Mr Marlboro trying to convey is the intentions of the govt! Do u think govt really concern about yr health.They r more concern about the money.<br>If not,as what billybong mentions</strong><br><br>It is obviously transparent to all except those who wear blinds that taxation of cigarettes is two-fold:<br><br>1. to fatten the buldge of the govt<br>2. to reduce the number of smokers in singapore.<br><br>How you determine which one holds greater value is purely subjective.[/b]</blockquote>1) Seen what HK pple do when there is "no change in the political stage" of their country?<br><br>2) go read other forums, and actually u'll find out that many more pple come to internet forums to elt out steam.<br><br>3) Go to  or  or  and u'll see many examples of edited letters. in fact, the best place to go is . All the letters there are either rejected letters or edited letters. ST Forum publishes letters selectively, and even then many of the letters look suspiciously incongruent. Haven't you read that kind of letters before?  a letter with one opinion at the start, that suddenly morphs into something the direct opposite att eh end. and of course, there is the issue of length measurements. I remember that there was one day with an entire letter page on LHL. 2/3 of the page was covered with over-lavish praises of him, and only the last 1/3 contained a letter of criticism, and most of the last 1/3 was blotted out by an ad. SO there.<br>4) abt smoking, i'll not comment, but i give it that everything the govt does is for money. read the latest article at ThinkCentre abt GIC and the govt surplus. But it is very clear, frm the way govt squeezes CPF and dumps a little too much attention to teh independent schools, that they only care abt money. Entrepreneurship will add money to their coffers; at least that si the only kind of entrepreneurship they are caring abt. n of course, never forget their obnoxious salaries; for all the talk abt corruption!<br><br>the pikamaster</div>
