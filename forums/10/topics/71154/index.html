Do u think govt really concern about yr health.They r more concern about the money.<br>If not,as what billybong mentions(<strong>I would think alcohol and smoking go hand-in-hand. If the gahmen decides to take affirmative action,<br>then raise the prices for both.),</strong>then why alcohol is not affected?(becos of Tiger Beer,spore money again!) Don't be naive! Friend!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To fund all the initiatives that the govt is doing, they need money.  Yes, and it is true that the world moves on money.  Yes, perhaps the Govt is high-handed, but the pain has to come from somewhere, and nothing wrong from pinning it on non-essential items - like smoking and gambling.  Otherwise, how are we going to subsidise education, healthcare, etc.<br><br>I think sometimes we miss the big picture, when we think democracy is good and fighting for our rights by walking the streets like the Hong Kongers or Taiwanese... do a few of that, create some havoc, you may not achieve much, but you will create a sense of insecurity with the MNDs and then.... you will regret when they cease to come and many start to leave, then we can really kiss our economy good bye and start living like a fishing village some hundred years back.<br><br>Think about that when you complain about price hikes on cigarettes....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I wonder how many people out there actual watch the show Zuo Xiang Gong He every Friday night on channel 8.<br><br>Last episode shows Dr Sun Yat Sen trying to explain to the people what is the meaning of the Republic after their many years being rules by the Manchus. From there I know more about what a real Republic should be like.<br><br>Firstly, the government is being chosen by the people. For a large number of people, lets say 80,000, one senate will be chosen by their votes. This senate is suppose to represent this 80,000 people and he will attend parliament to make decisions for the country. Of course this is the basic concept of being a Republic.<br><br>However in Singapore, I really wonder are we really in a Republic system anymore. I don't even know who have I chosen to represent me in the parliament. As for most other areas here, I don't even have the chance to vote. I think a PAP walkover in the area just because there is no opposition in it is not fair.<br><br>I feel that even though there is no opposition party in the area, it is still compulsory for us to vote. To vote whether to accept this person to represent us or not. In other words, in areas where there is a walkover, the people there still vote, but on whether should we accept this. We still have a choice to deem that person suitability to represent us. If it is a walkover and the people had chosen him not to be representing them, that area will be given, maybe a month to prepare for another round of voting, where other people can get to have a chance to join in the election. If this method proves to be too troublesome, then let it be that nobody shall represent this 80,000 people. There will be one lesser senate to the parliament.<br><br>Secondly, why is there a need to put down a huge cash deposit before voting ? I thought it is for us people to choose who to represent us, why should any cash be involved ? Does it mean we cannot choose a poor people to represent us thoug we want to or does it imply if one is poor, one cannot be a senate ? I think that goes against the initial idea of being Republic.<br><br>I think we should drop the name Republic for Singapore to portray our political situation more accurately.</div>

Fellow singaporean unite and fight for our right![/b]<br><br>Naiveity depends on your understanding of the overall picture. It is simplistic to make outrageous claims and call the response mute when you dun like the answer. Short of the whole population, i can safely say that most ppl want changes but unless there's a radical reform in the political stage, there's little the masses can do accept continue to write and express their various dissatisfactions.<br><br>And before you go mouthing about forum-users as "govt propagator" (actually it should be govt propaganda), read more topics in this forum; you might realise most ppl are just looking for a qualitative, objective argument. And many do not agree with our gahmen's policies either.<br><br><strong>Spore without freedom of expression is a total true fact. What BillyBong mention of the channel of expressing through forums in ST,Streats r self-deceiving.We all know these r govt control,not all letters and complaints send to will be published.Govt will decide what to show and what cannot. Do u call that a right!(except internet)Have any of our complains about those laws that have passed been heard? Wage reform,CPF reduction,GST,increase of public transport fares and.......! In the end ,it just passed accordingly to what the govt want.There shall be a balance of power between people and govt or else why r we call republic? If the power is one side,then one day a group of corrupted people make it to the parliament and control all the important positions.They will just implement anything they like<br>(100% taxes).Yes, our spore past record had shown good management by the govt.Doesn't meant they will always be right in the future!Just like what i mention abt the one day...! Some power needed to be given to the people to check the govt of their policy.Just like what's happening in HongKong,After the handover in 1997,the govt try to be funny and implement 23 laws to control the freedoms and rights of hongkonger.500,000 people gather and protest against them and china backed down. </strong><br><br>How can serving notice to the masses through forum pages be termed as 'self-deceiving'? It is the passing of information or criticism that keeps ppl in check. Knowledge that there are certain elements within our society who abuse power or unscrupulously use them for their own ends is hardly rubbish. It sometimes takes such letters and voices to be heard b4 our leaders sit up and take notice. Yes it might seem relatively futile but at least others know, and isolated incidents will receive more publicity...especially those our leaders wish to sweep under the carpet. (like our SM's recent usage of SIA)<br><br><strong>What Mr Marlboro trying to convey is the intentions of the govt! Do u think govt really concern about yr health.They r more concern about the money.<br>If not,as what billybong mentions</strong><br><br>It is obviously transparent to all except those who wear blinds that taxation of cigarettes is two-fold:<br><br>1. to fatten the buldge of the govt<br>2. to reduce the number of smokers in singapore.<br><br>How you determine which one holds greater value is purely subjective.</div>
