When he tries, he sounds like some angmo trying to speak Mandarin.  His father is Chinese, but was an orphan brought up in an English educated family (his mother is Portuguese).<br><br>His whole family speaks English at home.  This guy doesn't even have a Chinese name (for some legit reasons), but ask him what race he is, he will proudly say Chinese (even though you can see he is not pure Chinese).  He is just not good with languages.  He took Malay as a second language cause he just couldn't cope with Mandarin in school.<br><br>On top of all this he has been living abroad (US, Canada and Australia) since he was 16, just came back to Singapore 4 years ago.  His g'frens also all caucasians and he always tells them that he is Chinese (I've seen him get offended when one of his g'frens told him he doesn't behave very typically Chinese).<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  Every day at breakfast we get to see him arguing with this Hong Kong Chinese who seems to think deep down inside that the Chinese aren't as good as the Caucasians.  (Must be cause Hong Kong was a colony till '97... HK Chinese have been brainwashed too long already).<br><br>So how?  Look down on this friend of mine also?  Going to judge people just because they can't speak Chinese?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

Most of us in Singapore do not identify with China, nor do we consider us Chinese in the context of attitudes, behaviors, values and aspirations. Our general idea of Chinese is that they spit, talk loud, grab money in every way possible. On the other hand, we can never be Chinese because we cant even appreciate the nuances in a Chinese joke that requires one to be knowledgeable in Chinese culture, history and literature that is commonly known by a typical mainlander if he/ she has completed high school.<br><br>And no, Ma Zhu worship is a Hokkien tradition, not enough of a basis to qualify one as a Chinese.<br><br>So the question is, how do we describe ourselves given that we are in appearance, yellow skin and black hair?<br><br>1. Asianized Chinese?<br>2. Chinese descendents of a long ago diaspora generation.<br><br>Whatever it is, we must ADMIT that we dont know enough of our roots to qualify as a Chinese.<br><br>Then it comes down to: I am a Singaporean.<br><br>Oops! Define that.</div></blockquote>Just be yourself lah. No need to emphasis anything. People look at your skin color, make some assumption. No matter what you emphasis will not affect their opinion one. After a period of contact, they will know you as you, rather than just some people of a certain type of skin or background.<br><br>If people ask me about my history, just tell them the truth loh. Grandparent from China, Fujian or Chao Zhou coming to Singapore at the age of 5 or 15 etc etc.. loh. Then explain that was grandfather or great grandparent, but Singapore now is very different from China etc tec loh.... no big deal. Often then not, the people from the other country will find this very interesting and ask more. You will soon realise how little many people know about Singapore anyway.<br><br>Anyway, history is a very interesting topic. Read quite a bit in recent years. The America History, European History and Chinese History are all rich and full of great stories. If free, why not go read some. It is a shame that the Singapore government find no value in teaching this subject broadly, since there is no economic value. But I think knowing the history of the world makes one appreciate so much more the current situation in the world and Singapore. If one is born in a random era and place, there is a good chance you will have to worry even about survival.</div>

I have a colleague who speaks English fluently and can't speak one word of Mandarin.  When he tries, he sounds like some angmo trying to speak Mandarin.  His father is Chinese, but was an orphan brought up in an English educated family (his mother is Portuguese).<br><br>His whole family speaks English at home.  This guy doesn't even have a Chinese name (for some legit reasons), but ask him what race he is, he will proudly say Chinese (even though you can see he is not pure Chinese).  He is just not good with languages.  He took Malay as a second language cause he just couldn't cope with Mandarin in school.<br><br>On top of all this he has been living abroad (US, Canada and Australia) since he was 16, just came back to Singapore 4 years ago.  His g'frens also all caucasians and he always tells them that he is Chinese (I've seen him get offended when one of his g'frens told him he doesn't behave very typically Chinese).<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  Every day at breakfast we get to see him arguing with this Hong Kong Chinese who seems to think deep down inside that the Chinese aren't as good as the Caucasians.  (Must be cause Hong Kong was a colony till '97... HK Chinese have been brainwashed too long already).<br><br>So how?  Look down on this friend of mine also?

He is much better then any of those who refuse to acknowledge their heritage becos they are ashame of it.</div>
