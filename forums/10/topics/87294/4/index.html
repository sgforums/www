Scientists believe as early as 4500 BC there were ppl living in the islands. It is believed that by AD100 the ppl living throughout the islands closely resembled the present day Jap, in language and appearance. Chinese, Korean and a group of ppl called Ainu made up the largest minority group.<br><br>Chinese influence in Japan came at late 400's, among other things, system of writing, advanced method of calculating the calendar, confucianism and by 552, Buddhism came in from China.<br><br>Scientists believe the Korean people were in korea 30,000 yrs ago.<br><br>did japan started out as manchurians??  Not likely.<br><br>japanese were never linked to china. in fact, japanese are the most conservative ppl. While their way of life may be very americanized, their heritage, their language, their culture remain very much similar to what it was centuries ago.<br><br>World mass immigration happened between 1700-1820, mainly to America, three fifth of the immigrants were of english origin, hence English was the dominant language. The greatest immigration happened between 1820 to 1830 'cos of the Great Famine in Europe. These europeans moved to south america, africa and Australia. That explains why in these places, many european languages are spoken even up till today.<br><br>What it says here is that the immigrants brought their languages and culture to where they went. They did not go and assimilate with the locals, and it was because they were proud of their heritage and culture!!<br><br>Chinese immigrants left China in much later dates and where they landed they were already local languages and culture . China towns were established in places where the chinese wanted to retain their heritage, especially in places where they were visibly different, from the whites or the black.<br><br>Most European immigrants were able to migrate because they were rich, to pay for the trip out of Europe to places like america and australia. Many Chinese immigrants left China because they were poor, many were sold as labourers.<br>The rich were educated and the poor were not educated. In new settlements, schools, like hospitals were built by westerners. Chinese who can afford send their children back to china for education, otherwise stay locals. In British colonies like singapore, most took up studied english, easy to find job. So where is our culture and heritage..... if our parents did not pass on to us?<br><br>It is not anybody's fault that some of us do not feel the link with China. To put it correctly, mainland China, especially when under the communists, was not a place we would like to have link with. Finding root is to explain why we are what we are today. Singapore is too young a nation to develop our own culture and heritage, yet.<br><br>HK, have come under the british for 150 yrs have not lost their chineseness and the ability to speak cantonese. The jews around the world can be citizens for generations in many countries outside Isreal but they are jews and their heritage remains, since the time of Abraham.<br>Why? Looking at the history of the jewist people, there were persecuted left right centre so there is nothing to shout about, but they remain jews as a people.<br><br>I was born in Singapore, but was not born an indian, malay or angmoh, but chinese, like my father and mother. I thus was born with their heritage. In singapore, I am glad I have the opportunity to learn about Chinese, language and culture to be more of a chinese. At the same time,  as a Singaporean, my life with the different races here in Singapore add on to my heritage as a singaporean. This chinese singaporean heritage will be passed on to my children...until such days when my descendents married indian or angmoh in Singapore and they cannot call them chinese anymore but only Singaporean, but if they migrate to another country, then they cannot call themselve Singaporean anymore, but they remain Chinese.<br><br>Just to share with you about my feeling, sorry a bit long winded.<br><br>have a good evening.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The people I really applaud are those who take their time to learn as many languages as they can, and use them proudly, even though these languages have no connexion (or was it connection? Same?) to their cultures at all. I believe there's this guy who have learnt almost FORTY(!) languages, most of which he had acquired before he was 20. Proficiently, too. And these languages are not just Indo-European alone. It is diversified. Talk about trying to beat the curse of Babel (or something).<br><br>There are people who can be blamed, but some cannot be, because they've never been exposed to that language when young, but we can't tell until they tell us so. But sadly, we as human beings would judge at first impression most of the time, though, so even truly innocent individuals are dragged into the water.<br><br>Anyway, if anyone's interested: Amongst linguists, they can't really decide if Hokkien, Cantonese, etc, should be classified as separate <span style="font-style: italic;">languages</span> or dialects. According to some, they should be languages because they're mutually unintelligible, but some stick to the dialect classification. I choose the latter, since the grammar, writing systems, etc, are the same. In fact, except for the slight differences in expression between the two countries, we might even call them different accents for the same Chinese words. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>WJTW</div>
