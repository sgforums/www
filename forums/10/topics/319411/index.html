                              the recent trial that involved you, LKY suggested that you “play by their
                              rules” and like JBJ get yourself out of bankruptcy by paying up the money.
                              Well, personally I hope that you do not fall into the trap. You cannot play by
                              rules that one party in a contest makes and hope to win. Like at the casino.
                              Gambling is a contest between the casino and the gambler. The casino makes the
                              rules. The gamblers lose.</span></strong></p>

                              casino will never make rules that give the advantage to the gamblers. That is a
                              given. The casino is also not honorable enough to come up with fair rules. The casino comes up
                              with rules to their advantage. Take the game blackjack, for example. LKY said
                              that his father was at one time a sucker for blackjack. When you play blackjack
                              with your friends, and if you bust and the “house” bust, it is a draw. At the casino, they change the rules to, you "hit" first and if you bust, you lose even if the casino subsequently busts when it is their turn to hit; an unfair rule that gives them the advantage. Unfair rules give them the advantage, in addition to the commissions that they take. The rules they make ensure that the
                              casino industry as a whole makes tens of billions of US dollars a year in both
                              USA and Macau.</span></strong></p>

                              you said to LKY, “One way that I can campaign is through the media; you control
                              it. One way that I can campaign is to get down to the street and talk to
                              voters; you arrest me. One way that I can campaign is through my party’s
                              newspapers; you sue me.”</span></strong></p>

                              you and bias towards themselves. If you do that, play by their rules, it makes
                              them look good. What you are doing now makes them look horribly dishonorable.
                              They are not honorable enough to implement rules that by international
                              standards are just and fair to all comers. They behave like the casino
                              operators in spirit but unlike the casino, they are like you and me, no more
                              and no less than every other Singaporean with rights guaranteed by the

                              but conducive for building “a democratic society”. They trample on people like
                              yourself using the rules that they have come up with for their advantage.</span></strong></p>

              <blockquote>
              <p><strong>By Dr Chee Soon Juan<br> Published in Straits Times forum page (Print edition), 30 May 08.</strong></p>
              <p>IF TUNKU Abdul Aziz is concerned about the integrity of Transparency
                      International-Malaysia (TIM), then he must be careful who he gives his
                      awards to (’Ex-KL Transparency Int’l head rejects Chee’s claim’,
                      yesterday).</p>
              <p>TIM’s website says that it depends on, among other things,
                      transparency, accountability, democracy, and respect for human rights
                      to ‘guide its work’.</p>
              <p>Then it gives the award to Mr Lee Kuan Yew who has imprisoned
                      opposition leaders without trial, closed down newspapers and
                      amalgamated them under Singapore Press Holdings, introduced unfair
                      election rules, and continues to disallow speaking in public areas and
                      peaceful protests.</p>
              <p>Mr Lee, when confronted with these facts, does not refute them.
                      Rather, he skirts the issue and says that without him and his style of
                      governance, Singapore would not have $300 billion in its reserves, that
                      the court would not have modern facilities, and I would not be living
                      in an HDB flat. The presumptuousness and disingenuousness aside, it is
                      clear that Mr Lee doesn’t deny that he is no practitioner of democracy.</p>
              <p>Reporters Without Borders ranks Singapore around 140th out of about 167 countries in world press freedom.</p>
              <p>Washington-based Freedom House rates Singapore’s press as ‘not free’
                      and states in its annual report that ‘Singapore citizens cannot
                      democratically change their government’.</p>
              <p>When I broached this matter with Tunku Aziz in a conference in Sao
                      Paulo, Brazil, he qualified that he didn’t give the award to Mr Lee for
                      his human rights record. This contradicts what is stated in TIM’s
                      website.</p>
              <p>How Mr Lee can be given an award for transparency and accountability
                      while ignoring his human- rights record, which includes crushing a free
                      press, is incomprehensible. When I approached Dr Peter Eigen of the
                      Berlin-based Transparency International (TI) at the same conference, he
                      said: ‘We had nothing to do with that (referring to Mr Lee’s award). It
                      was our Malaysia chapter that gave the award. We had nothing to do with
                      it.’</p>
              <p>When I pointed out that TI in Berlin had endorsed it, Dr Eigen
                      replied: ‘Everyone knows that Lee is no democrat. Talk to Tunku Abdul
                      Aziz about that. He leads the chapter in Malaysia. They are autonomous
                      as far as setting their own agenda.’</p>
              <p>The point I raised in court on this subject was that the process of
                      vetting the nominee is not made clear. The TIM website, despite its
                      name, does not make the award process transparent. How much Tunku Aziz
                      admires Mr Lee is not quite the point.</p>
              <p>The episode confirms my view that it is sad that Mr Lee will cite an
                      award whose process is not transparent and carries little weight in the
                      eyes of the international community.</p>

              <p><br>Yah, this keeps me wondering.... Is nation more important than his wife? Since he's got some "capable" ministers under him, can't he just ask any of the "capable" ministers to take over him at Moscow?</p>

              <p>Maybe on his mind, he's thinking.... "Since she's going to gone case liao... no point staying with her... face is more important and i need to hide from this saga for the moment.... anyway, i'm still alive and kicking...."</p>
