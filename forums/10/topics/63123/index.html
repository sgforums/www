In what way did that vote cause the situation (what situation BTW?) to get out of hand? Would the Singapore economy collapse because of the vote?<br><br>The only ones who claimed the pilots wanted to take industrial action are our overpaid ministers, who even came up with grand conspiracy theories of pilots trying to "sabotage our Air Hub reputation" and trying to "do Singapore in", and use it as a (pathetic) excuse to use the sledgehammer on an ant.<br><br>Or is that the reason for their obscene salaries? To dream up of non-existent threats?<br><br>Do we arrest people before they commit crimes?<br><br>Stop believing everything our do-no-wrong top ministerial talents say and judge the facts for ourselves.<br><br>Its such a pity that their scare-mongering, tale spinning and fact-twisting still work on a lot of minds too lazy or ignorant to check their facts before swallowing everything the MIW say.[/b]</blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Unfortunately, sugardaddy, if Singapore pride itself for its FIRST WORLD integrity, maturity, high moral standards, and other very complimentary standings, why do you think that the general feeling has been so negative amongst the Pilots (and most of the Airline Workers including Ground Staff) that they have been cheated in the last negotiations, when the announcement of $300 million PLUS profits came out for the last quarter, and so soon after the cuts have been made ?<br><br>Following the recent mass wage, retrenchment and CPF cuts, this general feeing of resentment has also been widespread throughout other industries and commercial sector, as was seen by the general expressions of discontentment by the sub-Union Leaders towards the Secretary-General of the NTUC at their pre-conference meeting.<br><br>Remember the weak televised protests, showing some sub-Union Leaders confronting and accusing the NTUC Secretary-General of only know how to 'cut, cut, cut' ?<br><br>While Singapore pride itself as a member of the FIRST WORLD, is this 'rough shod' manner of dealing with disgruntled workers the way to respond, using one's own position to fashion laws to suit one's own position ?<br><br>This is similar to some other Third World Countries, where the business tycoons are also Congressmen, who will legislate NEW Laws to protect their own interests, and suppressed the Worker's Rights to any FAIR hearings.<br><br>It was a surprise to learn that the Secretary-General of the NTUC is also a Member in the SIA Board of Directors, although it is no surprise that SIA has been created using funds 'from' Temasek Holdings, its resources managed by the GIC - and LKY is the Chairman of the GIC.<br><br>It looks like it is not only the Pilots who have SUPER egos, but quite a few characters APPOINTED to be Ministers and to the SIA Management.<br><br>It is an INTERNAL UNION matter, when the Union members passed a NO-CONFIDENCE vote on their Leaders, who did not represent the welfare of the Pilots accurately.<br><br>It is no business of anyone to step into their INTERNAL AFFAIR.<br><br>Yet, with regards to this McCrea case that is developing between the Legal System of Australia and Singapore, is this also First World behavior that an 'assured' sentence is pre-determined for the sake of smoothening the process of allowing the Australian system to release a Murder Suspect to Singapore to stand trial.<br><br>There are TWO dead persons, one is a Singaporean, murdered in Singapore, and yet our 'First World' Government will weakly respond in this manner to placate the demand from Australia - another First World Country.<br><br></div>

Thats where the Unions come in, to negotiate a middle-ground settlement that pleases both the employees they represent and satisfactory to management. By tilting the playing field more and more towards the management and emaciating the unions of their power thus ensuring that management almost always gets the bulk of decisions in its favour, you're only driving the employee resentment underground. Is there any wonder why Singapore and the Singaporean worker ranks very poorly in global employee satisfaction and productivity surveys?<br><br>As it is, the labour laws in Singapore are already very skewed towards management, and Singapore needed this recent shifting of the labour goalposts like it needed a bullet in the head.<br><br>As for lowering morale, morale at SIA is not exactly sky-high at the moment. Besides, by taking away more of the pilots privileges to choose their own representatives and the powers of those representatives to negotiate for those they represent, would it help morale?<br><br>If they wanted to mass resign, can the new law stop them? If anything I'd say it has pushed them nearer the exit door<br><br>Like i've asked in my previous post which Atobe has reposted, can you accuse, or punish someone for a crime that they MIGHT do, BEFORE they have done it? AND which they had NOT even threatened to do?<br><br>Give me a break, spare me the <span style="font-style: italic;">ad nauseum</span> repetition of the governments scare-mongering and worst case scenarios. It gets tiresome after a while, hearing them cry wolf one too many times already to justify their knee-jerk, ham-fisted and sledgehammer responses. Unless of course, one is too lazy and ignorant to judge and analyse the facts for themselves.<br><br>Your arguments hold as much water as a sieve.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A story which is really cliche.<br><br>Mr Tan runs a business selling plastic toys.<br>He hired managers Chan and Dick to help run the company.<br>The production line has five workers: Ah Beng, Ah Seng, Ah Huat, Muthu and Ali.<br><br>As the CEO, Mr Tan pays himself a million dollars a year.<br>His justification is: "without a good leader, the business will not be<br>successful; and you won't get a good leader if you're unwilling to pay for one."<br><br>Mr Tan has never worked in another company before.<br>Chan had won a government scholarship twenty years ago while Dick is an expatriate from America.<br><br>Mr Tan thinks very highly of them and pays them each half-a-million dollars a year. As an expatriate, Dick also gets housing, transport and relocation allowances amounting to a quarter of a million dollars a year.<br><br>The production workers each gets $1,500 a month with $300 going towards a retirement gratuity that the company would match dollar-for-dollar.<br><br>The business hasn't been going too well. In fact, business has been downright awful for the last few years.<br>Consumers seem to prefer the cheaper plastic toys from companies across the street.<br><br>Mr Tan is furious. "These consumers are a bunch of idiots," he said, "don't they know that the companies across the street are not managed by talents like Chan, Dick and myself?"<br><br>Mr Tan has always been deeply impressed by Chan and Dick.<br>Chan has the remarkable ability to use words like "synergy" and "paradigm shift" in every sentence. And Dick? Dick is white.<br><br>So Mr Tan got down to some serious discussions with Chan and Dick. After many hours of brain storming, they decided that they know what's wrong with the company.<br><br>"We don't have enough talents," Mr Tan declared, "we need to hire more scholars and white men." And he did. So now, there's Ang, who was Chan's best friend when they were in RI, and Brad, Dick's brother.<br><br>They are hired on the same terms as Chan and Dick. To reward themselves for coming up with this visionary strategy, Mr Tan<br>gave Chan, Dick and himself a 10% raise. With the raise and the hiring of two new management staff, Mr Tan figured<br>that he had to cut cost. So he laid off Ah Huat, who's about to retire and receive his retirement gratuity from the company.<br><br>The remaining four production workers now have to work 12 hours a day to cover for Ah Huat.<br>They didn't get any compensation for this extra work because Mr Tan told them that this is a difficult time for the company and all workers have to make some personal sacrifices.<br><br>"Luckily, we now have a world class management team and business will pick up in no time," Mr Tan proclaimed.<br><br>However, business hasn't picked up at all despite having a world class management team. On the contrary, business seems to have worsen quite a bit.<br><br>Mr Tan is now even more furious. He has no doubt that he and his management staff are world class. So the problem with the company must surely lie with the blue-collar workers like Ah Beng and his gang, who hardly have any paper qualifications and speak dialect and Singlish.<br><br>But just to be sure, he engaged the services of a management consultant firm to confirm his belief.<br><br>The management consultant cost Mr Tan an arm and a leg but he identified the problem: "Your labour cost is way too high.<br>Do you know that the average annual wage of your employees is more than $400,000? That's ten times the amount for the companies across the street."<br><br>"Ah ha! Just as I thought," Mr Tan congratulated himself on arriving at the same conclusion as a world class management consultant, "Ah Beng and his gang are overpaid."<br><br>So Mr Tan reduced the salary of his production workers to $1,000 a month and abolished the retirement gratuity scheme.<br><br>This story is totally fictional. So if any of the characters are people<br>that you know. it's PURELY coincidental..........</div>
