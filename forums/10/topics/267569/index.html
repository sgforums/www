I said that the top thinks us to be peasants and to do their bidding without question. I didn't say we were really technically peasants but the top regards us as peasants.<br><br>And can you quit stuffing your bloody head in the ground? How about explaining to me why we have a rubber stamp parliament? The fact that a rubber stamp parliament exists is an example of why the GOvt thinks us peasants. Why? It doesn't trust us "peasants" to exercise our right as citizens to vote for the "right people".
