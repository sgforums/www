              <h1>Parents sueing their children?</h1>
              <p>Tuesday, 29 September 2009, 12:43 pm</p>
              <p><strong>Source: <a href="http://theonlinecitizen.com/2009/09/parents-sueing-their-children/">http://theonlinecitizen.com/2009/09/parents-sueing-their-children/</a></strong></p>
              <p>I refer to the media report <a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/449852/1/.html">“172 file for parent maintenance in last 12 months” (CNA, Aug 19)</a>ut
                  the increase in applications to the Tribunal for the Maintenance of
                  Parents (TMP) by more than 70 per cent to 172 in the previous 12 months
                  to July, compared to an average of 100 in previous years.</p>
              <p>The number of enquires to the TMP has also increased to more than
                  160 in the first five months of the year, as well as the number of
                  unsuccessful applications to 16 in the past 12 months.</p>
              <p>One of the possible contributing factors to the increase, may be the
                  mis-match between the minimum age that parents can apply to the TMP and
                  the CPF annuity withdrawal age.</p>
              <p>When the TMP was implemented in 1995, I understand that the minimum
                  age for parents to apply was set at 60, to co-incide with the then CPF
                  annuity withdrawal age of 60.</p>
              <p>Now that the CPF annuity withdrawal age has been extended to 62, 63,
                  64, and eventually to 65 under CPF Life, parents who may have
                  difficulty obtaining gainful employment before their CPF annuity
                  withdrawal starts, may be more likely to apply from age 60.</p>
              <p>Therefore, I would like to suggest that the TMP minimum application age be aligned to the CPF annuity withdrawal age.</p>
              <p>After all, the TMP already has provision for parents below age 60
                  with a disability or illness preventing them from working, to apply.</p>
              <p>I would also like to suggest that the TMP takes into account any
                  expected future CPF payouts, in the mediation process, as well as the
                  order for maintenance.</p>
              <p>The current procedure for the children to apply for a review of the
                  maintenance order, may be difficult, as they may not have access to
                  information regarding their parent’s future CPF withdrawals.</p>
              <p>Another contributing factor that may increase the number of TMP
                  applications, may be the phasing out of the 50 per cent CPF withdrawal
                  rule. In this regard, from 2013, CPF account holders with less than
                  $203,000 ($161,000 CPF Minimum Sum plus $42,000 CPF Medisave Minimum
                  Sum, at their current estimated rate of increase), may only be able to
                  withdraw $5,000 at age 55.</p>
