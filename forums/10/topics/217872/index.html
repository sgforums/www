            <div class='col-md body'>SINGAPORE'S job creation rate continued to grow strongly in the third quarter of 2006, with all major sectors adding workers stemming from sustained economic expansion.<br><br>Preliminary estimates from the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) released on Tuesday show that employment grew by 41,600 in the third quarter, higher than the 28,500 gains in the same period last year.<br><br>The increase in employment also exceeds the 36,400 gains in the second quarter of 2006, the MOM said.<br><br>Cumulatively, employment in the first 9 months of 2006 rose by 123,100. This has already surpassed the 113,300 gains for the whole of 2005.<br><br>All major sectors added workers, with the bulk of the gains continuing to come from services (24,600). Employment rose in manufacturing (11,300), continuing the uptrend that started in late 2003.<br><br>Amid a pickup in building activities, construction increased its workforce (5,500) for the 7th consecutive quarter.<br><br>The seasonally-adjusted overall unemployment rate was 2.7 per cent in September 2006, a marked improvement from the 3.2 per cent a year ago.<br><br>It has also edged down slightly from the 2.8 per cent in June 2006.<br><br>Retrenchment figures went down. The MOM said preliminary findings from a survey of private sector establishments with at least 25 employees show a fall in retrenchment.<br><br>The number of people retrenched fell from 3,200 in the previous quarter to 2,300 workers in the third quarter of 2006 and 2,800 in the same quarter last year.<br><br>Manufacturing continued to form the bulk of the workers retrenched (1,800), reflecting the on-going restructuring in the electronics industry, the MOM said.<br><br>Another 500 of the workers laid off came from the services industries.<br><br>(Straits Times, 31 Oct)</div>
