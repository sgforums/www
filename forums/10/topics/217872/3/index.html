            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by oxford mushroom:<br><strong><br><br>Why do you think the Japanese economy has been in the doldrums for so long? Read this:<br><br>"Construction workers, with their traditional baggy trousers and cloth split-toed shoes, look increasingly anomalous in contemporary Japan. But there are still a lot of them Â— more than you'd think. [b]The construction industry employs 10% of Japan's workforce, twice the proportion in the U.S. </strong>And even though the construction market has shrunk since the peak of the speculative "Bubble Economy" of the late 1980s, the number of construction workers has gone up, to around 6.5 million recently compared with 5.9 million in 1990.<br><br>Why? Since the bubble burst, Tokyo's primary weapon to spur the economy has been round after round of public works spending. "After the bubble, Japan should have been scaling down this sector, but because of the stimulus packages, this sector kept growing," says political analyst Okazaki Shigenori of UBS Warburg Securities in Tokyo. "These people had to be kept employed, so they kept pouring money into public works."<br><br>They have to be kept employed for two reasons. <strong>One, there are a lot of them, and Japan has a skimpy social safety net for the jobless. Two, <span style="color: red;">the construction industry lies at the center of the LDP's political power base</span>. </strong>"We have to depend on the power of politicians to win contracts for public works projects," an executive of the Japan Federation of Construc-tion Contractors recently told the Japan Times. <span style="color: red;">"So we have supported [LDP members'] election campaigns."</span><br><br>......This symbiotic relationship carries two major demerits. Since <strong>these industries never faced unbridled market forces, they are inefficient Â— and falling further behind. In the 18 years to 1998, Japanese manufacturers raised their productivity 69%, while cutting costs 3.4%, says economist Murakami Naoki of BNP Paribas in Tokyo. But the construction industry raised its productivity just 7%, with costs rising 61%. </strong>"Productivity did not improve much in highly regulated industries such as construction, property and services," Murakami says. And that increases costs for the whole economy."<br><br>Japan is desperately trying to change these errant policies but it has been very difficult so far. As the President said in his speech, <span style="color: red;">we must avoid the mistake of welfarism as practised in some countries.</span><br><br>(http://www.asiaweek.com/asiaweek/magazine/nations/0,8782,101784,00.html)<br>[/b]</blockquote><span style="color: darkred;">This is sheer idiocy in linking <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>POLITICAL PORKBARREL BENEFITS</strong></span> to a selected sector of supporting electorate with <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>WELFARISM</strong></span> for the larger society.<br><br>Is <span style="font-style: italic;">POLITICAL WELFARISM</span> to a political support base equate to <span style="font-style: italic;">SOCIAL WELFARISM</span> to the larger community ?<br><br>Can the Japanese Economic Doldrum be so simplistically blamed on the continuous <span style="font-style: italic;">PUBLIC WORKS</span> sector to support a small group of POLITICAL SUPPORTERS to the LDP ?<br><br>It was recognised by many that the Japanese economic sufferings was due to its stubborn resistance to change - in its form and structure in the manner in which Government and Private Sector have been organised to meet with the global challenges that has continuously outstripped development in Japan.<br><br>From the following paper <span style="font-style: italic;"><a href="http://digitalcommons.libraries.columbia.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1030&amp;context=japan_occasional" rel="nofollow">"The History and Future of Japanese Management"</a></span> - it has revealed the historical philosophy of Japanese Corporation in the manner it relates its profit making objectives with its own responsibility towards society.<br><br>This guiding principle has solidly provided them the foundation of a structured and disciplined manner of conducting relationship between the organisation with external supporting organisations, between the management and its work force, between the corporation and its social responsibility to job creation, social stability, social wealth, and to the environment.<br><br>The Japanese had been bogged down by such principles which prevented them from restructuring their workforce by mass retrenchments - not only in the construction sector, but also in the white and blue collar administrative and manufacturing sectors.<br><br>The sybiotic relationships between corporations and financial sectors had raised many questions that resulted in financial crisis that finally required the Japanese Government to use the reserves to bail out large Japanese banks, which would otherwise have sunk.<br><br>The Japanese have shown that restructuring without pain, and with caring social resposibility towards its Citizens can work, as can be seen with the minimal lay off and a wide social security net to support those who have been most affected.<br><br>Can the Singapore Government learn from the Japanese Government about <span style="font-style: italic;">POSITIVE SOCIAL SUPPORT</span> and not simply depend on the worn out slogan of <span style="font-style: italic;">WELFARISM IS EVIL</span> ?<br><br>It is sheer idiocy when a PhD can simply jump on the bandwagon without any critical analytical thinking of the issues, and help to propagate to strengthen a false social and political premise.<br><br></span><br><br></div>
