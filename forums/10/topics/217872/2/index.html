Wonder how they survive? Go figure.</div></blockquote>Why do you think the Japanese economy has been in the doldrums for so long? Read this:<br><br>"Construction workers, with their traditional baggy trousers and cloth split-toed shoes, look increasingly anomalous in contemporary Japan. But there are still a lot of them Â— more than you'd think. <strong>The construction industry employs 10% of Japan's workforce, twice the proportion in the U.S. </strong>And even though the construction market has shrunk since the peak of the speculative "Bubble Economy" of the late 1980s, the number of construction workers has gone up, to around 6.5 million recently compared with 5.9 million in 1990.<br><br>Why? Since the bubble burst, Tokyo's primary weapon to spur the economy has been round after round of public works spending. "After the bubble, Japan should have been scaling down this sector, but because of the stimulus packages, this sector kept growing," says political analyst Okazaki Shigenori of UBS Warburg Securities in Tokyo. "These people had to be kept employed, so they kept pouring money into public works."<br><br>They have to be kept employed for two reasons. <strong>One, there are a lot of them, and Japan has a skimpy social safety net for the jobless. Two, the construction industry lies at the center of the LDP's political power base. </strong>"We have to depend on the power of politicians to win contracts for public works projects," an executive of the Japan Federation of Construc-tion Contractors recently told the Japan Times. "So we have supported [LDP members'] election campaigns."<br><br>......This symbiotic relationship carries two major demerits. Since <strong>these industries never faced unbridled market forces, they are inefficient Â— and falling further behind. In the 18 years to 1998, Japanese manufacturers raised their productivity 69%, while cutting costs 3.4%, says economist Murakami Naoki of BNP Paribas in Tokyo. But the construction industry raised its productivity just 7%, with costs rising 61%. </strong>"Productivity did not improve much in highly regulated industries such as construction, property and services," Murakami says. And that increases costs for the whole economy."<br><br>Japan is desperately trying to change these errant policies but it has been very difficult so far. As the President said in his speech, we must avoid the mistake of welfarism as practised in some countries.<br><br>(http://www.asiaweek.com/asiaweek/magazine/nations/0,8782,101784,00.html)<br><br></div>

What abt HDB to HDB?<br><br>HDB prices are steep already. Have u calculated how much u would have in your CPF by age 60 (if u dun buy HDB)? Assuming a certain pay and u have employment throughout.

If one is jobless, one can get a gov part-time job, or if one has small children to look after, or one is working on entrepreneuring projects and needs some little makan everyday to pass by, or one is getting old and needs a part-time job for a in-between employment, or one is retired but can still work, or...<br><br>So many good benefits. Am i constructive, before i raise a negative issue ?<br><br>Actually this topic requires political experts and social experts to debate whether it is practical or not, in order to convince me the society is good enuff currently, and it won't work.<br><br>Young enterpreneurs are for people from previleged backgrounds, as they can get good support for budding projects. Normal working adults are made to worked hard in the past, and the salary were quite good then. But now, for a who-heck-care-about-you salary ($1200 a month), not only a middle-age man has to work, he will be squeezed all out and become dry, and to work long hours or huge loads of work. And when a man looks for a part-time job, all employers in the society say, go fly kite. How to start an enterprenuership ?<br><br></div>
