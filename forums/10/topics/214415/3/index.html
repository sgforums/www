I don't know why some Singaporeans actually hunger for it.<br><br>It's really taking your money, give it to you for a while and you return it to them in the same month to pay the bills  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

It was intended to be used as a means to pull more money out from you. Once there is "progress" package, the prices of basic good will rise - electricity, taxi, medicines, transport and etc. Next the price of food will go up, then economy is 'better', employment is "up", tax will rise, gst will need adjustment, our great "leader" need a new property in Switzerland so their salary will increase, CPF contribution by employers might cut once again because singapore is not attracting enough investors but the price of JTC/office rentals are artificially booted up to ensure high profit for all the GLC to earn high profits.<br><br>Isn't this the way things are and will be?</div>
