            <div class='col-md body'><br>S'poreans 'not well-prepared for early retirement'<br><br>Most surveyed by AXA think their CPF savings are enough, but it may not be so<br><br>By Arthur Poon<br>Oct 10, 2006<br>The Straits Times<br><br>SINGAPOREANS have a clear idea about retirement - call it quits at 54 and enjoy a better living standard. Think again, says an insurance expert.<br>The unrealistic financial expectations of many people here were unearthed in a global survey of 10,000 people by insurer AXA.<br><br>Respondents were asked about the ideal retirement age, what plans they had made and if they expected a better standard of living after retirement.<br><br>The local findings, as outlined to a conference by Mr Richard Shermon, chief executive of AXA Life Insurance Singapore, showed a worrying disconnect with reality.<br><br>'There is a huge retirement funding gap in Singapore,' he said. 'People dream of an early and comfortable retirement, but they are not financially prepared (for it).'<br><br>Those dreams include retiring at an average age of just 54 - earlier than people of any other country - while one in four believe that their living standard will then improve.<br><br>And 90 per cent of Singaporeans think they are saving enough by contributing to the Central Provident Fund (CPF), Mr Shermon said, and almost half think their CPF will give them a monthly income equal to their last drawn pay.<br><br>The reality, he said, is that the minimum sum required in a CPF account will be $120,000 by 2013, but this will provide a meagre monthly payout of less than $1,000, assuming that one draws on it for more than 10 years.<br><br>Many people, such as sales executive Steven Chin, 54, and a father of three, are not sure about where they stand.<br><br>'I estimate my CPF savings will give me $1,500 to $2,000 a month after retirement, but I have never really done the sums,' said Mr Chin.<br><br>The need for people like Mr Chin to plan was addressed by the CPF Board's chief executive, Mr Liew Heng San, in the opening address yesterday.<br><br>He told the conference organised by the Singapore Actuarial Society that the ageing population poses vital challenges. He also expects financial support for the elderly from family members to shrink.<br><br>'There might be a value change in that elderly parents may now be more reluctant to rely on their children for financial support. With more working overseas, we can also expect family support to become more fragile,' he said.<br><br>CPF has in the past focused on helping members accumulate savings but not given enough thought to how the savings should be disbursed post- retirement, he admitted. An area that CPF is studying is a bigger role for annuities, and how these products can be better designed for the Asian market.<br><br>Mr Liew urged members to defer CPF payouts if they are financially able to do so. 'For every one year that they postpone payouts, they can extend it by two more years'.<br><br>The reason: Members with only the minimum sum will have just 20 years of payouts if they start getting them at 62.<br><br>arthurp@sph.com.sg<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Funding gap<br><br>Ninety per cent of Singaporeans surveyed think they are saving enough by contributing to the CPF. Almost half think their CPF will give them a monthly income equal to their last drawn pay.<br><br>The reality, says AXA?s Mr Shermon, is that the CPF minimum sum will be $120,000 by 2013, but this will provide a meagre monthly payout of less than $1,000, assuming one draws on it for more than 10 years.</div>

Inconclusive knowledge of one's personal financial assets and requirements<br>3. Too much reliance on govt<br><br>Anyone who has observed the past and present market conditions will know that CPF alone is insufficient to sustain the post-retirement era. Recently, CPF closed off the loophole that permitted voluntary top-ups over and above your 20% monthly contributions. That was disappointing because it removed our chance to take advantage of the highest interest rate in town to maintain our kitty. The downside being it could not be touch till post 55yrs.<br><br>I am not convinced that insurance companies are a good avenue to invest our monies as the interest rates usually span several years and seldom accurately takes into account inflation and other depreciation aspects.<br><br>Coupled by the fact that most insurance agents (financial planners) are not FA trained, you take the huge risk of placing your trust in them.</div>
