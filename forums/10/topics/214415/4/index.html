It's a bad decision and many have lost their savings. It's a stop-gap decision and a bad one; knowing most citizen (who doesn't have investment knowledge) will be taking out their money because they weren't able to earlier.<br><br>Since our dear government has been using our money for overseas investment (although they don't admit it). Why not make it official and give citizens a  choice to invest in Singapore Inc. That way, Temasek will be really held accountable for their investment and CPF will have to pay a higher interest rate.<br><br><blockquote><br>2) Medical care - what is this account good for, better medical care, more economical healthcare service or promoting bioscience R&amp;D or providing business funds for such manufacturing ?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"><br></blockquote>The root of the problem is medical cost.

Whether or not our views are heeded, we continue to bombard them with our negative sentiments towards current policies governing CPF, and other policies as well, to hopefully effect at least some degree of adjustments or amendments, to allow individuals their reserved avenue of self-salvation or preservation.<br><br>Our gov's policy in this matter, is very obviously self-serving. If they DO NOT want to take care of its people in their old age, at least allow people to take care of themselves with their own money now, so that they can still be healthy enough to work when they are old.
