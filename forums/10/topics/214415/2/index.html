Don't think of upgrading.<br>Try to cut cost to the max u can. The more u expect the faster u die, stress ourself and supply govt with ton of $$, they will not say thank you!</div></blockquote>my advice for families of all income levels is :<br><br>watch the situation and look far ahead. however, never forget to look down on your feet and watch to make sure that you have one step on a ladder before you progress to another rung. insurance can play a significant role in medical bills coverage...u just have to buy the righ ones from the right people or right organization. i think those medi-shield variants deductable from our medisave account are the fist we should look for. you will not make a profit outta it, but it should be enough to cover bills in critical situations.<br><br>forget about those endowment or savings plan..unless u start young or from a baby it will not make much of a difference. invest your money elsewhere.</div>
