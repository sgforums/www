              <h1>State media’s continued silence on sensitive issues will erode its credibility further</h1>
              <p><strong>By Fang Zhi Yuan</strong></p>
              <p>When news broke out that Singapore’s Sovereign Wealth Fund, Temasek
              Holdings have lost S$58 billion dollars of its investment portfolio
              last year, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>one would expect many serious questions to be asked in the
              press. There were none.</strong></span></p>
              <p>More disappointingly, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>the extent of GIC’s loss was not published in
              the English papers either while it was revealed by U.S. news agency Dow
              Jones that GIC may have lost an estimated amount of S$50 billion
              dollars.</strong></span></p>
              <p>Few Singaporeans would have bade an eyelid 20 years ago at the gross
              discrepancy between what was reported by the mainstream and foreign
              media. Now, readers are spoilt for choice. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>They will simply source for
              whatever information which was not published by the press on the
              internet where local bloggers are more than willing to serve them their
              own dose of propaganda.</strong></span></p>
              <p>The mainstream media risks losing credibility in the eyes of the
              public if it continues to adhere strictly to its <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>anachronistic policy
              of self-censoring news of national importance such as the catastrophic
              losses suffered by our SWFs.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>As Singaporeans become increasingly exposed to diversity of views
              offered by the alternative media, the blatant one-sideness and
              prejudices of the state media will not be lost upon them. </strong></span>Though there
              may not be a visible drop in readership in the near future, the
              influence it exerted over a more astute, discerning and informed
              population will be diluted.</p>
              <p>Two recent reports highlight the growing threat the new media pose
              to a traditional media which has yet to catch up with the times: a
              Straits Times report on Singapore being the most wired nation in the
              world and in a recent study conducted by marketing agency OgilvyOne
              Asia Pacific, more than one in two Singaporeans said they trust blogs
              as much as newspapers or TV news bulletins.</p>
              <p>In spite of the state media’s frequent exhortations to the public to
              take what was written on blogs with a pinch of salt, more Singaporeans
              are finding the reverse to be true. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Where there is a vacuum of
              information from the officialdom, myths, half-truths and rumors will
              move in naturally to fill its place, thereby becoming the new
              (distorted) truth.</strong></span></p>
              <p>The best way for the mainstream media and the government to counter
              these endless speculations is to be forthcoming in the release of
              information to the public. The more reticent it is, the more it will be
              perceived as having something to hide.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The mainstream media’s refusal to speak out on critical issues of
              national importance will inevitably breed cynicism, resentment and
              contempt for its news coverage amongst Singaporeans, promoting
              the growth of an adversarial blogosphere which has become
              disproportionately anti-establishment to counter the official
              propaganda in recent times.</strong></span></p>
              <p>Had the mainstream media allowed more space and flexibility for
              dissenting views contrary to the government to be expressed in the
              public domain, the great political divide between the new and the old
              media would be narrower instead of growing apart as of present.</p>
              <p>It makes little sense to conceal information from the public in this
              day and age where it can be easily obtained elsewhere by a simple click
              of the mouse. Nor will internet ramblings be confined strictly within
              cyberspace as long the press carries no reports on it.</p>
              <p>In a wired world without any frontiers, the influence of the new
              media can reach even those who do not surf the internet via word of
              mouth, brochures and VCDs.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> The state media will only make itself look
              stupid if it chooses to ignore the voices of the people on the ground
              at the expense of serving the vested interests of the government.</strong></span></p>
