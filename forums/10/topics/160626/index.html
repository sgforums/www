            <div class='col-md body'>Singapore media fears Koizumi's new cabinet will worsen Asia ties<br><br>Tuesday, November 1, 2005 at 15:17 JST<br>SINGAPORE Â— Singapore's media expressed concern Tuesday that Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi's appointment of hard-liners in his new Cabinet will increase tension between Japan and its Asian neighbors.<br><br>"Koizumi names hawks to Cabinet in reshuffle," blared a headline in Singapore's leading newspaper, The Straits Times. "Hard-liners likely to spell more tension in Japan's relations with its neighbors," the subheadline said. The state-run television news channel, Channel NewsAsia, aired the same concern in its news about Monday's reshuffle, saying "analysts say this will probably spell more tension with its Asian neighbors."</div>

They were made to pay for the costs of the war they started, I would do the same to whoever started the war in my territory, wouldnÂ’t you?<br>and the treaty provided for the German military forces to be severely limited, for fear of future German aggression, logical?<br><br>Germany was partitioned? or given up German colonies and loss of territories Germany annexed or conquered in the relatively recent past? Check the history.<br><br>It was a compromising treaty and the great depression of the early thirties that gave rise to German nationalism and nazism, and the rise of Hitler to power, and WW2 in Europe.<br><br>The question, is whether the German then were aware of the destruction and death they inflicted on their neighbors? They had thought that the treaty brought poverty to them but forgot that they were defeated otherwise it would be their neighbors who would suffer.<br><br>The allied forces did a complete job in WW2, GermanÂ’s war making machines were totally and completely destroyed, all war criminals were caught, tried and sentenced even long after the war ended. Do we see a threat from Germany today, as the strongest n most powerful EU nation?<br><br>Can we say the same thing about Japan? Obviously not. The war criminals trials were not complete as the American needed bases in Japan to counter the rise of communism in China and Korea. Today, top Japanese war criminals in WW2 were respected as war heros, textbooks are being changed to paint Japan as victim of the war, Â…Â…<br><br>Young Japanese who have traveled outside of Japan might know what their ancestor did during WW2, tears rolled from the eyes of two of my lady colleagues from Japan when I told them that, on a combined business trip in shanghai. I donÂ’t blame the young generation of Japanese but with the ignorance of the young japanese and apathy (or ignorance) of the young Singapore on the Japanese atrocity in WW2, things will be forgotten. Then come a great depression, stock market melt downÂ…Â…history repeats itself, by we would then be forced to learn, and it might be necessary to wipe out all the aggressive elements totally, but thenÂ….we need to talk about human rights!!<br><br>This is old story, discussed many times, any better understanding? hmm.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br></div>
