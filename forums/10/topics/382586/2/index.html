              <p>Change is often exciting. A belief of a better tomorrow, a better life for all, from the humdrums of daily living. Mankind are often creatures of habit and find their own existance within a protected shell known as his comfort zone, and yet some would become bored, to seek change for the sake of change based on his perception and beliefs, rousing others to his crusade of change.</p>
              <p>For every berlin wall torn down, there is another tale of walls being erected.</p>
              <p>The China monarchy was abandoned and Sun Yat Sin thought a new era was borned. He was wrong, and could not withstand even the japs from gobbling Manchuria. Warlords ruled and the common citizens lives were no better, only worse.</p>
              <p>Along came an idealistic concept of rule under commie Mao, who maneuvered his position capably and kicked out Warlord Chiang and ruled China. Yet for all the idealism the commie promised, millions of lives were lost.</p>
              <p>Similarly, hunger for change, the french bravely stormed the Bastille and remove the head of the sun king, yet they only recieved Napolean the dictator who wrecked havoc in Europe, with the french paying the price.</p>
              <p>Equally hungry for change, the <strong>Bolsheviks</strong> removed the Tsar, and had to be contented with Stalin and being murdered by him.</p>
              <p>The Zimbabwe africans remove the colonial whites and ended up with Mugabe.</p>
              <p>The lists goes on with 'change'. And here in Singapore, does anyone wants to contend with the Outlaw, with his followers - unconstitutional beasts and denial of freedoms type animals whom smearing others who disagree with them is second nature, possibly murder when power is gain as evidently seen by their rapacity for mind control presently?</p>
              <p>You readers be the judge, and it is hope that all are aware that change can only occur at a pace when citizens are prepared and ready for it so that none gets left behind, and not forced upon or manipulated by others.</p>

              <p>Who decides what is the national identity we want ? And what happens if i don't agree with that identity ? What is the definition of nation building?  How often are those terms used so that one man could incite a group to oppress another?</p>
              <p>Just because we have a common agreement on what the problem is does not mean we would have the same ideas on what the solution is.</p>
              <p>angel3070 have no interest in creating a national identity, he has already decided what that identity should be.</p>
              <p>The change you mention takes place after the collapse of the Soviet Union and it collapsed under its own weight, it has nothing to do with the will of the people or what they wanted. It was decided by the powerful autocrats who decided they could profit and enjoy so much more by being capitalists than communists.</p>
              <p>The collapse was already decided in Moscow before the satellite nations would have even dared to make a peep.</p>
              <p>Have i ever said i did not want the PAP gone? But how many times have an oppressive presence removed itself only for another to take advantage of the power vaccum to seize power? How easily would the wrong man take power singing the slogans of "National Identity" and "Nation Building", regardless of the vocal minority who disagrees with him?</p>
              <p>LKY is not an exception in the annals of history, he is not an alien anamoly that somehow seized power and could manipulate the people to dance his tune. There are dozens more eager to do or say anything to enjoy the same taste of power the moment he is gone.</p>
              <p>Those, are who i am worried about.  </p>

              <p>If he cannot guarantee a LKY clone to repeat his success, time is running short for LKY to build a sound legacy that will not allow any single individual or instituion to rule unquestioningly supreme, and to rule by fear.</p>

              <p><br>As i said many time already, Singaporeans are comfort zone seekers, once their social status and economy is stable and life goes on happily, they dun mind the political arena to remain under one rule, at least they can see a light at the end of the tunnel, that is they at least get a glimpse of the future, as for Change, it is a risk, and as comfort zone seekers, they hate risk.</p>

              <p>Who decides what is the national identity we want ? And what happens if i don't agree with that identity ? What is the definition of nation building?  How often are those terms used so that one man could incite a group to oppress another?</p>
              <p>Just because we have a common agreement on what the problem is does not mean we would have the same ideas on what the solution is.</p>
              <p>angel3070 have no interest in creating a national identity, he has already decided what that identity should be.</p>
              <p>The change you mention takes place after the collapse of the Soviet Union and it collapsed under its own weight, it has nothing to do with the will of the people or what they wanted. It was decided by the powerful autocrats who decided they could profit and enjoy so much more by being capitalists than communists.</p>
              <p>The collapse was already decided in Moscow before the satellite nations would have even dared to make a peep.</p>
              <p>Have i ever said i did not want the PAP gone? But how many times have an oppressive presence removed itself only for another to take advantage of the power vaccum to seize power? How easily would the wrong man take power singing the slogans of "National Identity" and "Nation Building", regardless of the vocal minority who disagrees with him?</p>
              <p>LKY is not an exception in the annals of history, he is not an alien anamoly that somehow seized power and could manipulate the people to dance his tune. There are dozens more eager to do or say anything to enjoy the same taste of power the moment he is gone.</p>

              <p>i am not absolutely sure if i understood what you meant by the government tie-ing the notion of nation-building to our ethnic culture. that's a square peg in a round hole.</p>

              <p>One thing i notice about democractic countries in our immediate region is that the better performing ones are those that are more ethnically and culturally concentrated (Japan, Korea, Thailand and Taiwan)</p>
              <p>Malaysia may be a functional democracy but the racial and ethnic differences are resulting in paralysis of decision making and establishing common concensus ( their minister encouraging speaking of Malay because he feared the loss of ethnic identity? I guess he never asked the Chinese and Indians on their opinion.)</p>
              <p>The Philipines and Indonesia have the same problem as well. Religious and ethnic violence still rages on.</p>
              <p>You can argue that America is an exception but how long did it took for them since Independence to enact the Equal Rights Amendment? How much blacks had to suffer under the oppression (One can even argue that they're not really equal now either) The American Indians are devastated as a race now. And are the majority whites immigrants really that different? They share the same religion after all and they had two centuries to sort themselves out.  </p>
              <p>The Chinese have a saying é�žæˆ‘æ—�é¡ž, å…¶å¿ƒå¿…ç•°. </p>
              <p>Translated it means if you're not my race, you're going to think differently. It's not as racist as it sounds, neither does it hint of any racial superiority or inferiority. It just means that if i'm born of a particular race i'm going to grow up with different values and piorities in life than that of another race.</p>
              <p>In every day life it's not really an issue, i live my way and do not interfere or comment on the lives of Malays and Indians. But it's different under democracy, which is a system that favours the one that would incite hatred and dissent based on those differences and attempt to draw politically correct lines seperating the groups.</p>
              <p>Cocky as we may be that Chinese are the majority in Singapore, we are a minority in a region that's not shy about their dislike for Chinese. We needed someone then that weren't part of the major races and LKY fitted the profile(a Chinese he is not).</p>
              <p>We are slowly progressing towards a country where people viewed themselves as Singaporean first (hell, i find the news report that an Indian Nsman was beaten up by a Chinese, Malay and Indian hilariously progressive).</p>
              <p>A culture and national identity will eventually form whether we like the end results or not, we're a country that still have plenty of people who were adults at Independence when they start passing on the barriers between the races will start to fall. It should not and cannot be done because some hack uses it as a ticket to get more votes</p>

Of these, an average of 46,300 applications were successful which translates to two successful applications out of every three.<br><br>MM Lee said earlier that all applications are carefully vetted so that “highly qualified” foreigners will become PRs.<br><br>However, some of the new PRs include beauticians, language teachers, clinic assistants and administrative personnel who are not quite considered “qualified” as exemplified by the case of Chinese national Zhang Yuanyuan who got her PR in only 2 months while working as a Chinese teacher in a private school.<br><br>In his reply to Mr Chiam See Tong’s question about the number of PR applications received, granted and PR statuses renounced, Mr Wong said that PR applications have been increasing steadily in recent years.<br><br>At the same time, about 2,200 PRs renounce their status each year.<br><br>He did not reveal the reasons behind these PRs leaving Singapore and whether they have made any profits from the sale of their properties if any.<br><br>Mr Wong also reassured Singaporeans that the inflow of immigrants will be “managed” to ensure that Singaporeans benefit in the long term.<br><br>“We’ll manage the inflow of immigrants, taking into account how quickly our society can absorb and integrate these new immigrants without diluting our national identity or weakening our social cohesion. Such a sustained and calibrated inflow of immigrants would ensure that Singaporeans benefit from immigration in the long term,” he said.<br><br>As of June this year, there were 1.253 million non-residents, but only 533,000 PRs. In total, foreigners now make up 36 per cent of Singapore’s population, up from 14 per cent in 1990.<br><br>The new immigrants tend to mix among themselves and there are signs that ethnic enclaves are emerging in Singapore in estates like Geylang and Jalan Besar.<br><br>Dr Vivian Balakrishnan added that it was government policy to ensure there were no ethnic ghettoes in Singapore.<br><br>Immigration has become a hot topic in Singapore with many senior leaders speaking out on it over the last few weeks.<br><br>An online furore over Chinese national and Singapore PR Zhang Yuanyuan proclaiming her loyalty to China on TV was even reported in The Economist. (read article here)<br><br>Despite concerns on the ground at the direction and viability of Singapore’s liberal immigration policy to import foreigners en masse to make up for the population shortfall here, the ruling party is adamant that there will be no wholesale changes to it.<br><br>A $10-million Community Integration Fund was unveiled two months ago to make the newcomers feel “welcomed” in Singapore at the expense of local taxpayers.<br><br>The ruling party is also busy courting the new citizens and PRs to join grassroots organizations like RCs and CCCs.<br><br>According to a shocking revelation by Dr Vivian, there were about 4,500 new citizens serving in grassroots organizations.<br><br>With elections around the corner, the ruling party is posturing to safeguard the interests of Singaporeans in order to placate rising frustration and tension among the voters.<br><br>Citizens enjoy few additional benefits than PRs other than slightly higher subsidies in public housing and healthcare.<br><br>While all Singapore males have to serve two years of mandatory National Service followed by another 13 years or so of reservist, new citizens and PRs do not have to do so.<br><br>The relentless influx of foreigners into Singapore has forced some Singaporeans to seek work opportunities overseas leading to a brain drain for the island state.<br><br>About 180,000 Singaporeans are studying, living or working overseas with 1,000 renouncing their citizenships every year.<br><br>Despite the desperate attempts of the ruling party to attract qualified immigrants to relocate to Singapore, few are biting the bait due to the few social welfare benefits afforded by the government and the repressive political climate here.<br><br>A Gallup poll in July this year revealed that the top three immigration destinations for Chinese college students are U.S.A, France and South Korea. Singapore is not even featured in the top five. (read article here)<br><br>The majority of Chinese nationals in Singapore hail from the poorer inland provinces like Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Guangxi, Sichuan, Liaoning and Shanxi with few from the rich coastal cities like Shenzhen, Guangzhou, Beijing, Shanghai and Wuxi.<br><br>Source: The Temasek Review</div>

With this, Shah has become the only boy from Gujarat to have been awarded this scholarship. He will be leaving for Singapore on December 26, 2009.<br><br>Yash’s achievement comes as a surprise also because last year Yash’s sister, Nidhi Shah, had also been selected for a similar scholarship programme sponsored by the department of Education and Cultural Affairs, USA. She was one of the 40 scholars from India to have attained an academic year with full scholarship. “The fact that my sister went for a similar programme, did help,” admitted an excited Yash.<br><br>This prestigious programme spans 4 years, at the end of which Yash will receive the Singapore-Cambridge General Certificate of Education ‘Advanced’ (GCE ‘A’) Level (equivalent to STD 12) certificate. This means that he will be pursuing his studies from class IX to XII in Singapore.<br><br>Yash had been preparing for the scholarship programme for the past one and a half years and learnt about it from his school and newspaper. He believes that to achieve the scholarship one must perform well academically, have good command over English language and should easily adapt to changes or their surroundings.<br><br>This besides, he insisted that one must try to strike a balance between academics and extra curricular activities. Yash himself is a trained pianist from the Trinity College, London and Associated Board of Royal School of Music (ABRSN). He has been practising the instrument for the past six years along with preparing for several other exams.<br><br>“Normally, only students from Cambridge or IB Board are selected for this scholarship, and there are hardly any students from the state itself,” said Yash’s father while commenting on his son’s achievement. “I wish that awareness be created about this programme and students excel the same way as my son,” said his father with a sense of pride, adding that he would always support his son in his endeavours.<br><br>He further said that other children from the state must also apply for this programme and strive hard to achieve their goals. As for Yash, he believes one must never give up and advises students of his age to make the most of the opportunities they get.<br><br>What all will the scholarship cover<br><br>All travel cost, including the to and fro air fare and visa charges.<br>All tuition fees, lodging and boarding charges, exam fees<br>Settling-in allowance, medical benefits, accident insurance cover and monthly pocket money. – DNA<br><br>Source: The Temasek Review</div>
