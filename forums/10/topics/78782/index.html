            <div class='col-md body'><br>Annoyingly, the papers have again stated that Singaporeans are shying away from cleaning jobs. But as I see it, how could ANYONE survive on a $1,000.00 salary apart from the status of being a cleaner? Where's the logic?<br><br>A local person who has children can't even get by decently on a $1,500.00 salary, what on earth can $700 to $800 or $1,000 do??<br><br>Doesn't our media have any cow sense? I mean if the government reduced costs of living substantially enough, then perhaps such low salaries may be possible to live by.<br><br>Personally, even if they offer $3,000 and above, I'd still not want to take up such a job - I'd be wasting the money I spent "upgrading" myself.<br><br>When is the media and our government going to see that it isn't the image of such jobs, but survivability of such low salaries!!??<br><br></div>
