Union Chief a joke, 2 case PSA and SIA, he step down. <span style="color: green;">A Chief who dun really work and fight for the work force for the chief himself is oso working under another bigger chief, chief lee that is</span> why do ppl still join the union.<br><br>SIA a joke of the millennium. ppl sometime worry too much, when chief say he going to let those want to go to go, think abt it, who will loose out more? he going to get from other in the market, market where? other coy? how long will that going to take? immediate empolyment? how much he is going to pay the new group? if from other coy this group from SIA can fill up wat was empty as well? jus take it as playing musical chair lar.<br><br>Same like other story in Singapore when the power win and more rules enforce after math..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>U know last time i met an Indian cleaner who come n work in Singapore,we have abit chit chat with his broken english.I ask him why he want to work as a cleaner in Singapore.He told me that becoz the pay is high compare to his country n no friends n relatives know him working as a cleaner.Then i ask him again,if he was in India,with the pay standard in his country,will he work as a cleaner or not?His ans is NO!I ask him why,he say 1st his friends n relatives will look down on him,2ndly,the pay will be too low.It seem like ppl with the same thought is around the globe,not only Singapore.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think it sux...singaporeans can't even clean their own trash...They should make it a better paying job and force singaporeans to do it...but singaporeans won't because they are too spoilt to and can easily juz throw shitty jobs to people from other countries...exploitation...All these manual jobs should pay better lor I think at least enough for people to surivive comfortably. Other countries people can clean their own trash why singapore cannot...that's because other country the pay is good to clean trash! The companies should pay more since people don't want the job...not the other way round.</div>
