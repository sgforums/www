            <div class='col-md body'>Hi to all.<br><br>I'm really having dual thoughts about posting this...but...<br><br>I know that tis is very wrong(to speak ill of  the Government)but i really need to get tis off my chest.<br><br>I'm getting more &amp; more disillusioned with the future prospects of art students here in S********.The fact that art materials costs so much &amp; there is the constant need to replenish finished/used products have made me a very poor &amp; sad man.<br><br>I could not afford the time to work as i've so much assignments from lecturers that i feel so very very stressed.Yet,I'm really happy to do them esp. when i finish my work,the satisfaction &amp; joy it gives is way too good to describe.<br><br>Well,the Government did chip in by waiving the school fees and i really appreciate it,really. &amp; yes,they organise many art festivals to try &amp; turn our society arty farty.<br><br>Yes,they try to 'inject' art into our lives,into the lives of ordinary folks...<br>They willingly use $$ on all these exhibitions,which is good for the future of art in S********,but,I was really hoping that they would come up with some sort of a plan,a plan to help people like me,an art student.<br><br>The plan?It would be something of a financial  help from the Government to all students in tertiary levels(as tertiary art is way,way too costly).Perhaps some $$ into our bank accounts every month?<br><br>"Far fetched!!",I heard you cry out.But,I really hope that the Government would,in their own ways help out with students like me.<br><br>As for scholarships,too little of it...Mainly offered to students with good ACADEMIC results.ACADEMIC as in A'levels,blah blah blah.It's not really a wise choice too.I mean who would like to be bonded for some 4-6 years?I know i wouldn't mind...but...the organisation giving out the scholarship would mind.<br><br>More financial help from the Government would really be very much appreciated.Maybe the Government has their own ways &amp; means?Maybe help is on its way?Who knows?<br><br>Ask any art students &amp; u would get the same answer,"art is an expensive subject."<br><br>Dear people,I'm really grateful that you are patient enough to read what I have to offer.<br>I'm not directly naming the country as I fear for my own well-being,u know it's not good to speak ill of ur own Government,but,i'm only trying to address a problem faced by many art students.I could not turn to the papers...not to my MP...so...<br><br>Thank you to one &amp; all.Flamings &amp; degenerating postings are welcomed too...anyway,wat can i do about it?<br><br>Best Regards.<br>Stef</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree that Art in singapore is an expensive subject as i have friends who studied Art and they conplain incessantly about the high prices of materials,i think this is becos such items are specially imported and also the Arts scene is not really developed in Singapore although it is better than last time,here's hoping things get better,heeheh  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>------------------<br>When you were born, you were hungry and everyone around you was full.

            <div class='col-md body'>First of all, you should know in the first place before you take up any art related courses that it is indeed going to be expensive and should be prepared for it and not complain about it. Besides, the govt already subsidize some portion of the school fees. The materials are the ones that are expensive and you can't expect the govt to subsidize that as well because of the amount of wastage. Dun expect the govt to pay for waste. And if they were to subsizide that, won't people from the other industries complain how come they are not getting money for their stuff as well? Besides, the arts isn't the no.1 priority  of the govt, IT is and investing in IT also helps the country gain and helping the arts so much won't do them much good. SO before you start complaining so much, put yourself in the shoes of people in the other industries and think if it's fair to say what you say.</div>
