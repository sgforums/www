The patients probably lost medical benefits, ya. But the donors lost huge sums of money, stuff that could have been used to purchase other stuff such as food. I believe a large proportion of these donors to be heartlanders i.e. they are of the lower-income groups. Henceforth, NKF has done great economic/financial harm to these people. Not to mention if the donors are old folks, then they have had emotional harm done to them too, since they have been conned of money. Even the patients have been harmed; some emotionally, after having been forced to act "poor thing" on the NKF's national advertisements and being threatened with reduced treatment should they refuse to comply. (That is part of what the CAC was investigating FYI.) These patients need the kidney treatments; kidney treatments are not mere benefits for them.<br><br>So indeed much harm has been done.<br><br>the pikamaster</div></blockquote>If any donor or patient were to kill Durai, either for the great financial losses or to prevent further financial losses, he would still be guilty of murder, no matter how much he lost because of Durai.<br><br>If a person were to kill to prevent his own life being taken, he is likely to escape death penalty for act of self defence.<br><br>It is never justified to kill for money, but you can kill if your own life is threatened, such is the value of life.<br><br>to equate the harm done due to financial lossess to a life taken devalue the value of life.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br></div>
