I'm talking about mere understanding, not about appreciation of the concept.<br><br>2) I have simply no idea where the idea of respect for elders comes in to this issue, so I'll try my best to make an educated guess. If you claim abolishing the Death Penalty is being disrespectful to Elders since they support the retentionist side, (and besides how sure are you that they support it?) then this argument is flawed.
