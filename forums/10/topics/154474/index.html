            <div class='col-md body'>SYDNEY : Singaporean student Ram Tiwary will stand trial for the September 2003 murder of his two flatmates in Sydney.<br><br>The trial is expected to take place next year.<br><br>A Sydney court reached this decision after a nine-day preliminary hearing.<br><br>Twenty-eight-year-old Tiwary is accused of bludgeoning to death his Singaporean flatmates, 27-year-old Tan Poh Chuan and 26 year-old Tay Chow Lyang, in the flat they shared near the University of New South Wales.<br><br>On the final day, the court heard that Tiwary had fallen behind on his rent and was doing badly in school.<br><br>He had even passed off his girlfriend's university results as his own to the Singapore Armed Forces, for whom he worked.<br><br>The prosecutor also reminded the court that Tiwary had lied about his whereabouts on the day of the killings, telling his father he did not live at the flat in question, telling his friends that he had been out, and telling police that he had been sleeping.<br><br>The defence countered that the case against Tiwary was based largely on speculation, including rumours that the Singapore student had an argument with his flatmates over his delay in paying his share of the rent.<br><br>Tiwary's lawyer claims the student had access to his father's Diners Card, from which he could draw money.<br><br>Also many people had access to the flat -- there were at least 19 sets of unidentified finger prints found at the murder scene.<br><br>The Crown prosecutor John Cline argued that the evidence strongly suggested that Tiwary was the only person with the intent and inclination to kill his flatmates.<br><br>Tiwary's lawyer Chris Hogg, meanwhile, dismissed claims that Tiwary had taken a shower after the killings in order to remove blood from his body.<br><br>No trace of blood was found on any of the towels in the house.<br></div>

Then sentence is passed depending on the facts uncovered in the process, including the state of mind of the accused at the time of commiting the crime, the motive, is death resulted from reckless disregard for human life or excessive use of force, act of self defence..... and if the crime is a first degree murder, or a manslaughter.<br><br>Justice is done when the accused receives fair and just trial, and the necessary punishment.
