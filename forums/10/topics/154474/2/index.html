However, he had to give notice to his country and thus pikamonster was again sentenced to another seven years.<br><br>Seven years later, pikamonster killed Barry Lee.<br><br>Now for part II.<br><br>In country XYZ, there was never any death penalty.

But how do you measure the exact level of satisfaction gained?</blockquote>please provide evidence on the debunk-ing of utilitarian theory. as i've said, there are flaws to every single form of political control. you're merely making a regress argument. i can counter by claiming "that the psychological harm to the people who are directly involved with his hanging would be less than the potential harm to people, by potential perpetrators of the crime". as such, it's not wise of you to counteract an argument by your logic. utilitarian theory is present even in the theory of economics, which in case you didn't know, is taught universally and applied universally. if it has been debunked, academics are sure slow to react. please do not generalise.<br><br><blockquote>3) Then we should hang Durai.

BUT it provides a justification. you will not find a single justifcation for any law code, as such it boils down to the non-monolithicality of law.</div>

No difference when it boils down to your intelligence. I'll repeat it one last time, if you still don't get it, i'm afraid there's nothing much i can do. Law has its roots in philosophy; it evolved out of the need for greater expression of social consciousness and what is deemed right in morality. As such, law is not a homogenous concept in that it is rigid and uncompromising. On the contrary, law has proven to be otherwise. Your argument that we're following British law thus making our law monolithic is laughable. Law encompasses all variants of different law codes used in different countries. IN FACT, the difference in law in different countries show the ability of law to deviat in different circumstances to suit different needs. (Be it, philosophical or political.) Hence you're either arguing for the sake of arguing, or being very careless in your arguments.<br><br>2) No one is advocating the implementation of utilitarianism in all attributes of life. What i've merely said was to justify the existence of utilitarianism still in this world. Utilitarianism cannot be debunked but it can be criticised.  Nothing is perfect, and it would be incredibly naive to view utilitarianism as useless just because it has be criticised. We're taught economics in utilitarian terms for a simple reason: the world is too complex for us to make it more complex. We do not need grandiloquent philosophies which cannot be executed practically. Quixotic idealism cannot dominant one's thought. Hence, it is fair to say that most government in the world rely (i did not say sorely) or refer to utilitarianism at some point in their policies. Stupid you think? Pragmatic i'd say.<br><br>I would like to appeal to other forumners out there to evaluate the argument between me and pikamaster. It's better to have outside evaluation than to have anyone of us, in case he's mistaken, to believe the entirety of his argument. Thanks</div>

After all, police, judges and jury are all still human.<br><br>Regards,<br>the pikamaster</div></blockquote>3) The deterrent factor CANNOT BE DISREGARDED. No matter whether the person will repeat or not, he had committed a crime that had damaged enough lives. Hanging is not a solution, but a strong deterrent to make others not repeat another's actions. Can you tell me which deterrent can be more strong than death in any penalties in crime?<br><br>5) The definition in law for murder IS exclusively in many countries. The idea of murder is pre-planned. You should take up law to know about it. Of course I'm not blaming you for not knowing. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> Whatever the reason, it's wrong to kill right?

(My teacher then gave us a newspaper cutting) Can you tell me what roughly happened when there ain't a law to fix it?<br><br>10) Even a jury cannot be right. Let me just say one thing. No one, or nothing is 100% right, but we try to make do. The laws are not there because they are right, the laws are there because they protect the main interest of the majority of the people.
