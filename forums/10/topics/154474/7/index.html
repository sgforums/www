It is part of the democratic process to accommodate differing opinions. You have a right to convince Singaporeans that the death penalty is barbaric as I do to argue that it is just.<br><br>2. Without a referendum, we will never know. That is why such an argument is fruitless. You can never provide proof that the majority of Singaporeans are against the death penalty, whilst I will continue to point to the multitude baying for blood each time a heinous crime has been committed, such as the Huang Na case. Remember that even in staunchly catholic Philippines, they have re-instituted the death penalty for heinous crimes. By and large, I belive that Asian societies support it and I welcome a referendum to prove my point.<br><br>3. That's your view. In the balance between rights of the victim and rights of criminals, I am clearly in favour of the former. Amputating the limbs of a robber will certainly make it far more difficult for him to re-offend. The death penalty will certainly take the murderer out of circulation. And despite the arguments about the deterrent effect of the death penalty, what is clear is that imprisonment does not deter many criminals. The murder rate and other violent crimes are increasing by the day in liberal, western nations like the UK. I certainly do not want that.<br><br></div>

The court trial and judges or jury decision determine if the accused is guilty and what  punishment is necessary. If the religious court in Indonesia can declared a convicted terrorist "infidel" or whatever terms that make him a religious outcast, for killing innocent ppl, including those of the same religion, I am sure this will be much more effective than death penalty.
