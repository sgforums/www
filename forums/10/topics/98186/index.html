            <div class='col-md body'>Is that a real fact that Laws of parliament, disallow parties from seeking damages from the government in relation to losses by citizens? Didn't expect that. It still bothers me how the HSA got away from liability in the Slim 10 case.

            <div class='col-md body'>Nelstar, i have personally been educated in basic studies in canada and in Australia when i was n yr 12 and earlier. HOw many systems have u had the pleasure of seeing? The reason why i didn't want to answer u on that b4 was cos it is a sideline on the main discussion question. So how have u backed up on ur 99% of state laws.......? And why do want to have personal attacks here. Its an open discussion for all. The focus is on civil liability and and knowledge of civil rights. For ur information, basic law would cover common law and how it was created, basic criminal law and torts +contracts.<br><br>BUt i'm sure u already knew that. How has the wide jurisdiction of state laws impact on the individual. It covers sucha wide area, it is not necessary to know all. But it would be worth 2 cents more if u knew ur civil liability and what u can and cannot do in normal human and business interactions right?</div>

U have not put anything on the dinner table as of yet. If this forum is beneath u, u could always go somewhere else.<br>And u have not answered how knowing the state laws is of great use in a persons normal daily life. U enjoy innuendo and negative statements. BUt offer little. I ask questions in hope of finding ppl's opinions. I do not take an extreme side.
