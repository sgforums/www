            <div class='col-md body'>MINDCHAMPs has been using students who excel and important educators such as former RGS principal to endorse.I understand that they provide methods to study as oppse to rote learning but the fact is that it did not really goes into core contents of the subjects.From K1 to even varsity level the fee for each student ranges from $3000 to $6000 so exorbitant.My neighbours sent her son P6 and daughter sec 4 spending .$10k and yet no results.The p6 boy went for English course and emphasis on essay writing but fare badly in recent PSLE in 2007. The teachers did not even mark his practice papers even though they tried to teach him to write better.They instead asked the boy to bring back essay paper to be marked by his pte tutor.<br><br>What I understand is that the marketers they employed work like insurance agent.ie they're paid on comission basis..many of their marketers are   only out getting pple to sign up and they are paid very lucratively hence the bulk of the comissions account for the high fees charged $3000 to $6000.These marketers are paid and even be rewarded based on how many students signed up for the courses.My neighbours' students even remarked they love going there to play as co emphaise play to encourage learning but these 2 children p4 &amp; sec 4 obviously did not reap much benefits..luckily their parents can afford to splurge on them.Anyone can comment on MINDCHAMP <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>

              <p>bro, your nick sounds suspicious leh. anyway, congrats on your kid's good result, regardless.</p>
              <p>i think if the parents believe and the kids has the motivation to go thru' it, then so be it.</p>
              <p>it is not cheap. i certainly cannot afford for my kids, if i have any.</p>
              <p>the other often used methods is NLP. again, it has its detractors, but it does have good learning points if one takes to heart the teachings its preaches.</p>

That was 4 years ago. Because of MindChamps, he is now a scholar at NTU! I was so amazed at his transformation that I wanted to share my experience with other parents. And being an Education Success Coach allows me to do just that. I am passionate about what I do and really, you should consider approaching us if you feel your child needs help. </span></p>

              just out of curiosity out of average course fee of about $5000,yr comission is about $2500(50% right)? If true is indeed atrocious .recently my friend signed up and the instructors want to cut down on the scheduled no of lessons,wad's the logic/ after paying $,then resort to this tactic?
              
              many students joined and were inspired for the first few weeks only but as time passes all the lax,lazy attitudes creep back again,typical comments by most parents lamenting about the exorbitant charges after seeing their children back to square ones again.Those advertised to show phenomenal success including yr child are only a handful ones whose success are not necessarily due to MINDCHAMP's efforts or teachings.How is Adam Khoo's teaching techniques differ from yr MINDCHAMPS?

              <p>MINDCHAMPs has been using students who excel and important educators such as former RGS principal to endorse.I understand that they provide methods to study as oppse to rote learning but the fact is that it did not really goes into core contents of the subjects.From K1 to even varsity level the fee for each student ranges from $3000 to $6000 so exorbitant.My neighbours sent her son P6 and daughter sec 4 spending .$10k and yet no results.The p6 boy went for English course and emphasis on essay writing but fare badly in recent PSLE in 2007. The teachers did not even mark his practice papers even though they tried to teach him to write better.They instead asked the boy to bring back essay paper to be marked by his pte tutor.<br><br>What I understand is that the marketers they employed work like insurance agent.ie they're paid on comission basis..many of their marketers are only out getting pple to sign up and they are paid very lucratively hence the bulk of the comissions account for the high fees charged $3000 to $6000.These marketers are paid and even be rewarded based on how many students signed up for the courses.My neighbours' students even remarked they love going there to play as co emphaise play to encourage learning but these 2 children p4 &amp; sec 4 obviously did not reap much benefits..luckily their parents can afford to splurge on them.Anyone can comment on MINDCHAMP <img title="Razz" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz"> <img title="Razz" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz"> <img title="Razz" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz"></p>

              <p>let's put it this way. If Mindchamps, adam khoo, shicida and the likes will work wonder and are able to produce fantastic kids and outstanding students, then there is no need to have schools or teachers. Just send all the children to such courses and they will produce future leaders, scholars and millionaires ......</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Let's be realistic ... such motivation courses may work on some children but certainly not all.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Some S'pore schools have engaged them to coach the pupils and results are mixed.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Let's not be so guilible. Parents, teachers and the these coaches can only guide. The most important factor is the kid himself/herself want to change for the better.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Lastly, the companies employs marketing and branding strategies and we are enriching their pockets...... :)</p>
