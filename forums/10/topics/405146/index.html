              </div>
              <div class="art-PostContent">
              <p>Dear Madam Ho Geok Choo,</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.temasekreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Snap31.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-28100" title="Snap3" src="http://www.temasekreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Snap31.png" alt="Snap3" width="94" height="121"></a>It had came to my attention from the many gigantic posters in our neighbourhood around Boon Lay and Jurong West St 52 that you are our de facto Member of Parliament (MP). This was the only contact I had with you during your tenure as our MP, apart from the many other posters that your Grassroots had placed around our lift landing.</p>
              <p>As a residents staying at West Coast GRC, in which you are one of the MPs, I would like to ask you a few questions:</p>
              <p>(a) <strong>Why is it that you had never conducted any house visits at our constituency during your tenure as our MP?</strong></p>
              <p>This is so unlike one of your colleagues, Mr George Yeo, who had to juggle meeting with residents, going overseas for diplomatic reasons and keeping in touch with the citizens via Facebook, Twitter and other media platform. I really envy the residents in Hougang as their MP seemed to be more resident-oriented as opposed to you. Is it because West Coast GRC had been a walk-over which is why you believe that it would be a ‘walk in the park’ in the next election as well?</p>
              <p>(b) <strong>What have you done as our MP?</strong></p>
              <p>Considering that we had seldom seen you in our Constituency, it would be of great interest to the resident and myself to know the contribution that you had made for the residents in Boon Lay. Apart from the lift upgrading that was mooted before the last election, and painting works that are being carried out currently – possibly in light of the impending General Elections coming up – there are no tangible contribution from yourself to our estate. Carpark woes had always been a achilies heel for residents, but what had been done for us? There are also a large number of rodents in the estate but the problem seemed to go unnotice by yourself. Taking your paycheck into consideration, I would expect a better job from you as our MP.</p>
              <p>(c) <strong>Is the workload too much for you?</strong></p>
              <p>A check on the Internet reveals that apart from being a MP, you are also the Head for Singapore Human Resource Institute (SHRI) as well as Vice-President of the Women’s Wing in PAP. Can I suggest that you are probably more pre-occupied with the latter two roles as compared to your obligations as a MP which explains why you had neglected us all this while.</p>
              <p>As a resident at your constituency, I am utterly disappointed with your work as our MP. In addition, your Grassroots consist of selfish people who thinks of their own interest. At many Grassroots events, it is not hard to see all the Grassroots members laden with freebies and spreading it amongst themselves. Blatant misuse of the Resident’s Committee Office at 527 Jurong West Street 52 is also a common sight with your Grassroots members using it for their ‘gossip sessions’ – mocking at resident’s problems and even bragging about being a PAP member in which nothing would happen to them even if they do something wrong.</p>
              <p>I assure you that if nothing changes between now and the next election, you will lose a substantial amount of votes as many of those residing in the Jurong West Street area and Boon Lay Division is utterly pissed with your leadership in the Constituency.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Dear All,</p>
              <p>Can I add that it seems that Mdm Ho is relying on the posters to make her presence felt in the constituency. In fact, the only time that our constituency got our 1st House Visit in 12 years, it was Mr Kenneth Jeyaratnam and his Reform Party that appears at our door-step, even if it is for that 30 seconds.</p>
              <p>If I am not wrong, only Blk 520 – 536 is under Mdm Ho’s constituency whilst the remaining blocks are under Mr Lim Boon Heng, whom I had a brush with, and will write on it in the next few days.</p>
              <p>Perhaps Mdm Ho is relying on the fact that amongst the 16 blocks under her resides residents who are generally ‘traditional’ and had already been ‘brain-washed’ to vote for the PAP and not the opposition. However, there are the ‘grown-ups’ like myself and a sizeable portion who have seen enough and complain enough to be fed up with a MP like Mdm Ho.</p>
              <p>While MPs and Ministers like George Yeo are always present with their residents – no matter how ‘wayang’ it is – at least the effort is there.</p>
              <p>The recent World Cup screening at Jurong Spring CC was entirely run by the people from the Commuinity Centre and while to many MPs it makes good interaction time for them with their citizens, we do not see any MPs gracing the screening. Even Dr Amy Khor went to Gek Poh Ville CC on the opening night of the World Cup Screening.</p>
              <p>Hopefully the Reform Party would make Mdm Ho wake up from her long slumber and finally go to the root of the problems that people in her constituency are fretting about.</p>
              <p>Our fraustrations are building up over the past 12 years!</p>
