            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Master,<br><br>Nah, we need people for better job than handling out flyers. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>You mean you don't see any interest from Workers' Party to contest hotly in coming elections? I think you must be mistaken! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>I heard forumites (dunno whether they are from here or not) are complaining about Aljunied GRC using Town Council funds to put up MPs photos all over the place. Eventually, Aljunied GRC has to cover these big billboards up with some other posters... you know why they actually did that? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>If we are not actively giving pressures to those PAP incumbants in Aljunied GRC, do you think they ever bother to put up big billboards of their MPs' faces? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> And not to forget to mention the early Sunday morning coffee breakfast presence of the PAP MPs in the markets! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>We use our brains to work, not noise to work. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> If you ever bother to find out how much SUSTAINABLE preparations we have made since 2002, you won't make such comparisons! Workers' Party election preparations started long time ago! We don't need to make announcements like that, asking people to come forward as candidates, basically because we are already in the selection process. I think I am revealing too  much details here already. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> Neverthless, the most classic exclaimation we heard from residents when we do our house visit is :"Oh, now I know why my MP so hardworking nowadays!".<br><br>Maybe you are living some other places which deprive you the opportunity of meeting up with our candidates. But that doesn't mean we aren't giving it a good fight on the ground. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Goh Meng Seng<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Master -_-:</div><div class="quote_body">Recruiting people to hand out flyers?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Dun see any interest from your party though to contest hotly in the elections and rather to just act on spur reaction? unlike the elections where the<br>power houses like Gertrude De Gracia,Saraswathy Murugason,Seow Khee Leng,Lim Lye Soon and Gopalan Nair are around.</div></blockquote></div>
