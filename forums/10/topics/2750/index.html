            <div class='col-md body'>Looks like it's overdone and over reacting to the present situation, but it's understandable for US to flex its muscle after such a blow to its sovereignty. However, the rat's companions may be laughing in the jungle. So are they going to level the jungle and kill all the rats?<br><br>Objectively speaking, the missile shield, and even the latest of all the war machines are rendered obsolete overnight by the latest terrorist attack in the WTC. Just a simple knife could rack havoc as devastating as a inter-continental missile, and this is even more accurate! There was no misfire to any foreign embassies in New York City<br>or downtown Mahanttan!<br><br>There is big lesson to be learn from here for Singapore. Singaporeans should remain alert and remain humble at all time and always remind ourself that precaution is always better than cure!Do whatever we can to prevent a major castatrophe to happen, remember that even accident is man made, so why takes chances?</div>

Instead, sure, they have made americans more patriotic, they have made giliani the Time's Man of the Year, and other stupid redundant changes to this world.<br><br>and, guess u all didn't know this. A group of delegates from Malaysia went over to Afghanistan, and guess what they found out? The media spills shit and rubbish to all of us: making us think that the USA is helping the Afghans instead of destroying them. The first things they bombed were the schools, the hospitals, the public amenities and so on. Guess no one really know rite? Yah, the other day saw on CNN, AN American soldier was killed in the war. It was publicised so aggressively, and what happened to the publicity those thousands of afghans which were killed??? CNN didn't even show a glimpse of it. Only Al-jazeera did it.<br><br>so my fellow singaporeans, media like channelnewsasia, straits times and so on, these are tools of the garmen. They let u think wat they want u to think. Next time, don't believe every single thing they tell u on TV or the newspaper, take everything with a pinch of salt.<br><br>No killings should ever be justified. Humans made them justifiable, and let us not produce another generation of osamas and bushes, who justify killings to suit their idealisms. Sick!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>"The first rule of jungle warfare, eliminate the jungle."<br><br>I believe this needs some clarification.  What I meant by "eliminate the jungle", means rendering the conditions difficult for the enemy to hide in.  Making conditions to maximise firepower on the enemy without causing too much collateral damage.  It does not mean literally to flatten a jungle. Doh.<br><br>Eg.  When you need to sweep the floor, you need to switch off the fan or close windows first right?  Don't let the wind blow the dust all over the floor right?<br><br>PS: Not everything should be taken literally. =)</div>
