This is true vice versa, meaning that DBS Singapore will also gain credit if DBS Hong Kong is performing very well. It has adverse implications as it cast doubts on consumer confidence on the bank. Take it as a setback, admit the mistake, disclose the reasons for the blunder &amp; implement ways to tighten the procedures so that consumer confidence can be won over quickly, before we see the competitors start taking advantage of the situation.

Be pepared for biasd &amp; unfair comeptition in a hostile environment. Again , it can happen anyway in the world, be it Hong Kong, China, Vietnam &amp; even US. One  has to be extra vigilant, avoid the pitfalls &amp; learnt from the hardknocks &amp; prepare to fight harder than the locals. In fact, a good strategy is to engage the locals to run the business although the risks is also for them to play you out. But if you survive &amp; rise above the local competitors, then you emerge much bigger &amp; stronger. In the world of business, it is always Big Fish eat small Fish,  no good or bad fish.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
