              <p>Land is precious in Singapore and looking at the map. The KTM railway track cuts Singapore into half, running from the North Crossway in Woodlands to Tanjong Pagar in the South. Those high-end districts and many inconvenience caused to our Country's development, future and plannings.</p>

              <p>Hopefully they can solve this. If money is all they want, its least of our problem.</p>
              <p>Najib-Lee meet expected to resolve KTM land issue  <br>  <br>Mon, May 24, 2010<br>The Star/Asia News Network  <br>         <br>SINGAPORE: The retreat between Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak and his Singapore counterpart Lee Hsien Loong today is expected to pave the way for a resolution on the status of KTM Bhd land here.</p>
              <p>Malaysian officials are looking forward to a positive response from the Singapore leader on a Malaysian proposal for a new location for the KTM railway station in Tanjong Pagar.</p>
              <p>The KTM land issue has bogged down ties in the past with both sides playing hardball diplomacy and having their own interpretations of the Points of Agreement (POA) signed in 1990, on the terms of development and status of the KTM land that expands from Woodlands in the north to Tanjung Pagar in the south of Singapore.</p>
              <p>Under the POA, Malaysia and Singapore, among other things, agreed that the KTM railway station be moved from Tanjung Pagar to a location to be decided later.</p>
              <p>However, over the years, negotiations stalled after both sides failed to agree on where the new location should be in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Najib, who made his first official visit as Prime Minister a year ago, has made it clear to Singapore that he did not want old issues to drag on.</p>
              <p>Wisma Putra, in a statement, said Najib's visit provided an opportunity for both leaders to cement their personal ties and enhance the cordial relations between both sides. He and Lee will start with a four-eyed meeting before being joined by their Cabinet ministers.</p>
              <p>Najib is accompanied by Foreign Minister Datuk Seri Anifah Aman, International Trade and Industry Minister Datuk Seri Mustapa Mohamed, Transport Minister Datuk Seri Ong Tee Keat, Home Affairs Minister Datuk Seri Hishammuddin Tun Hussein, Minister in the Prime Minister's Department Tan Sri Nor Mohamed Yakcop and Johor Mentri Besar Datuk Ghani Othman.</p>
              <p>Malaysia is also looking south to invest in iconic projects, namely a wellness centre and mixed development township in Iskandar Malaysia.</p>
              <p>Najib and his wife Datin Seri Rosmah Mansor arrived here on Saturday. They paid their last respects to Singapore's former Deputy Prime Minister Dr Goh Keng Swee at Parliament House yesterday.</p>
              <p>Lee later hosted a dinner for Najib at the Glass Pavillion Resort on Sentosa Island.</p>

              <p>Singapore and Malaysia said on Monday they have resolved long-standing disputes over land and water that have plagued ties between the two neighbours for the past 20 years.</p>
              <p>Malaysia will relocate its railway station near Singapore's central business district to an area close to one of the two bridges linking the two countries, freeing up land in the city-state for redevelopment.</p>
              <p>Malaysia has sovereignty over the site on which the Tanjong Pagar station is located, as well as land on both sides of the railway tracks that run through Singapore, under agreements dating back to British colonial rule.<br>  <br>Singapore said in turn it would not seek to extend a water agreement dating back to 1961, which allowed the city-state to buy water from the southern Malaysian state of Johor at below-market rates. Singapore will also hand  over the waterworks it operates in Johor to the Malaysian state government when the current agreement lapses.</p>
              <p>The agreement between the two countries emerged after a meeting between Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak and Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.</p>
              <p>"It's a big breakthrough. It paves the way for closer ties now that long-standing sore points have finally been resolved,"'said Citigroup economist Kit Wei Zheng.</p>
              <p>The two countries said the Malayan Railway land will be developed by a joint venture between Malaysian sovereign wealth fund Khazanah, which will hold 60 percent, and Singapore state investor Temasek, which will own the balance 40 percent.</p>
              <p>Other agreements reached by the two countries include the building of a rapid transit link between Singapore and southern Malaysia, and the joint development of an "'iconic project"' in Malaysia's Iskandar region by the two countries.</p>
              <p>Malaysia has been promoting the Iskandar region, a showcase economic zone just north of Singapore, that it hopes can become a hinterland for its wealthy neighbour just as China's booming Shenzhen complements neighbouring Hong Kong. The zone has, however, attracted relatively few investments from Singapore.</p>
              <p>"The points of agreement would facilitate resolution of the issue which has been outstanding for more than 19 years," the two countries said in a joint statement.</p>
              <p>Well Done PAP Government - Thank You Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak, Our good neighbour.</p>
