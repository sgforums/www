              <p>I understand in university ranking, there is a consideration on the percentage of the student population.  Consequently our local universities, like Oxbridge and Ivy league universities, would like to seek some 20% foreign students.  As such, some times some foreign scholars could be inferior to local talents.  Besides, for spore case, I believe local student entry qualifications is very different from foreign countries' as they do not sit for GCE A exams.  As such, it is always difficult to ensure equal qualifications.   Any way, foreign scholars have a mitigating factor of need to acclimatise to local education system.  Am I right?  Even Harvard admits Bo GuaGua even though he did not really excel in Oxford as he had to extend his studies in Oxford for one year and still got admitted.  Is this an evident of this?</p>
              <p>If this is true then there could be a misunderstanding of NUS discriminating local talents over foreign students.  To get a good ranking for local universities, all local university students benefit.</p>

              <p>Hey Guys,</p>
              <p>I was just trying to suggest any university fighting for good ranking might have to admit foreign students that might be inferior to local students just like Havard in the case of Bo GuaGua.  This is because one of the ranking  assessment area is the ability of universities to attract foreign students.  It is not about govt trying to side with the foreigners over local talents.</p>

                  So what u say is that the more inferior the students, the better the university is.  Problem is that sg govt would prefer to offer to foreigner when the local can't even pay for the university study.  But of cos, nothing to complain since the majority of the singaporean agree with this.

              <p>As long as you have the money and qualifications to enter. You will get in regardless of age, religion, race and nationality.</p>
              <p>Just like any other universities in this world in Japan, Australia and etc, as long as you meet their qualifications to enter. You can apply and enter. </p>
              <p>The difference is SG government support the local students with subsidies. <br>For overseas students, they get tuition grant in exchange for a bond of 3 years-working in Singapore. <br>For scholars, they can apply for Asean scholarships or other scholarships with or without bonds.</p>
              <p>On the universities part, they will get the best students they can get. Singaporeans will just have to work harder to meet the international standards. Else, they have to go to Australia, SIM, or other private uni. </p>

                  I do agree on the point that "some foreign students to be inferior to some local students", however in singapore such foreign students will still get a full scholarship from sg govt whereas, the local students which results that are better are not entitle to it.  Better still if the family cannot pay for the fee and the local had to drop university.  I dun see how it benefit singaporean grads in this way.  Of cos if the foreigner is paying his own fee that your point might stand, but not when those inferior students are pay by sg govt.
