            <div class='col-md body'>i think  our singapore foreign ministry will be treated as 'chicken shit' in international media since this incident onwards. singapore foreign ministry has the guts to declare on china policy and warn that any indepedence drive would lead to war. why now dont have the guts to strongly request taiwan for an apology. when the taiwan foreign minister speak like that in the media press can we still treat it as a personal remarks? can we?<br>it will not be good if we keep quiet like a dead dog, it will only lead to other country using singapore as a scapegoat.<br>Taiwan foreign minister refuse to apologise and foreign ministry mention singapore foreign ministry did not protest.<br><br>in that case, i strongly request BG YEO next time stop be a hero and talk about china taiwan relations if you cant even uphold singapore integrity as being associated as " bi sai'</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>foreign minister Mr. Chen did not apologise and mention he will not apologise.<br>Mr. lu is only spokeperson for mr. chen. in today streats page 6 we can read tat foreign ministry of taiwan did not apologise officially and it because singapore never ask for one.<br><br>now taiwanese are trying to find fault with singaporean. first the tourist complain about singapore police force illegal treatment now the stupid foreign minister remarks. i wonder now, what the purpose of our PM visit to taiwan 2 months ago that causes china to be upset with us. now BG yeo make the comment at UN warning taiwan independence would lead to war and causes taiwan to lashes at us. i really feel like a pi sai now. seem like after NEW PM come in the first mistake was mishandling of china and taiwan issue.<br>i suggest we should just shut our mouth next time and talk less at UN meeting since we can even defend the pride of singapore.<br><br></div>

And in fact the current taiwanese government is the biggest balls carrier for yankees... they dun even dare breath hard when bush warn the current adminstration not to go over board wif their childish acts to provoke PRC. and when these yankees extort them in buying over priced hardware and weapons, PPP adminstrators asked taiwanese to give up bubble tea...<br><br>ROC overseas training enviroment ain't that good compared to australia. i suggest suspending all ROC training till KMT comes to power again. beside it's former taiwan's president KMT's Chiang Jing Kuo whom we should thank, not this bunch of inhuman lying PPP idiots.</div></blockquote>agree all above .<br></div>
