(me a singaporean working in Taiwan)<br><br>The comments and subsequent burning of the flag is a measured political move to divert attention from their domestic problems to the international front.<br><br>The comments is intentionally made to the press to impress of the southern taiwanese on the frustrations facing the pan green party... ie showing that they are working.  The media is in cohoot, as there are few of them there and they choose to deliver it out internationally.<br><br>Notice also that in the flag burning protest, there are only about a dozen ppl, ie, nuthead that are so completely brain-washed that they will do anything.<br><br>The commoner view is that it is not appopriate for their FM to comment so... and life goes on as usual.

This saga is clearly a political diversion of attention from the government and most Taiwanese, at least those I know, just ignore it. Whether singaporean take it as a joke or take it as an insult, to a certain extent, is a measure of political maturity.

Deng Xia Peng was a great leader to have brought about unity with HK and Macau through diplomatic solutions under "One country two system" policy.<br><br>Taiwanese perhaps should understand that to re-unify with the mainland is a victory historily and culturally and even economically. Only a weak leader appealing to sectoral interest will see this one-China policy as a negative policy. Taiwanese people should learn to see this larger perspective for themselves - reunification with mainland China is a positive not negative event. They should support this one-China policy which their own leadership cannot see. Clear thinking on this issue by Taiwanese is important Peace will come naturally if there is such clear thinking and acceptance of one_China policy. Other issues and terms of unifications are minor and can be settled from the larger perspective. In fact minor issues can always be resolved given some patience to work things out. After all HK was given 50 years to practise dealing and wheeling so why can't Taiwan ask for time of full unification like HK. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

History book has been carefully written probably under the influence of western historians. An independent movement in Taiwan will be full of problems for the Chinese themselves and overseas Chinese.  Any Chinese should be able to see this as a conflict of Chinese fighting Chinese. A diplomatic solution has been long in coming.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
