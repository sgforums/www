There was never a need to apologise to Taiwanese since Taiwanese are not insulted. </div></blockquote>Nope... " Taiwan FM says no plan to apologize to Singapore for 'booger' comment"<br><br>Wed Sep 29, 1:29 AM ET   Asia - AFP<br><br>TAIPEI (AFP) - Taiwan Foreign Minister Chen Tan-sun has said he has no plan to apologize to Singapore for derisively calling the small city-state "a country the size of a booger".<br><br>AFP/File Photo<br><br>Chen quickly replied "no" to reporters asking if he plans to extend an apology for his language.<br><br>Asked Wednesday whether ties would be damaged, he replied: "It has been taken care of."<br><br>Chen sparked an outcry Monday with his description. He was responding to a speech by Singapore Foreign Minister George Yeo at the UN General Assembly, cautioning Taiwan that an independence drive would lead to war with China.<br><br>"Even a country the size of a booger brazenly criticized Taiwan and former president Lee Teng-hui in the United Nations (news - web sites)," Chen said in the Taiwanese dialect.<br><br>"It was nothing but an effort to embrace China's 'balls', forgive me using such a word... What he said was to try to please China."<br><br>Taiwanese legislators criticised the remarks and Singapore called Chen's language intemperate.<br><br>"Many other countries also believe that Taiwan is pursuing a dangerous course towards independence," a Singapore statement said.<br><br>"Resort to intemperate language cannot assuage these concerns."<br><br>Taiwan's foreign ministry spokesman Michel Lu said Chen regretted that his comment had caused "uncomfortable feelings among some people".<br><br>"It's not an apology, since Singapore didn't protest or condemn it (Chen's comment). The minister has expressed his regrets," Lu said.<br><br>"Singapore understood the situation under which the comment was made after good communication between the two sides," he added.<br><br>Beijing views Taiwan as part of its territory awaiting reunification -- by force if necessary -- despite their split in 1949 after a civil war.<br><br>they are apologising to the 'cultured' taiwanese who were 'protesting' on our behalf or just to make the their foreign minister looks bad. Since our beloved foreign ministry did not protest against those degrading words used, they see no need to send apologies to singapore. I'm not asking our FM to start any war of words with these taiwanese, as it is a waste of time and tax money. however we should do something 'small' to make known our displeasure. anyway singaporeans should not demand his apologies in the first place, this idiot hate our govt. to the core, how sincere his apology will be?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Many people thought that our message made by PM Lee and George Yeo is to carry China's balls. To a certain extend, yes, it does make such effects but our voicing is targeted at USA, not China nor Taiwan.<br><br>When PM Lee says "We will not support Taiwan if the war broke off due to Taiwan's independence move", what he meant to say is that Singapore will not allow Uncle Sam to use our facilities here to support Taiwan's defence against China. That is the clear message we want to send to USA, not Taiwan or China.<br><br>Here again, we repeated similar thing in UN. The message is clear again, Singapore does not wish to get involved in the Taiwan if it is provoked by Taiwan's independence movement. However, I think George Yeo overdoes it.  There is no need to talk about Lee Teng Hui. If only he got the guts to speak out the truth, talk straight, Singapore is not going to allow US to use its base to support a war in Taiwan Straits. Simple, precise and sweet.<br><br>Of course I am furious at the snobbish remarks the Taiwan foreign minister has made. Regardless of size or strength, every member of UN has its rights to speak in this international forum of what its views are. Taiwan, technically speaking, is not even a recognised nation, not even a member of UN; it means that it is not even "up to par" to be comparable to a nation like Singapore. Why talk so loud and rude?<br><br>As far as we are concerned, we stand proud as an independent nation, despite the little size we have.<br><br>On the other hand, I think there is no necessity for George Yeo to engage in such speech. Diplomatically, it is considered as insensitive. We have already done one wrong. Two wrongs don't get one right.<br><br>Goh Meng Seng</div>

The nature of the comment was not made in an official capacity. It was made more of a private nature. I do see differences when it was made as a press release officially where it is an official statement versus a person making a personally statement. From Singapore newspaper it may look like an official statement, but the nature of this speech is that he made the comment  in a meeting with Tai Nan people which is then widely cover by the media. This can in no way represent the Taiwan government in anyway.<br><br>The only thing I can agree on this is that he is really the worst choice for a foreign affair minister. Also, I do agree Taiwan government sucks. Ah Bian sucks - one of the biggest asshole to hold an important position. The other one who sucks worst is Geogre Bush.</div>

The nature of the comment was not made in an official capacity. It was made more of a private nature. I do see differences when it was made as a press release officially where it is an official statement versus a person making a personally statement. From Singapore newspaper it may look like an official statement, but the nature of this speech is that he made the comment  in a meeting with Tai Nan people which is then widely cover by the media. This can in no way represent the Taiwan government in anyway.<br><br>The only thing I can agree on this is that he is really the worst choice for a foreign affair minister. Also, I do agree Taiwan government sucks. Ah Bian sucks - one of the biggest asshole to hold an important position. The other one who sucks worst is Geogre Bush. </div></blockquote>I dun see the comments as private statements. He was addressing pro independence representatives of tainan. It made it as 'official' as can be. i wouldn't give a damn if all these words came from the mouth of any legistrator of ROC, but  it was from the Foreign Minister Chen's CB mouth in which represent his govt and ROC officially.<br><br>I expect more insults to come our way if singapore govt did not do anything about it.<br><br>Imagine BG Yeo as a FM calling ROC a place for assholes and CBs during a meeting with his GRC grassroots leaders.</div>
