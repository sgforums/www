I hope there are no delays in approving land for projects or these projects will not get off the ground" Abdullah told civil servants at a dinner here last night.<br><br>At the same time, he said, it was important that the Federal agencies responsible for implementing these projects ensured they were not delayed or abandoned due to poor monitoring.<br><br>Earlier, speaking at the closing of the Perkampungan Hadhari at the Wakaf Mek Zainab, he called on the people to shed old attitudes and take part actively to make the 9MP a success.<br><br><strong>Abdullah said a top-class infrastructure would come to naught if the countryÂ’s human capital was not developed.</strong><br><br><strong>"Human capital development should not only be about giving knowledge but must also emphasise the development of morality and spiritual ideals," he said.</strong><br><br>The Prime Minister is on a two-day visit to Kelantan.

POLITICS and POLITICKING should be saved for elections, not during normal times. PROTESTS are not POLITICKING if they have some purpose which is to benefit the WELFARE of some people; WELFARE not POWER POSITION. PROTESTORS seek to be HEARD, not to RUN the government. Only REBELS and REVOLUTIONARIES seek to OVERTHROW a government in power. PROTESTORS will only become REBELS if their NATIONAl LEADERS do not lead. SO I wish Singapore well, and hope that we manage to engage all our PROTESTORS before they turn into REBELS and REVOLUTIONARIES under the lead of DOCTOR CHEE SOON JUAN and the SINGAPORE "DEMOCRATIC" PARTY.</div>

POLITICS and POLITICKING should be saved for elections, not during normal times. PROTESTS are not POLITICKING if they have some purpose which is to benefit the WELFARE of some people; WELFARE not POWER POSITION. PROTESTORS seek to be HEARD, not to RUN the government. Only REBELS and REVOLUTIONARIES seek to OVERTHROW a government in power. PROTESTORS will only become REBELS if their NATIONAl LEADERS do not lead. SO I wish Singapore well, and hope that we manage to engage all our PROTESTORS before they turn into REBELS and REVOLUTIONARIES under the lead of DOCTOR CHEE SOON JUAN and the SINGAPORE "DEMOCRATIC" PARTY.</div></blockquote>Very good point. Protesters generally only seek to be heard of their views since there is no avenue to express them through the press and other media being controlled by the government.<br><br>They may not seek to rebel or revolutionize just because they go to the street to protest against certain policies or problems caused so government should not jump to the conclusion that protests in such circumstances are disorderly or wrongful.<br><br>Government may be oversensitive or be the party at fault in the first place which causes the protest. It should differentiate the peaceful and similar non-revolution protests and not tar them with the same brush.<br><br>Government may be the party who has to change their attitude and policy towards protesters.<br><br>Now there is no such differentiation based on purpose or nature of protests. For example, if all wear brown to display their displeasure for banning Mr. Brown's column, should government regard such protest negatively when people are just expressing displeasure at unwarranted interferences with birth right of citizens to write opinions as they feel right to do so.<br><br>In the first place was the government even right in all its policies regarding press freedoms or curbing of free expressions.<br><br>Similarly when people wear T-shirt with elephants, are they out to overthrow the authority?<br><br>If government's wrong policies are not expressed by people, won't the pent-up situation lead eventually to instability and disorders. So finally when there is general disobedience, who will be the cause of such disobedience.<br><br>Should the ministers who refuse to change the wrongful curbs on freedoms of expression etc and suchlike policies be the real culprit who have caused the disorders and should such ministers be jailed if there is an outbreak of disorder.</div>
