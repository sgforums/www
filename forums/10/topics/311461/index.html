              <p>Im not sure he should indeed get punished, and so on. Besides, he has come up to apologize and taken a more active charge, I think it is something more than his duties or what is expected of him already. He is a minister after all.</p>

              <p>Meat Pao,</p>
              <p>I understand what you said. But look at the whole governing system as a whole. How many times big problems or mistakes by the top leaders occurred due to their kind of pushy autocratic system did the leaders really own up to their big mistake and take responsibility. From Hotel New World collapse to another Nicol Highway collapse, from NKF to Shin Corp squandering of people's monies for their own glory, did they ever admit mistake.</p>
              <p>If people are inflamed now by the Mas Selamat escape, they have their inner reason to feel inflamed. So we should not easily excuse the top of such mistakes as they have happened due to too much complacency and cover-up in the past with use of political legalistic power to ignore accountability to the people.</p>
              <p>If it is the private sector the chief who was paid millions would be thrown out by shareholders in the extraordinary general meeting if the board of directors try to give such excuses.</p>

              <p>If you look at the bigger picture, you should be questioning, why was a terrorist head put in a sub-standard detention centre instead of a well-guarded prison which give him the opportunity to escape? As the head of MHA, can WKS say he is not aware of this?</p>
              <p>Along with WKS's millions dollar salary are the additional responsibilities (if not, why are we paying him so much for?). Yet, when something like this happen, the blame goes only to the guard. What's the logic behind this?</p>

Someone better write to protest and change a head for MHA. While his care the prostitutes problem grew and now a JI leader escaped. And nowadays police attitude are getting worst no basic manners. Cilvl Defence officers are getting more ridiculers, they make their Junior Officers work like dogs so that they can get credit and promote I know this is nothing new in gov sector. Not being even able to have a proper meal when on duty and not even allowed to buy food from outside for those fireman or Paramedics. Because the citizen simply dont regard them as human because they just complain when they saw fireman or paramedics buying food. What they do not know is that there are no food canteen like the police in firestation even there are they are closed at night. But when the police happily buying food slowly walking no one complain or all....what is this? Ever wonder why does it took so long for police to arrvie at scene when someone call the police and ambulances or fire engines will be there withing 10mins depends on location. And there are only about 37 ambulances in singapore compared to thousands of police and hundreds of police cars. Petition.</p></div>

              <p>Im not sure he should indeed get punished, and so on. Besides, he has come up to apologize and taken a more active charge, I think it is something more than his duties or what is expected of him already. He is a minister after all.</p>
              <p>The ones at fault, I think, are the guards, and maybe the detention center head/ chief.</p>
              <p>I dont think a minister should be at fault for this.</p>
              <p>To me, all this WKS talk, is a little bit different. Something else is hidden under the surface. I think people just use this Mas Salamat case as a tool to throw something at him, because they dont like the 'PAP', or the 'powerful ministers' in general. So it seem like a little superfluous, and a little forced.</p>
