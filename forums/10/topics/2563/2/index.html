SAF will be able to carry out deep enemy rear sector intelligience coverage.... OR enable SAF to gather information ASAP....<br><br>A slow propeller UAV.... would take quite some time to reach a far away area of interest...<br><br>Furthermore... a slow UAV can still be detected by a ground base radar... having a high speed UAV would increase the survivalbility of a UAV that will increase its chances to reach deep behind enemy line...<br><br>Lastly.... a high speed UAV endurance can be increased with greater fuel capacity... and may not require to loiter for as long a time as a propeller based UAV....<br><br>Furthermore... it is my belief that in future time to come... UAV might be high on the list of targets by enemy SAM... to prevent lost of military secreats and initiatives...  to the enemy...<br><br>as such.. propeller driven plane with its slow speed... might not survive well in a real battle scenario.... although in peace time trainning... the idea of shooting down a UAV is a lunancy idea... but in war... an enemy force would have no qualms about shooting it down...</div>

A big UAV even in the size of Global Hawk is not easy to develop. Furthermore it will cost quite a fair bit. Even the US UCAV is going to cost somewhere 1/3 to 1/2 the price of an F-16. Can ST Aero ready afford to finance such a project? Assuming that this is one of their secret R&amp;D project.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Back to the original topic, I've heard that a group of F-16s from the Indiana Air National Guard has joined the Aussie Hornets here for the combined exercise. This makes it the 3rd Slingaroo exercise ever held and the 2nd invlving a ANG unit, after F-15s from the Louisiana ANG kicked off the first Slingaroo with 75 Sqn RAAF in 1998. Nice to see the ANG units with their colourful and interesting markings back, it was a real downer to see the Commando Slings scaled back during the Clinton years, now that they actually have a real president in the White House the Americans are warming to Singapore again</div>

Although it is cheaper and costs less (not considering the 'priceless' pilots!) but i think there is no situational awareness in AI! It would be like flying a MS Flight Sim more than an aircraft, and i guess that would mean any kid can fly a UCAV then.<br><br>The concept of having a UCAV(i think) is to be piloted by a ground crew to carry out the missions under the cover of a human piloted fighter.It is more of an asset than a replacement for the air fleet. I doubt you can replace human reflexes and experiences with just an AI. There are utimately just a machine with no 'brains'.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Does anyone know how's the pitch black exercise goes this year? Viper52, hear or read anything yet? Any pics so far? I haven't found any information from any magazines on the news agent magazine racks yet... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> sigh!!!!<br><br>Funny how this year, USAF did not participate in the exercise. Perhaps they are a little over stretched with their deployment in Afganistan, the gulf, Phillippines and in Bosnia, perhaps they are even preparing for another war against Iraq right now....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>JB, heres what I got from the AFM forum, I've not idea who Air Commodore Pietsch is but I would think some RAAF big shot. Additionally an Aussie contact I have said that this years Pitch Black is basicaly Amberley duking it out with Williamtown for control of airspace over Central NSW...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>----------------------------<br><br>PITCH BLACK 2002 from Air Commodore Pietsch<br><br>This is the first time that it's been held on the east coast for about 15 years. This year is a scaled down exercise. There's no US forces involved and there is no British forces involvement. The reason for that is of course, as we know, the real world activities are keeping many armed forces quite busy and Australia's no different. We don't have some of our forces with us this time, because some of them are deployed at the moment. The basis scenario for the exercise is really quite simple. We've got a strike force based her at Amberley and we've got a defending force at Williamtown. And the aim is to launch strike forces out of Amberley against targets, which will be defended by the Williamtown defenders. The expected outcome of the exercise is fairly straightforward. We're looking for improving or maintaining and developing between he Republic of Singapore Air Force and our forces. We're looking at improving the skill levels of aircrews and our fighter controllers. We've also got the army with their surface to air missiles out there training and out of it, we want to improve the preparedness of both of our forces.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I don't think Singapore will be able to afford the UCAV on a large scale basis to have any significant impact in its armed forces.  It would more likely use UAVs for recon etc.  Also, Singapore does require a large number of UAVs.  UAVs are lost or written off VERY easily.  Probably 'cos they're harder to control, especially if you lose contact with it, although current SIngapore UAVs are programmed to return on their own if contact is lost, but it is still very easy to lose a UAV.  Another reason is that very often, you need continuous info of your enemy/battlefield.  To do that, basically you need a large number of UAVs (some sending feedback, some on their way/returning, some on standby and some in maintenance)<br><br>also, I doubt it necessary for a supersonic UAV.  A UAV should be stealthy.   If the enemy find your UAV, you can say byebye to it already,  'cos most fighters today are supersonic and SAMs are even more so. (unless the enemy has yet to scramble planes and does not have SAMs aimed at you, which is highly unlikely once the UAV is found)  Once you're UAV is found in that sector, most likely you cannot put anymore UAVs around there because the enemy will be on their guard there, so the best option is still to be stealthy and not speedy.<br><br>A UAV also beats a satellite in that you need several satellies up just to ensure that you can give 24hr coverage of the enemy(at least 3 sats i think).  Otherwise, you'll only have info when the your sat is overhead the enemy.  A UAV is there when you need it.</div>
