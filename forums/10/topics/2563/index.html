I would not say that they would render the T91 impotent. However, it would be a good countermeasure against their MBTs.<br><br>Tripwire, 20 Apaches are barely enough to counter 72 MBTs. Don't forget that not all 20 birds will fly at any 1 time. If RSAF can keep the helos at 80 to 90% available for combat, that will be a major feat in itself. Furthermore, don't forget that attrition is definitely possible. I would propose that RSAF will need at least another 12 to 20 more (Not necessary to have all armed with the Mast mounted radar).<br><br>Go by the numbers...<br><br>Alternatively, RSAF can complement the Apaches with a less expensive attack helos like the EuroTigers, Roovialks or the AH-1Zs.<br><br></div>

BTW, 20 Chinooks is more than enuff in my opinion. As Chinooks will not be the only transport helo in RSAF inventory.<br><br>What r your thoughts Viper?<br></div>

Thats why they get invited for mulitilateral exercises with the US quite often. However I once heard from a US ANG personnel that they(the ANG guys) didn't know people could take that much beer and stay alive!<br><br>Same goes for our RSAF boys, if they're not good enough to provide high standard opposition for other pilots are Red Flag etc, they won't get invited back.<br><br>If you're lucky, the aussies may stay in Singapore for quite a while. They stayed for 3 exercises at least once, FPDA-ADEX, Churinga(RSAF-RAAF) and Slingaroo(RSAF-USAF-RAAF).</div>
