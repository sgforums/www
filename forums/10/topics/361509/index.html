              <p>When North Korea launches nuclear tests after nuclear tests

              statements like:<br> <br> "This is an abhorrent act"<br> <br> "What the North is doing is threatening all of humanity"<br> <br> "We urge North Korea to return to the 6-party talks in order not to
              further destabilise the entire region"<br> <br> "The country of Japan and the Japanese people will not tolerate
              this at all."<br> <br> "We urge the North to refrain from taking any actions which will
              deteriorate the situation".<br> <br> "North Korea is directly and recklessly challenging the
              international community."<br> <br> <br> When the Myanmar junta shot it's own people last Sept and recently
              when Aung San Suu Kyi was arrested for some lame reason which was
              not her doing, ASEAN and the world issued condemnation statements
              like:<br> <br> "These claims against Aung San Suu Kyi are outrageous" (Hilarious
              Rodham Clinton)<br> <br> "ASEAN, the regional club of nations, expressed "grave concern"
              over the trial and said "the honour and the credibility of the
              [Burmese government] are at stake."<br> <br> blah blah blah......<br> <br> <br> all these govt officials ever do is to make "condemnations", and
              then ALL-TALK-NO-ACTION.<br> <br> WTF?!<br> <br> and the US always threatens sanctions against Myanmar, and even if
              they carry it out, it will only harm the people way more than the

              statements of condemnation till end of eternity and they should
              have common sense to know that as long as no action is taken, such
              "condemnation" are USELESS!!<br> <br> How many hundreds of sentences of condemnation has our own local
              government issued to the press regarding such events?<br> <br> and in those tragic events, governments of the world love to use
              words like "We are deeply saddended and sorry for....." and "It is
              unfortunate to hear that...."<br> <br> My take is.....if no action is possible, then pls shut up and don't
