Hopefully, they will keep the road closures to a minimum, but if there is going to be a night race it will be more complex to set up and I can expect greater disruptions.<br><br></div>

Whatever above is your own perception!  The fact is people here knows what sort of crap you are.  So what is there for you to talk about others when we have been humiliated and treat with unkindness by you.  Like what I say, a person like you with bad character your words don't carry weight.
