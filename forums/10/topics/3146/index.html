            <div class='col-md body'>well, this kinda question, huh... some people may not like the way some people answer, but anyways.. regarding any questions, you gotta be 'transparent' right.. check things out in a non-biased way, and realistic.<br><br>Anyway, world... you make it sound so abstract... but if it refers to the whole world, yeah I guess that's fine.<br><br>You know, I honestly say that the world now possesses all these: corruptive governments, more wild and destructive nature with less consciousness, advanced technology, and of course, morally degraded.<br><br>Ok fine, it's bullshit if in the past eras there are no such points, all I can say is that through the history, it's getting worse and worse. I say morality, not cruetly. Cruetly is less of course, due to well, we're not that primitive anymore. But of course, some people in Indonesia actually don't seem to be very much different from the people in Qin dynasty. yep, except that now, they'd rather call it a 'religious war'.<br><br>Nonsense ok? Fanatics here n there, they go whatever their flow goes.<br><br>List you some contradictions:<br><br>Those suicdie bombers are promised to meet a lot of sexy n pretty goddesses in the heaven if they're gonna be 'martyrs'.<br><br>Found out yet? No? Come on! Think of it, going to heaven with some 'wordly' reasons, are u fit enuff to go to heaven?<br><br>Next, those Indonesian women are so crazed due to the September's incident that they support Afghan n everything. Yet they don't even know how ... ugly (personally) it is for the women who live in Afghan.<br><br>Ok, the world now is transparent and they are sick. What makes me sick even more is that because of this, they'll say: "Uh, yeah, I'm sick. So?"<br><br>Heh.. should I actually use my personaly comments.. or should I tell u the status of this world? It's very 'abstract' for some. Well, but the more u think of it, for me, the more I'll get pissed off.</div>

(view it as if nothing at all)<br>-Practice homosexuality and incest.<br>-Corrupted governments.<br>-No feelings for compassion<br>-Harbouring hates and angers.<br><br>Look at it, the world has turned into such a hostile place.
