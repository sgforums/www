            <div class='col-md body'>I have been living in Hong Kong, parts of mainland China for the past few years. Sad to say this but as far as freedom of speech and media liberty are concerned, Hong Kong is a few light years ahead of S'pore.<br><br>We may have a democratic system but yet our ruling govt seeks to control every facet of life to the point of rooting out any hint of dissent. All these are done in accordance with the law and of course the govt makes those laws.<br>Look at these articles:<br><br>http://www.singapore-window.org/sw01/011206au.htm<br><br>http://www.singapore-window.org/sw01/011124sf.htm<br><br>http://www.singapore-window.org/sw99/90501sc.htm<br><br>Speaking about economic performance, Hong Kong is also outperforming Singapore.<br><br>Singaporeans are the most indebted in the world and our wage except for public sector have been falling lower and lower since 1997 Asian Financial crisis. Our investment return is a miserable 1.4 - 4 % compared with 6% for Hongkong.<br><br>9 out of 10 businesses are struggling to keep the business surviving even as the GDP was supposed to grow by 6-10 % for 2004.<br><br>Unemployment and underemployment rate is still very high.<br><br>Hong Kong will always have the support of the mainland China. In fact China has been helping to boost HK economy. Beijing bought some of the excess properties, bad debts and has been sending her ppl to visit and shop in HK.<br><br>Lastly even if HongKong collapes, its people can always retreat back to the mainland. Many Hongkongers and Taiwanese are migrating to mainland China in large numbers.
