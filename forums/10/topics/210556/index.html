            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: darkred;">Besides swearing to the defend the Constitution, also included in the Oath of Allegiance is to obey the President of Singapore - (who so far has always been a PAPa's Man). If I am not mistaken, the pledge also require the swearing of allegiance to the Government of Singapore.<br><br>Did MM LKY make any admission that <span style="font-style: italic;">'Singapore needs a system'</span> ?<br><br>I would not count on any news report in the free handout of <span style="font-style: italic;">TODAY'</span>, which is a misnomer as it reports only <span style="font-style: italic;">'yesterday's news</span>.<br><br>In the large tabloid <span style="font-style: italic;">The Straits Times</span> - which one has to pay, not handed out free - its front page highlighted :<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>S'pore must preserve its system of govt: MM</strong></span><br><br>This statement is straight forward enough to mean that the <span style="font-style: italic;">'status quo'</span> shall be maintained till eternity.<br><br>The aritcle went further in reporting :</span><br><br><span style="color: blue;"><blockquote><br>"My ambition, having created this Singapore, is to preserve the system that produces the answers we must have as a society to survive," he said yesterday.<br><br>"MY hope is that there will be a government that is equal to the job, as the PAP was," said Mr Lee, referring to the ruling People's Action Party he co-founded in 1954.<br><br>"We have structured the system such that a competent group which gets in will find a machine that works. Don't tinker with it. Run the system properly on the basis of merit, not nepotism, and you will always find a way out of the problem."<br><br>"My ambition is not to preserve the PAP," he added.<br></blockquote></span><br><br><span style="color: darkred;">If the above is not an attempt to preserve the <span style="font-style: italic;">'Old Ways'</span> instead of evolving an institutional system that meets with the aspiration of the people in the 21st Century, what else can be more obvious.<br><br>Will a winning team - that creates the ground rules to ensure its monopolist susccessess, bother to change those ground rules to adapt to the current societal challenges ?<br><br>The last statement must be the best <span style="font-style: italic;">understatement of the Year'</span> - coming from LKY, and probably intended for the consumption of the delegates attending the IMF / World Bank conference.<br><br>Can we believe him in this seemingly altruistic statement ?<br><br><strong>Of some concern to all Singaporeans is MM LKY's insistence that</strong> : </span><br><span style="color: blue;"><blockquote><br>the problem with Singapore was that it had "now reached a very odd stage" - an electorate which wants the PAP in power, but also an opposition to "squeeze" the Government.<br><br>"Well, that's all right. But if they become the government, that's real trouble," he added.<br><br>"Our problem really is how to make the electorate sufficiently wise and sophisticated to understand that these are the limits."<br><br>Beyond the limits, he painted two dark paths: one, which would happen in the absence of the Elected President (EP) to protect the reserves from rogue regimes, is a military coup.<br><br>"Without the Elected President, if there's a freak result, <span style="color: red;"><strong>within two to three years the army would have to come in and stop it,</strong></span><span style="color: blue;">" he warned. "And once you break that, by military intervention, you have destroyed a system which works on the basis of who was voted into office."<br><br>Two, even with the EP,  a corrupt government can still bankrupt the country:<br><br>"Even with the Elected President, if they (the opposition) win a second time, the reserves are open, because they can then arrange for their president to be elected and the country comes to a grinding halt," he said.<br><br>He believes the present opposition parties, if they became the government, would cause Singapore to collapse.<br><br>"You have seen the candidates who have turned up. If they win, this place goes down. And nobody doubts it," he said.<br><br>He added: "The day we can produce an opposition of the same quality as us, that day we are in a safer condition."<br><br>The problem, he said is that the opposition, unlike the PAP, has been unable to "induce" people of top quality to join it.<br></span></blockquote></span><br><span style="color: darkred;">Is the truth now not made more obvious, in LKY's earlier efforts to ensure that the Heads of the Civil Services, Judiciary, SAF and Police Force will be constitutionally protected, and any <span style="font-style: italic;">new government of the day</span> - that is elected by the Citizens - will NOT have the authority to remove these persons from their position of authority.<br><br>Can these heads of the various civil and military groups stay neutral and commit themselves to their pledge of allegiance.<br><br>If ever the day comes when the PAP gets voted out of office, will it be prepared to relinquish power gracefully, or will it resort to the <span style="font-style: italic;">'scorch earth policy'</span> of Third World Politicians ?<br><br>This uncalled for remarks from MM LKY begs the question : if LKY intend for the PAP to utilise the SAF to create a <span style="font-style: italic;">'Coup de'tat</span> to regain political power, IF EVER the day comes, when Singaporeans decide that they have enough of the Lee's ?<br><br>The weakness of the Singapore system is quite obvious, as there is no clear institution that is <span style="font-style: italic;">'not perverted'</span> by the presence of a PAP person in the Civil Service, the SAF and the Police Force.<br><br>This present situation is caused by the PAP refusal to acknowledge that there are personalities, who are more capable than those whom they have recruited, and have largely declined participation in the political process.<br><br>Some who have decided to be involved and have decided to work with the opposition - to present themselves as the Alternatives Solution to the PAP - have been faced with abusively derogatory treatment from the PAP members, and with a mentor to lead them in the worst political behavior in the able LKY.<br><br>Is MM LKY justifying his position in the light of the <span style="font-style: italic;">big wigs</span> from the World Bank and IMF being in town ?<br><br>LKY's methods and history is familiar to those leading the World Bank and the IMF; and the most telling criticism was said by World Bank President Mr Wolfowitz - arising from the banning of the 27 Civil Society Activists :</span><br><span style="color: blue;"><blockquote><br>Singapore would have to decide whether to show it was "authoritarian' or "at the stage of success they have reached, they would do much better for themselves with a more visionary approach to the process".<br></blockquote></span><br><span style="color: darkred;">Put it in plain local English : "Either you are a Third World Authoritarian Country", or "if you claimed to have arrived as a member of the First World, then it will serve yourself well by taking part in the process as a  member of the First World". </span><br><br></div>

Instead based on conceptual approaches, government took the easy path of increasing fees and double charging on lands and infrastructures to increase burdens on the people.<br><br>As for the desirables like creating world products wanted by the world and creating brand names, what have they done? Has any one of our scholars got half the world-beating mind like Stanley Shih who from his graduation was concerned with producing products wanted by the world and brand names that sell the products.<br><br>There are many desirables like getting workers to excel in whatever they are doing as part of their daily works, but what have conceptual leadership done to produce the results?<br><br>Sooner or later when leaders will have to realise the shortcoming of conceptual leadership approach which does not produce any implementation system or excellence.<br><br>For years the government has been neglecting middle management and implementation excellence which the scholars no matter how brilliant have been unable to achieve.<br><br>I for one have pointed out the flaws in the leadership concepts of governance to the Feedback Unit and asked ministries to take practical actions to implemtn process management which will be more effective to cut costs and avoid double charging on lands thought out by scholars to get their easy way out.<br><br>It is not that the scholars are not good in their works but they need time and have to prove themselves in producing results and not be pushed up to occupy position of responsibility without half the efforts.<br><br>The economic restructuring plans for the past two decades have been largely identified in the form of projects like attracting value-adding industries and businesses but the scholars have yet to achieve a market positioning for our economic strategy and plans in this regard.<br><br>Sadly owing to the overzealous auto-piloting of leadership and elitism today we could hardly find a minister like Dr. Goh Keng Swee to give the economic restructuring the needed practical big push.<br><br>Every minister claims to be a talent but they would come and go without improving citizens' livelihood or upgrading of their economic competitiveness talked about for years.<br><br>Sooner or later the leaders will have to change such elitist conceptual leadership to one which is more practical, result-oriented hands-on process management as recommended to the leaders many times. (read www.managefranchise.blogspot.com and www.ospforohsopolite.blogspot.com)<br><br>Therefore MM Lee should have known that his conceptual leadership and meritocracy is too superficial an approach.<br><br>He needs to decentralize the governing system based on process management where every ministry and department will be properly delegated with responsibilities and targets and who will be held accountable for any lack of results.<br><br>He could not just talk about concepts like leadership or meritocracy any more.<br><br>On the larger perspective government is not about law and order but empowering of the masses in all their endeavours which up to now is hardly acknowledged.<br><br>f he wants to change to a system approach to complement his staunch leadership top down approach he will have to start getting people interested in social and cultural belonging and sharing to build up the whole system from scratch.<br><br>He will have to liberalise the controls and empower the masses so that they will respect the leaders who will care for them and treat them with a part to play instead of like a digit easily replaced by foreign talents of no particular definition in order to attain final efficiency and accountability and results.</div>

And some of his words, border on the unconstitutional and are quite unfair to fellow Singaporeans. He should be advocating on the unity of Singapore as a plus point for investors, instead, he paints such a bleak picture which anyone in academia or global finance, would understand to be alarmist in nature.<br><br>I am saddened by the words he chose to use regarding political change, where is the unity? I only see words that serve to accentuate the gulf.</div>
