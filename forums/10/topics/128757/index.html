If so i suggest that you lodge a complaint with the relevant depts. After all, those ppl being paid to provide a service and i do not think that being a twat is part of the job description. Further, those ppl are probably only a few paychecks away from bankruptcy themselves. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Can anyone remember former NMP CHia Shi Teck and chairman of Heshe Holdings? When he was declared bankrupt in 2003, he was shunned by many sectors of society. The Boy Scouts were supposed to honour him for the contributions he made to their movement, but when news of his bankruptcy broke, the ceremony was called off. A hush-hush event took the place of that. Later on, an Australian journalist called Backman made a joke of the whole issue.</div>
