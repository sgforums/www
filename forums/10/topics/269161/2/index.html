So when we see a person's actions and judge him on the basis of those actions, do we also see his accomplice edging him on by the side?  isn't he the more sinister of the two?<br><br>remember the murder case involving some Mr Ler who managed to convince some kid to commit murder on his behalf?  we cannot condone the kid who committed the murder, neither should we condone Mr Ler.<br><br>so while it is his and his decision alone to unveil himself, we must not forget that it was cai tao kuay who edged him on.</div>
