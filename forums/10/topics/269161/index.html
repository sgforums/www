            <div class='col-md body'>This is a TV discussion forum on Channel U.  Today's topic is about society's acceptance of ex-convicts.  I am very pissed with one of the two main panelists - Cai Shen Jiang.<br><br>At one point in the show, an ex-convict was speaking behind a veil about being reaccepted by those around him which gave him a lot of confidence about our society.  Cai Shen Jiang then questioned the veiled speaker why he is still speaking behind a veil if he truly has confidence with our society?  This prompted the ex-convict to unveil himself even though he had wanted to protect, not his own identity, but that of those around him.<br><br>This in my opinion is very irresponsible of Cai Shen Jiang.  He is like a smart aleck daring a poor boy to prove his bravery by jumping into the sea and swimming across the channel.  What if the poor boy drowns subsequently?  He can say the boy has himself to blame for trying to be someone that he isn't.  But isn't the smark aleck partially responsible for causing the boy's death?<br><br>In another instance, the discussion fell upon a comparison between Durai and Mediacorp artist Li Ming Shun.  A guest panelist opined that the former is more unforgivable than the latter because the former caused hurt to so many more people than the latter.  To this, Cai Shen Jiang asked whether there is any difference between killing many persons and killing just one person?<br><br>The stupid Cai Shen Jiang might as well have asked if there's any difference between raping one woman and raping many women.  Every rape counts as a separate offence and the penalties all add up don't they?<br><br>It's just that murder is so heinous, one is enough to send you to the gallows.  You can't hang a person 10 times for committing 10 murders can you?<br><br>Lastly, there was a telephone interview with a carwash businessman who employs ex-convicts.  In the course of the interview, Cai Shen Jiang accused the businessman of not being sincere enough and not doing enough to embrace ex-convicts.<br><br>Who can fault the businessman for helping ex-convicts?  Hasn't he done enough?  What has Cai Shen Jiang done to help ex-convicts?  Who is he to make such comments?</div>
