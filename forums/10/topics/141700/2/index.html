I will stop donating to NKF until the chief is removed. If NKF can pay $600,000 pay check, i dont think it needs my few dollars. imagine how many more people $600,000 can help instead of going to one person. All the lavish spending on golden tap and flying 1st class, I thought business class is already pushing the limit, not to mention 1st class.  :-|<br><br>how do I stop my donation every month......<br>to bad have called in to donate last week for the TV drive.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This is white collared crime in its highest level. Still remember donating religiously from my allowance since my Primary school days.<br><br>Till this feb when NKF came to our company for a health checkup under some volutary organisation, the volunteers still came to encourage us to leave our names to take charge of a collection card to canvass for donations. I am so 'impressed' at how NKF actually trains their staff to answer the questions assuring us that all the news about TT Durai (first class flights, high pay) and the difficulty in getting support from NKF were untrue... Shame on you!<br><br>And the most heinous thing is capitalising on man's conscience and emotions to donate to the organisation. All you donors out there, think carefully on all the artfully cheorographed NKF charity programs with very selected case studies about the various kidney patients whose life stories move you to tears. Plus, the many letters sent out of people with true life case stories to really move you to donate.<br><br>The directors and CEO in NKF are no more than <strong>theives</strong> and <strong>villians</strong> who rob from the people who should rightfully be allocated the money for treatment of their illnesses and instead spend them lavishly and mindlessly.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>its sad that such a charitable organisation back by public funds is motivated by profits. That CEO is just a simple case , if he can draw such a high salary , what abt the others ? those senior officers or CFO , COO ? think they will be drawing high salaries too. Its true that they are doing charitable deeds , but how much?<br><br>if i take 100 from u and give only 1 dollar to the needy n make that dollar giving glamorous , i can say i am doing gd work too, but what abt e 99dollars that goes to my pocket?<br><br>is there a need for a charitable organisation to be run by such means? now they have e cancer fund , its sick to know that it may be just another drive to earn more money! soon we will have all sorts of donations available for them to try to earn more money.<br><br>the 2 day fund raising show , earned abt 10million dollars. tt CEO draws 600,000. so simple maths show that 6 percent of it goes to him. What abt e salary of the others ????</div>

Still remember donating religiously from my allowance since my Primary school days.<br><br>Till this feb when NKF came to our company for a health checkup under some volutary organisation, the volunteers still came to encourage us to leave our names to take charge of a collection card to canvass for donations. I am so 'impressed' at how NKF actually trains their staff to answer the questions assuring us that all the news about TT Durai (first class flights, high pay) and the difficulty in getting support from NKF were untrue... Shame on you!<br><br>And the most heinous thing is capitalising on man's conscience and emotions to donate to the organisation. All you donors out there, think carefully on all the artfully cheorographed NKF charity programs with very selected case studies about the various kidney patients whose life stories move you to tears. Plus, the many letters sent out of people with true life case stories to really move you to donate.<br><br>The directors and CEO in NKF are no more than [b]theives</strong> and <strong>villians</strong> who rob from the people who should rightfully be allocated the money for treatment of their illnesses and instead spend them lavishly and mindlessly.<br><br>[/b]</blockquote> SO who help to raise all these fund..  The Media corp, VIP etc... worst still all those oversea celebraties.......   so we are not the only one kena conned .....  I sought some consolation here .....</div>
