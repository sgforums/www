            <div class='col-md body'>I cancelled mine last year (had donated 25 per month since 1996) got really pissed with them for the following reasons:-<br><br>1. Non Profit Org running like MNC<br>2. Non disclosure of mgt salaries (fat pay cheques and 1st class travel)<br>3. High profile NKF fund raising shows on TV (WIN condo, car, BIg $$$ strategy)<br>4. Harressment by tele marketers (till i lodged an official complaint)<br>5. Enrolled me in some "club" thingy, and sent tons of reports, letters and invitation cards in GOOD quality paper and cards. waste of $$$.<br>6. Annual report printed in colour<br>7. Huge reserves. Yes they need them but XX  millions?!?!!?!?<br>8. Arrogant behaviour: "We can raise more money, we got the brand name!!! attitude<br>9. Depriving other NGO of funds / donations<br>10. Partnership with mediacorp and singtel (always wonder how much are their cut)<br>11. Sueing reporter and SPH for spilling the beans  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>For those out there, please consider channelling your donations to other NGO or non profit org.
