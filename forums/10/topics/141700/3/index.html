            <div class='col-md body'>i guess NKF wants to 'steal' donator's money from other organisations. the same thing also happens to church nowadays. their motives: tap people's money to pay astronomical amount of salaries for their staff.<br><br>i think nkf shld not employ a not-so-highly experienced CEO that demands high salaries. nkf is, after all, an icon in singapore and donation won't dwindle so drastically because of poor management. this is not some kind of company that should retain their product's demand.<br><br>nkf will always receive donation as people see their honorable work. they need a CEO with passion for the people, not with power to negotiate higher wages.<br><br>as for now, since they have 30 years worth of reserves, they should also share some of the money to other charitable organisations.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Atobe:</div><div class="quote_body">With the NKF paying him this amount for his salary, does he expect a similar amount from the newly created NKF-Cancer 'foundation' too ?<br><br>Why did the Government allow NKF to set up a new charity fund for Cancer, when there already exist the Singapore Cancer Society and the Singapore Children Cancer Foundation ?<br><br>From the current court proceedings in this NKF - ST Court Saga, it is now revealed that there are no government guidelines, or requirements for the full disclosure of accounting of such foundations that are funded by public charity.<br><br></div></blockquote></div>

We did not give NKF money to buy expensive toilet fittings and give their heads huge  12-month bonuses. We gave the NKF our money so that other Singaporeans with kidney problems can benefit.<br><br>I will not deny that NKF has done a lot of good for a lot of people.<br><br>However, like it or not, this episode has severely dented the goodwill and charity of ordinary Singaporeans like you and I.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>he got 10-12 months bonus... did all the staff get that too?!?!?!<br><br>I have heard that to get NKF to help also not easy.. you must fulfil ALOT of criteria before you are eligible for the subsidies. SUBSIDY hor.. they don't help all the way.. $1 treatment, you pay 80 cents they pay 20cents only horz.<br>[How credible I cannot confirm, but I have long ago heard of this.]<br><br>Still, I continued to donate to them via giro. But this is the last straw.<br><br>I really question the Board Of Directors. For the CEO to live like that, the BOD must have given the go-ahead.</div>
