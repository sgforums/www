"No one will help you if you don't and we will not forgive or disregard anybody who came to Iraq. You didn't come to support the Iraqi people but to protect the Americans; your fate will be exactly the same as the Americans and others."<br><br>The Philippines removed its humanitarian troops a month early, a demand set by the abductors of Angelo de la Cruz, a 46-year-old Filipino truck driver.<br><br>"And for Arab and Muslim forces, we advise you not to obey if you are forced to be sent to Iraq and if you don't, then, the laden cars will be waiting for you and we will not stop."<br><br>Unification and Jihad claims Jordanian-born al-Zarqawi as its emir or leader. The network is suspected of many attacks against U.S.-led forces in Iraq.<br><br>The United States has raised the bounty on the head of al-Zarqawi from $10 million to $25 million.</div>
