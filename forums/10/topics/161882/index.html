If he delay a bit more, we will get a chance to move upwards.  He know there was no way malaysian leaders could manage singapore politicians.   Our politicians are getting more popular.<br><br>He shook us by suddenly chop as off.  Bye bye you are on your own.  so no more PAP threat.  he happy and relief and so does many BN.  He never think of the future legal problems he brought on us today.  But he won and rule happily.   A tiny island that live off the mainland.  sure to die sooner or later. sure to beg for help.<br><br>They soon carried on to win many elections in east and west.  THey kick us out but keep us international status as one of the state.  now not sure.<br><br>If not today, PAP HQ in singapore will still be tie with BN over running oil rich malaysia.  ANd we will still be living of the income of the oil rich malaysia, cheap petrol, corruption ,housing. pirated VCD, no need high rise flats.  life still goes on.<br><br>either way, people living in singapore will still survive just like penang, johore langkawi.  only different life style.  and the old causeway will be around for thousands of years,  low population, relax.  kampongs still around.<br><br>history may be different but we still live on.They kicking out make us think different and probably even facing more hardships.  Thats why many retire rent out hdb flat and live in malaysia to stretch retirement money longer.</div>

It is not even whether their national policies may or may be racial inclined.<br><br>In a globalised, integrated world with fast changing technology and hence way of life, it is whether the old WWII model of democracy, the doctrine of secular state and racial blind policies still work well.<br><br>The white Europeans may not openly or relunctant to admit being a superior race and their social policies may no longer have racial slang. But behind their culture and attitude, it is another thing altogether.<br><br>They still think that they can contribute to the world by taking in poor wretch black, brown, yellow etc and give them a better way life, by turning them (eventually if not immediately) into superior French, English, German gentlemen and ladies.<br><br>Time to take the blinkers off their eyes.</div>
