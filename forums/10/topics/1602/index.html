            <div class='col-md body'>Being a non-religious person i can understand why staunch muslim groups like PAS stay conservative and insists on certain islamic laws that seem extreme to outsiders.<br><br>In their own malaysian states, they have enforced their own distinctive islamic dress codes, possibly even adding separate male/female swimming pools to further strengthen these beliefs.<br><br>What i can't understand is why they have chosen to get involved in our domestic issues. And sadly, we have religious zealots like Zulfikar Mohamad Shariff who openly invite conservative parti members to visit parents of the tudung debacle and indirectly interfere with the local scene.<br><br>One can only question their motives as to their involvement into an otherwise local issue. This may be a religious and constitutional debate but it should not involve outsiders, in this case extremist political figures like PAS. This is a clear interference of our our domestic politics.<br><br>If Mr Zulifikar "has no political ambition and is only interested in removing the ban", then why has he involved PAS? Surely with such a "noble" agenda at heart, he would personally champion the cause, starting by getting the support of the local muslim population over the ban on tudungs?<br><br>Why then is his first action to invite PAS to become involved? They have sent their women and youth wing leaders to speak on the issue and urge local muslims to stand united and speak up against the ban. They have even raised the sum of RM$10,000/- in support of the families affected by the ban.<br><br>Yes. Zulfikar claims PAS came of their own accord thru no invitation of his yet he surely knew of the implications and repercussions of "entertaining" them as "guests". There is clearly no excuse for such action unless he has an ulterior motive.<br><br>If the money and support for the families was achieved by the local population, then it would surely be recognised as local support for the lifting of the ban, not to mention the importance this weighs on the minds of our local muslim community.<br><br>In this case, it only shows an outside political party and an individual chasing a personal agenda and ambition. Question marks will be raised as to the credibility of Mr Zulfikar to undermine the local muslim's unity by trying to divide them between taking possibly extreme action to oppose the ban, and adopting a gentlemanly approach to resolve the matter, as we have always done.<br><br>PAS shd be made persona non grata and politely asked to leave our borders before they create a serious problem to our nation's racial unity.<br><br>[This message has been edited by controversay (edited 24 May 2002).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The problem wif our society is that we've been a one party govt for way too long.<br><br>Hence when someone like zulfikar starts brewing unsubstantiated statements, it incites ppl and it's easy for some to believe him.<br><br>That's probably the only worry, however i'm confident ppl here are educated enuff to distinguish between lies and truths, right and wrong.<br><br>[This message has been edited by controversay (edited 07 June 2002).]</div>
