              <p>THE competition among countries for maids is getting hotter, and Singapore may be losing out.</p>
              <p>A Straits Times check with agencies revealed that maids from countries such as Indonesia and the Philippines now prefer to work in places like Hong Kong and Taiwan for the higher pay and a compulsory weekly day-off there.</p>
              <p>Singapore's mandatory English multiple- choice entry test on hygiene and housework and a rule that maids must be at least 23 years old also turn some away.</p>
              <p>
              
              The 20 agencies surveyed said the reduced inflow, especially of Indonesian maids, has led to suppliers charging up to $2,000 a maid, up from about $1,000 a year ago.</p>
              <p>The manager of a maid agency in Far East Plaza said: 'Sometimes, we can get only about five a month and the supplier charges about $1,600 per maid.'</p>
              <p>Indonesian and Sri Lankan maids are paid $280 a month and Filipinas, $300 to $350. In Hong Kong and Taiwan, maids earn about $690 and $750 respectively.</p>
              <p>There are currently about 170,000 foreign maids here, mostly from the Philippines, Indonesia and Sri Lanka.</p>
              <p>The higher pay overseas is making some maids working here jump ship. Take the case of Filipino maid Licia Magallon, 31, whose contract here ends in three months.</p>
              <p>'I'll go to Hong Kong. There the pay is double and I get time off every week and also on public holidays,' said Ms Magallon, who has been here for 20 months and earns about $320 a month.</p>
              <p>Singapore's lower wage has also led to a shortage of experienced maids. Director of Swift Arrows Maid Peter Loh said most maids who come here are first-timers.</p>
              <p>'They use Singapore as a stepping stone before going to Hong Kong and Taiwan. They also try to pick up some Chinese here to aid them in future,' he noted.</p>
              <p>His agency has also seen up to a 30 per cent drop in the number of Indonesian maids coming here since last year.</p>
              <p>To cope with the shortage, agencies are now hiring maids from Myanmar. They are paid $320.</p>
              <p>For Mr Loh, up to 30 per cent of his maids are now from that country. For Ms C. Chua, director of a maid agency in Lucky Plaza, the figure is 15 per cent.</p>
              <p>Despite the lower pay, agencies say Singapore's strict policy against maid abuse remains an attraction.</p>

              <p>i am always by how singaporeans can view their maids as not quite humans on the same level as say...their colleagues or friends. they might think they are paying them well compared to the wages in their home country and are well fed....but not many actually put themselves in the maids shoes and consider them as humans just like themselves.</p>
              <p>$280 work with no off is basically slave labor, the proof is that no  singaporean (or malaysian) would  settle for a  job with such conditions.</p>

              <p>HK &amp; Taiwan pay &gt; $$ than Sg for evrybody not only maid. They also got more leave &amp; benefit than us. Can't compare cos ppl std of living are also higher LOL</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">So if want ppl in Sg to pay the maid more $, then S'porean also must receive more $ from bosses. If not, where got money to pay them.....</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">BUT to think abt it, S'porean also paid quitehigh lol to hire a maid cos got govt levy to pay ea mth. Not sure whether HK/Taiwan have it or not.</span></p>

              <p>maids would rather go somewhere else like hk or taiwan because the pay is higher and better life? My aunt's maid in hk was saying how happy she was working in hk than in singapore as hk had better pay, cheaper standard of living, food, shopping (etc..)</p>
              <p>i think it's good! Time for singaporeans to learn a lesson and treat their maids well!</p>

              <p>Because it is sooo S'porean to demand the best and yet unwilling to pay for it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Nothing wrong with maid planning to go to a better place to work. Just as S'porean plans to migrate all the time..... Maids, FT, FW are all the same. Would you not want to leave for a better job if you could find one  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
