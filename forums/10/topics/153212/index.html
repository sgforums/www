            <div class='col-md body'>The government has for the past 40 years been showering goodwill and considerations to the minority and its religions. It allocated lands for building of places of worship, its ministers openly often seen patronizing their festivals and extend all forms of grants and financial supports to such minority.<br><br>It even went to the extent changing the voting system to GRC to guarantee the minority of representations and forming IRCs to appease minority to avoid perceived problems.<br><br>How about extending to the majority and all the law-abiding populations and not ignoring their interests or taking their silence for granted?<br><br>The majority and religions that are practising moderate and peaceful coexistence have to get recognitions of their concessions. It should not be the case that the majority have to concede all the time for being meek and for their meekness they are even seen to be tackled on preaching conspiracy or anti-social marxist values etc. Be fair to all and be balanced in treatments of religious beliefs and extending of goodwill and patrongages so that the government is not seen as being afraid of the extreme and militant.<br><br>If it gives the wrong impressions that it is afraid of the extreme and violent and militant but not willing to listen to the meek and tolerant, then people will get the wrong message and follow suit.<br><br>Balance of racial and religious treatment by the government is just as important. It is hoped the government will be more supportive of majority and those who are practising harmony and goodwill and tolerance as otherwise there is no reason for the majority to continue to compromises and show goodwill all the time to extremism of the minority.</div>

For good reason, though. Racism against other races is definitely a more pressing problem than the current oppression of homosexuals in this society. It could undermine the current social construct, and plunge us into the same racial distrust as in the 1960s.<br><br>This is not to say that we should deprive homosexuals of their rightful recognition in society, but resources are limited, and the use of it should therefore be prioritised.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Homosexuality is an increasingly pressing problem in Singapore, that, i mean ostracizing homosexuals. It started with being a taboo and then being a crime and then it became more liberal again but at the same time some heterosexuals make use of this liberty as another venue to ostracize even further.<br><br>First it was politics. Homosexuals are not given high recognition in the civil service. And then that was rectify to some recognition. Just think of the army, how many gays or trans are being severely mocked and even beaten up in the army? Okay that problem was rectified. Gays tend to have more pride of their sexuality because gay support groups are even larger than the lesbian ones.<br><br>There was this new rule in clubs where butches or likewise candidates who do not dress like a lady are not allowed free entry for ladies' night. Or even so, on normal nights, they are made to pay a guys' fee. (let's not input names here) But the question here is, is it fair? aren't butches or girls who just prefer t-shirt and jeans not ladies? Office politics - butches are not even shortlisted just because of the way they dress.<br><br>Is it the way homosexuals dress? OR  is it just their sexual religion? Is it the gender? Or it is just the person? Is it discrimination? Or is it a traditional taboo?<br><br>Laws aside, politics aside. Personally, would you sneer at a guy in skirt? Would you point your finger at two girls holding hands? Sometimes I think it is the way the society reacts, and thus the limited willingness to allow recognition. Where do most homosexuals congregate? The advertising industry.<br><br>I guess it is not about gay rights or the limited ability to voice thought. I suppose it is just about human rights. Is it not?</div>
