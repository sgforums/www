              <p>Hello, stop sidetracking the main topic leh. What an outsider view LKY and Singapore is not important but what we can contribute to make this a better place to live is why we spend time here.</p>
              <p>The fact that we have  a good 'Singapore brand' oversea is because what we have acheived in this little island. You may disagree with certain policies and  implementation but the end result and achievements cannot be denial.</p>
              <p>We have a beautiful city that most of my Chinese colleagues admire. Of cource, we can compliant of the PRC influcence and the PR status given to these foriegners. Most of these people come to work here had something to contribute, be it your boss of your subordinates. We can continue to debate if we need them or not as it is meaningless and I can attest to the fact that most companies dont take  recruitment because they are cheap or expensive or which country they belongs.</p>
              <p>The problem with we Singaporean is like frogs in the well, still looking at the world from the a single window view. We may be well travel and we have internet, it is only when we are truely intergrate and work with these outsiders than we are can share views and understand how the world had changed and the problem we face as a country to stay relevant.</p>
              <p>We have real problem with salary, employment, housing and all these are hand to mounth issues. We have elitism that have placed official in high level government that know nothing of the general population but continue to behave with SOE mentality. We think by creating a vibrant place , the rich and famous will settle in Singapore..we plan and plan and chart our policies without knowing the world changing rapidly. We think we can anticipate but we start to loose millions from our GIC investments........last, we have a voting system that cast in iron a communist one party rule. Who do we blame? We created this monster ourself and now we find it so hard to find alternatives and solutions. So make this forum a better place and surely, someone is watching.</p>

                  Chia Thye Poh: Sir, when the Prime Minister talks of defending our
                  country, we find it hollow. This Government has betrayed all the vital
                  interests of the people to the British. It has no right to talk of
                  defending the nation. This Government is oppressing the people; more
                  than 200 political leaders and trade unionists are in the jails of
                  Singapore. Our Secretary- General, Mr Lim Chin Siong, is in Changi and
                  political dwarfs like Mr Lee Kuan Yew can strut around and talk big
                  only when giants like Mr Lim Chin Siong are kept out of the political
                  arena (interruption).<br><br>Mr Speaker: Do not disturb him.<br><br>Enche'
                  Chia Thye Poh: <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The Prime Minister has spoken about the communal riots
                  in Singapore. He says that the Indonesians and the Communists caused
                  it.</strong></span></p>

              <p>The Prime Minister of Singapore is telling, in Europe,
                  that the UMNO politicians have caused it. The UMNO in Singapore says
                  that the P.A.P. has caused it. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>We who are in Singapore know that the
                  communal riots were the work of the UMNO and the P.A.P. who were

                  Indonesians and the Communists causing these riots is just to hide the
                  truth that <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>the main culprits belong to the ruling parties.</strong></span></span><br><br>SOME HONOURABLE MEMBERS : <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Nonsense!

              <p>Hello, stop sidetracking the main topic leh. What an outsider view LKY and Singapore is not important but what we can contribute to make this a better place to live is why we spend time here.</p>
              <p>The fact that we have  a good 'Singapore brand' oversea is because what we have acheived in this little island. You may disagree with certain policies and  implementation but the end result and achievements cannot be denial.</p>
              <p>We have a beautiful city that most of my Chinese colleagues admire. Of cource, we can compliant of the PRC influcence and the PR status given to these foriegners. Most of these people come to work here had something to contribute, be it your boss of your subordinates. We can continue to debate if we need them or not as it is meaningless and I can attest to the fact that most companies dont take  recruitment because they are cheap or expensive or which country they belongs.</p>
              <p>The problem with we Singaporean is like frogs in the well, still looking at the world from the a single window view. We may be well travel and we have internet, it is only when we are truely intergrate and work with these outsiders than we are can share views and understand how the world had changed and the problem we face as a country to stay relevant.</p>
              <p>We have real problem with salary, employment, housing and all these are hand to mounth issues. We have elitism that have placed official in high level government that know nothing of the general population but continue to behave with SOE mentality. We think by creating a vibrant place , the rich and famous will settle in Singapore..we plan and plan and chart our policies without knowing the world changing rapidly. We think we can anticipate but we start to loose millions from our GIC investments........last, we have a voting system that cast in iron a communist one party rule. Who do we blame? We created this monster ourself and now we find it so hard to find alternatives and solutions. So make this forum a better place and surely, someone is watching.</p>

              <p>"Singapore brand" I think that is "One" of the cause of the problems...</p>
              <p>Reason....the liberal states still considered Singapore a dictator so they are not too keen on Singapore....</p>
              <p>The chinese don't see us as "China Chinese" but Western Chinese so we don't think like them...</p>
              <p>So the Singapore brand is only in Accademic.....and social book.</p>
