              <p>Hi ,</p>
              <p>The documentary showed that:</p>
              <p>1. All NKoreans will give <span style="text-decoration: underline;">all  glory and credit to
              their leader</span> despite all the sufferings they receive living
              in NKorea. Their leader somehow gets all the credit.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. They are so <span style="text-decoration: underline;">brainwashed</span> , there seems to
              be nothing much to distinguish their FEAR for
              their leader and their Respect for their leader. The result of
              decades of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">PROPAGANDA</span>.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">People who
              showed resent to their Leader gets locked without trial
              forever</span> and tortured in an inhumane cell.  The
              relatives of this man gets locked as well but in another 'family'
              cell.  If anyone escapes, their entire family is executed
              brutally.</p>
              <p>If anyone says anything bad about their leader or complain
              the ration given is too little, they get executed.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>4. Although painted as great leader, each year many
              NKoreans risk their lives attempting to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">'migrate'</span> to SKorea, a land of
              true DEMOCRACY. They would rather risk their lives and their
              families' lives to escape from hell. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">They live in constant fear of secret
              police</span>.</p>

              <p>This is a regime that sponsors drug trafficking and and print fake currencies to finance the govt. There are even reports of meat pao made from human flesh - cannibalism.</p>
              <p>It's a gangster state and has a "military first" policy. Singapore has diplomatic relations with North Korea.</p>

              <p>The problem is that we are looking at NKorea from our own familiar settings and systems.</p>
              <p>Try to be a little more sympathetic. Besides, they are also trying to adjust and open up a little.</p>
              <p>Also I disagree if people pass judgements and assign blame on the president, Kim Jong Il, or the 'regime'. In reality the social-political-economic system is much bigger than any one person or the government. This is even more especially true in a socialist country like NKorea. There is almost no difference between government and people. They are very united. If you dislike Kim Jong Il or the 'government' then by definition you should also dislike all or most of NKorean people.</p>
              <p>I still remember afew years ago during an event, I forgot what event, an international event, a group of SKoreans protestors and NKoreans journalists got into a fight, because some SKoreans protestors were demonstrating and bringing banners/ signs with a photo of Kim Jong Il crossed. The NKoreans were so upset and offended they attacked the SKoreans and got into a fistfight.</p>
              <p>That is what I want to say, it is not possible to separate 'government' and people with a socialist country like NKorea. It is not like Americans they can feel so detached and feel OK to critisize their own government or president Bush.</p>
              <p>I just feel a little pity and sympathy, because their dream, which was idealistic, is very hard to maintain now in today's world. But seriously they are very hardy and is the last place on earth where almost pure socialism is still practiced. Where else, China has changed, Vietnam has changed, I think even Cuba is less closed than them, because it seems like Cuba is receiving alot of tourists.</p>
              <p>I admire them. Juche + orthodox communism. Still can survive and chug along despite huge odds against them. The koreans are very hardy and united people. They are very homogenous and have a strong spirit. The same people in the South who became world class master capitalists with its Samsung, Hyundai, in the North, they are the world class master communists and the last standing one. Amazing right? It actually shows the adaptability and resourcefulness of the korean people.</p>
              <p>Regarding Singapore, ya....when I read about which countries NKorea has a diplomatic relations with, I was surprised, it was such a short list, but it actually include Singapore. That is quite surprising, and it made me a little happy in my heart.</p>

              spirit. The same people in the South who became world class master
              capitalists with its Samsung, Hyundai, in the North, they are the
              world class master communists and the last standing one. Amazing
              right? It actually shows the adaptability and resourcefulness of
              the korean people.</p>
              <p>Regarding Singapore, ya....when I read about which countries
              NKorea has a diplomatic relations with, I was surprised, it was
              such a short list, but it actually include Singapore. That is quite
              surprising, and it made me a little happy in my heart.</p>

              <p>Do u think the people of DPRK will be as united if each of them were allowed personal freedom? They continue this by supressing their citizens freedom.</p>
              <p>If given a choice, having the ability to see how the world is, I doubt the north koreans will follow the kim jong il. In DPRK its one eyed man leading the blind....</p>
