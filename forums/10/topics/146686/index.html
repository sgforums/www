            <div class='col-md body'>The government is going headlong into businesses to de-corporatise essential government services via the NTUC and GLCs.<br><br>It is also using taxes to go into businesses overseas which take away competitiveness and viability of the domestic or people's sector of the economy. It is difficult to survive in any businesses in Singapore except for the GLCs, NTUCs and big fishes connected to government not to mention high tax-and-recover system of running the government.<br><br>GLCs which are corporatised so as to do away with provision of basic government services allowing fees to be set at market levels should return their extra profits and reserves (30 -60 years) to lessen the tax and other costs burdens and not to allow the elites to claim credits and draw them as million-dollar salaries and 12 months' bonuses.<br><br>Government is telling people not to expect welfare or free lunches. Are giving away of people's monies to elites in the form of unjustified million-dollar salaries or bonuses of ministers or cither favorites not welfarism or free lunches? GLCs' profits should be pulled back to lessen costs of livings and not free lunches to elites !!!<br><br>The GDP of the domestic or people sector of the economy is very very bearish right now because of major mistakes in governing the country after minusing the contributions of GLCs and MNCs.<br><br>Look at the neighbourhood shops, the JTC factories, the sliding COEs and the half-dead property market (dropped 35 % from previous peak) and you will know whether the economy is growing by 3-4.5% this year.<br><br>All the statistics and figures released in the ND speeches are look-good artificial reports to justify continuing past policies which will finally benefit elites employed at highest pay, plus handsome bonuses like the NKF case.<br><br>People are asking for welfare. They will expect equal treatment and not welfares to our elites in the forms of freebies or free lunches<br><br>Why not share out the negara garden, big community clubs and generous give-aways of free parking and dinners presently given only to the grassroots and connections to avoid welfare to any section of the population.</div>

If we are afraid of draining out our resources from welfarism we can help in a different way by way of investing in putting the unfortunate back to work one day.<br><br>Such an endowment idea is very practical our leaders but we have not heard any one among our well-paid ministers trying to look into relief of people who are out of works. They only know how to pay lip service with excuses of all kinds. They only knows how to double-tax on lands already owned by citizens and charge them again at market prices. They only know how to corporatise essential government services and make the GLCs charge for them at market prices thereby to acccumulate the taxes paid into surpluses. The MPs also did nothing to represent the people's plights.<br><br>What is wrong in helping those suffering from unemployment to tie over the bad patches. Everything has been exaggerated by our ministers to make it look like people asking for free lunches given the media at their control to tell only scare tactics to the people.<br><br>Welfarism or free lunches are not what people are asking. They only ask for reasonable caring government - not to tax and at the same time recover costs up to full market values or double-charge on lands. They only ask for allocations of certain parts of profits of GLCs to go back to lessen the high costs of living or helping people to relieve temporary setbacks not free lunches.</div>
