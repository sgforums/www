              <h3 class="post-title">Singapore Dissident Goes Awry?</h3>
              <p> </p>
              <div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #666666; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"><span>As
              my 'regular reads' list on the left column testifies, I (used to) enjoy
              reading Mr Gopalan Nair's entries regarding the state of Singapore
              politics. I chanced upon his blog at least a year or two ago and have
              been reading his thoughts regularly, long before the <a href="http://news.google.com.sg/news?oe=utf-8&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;um=1&amp;tab=wn&amp;hl=en&amp;q=gopalan+nair+singapore&amp;btnG=Search+News">ongoing debacle</a> in Singapore occurred.</span></span><br></div>
              <br><span style="color: #666666; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"><span>Although
              I felt it was unnecessary for him to come into Singapore and invite
              trouble in the first place, I felt that is was either a case of extreme
              silliness or political bravery - and very possibly a potent mix of
              both. I was not sure if his motivations were personal or patriotic but
              was willing to give him the benefit of the doubt notwithstanding.</span></span><br><span style="color: #666666; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span><br><span style="color: #666666; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"><span>As
              most of my readers know, I was formerly in the Police Force for 10
              years and was attached to the Central Police Division for the duration
              of my career. For a major part of those 10 years, I was doing much work
              at the Little India vicinity by way of various assignments. I was
              therefore naturally tickled when Mr Nair chose to stay at the Broadway
              Hotel along Serangoon Road upon his arrival and even more intrigued
              when he was <a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/Latest%2BNews/Courts%2Band%2BCrime/STIStory_254870.html">arrested for Disorderly Behaviour</a> within that jurisdiction.</span></span><br><span style="color: #666666; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span><br><span style="color: #666666; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"><span>I immediately checked with Mr Nair's version on his blog, <a href="http://singaporedissident.blogspot.com/">Singapore Dissident</a>,
              and he claimed to have been followed and persecuted. I thought perhaps
              some ISD officers had been tracking his movements which led to the
              scuffle and subsequent arrest. However, a few days later, I happened to
              chat with one of my ex-colleagues and was told that he was actually
              arrested by 'normal' officers who were doing routine plainclothes
              patrol that night. In fact, some of the officers who arrested him are
              known to me personally.</span></span><br><span style="color: #666666; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span><br><span style="color: #666666; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"><span>I
              was informed that these officers did not know who Mr Nair was until he
              was brought back to the Police station. I have no reason to disbelieve
              this as I know that the officers involved are not that much interested
              in the (opposition) political climate - unless of course they are
              tasked to perform duties with regard to 'demonstrations', in which case
              they curse and swear.</span></span><br><span style="color: #666666; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span><br><span style="color: #666666; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"><span>That
              being the case, it is very highly probable that Mr Nair WOULD NOT have
              been arrested had the officers recognised who he was. I am certain that
              he was not singled out and had, on his own accord, invited trouble by
              banging on the bonnet of the Police car. In usual cases (from personal
              experience as well), Police Officers try to give the benefit of the
              doubt to abusive drunkards simply because; a) they are more of a
              nuisance than being criminals, and; b) they are a handful until they
              sober up - being a nuisance from arrest to lock-up till they eventually
              sober up. Not to mention, somewhere along the line, they will throw up
              (ie. vomit) and compound matters for evryone involved.</span></span><br><span style="color: #666666; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span><br><span style="color: #666666; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"><span>In
              Mr Nair's case, the level of tolerance would have been (much) higher
              had the officers known who he was from the beginning of the incident.
              Of course, this is not to say that he would not have gotten himself
              arrested anyway with his antics eventually. I would even go as far as
              to say that he must have been extremely violent and aggressive to have
              'forced' the officers into arresting him.</span></span><br><span style="color: #666666; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span><br><span style="color: #666666; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"><span>Personally, I feel disappointed that he would choose to provoke officers and invite trouble for himself. In his <a href="http://singaporedissident.blogspot.com/2008/07/july-28-2008-2-months-and-2-days.html">latest entry</a> regarding the ensuing court case, he also speaks of the court officials
              being reluctant to identify their full names. Although I find this
              immaterial to the matter of the case itself, he mentions the
              investigator, Mr S Vickneshwaran, using a false name, S Vicki. I have
              personally known this officer since 1995 and he has always gone by the
              name 'Vicki'. In fact, there is only one officer 'Vicky' in the whole
              of Central Police Division (more so for 'S Vicky') and it is definitely
              not a 'completely false name' as alleged by Mr Nair in that entry.</span></span><br><span style="color: #666666; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span><br><span style="color: #666666; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"><span>At
              best, he is nitpicking with regard to this issue and, at worst, he is
              intentionally disrupting proccedings with a sideshow. I am again
              disappointed with this behaviour which he could and should avoid. As
              things progress, I find that, overall, he is drumming up things
              unnecessarily and then claiming to be persecuted.</span></span><br><span style="color: #666666; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span><br><span style="color: #666666; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"><span>These
              officers are restricted by the OSA (Official Secrets Act) and will not
              be able to defend themselves directly unlike Mr Nair who can post
              everything on his blog. Although I am not fond of things as they are in
              Singapore, I refuse to just stand by and watch my friends and
              ex-colleagues, who are honest tax-payers themselves, and who perform
              their jobs with dignity and honour, be subjected to such unfounded
              accusations and baseless distortions of the truth.</span></span><br><span style="color: #666666; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span><br><span style="color: #666666; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"><span>The
              purpose of this post is to let everyone see the other side of the coin
              with regard to the Disorderly Behaviour incident involving Mr Gopalan
              Nair. The facts stated herein are as good as hearing from the officers
              involved themselves, thank you.</span></span></blockquote>
