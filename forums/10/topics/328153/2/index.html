              <p>When one is making a complain or asking for help, it would be best if he is honest and straightforward, with full facts. Otherwise it would seem to be mischief being played.</p>
              <p>I would give benefit of doubt to the threadstarter and blame it on ignorance then. Symphathies of 'old age, poor, etc' will only get you so far. But it is TRUTH that will set you free. Here are some facts:-</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1. According to HDB,annex D of the SERs(enbloc) states clearly that:-</p>
              <p>(f) Exemption from the payment of resale levy for the existing flats;</p>
              <p>So what is levy are you harping about?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. Should you buy another new flat of your choice, with HDB subsidies, in an area of your choice, there will be a resale levy, as it is a flat of your choice and not a 'replacement' unit for you. And that levy is only $15,000 for a 2room flat and between $30,000 to max cap $50,000 for other room types.</p>
              <p>But if you buy in the open market, you need not pay the levy.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3. I know not where you stay, but basing on the current Commonwealth SER programme, the valuation of a flat there is between $200,000 - $230,000.</p>
              <p>Owners are asking at a premium - $300,000 for their flats.</p>
              <p>Assuming you sold yours at $$270,000, you would have made an investment return of $170,000:-</p>
              <p>-initial capital = $100,000</p>
              <p>-sold = $270,000</p>
              <p><strong>-cash on hand = $170,000</strong></p>
              <p>-in your CPF kitty = $100,000</p>
              <p>Total asset value = $270,000 ( to buy new flat anywhere, putting $100,000 of your CPF as deposit and loaning the balance, eg:-</p>
              <p>Resale 3rm flat in CCK = $200,000</p>
              <p>less deposit = $100,000 deduct from CPF</p>
              <p>loan = $10,000 loan over 30 years = est $694/mth ( depending on interest) </p>
              <p>But take note: you would still have $170,000 CASH ON HAND. with an asset value of $200,000, HDB home, with a 99 years lease, not 30 year lease, at current market value, which will grow at 10% per year.</p>
              <p>So, you are not as 'poor' or 'destitute' as you want us to thank. And this you would have to thank our founding fathers for making us owners of properties, a security for ourselves.</p>
              <p>Americans and other envious people would prefer us to take on 30 year leasses, but the 99 year lease came at a time when leaders were more generous. Don't ever make them change to 30 years lease, it would be a business decision most leaders would want, but citizens will only suffer at old age.</p>

              <p>Why would anyone want to buy an enbloc flat?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Because:-</p>
              <p>a) the flat would be situated at a central area with more amenities, unlike newer estate.(eg, commonwealth - near MRT)</p>
              <p>b) 1st timers get 20% discount on the units there, on top of all other subsidies, if they qualify.</p>
              <p>c.) 1st timers would have to wait between 3 to 5 years to get their new flats, but with enbloc/SERs, they can get it within 1 to 2 years.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Why should we have SERs/enbloc sales?</p>
              <p>Because old flats are not land efficient, for they are mostly 10 storeys high, and built with not good construction furnishings. But by demolishing them and replacing them, they can be as high as 40 storeys, much more land efficient, and comes with better facillities such as gardens, playgrounds, access roads, cablings, etc.</p>
              <p>Best of all, owners of existing flat getting replacement units have their leases extended another fixed 99 years, at a lower cost.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So why is the Threadstarter complaining?</p>
              <p>Maybe because he love his home of many years and bemoan the leaving of his neighbours and way of life? People get upset with 'changes'.</p>
              <p>But make no mistakes, no one person owns the land in Singapore. It is own by every citizen present and the future to come. Land use efficiency is a priority for economic growth. No growth = no future. Why waste the human life in inefficiency?</p>

              <p>Yes. You are right. But lets understand what HDB is all about. It is about giving citizen homeownership rights.</p>
              <p>As a 1st timer, anyone of us citizen would support that right. But for a 2nd timer, that choice of home ownership is a luxury. As we all know, in Spore, one should live within his means and pay for what he can afford. No more valid reason to subsidize them. We do not have any natural resources, let alone infinite resources.</p>
              <p>Private property homeowners, 2nd timers, etc, while do have my sympathies, but priority of right will always and must always be given to our new 1st timer citizens, espacially our young, a chance. This can only happen in Spore. No where else does any country gives a damn about the aspirations of the young in terms of cheap and good affordable housing.</p>

              <p>Selling his current Enblock flat on the open market and reap some financial benefit out the scheme is a bright idea. But hold on a second. PPP has to understand something very important. And many ppl would not be aware of the following:<br><br>If PPP sells his HDB unit on the open market, reaps some financial reward and moves to an old 3 room flat, the story does not end here. Full stop! <br><br>If PPP sells his HDB unit on the open market, HDB threats him as consuming the second HDB flat subsidy. In other words, PPP can never buy direct from HDB again.

              <p>True, singaporean like the word 'law-by-law'. We need standardization else chao. <br><br>However, human being human can falls into grey areas.

That why it is so important that we need channels for feedback. That is why the govt has to revamp and refine its policies from time to time. <br><br>For the latter, it is not a question of the person facing up to the hashness or the law not showing mercy. It is really the question of guidance or helping hand from whichever reliable source that can be utilized.<br><br>I tell you something funny. When I faced Enblock, I seeked out property consultants. About a handful 3 to 4, all interested in discussing buy/sell stuff with me, all interested in me signing contract. <br><br>When I ask about my options, my obligation, the law, HDB requirements - the look on their faces - sheeee....  </p>

              <p>"So PPP, if you planning to reap some fincancial reward and moves to another open market 3 room flat, make sure the flat is an unpgraded unit. This type of flat will has lesser chance of being Enblock."</p>
              <p>Advice of the day...I would say. Can't PPP qualify for studio apts?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Right from the word "go", PPP alrdy said he had financial difficulty and had to downgrade. And Xtreiyer insists that PPP is living beyond his means. And it is also HDB rules that if one were to have sold a flat before and his current flat is en bloc, then the levy is compulsory (God knows why...website doesn't say anything) which the same dud refutes again w/o researching into PPP's claim.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Lightning does strike twice, maybe three or four times huh, dude. Perhaps it's genetic...I mean that grey matter being thick lol.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Oh well, another option I would propose is not to take up any replacement flat but take all that en bloc money and rent a flat. This money should last for a number of years before children are financially independent. Look for those units with the possibility of staying long-term. Put the extra money in bonds and reap the interest.</p>

              <p><br>"Advice of the day...I would say. Can't PPP qualify for studio apts?"</p>
              <p>In PPP situation, there are 3 ways out</p>
              <p>1) returns the flat to HDB and purchases a 3 rm or a studio apts direct from HDB (can be new or old). Whether new or old flat, if he purchases direct from HDB, ie at a subsidised price, he has to do it at a certain timeframe. (I would not know about this timeframe, he has to find out from HDB).</p>
              <p>In this option, after everything is said and done, he is treated as consuming 2 HDB subsidies. <br><br>The restriction - he can only return his current flat to HDB and cannot sell it himself . However, HDB 3 rm or studio flats are limited. If it is in Sengkang, off you go.   </p>
              <p><br>2) returns the flat to HDB and purchases a 3 rm or a studio apts on the open market. In this option, after everything is said and done, he is treated as consuming 1 subsidy. <br><br>The danger - he has to be careful of the areas he selects. Make sure it will not an area that can undergoes Enblock. But if this open market unit is Emblock and he decides to go along, no worry. He has only consume 1 subsidy thus far.  </p>
              <p>Plus point - his freedom of choice in location.</p>
              <p>3) sells his current flat on the open market and moves to a open market 3 rm or a studio apt. At the point upon he selling his current flat on the open market, he can never purchase direct from HDB anymore. Why? HDB treats him as consuming the 2 subsidies.</p>
              <p>Remember, if he goes down this pathway, he can never purchase direct from HDB again. When he source for his 3 rm or studio apt, it cannot be a direct purchase but a open market purchase.</p>
              <p>Many dangers - he better make sure the open market flat is an upgraded one. This way the chance of Enblock is lesser. To this point, he has comsumed 2 subsidies. If he faces another Emblock again - no replacement flat for him. <br><br>The plus point - possibility of extra cash in his wallet.</p>
              <p>At this point, I have to warn PPP to do his sum. <br><br>When I tried to sell my unit on the open market (2 1/2 yrs back), the highest offer price I got was even lower than HDB compensation package.</p>
              <p>Also on selling on the open market, if you sell on the open market can you sell at a price that is <br>a) higher or comparable than paying the levy? or <br>b) higher or comparable than taking up the HDB compensation package?  <br><br>PPP also has to know that there are two ways of paying the levy. <br>a) One is on his previous, direct purchased flat <br>b) another is by his upcoming replacement flat. <br>My advice,  do your sum on the levy. At the time, when I did mine for my family, the diff was up to 20k diff.  <br><br>PPP, I will not go on in this thread anymore. If you need my help, you can PM me.</p>

              <p>You speak well. Look at the site in Queenstown. The least is about 50 years left. One porton, the govt enbloc. The other portion, the govt upgraded. <br><br>Fast forward to 50 years from now, the enbloc site will has remaining of 50 years lease (enbloc site starts with new 99 years lease) but the upgraded site will has 0 year lease left. <br><br>Using the term ceteris paribus (other thing assumes being equal), what going to happen to the site with 0 lease left? <br><br>I shudder to think the possibility of political involvement. What happen 50 years down the road, the upgraded site is in the hand of the opposition? What the residents get or not get? Think about it.<br><br>The govt from the onset never shy away from saying that it can and will use HDB flat as a leverage.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p><br><em>"u can avoid paying those levy by buying house on the open market."</em> <br><br>Yes but there are some catches.<br><br>a) sell current flat on the open market.<br>b) return current flat to HDB and take up the compensation package.<br><br>a) Selling on open market may not nec fetch a good price. <br><br>Why? because the buyer has to stay in his old 3 rm flat while the replacement flat is being built. Can be up to 3-4 years waiting period, you know? While the attraction of staying in a prime area is good, who wants to move into a old 3 rm flat, stay 3-4 years than move again to the replacement flat? <br><br>I tried to sell mine - only got one offer and mine was a clean 4 rm flat, next to the MRT.<br><br>b) return current flat to HDB and take up the compensation package (ie the total lump of compensation). <br><br>Do you know that HDB compensation package is always on the conservative side, ie lower than the resale or the open market price?<br><br>So he would be returning low price to HDB and buying high price on the open market. Yeah, this way no need to pay the levy. But he is already in financial diff, can he do a sell low, buy high stuff?<br><br>That was why I said I undertand what PPP is going thru.
