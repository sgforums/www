Right now, the entire cabinet is full of Dr M era people. Already some of his gang are going. It would have been nice to have given him (Badawi) a chance not to go down the same path.<br><br>But unfortunately, we screwed up that chance.

Dr M is going out and Badawi is not yet ready to consolidate power. By throwing that booklet, it caused the new leader a lot of embaressment and he has to respond. And we know their election is around the corner. Why did we seek to provoke them? </div></blockquote>The Malaysian political insiders(?) always have brilliant comments to make without accepting the facts as the world sees it.<br><br>There are always reasons and excuses from which they use to avoid the real issues, quite typical of them - which amounts to seeing a doctor to get a Medical Certificate (Leave) to avoid settling the problems.<br><br><blockquote><strong>Bad timing.</strong><br>Badawi is a moderate. He has done much already to cool things between Malaysia and Singapore. He talks more sense than their current foreign minister. But humans can only go so far before face must be given. Hence the booklet came at a wrong time.<br><br>Now my only question is why did we publish the booklet at that time? What happen in Singapore (or Malaysia) 3 months ago that promted us to stroke the fires? It was in April, and that was before the SARS incidents. What happen?[/b]</blockquote>When is there ever a right time, considering that they continuously make speeches putting us in a poor light on the Water Issues at all levels - from the kampung events to state sanctioned ceremonies, to speaking off-the-cuff to reporters at national events.<br><br>Not all in Malaysia is as wired up as we are in Singapore, and I doubt if the various national newspapers will sell similar advertisement space to the Singapore High Commission in Kuala Lumpur, to allow us to advertise our side of the story to refute the many speeches and unofficial remarks at the grass root level in Malaysia.<br><br>Such purposeful misleading political activities at the grass root level can poison the "People-to-People" relationship between Malaysia and Singapore.<br><br>What other choice does Singapore have to bring the issues out clearly to the Malaysians, and even then how many of these books will be in the hands of the Malaysians - if these books are intended for them in the first place ?<br><br>Did our Singapore MITA specifically said that these books were intended for the Malaysian "market" ?<br><br>Is this another case of Malaysia interfering again in our domestic affair of publishing these books for our "own internal" consumption ?<br></div>

And that should answer the puzzlement that our ministers have with Malaysia's advertistments. They can also claim to be giving as many people as possible the opportunity to weigh the facts and make their own judgement on the truth behind the negotiations.</div></blockquote><span style="color: red;">ken ken ken, here you go shoting off a version of affair that is fair removed from reality.  Hasn't it occur to you that even with modern communication, mis-information is the name of the game in today's wired world, nevermind backward Malaysian kampongs or cyberclass patrajaya districts ?<br><br>Do go read up that 20-page booklet from Malaysia's NEAC and make an honest  comparison with the content presented by Singapore's 80-plus page publishing. This episode of booklet-vs-booklet has become obvious to many reader that  how any well-documentated events and minutes of meeting can easily be mis-represented to those un- or ill informed (Malaysians ? ). In fact, this epitomises the difference of handling  style between Singapore's word-by-word  presentation of official print and statements as compared to her larger "friendly and sensitive" neighbour method of cut-&amp;paste editon of "I want fair-price" story. Somehow, Malaysia gov had missed the whole point of water talk, it is not about the price but  the principle behind the water agreement. And KL's mockery attempt to sell 3 sens rate only expose of how "money no enuf" attitude an envious and insulate institution that the Malaysian gov has become in this affair.<br><br>A contract is a contract. Wanna break contract ? Go to court then, why make fuss placing adverts and printing 3sens pre-election party-propaganda on tax payer$'s $$$ (Do u seriously believe that 20page, softcovered booklet cost that amount ??? )<br>Now thanks 2 its own making, Malaysia is indeed...truely asia...<br><br>If this is the way that Malaysian gov gets its deal done thru unilaterally changes after each meeting, than I shaddered at the thought of how honest they can adhere to Singapore's independence itself in the future.<br><br>I overheard a French associate after his trip to KL last weekend as saying "while someone else is making money, Malaysia can only make noises..."<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> </span><br><br></div>
