Might as well settle with MS word format...not much larger but still editable for the likings for UMNO readers and cronys<br><br>Even the image and content-rich MITA version of +80-page   didn't exceed that amount.<br><br>No wonder their site is now clogged with delayted hits that \even NEAC server can't handle.Check out their site @ http://www.neac.gov.my </span></div></blockquote>i think its a common rookie's mistake...<br><br>i have some experience in desktop publishing.<br><br>current industry standard is Adobe Pagemaker... some businesses and organizations are gradually upgrading to Adobe Indesign though last i checked, not that many of them use it yet...<br><br>either way, both are not your typical word processor  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>in MS-Word, u just let 'er rip and it automatically moves to a new page after u reach the end of one page... in these desktop publishing software, u don't.<br><br>with Adobe, u basically have to define the number of pages your publication will have at the beginning, or insert new pages as u go along... both are not very intuitive processes.<br><br>the likelihood of a rookie opening a new document for every page is rather HIGH... i've seen it happen myself... its quite tragic... this kid i worked with (not his fault lah... he was only temp-ing during hols...) actually had a 15 file document once... which shocked me cos each file could actually accommodate, if i'm not wrong, up to 9999 pages... or until your comp crashes from lack of ram, whichever comes first...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>so if one pagemaker file = one page, the most automatic thing for a rookie would be to output one pdf file for one page... its the only way the work can flow smoothly...<br><br>also, with PDF, if u want a manageable, small file that displays reasonably well, u HAVE to apply some compression. the temptation is often to output the PDF in the highest resolution available... that makes for a ridiculously LARGE pdf file... which is stupid cos laser printers prints max 600dpi... 150dpi is usually relatively good print quality for a laser printer already...<br><br>and if no compression is applied to the output file, be it zip or jpeg (yes, PDF supports compression in these standards as well,) u'll end up with a file too big to be useful for mass-distribution...<br><br>for me, i usually experiment a bit with different settings if i have time to get the best results... its a bit tedious, but the output is well worth the effort. esp when u work with graphics, u never know how the compression screws them up! double checking is better than looking stupid when pple complain about the quality of your work...<br><br>so u put these 2 childish errors together, u'll end up with their shoddy work lor... very LARGE pdf files and one page per file...<br><br>either that, or it simply shows that the organization has a very twisted, convulated, inefficient way of doing work... like 20 pple asked to do one page each to save time  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>didn't even occur to them to join the files together  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  joining them would've reduced the file slightly as it'll be getting rid of some redundant elements that defines each page as a separate file...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> yes, even if u made the first stupid mistake, it is technically possible to join separate pages into one PDF file with several pages... though it won't make much diff cos the output file will STILL be too large for effective mass distribution... unless everybody was using broadband...<br><br>now, doesn't this bring back memories of the times when Sg digitized the documents and posted them as PDF files? <strong>they actually said PDF files can be doctored as they are not scanned images of the original files</strong>... i laughed out loud at that cos it just shows that they don't even have the most rudimentary understanding of the technologies commonly used today...<br><br>thats why it doesn't surprise me that they made a mess out of this publication.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You buy water at 3sen, go thru value-added process then sell it at a so-so price. Nothing wrong if you can get a cheap source of water.<br><br>Dr M and that disgraceful malaysia foreign minister should not be harping at what S'pore does with the water. What ever S'pore do to the water is a tribute to her excellent organization and good minds(this maybe lacking in M). Whatever profits is her's to keep.<br><br>When doing business, you get a supplier to supply you raw material at an agreed price for the contractual period, then you sell the processed raw material to the end user at a price. This price will definately be much higher(basically everybody in e whole wide world knows that, no need for M to teach the world). Instead of learning from our government, they just wanna be a cry baby.<br><br>One can not learn and improve if the person can't even see their own deficiencies. Heard last time they wanna learn from the japanese... why look further then Singapore?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>No point eating sour grapes.

This time,  instead of internal tribunals like the ICJ, they choose the Malaysian court. This is exactly what Singapore's FM had highlighted in parliament earlier this yr based on the Water Agreement. So why the delay of over 6 mths ? Is this typical of how KL gov prepared a favorable home-ground condition before proceeding to legal challenges ?<br>Note that KL is currently amending its own internal law in preparation to take control of all the Malaysian's states domestic water system.</span><br><br><img src="http://www.nst.com.my/images/nst/anb/newlogo1.gif"><br><br><span style="color: darkred;"><strong>New Straits Times (Oct 1, 2003)<br><br>At The Dewan Rakyat: RM2.5m for water ads well spent, says Toyad </strong><br><br>Oct 1:  THE RM2,513,404.72 spent by the Government via the National Economic Action Council on advertisements on the Malaysia-Singapore water issue has resulted in more people being aware of the disadvantaged position Malaysia is in.<br><br>It has also been successful in garnering support from Singaporeans and the international community alike, Deputy Foreign Minister Datuk Dr Leo Michael Toyad said in a written answer to a question by Datuk Wan Junaidi Tuanku Jaafar (BN-Batang Lupar).<br><br>He said the advertisement campaign from July 13 to 18 gave the people a true picture of Malaysia's situation against the baseless allegations from Singapore.<br><br>"Many parties are now aware and understand our position and our rights," he said.<br><br>He said the Government had on July 30 decided to refer the dispute to a tribunal, which would be in accordance with Malaysian laws, and not to the International Court of Justice.<br><br>He said this was specified under the 1961 and 1962 water agreements entered into by both countries.<br><br>He also said the Government had taken steps to stop the purchase of treated water from Singapore.<br><br>"The Johor Government is now building a water treatment plant in Semanggar and water pipelines to connect the plant to consumers, scheduled to be completed by the end of next year," he said.<br><br>He also said the proposed bridge project to replace the outdated Johor Causeway was to accommodate the rising number of vehicles.<br><br>"The bridge will ease traffic flow and also open the waterway in the Straits of Tebrau which has been blocked all this while."
