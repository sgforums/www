            <div class='col-md body'>NeonTetra&gt; whatever hush-hush things the President was doing in MINDEF during your NS, I'm pretty sure that any decisions that came from him at MINDEF had already been made in advance by the Cabinet. He was probably just the rubber stamp, like he usually is.<br><br>We know what the Gahmen is like - if the President actually held any real power, do you seriously think they would allow us to directly elect him? Hah.<br><br>Even though he's supposed to serve as a check on the Gahmen, the President's power and influence has consistently been demonstrated to be very limited. Look what happened to poor Ong Teng Cheong. I'm surprised that the senior Civil Service and Cabinet can still sleep at night, when they must know that Heaven will make them answer for that when the time of reckoning comes.</div>

From somewhere I read, they say the president can only act on the recommendation by the Prime Minister.

But again if the president don't give their approval to the recommendations, the decision have to go to the cabinet or something, making it more troublesome lah.

            <div class='col-md body'>Under the Singapore Constitution, presidential approval is required for the passage of all legislation, after it has cleared Parliament. Many other important, non-legislative consitutional powers, in theory, flow from the president. For example, he has the sole power to appoint judges, and I think he should have the power to dissolve Parliament as well.<br><br>That's the theory, at least. In practice, of course, the situation is vastly different. As a previous poster pointed out, the President can only make important appointments of officials on the recommendation of the Prime Minister - the President can't just appoint anyone he likes. Also, in practice the Singapore President has never exercised his power to dissolve Parliament except where the PM has requested it prior to a general election, nor has he ever exercised his right to refuse to approve legislation passed by Parliament. This is in contrast to Presidents in other countries, who often make full use of their legal authority to check abuses of power by their respective governments, e.g. in Italy late last year, where President Ciampi refused to approve a new law that would have allowed the corrupt PM, Silvio Berlusconi, to protect the business interests of a media company he owned.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If my memory serves me, the president holds one of two keys to the national reserves. The other is held by the parliament i think. But as earlier posters had stated, I reckon hes just a puppet of the government and merely a legal formality, required but not really neccessary. His key seems to be in the governments hands too.<br><br>Furthermore, he holds the final decison on capital punishment. He can repudiate death sentences, but Im afraid there is no cases of successful appeals yet by death convicts. Nowadays, death convicts dont even bother to appeal to him.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yea from what i know and read up the president has limited powers.  His main duties are for ceremonial purposes and to protect the nation's reserves.  A lot of stuff that he does is under the advice of the PM.. actually there was a lot of questions raised on what does our president do during former president Ong's year as president when he voiced out concerns on his role as an elected president... if you wanna check out then newspaper archives its was around sept 99 if i'm not mistaken oh and if you wanna know more abt wat the president actually do go and check out the constitution.. you can find it online at http://statutes.agc.gov.sg<br></div>
