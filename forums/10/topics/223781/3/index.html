Where does the reserves come from? Do you know what is happening to OUR reserves now? Having a budget deficit once or a few times in a while is not the end of the world, it gives the economy time to restructure and focus on areas of development (instead of seeing your fellow citizens ending up on the MRT tracks as roadkill, in this case, track kill). Business cycles is not a linear line, it goes up it comes down, it's cyclical.<br><br>Have you analyse their budget 2006/2007? To increase taxes so that you can spend on areas to help stimulate the economy is one thing, increasing taxes so that you can have a bigger pay is another. In economics, it's called "Moral Hazard", a situation in which one of the parties to a contract has an incentive, after the contract is agreed, to act in a manner that brings benefits to himself at the expense of the other party to the contract.<br><br>In corporate finance, it's not good to have too much reserves, because it lowers your Return on Equity (ROE). That's why Singtel decided on a share buyback to reduce it's reserves, because they can't make that rate of return expected from them by the market. e.g. There is a difference between making a $10 profit with $200 and $100. $200: ROE = 5%; $100: ROE = 10%.<br><br>Do you know that the recent depreciation, since mid 2004 has resulted in a loss of 10% of our reserves? I would not discount a 15% to 20% loss of our reserves in afew years time.<br><br>[(1.71 - 1.54) / 1.71] X 100% = 9.94%<br><br>Why did such loss occur? A rigid system like ours will lead to more problems, because of it's inability to react to external circumstances with an appropriate response. Having 82 "Yes Sir!" people in the cabinet is not going to yield dynamic change.<br><br>You don't have to go Hong Kong to ask them about their lives, you ask me or any average Singaporean and they will tell you their lives.<br><br>According to "the Economist: world in figures 2007", Hong Kong's purchasing power is ranked 15th (77.7), whereas Singapore is ranked 24th (70.8 ); (USA = 100)<br><br>I admire you, you get all your information from ChannelNewsAsia, you are one smart aleck.

For the remainder part of the consultation we will not be advocating GST as the only option," he told reporters.<br><br>Tang did not take questions nor clarify whether the government will re-consider the policy in the future.<br><br>He said the government will stop promoting the plan over the remainder of the nine-month consultation period and urged citizens to continue to provide their views on the other possible ways to widen the tax base.<br><br>Hong Kong leader Donald Tsang said the decision has complete support from him and the Executive Council, or cabinet.<br><br>"We believe that the decision (Tang) has made respects fully the wishes of Hong Kong people that we should seriously consider widening our tax base," he said.<br><br>"At the same time he has paid full regard to the strong opposition of the people to the introduction of GST at this time," he said.<br><br>Tsang Yok-sing, Executive Councillor and the founding chairman of the pro-Beijing Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong (DAB), also welcomed the move.<br><br>"We opposed the GST but also believe that we should find other ways to widen the tax base ... we welcome that the government has listened to the public views," he said.<br><br>The proposal has met public hostility with protests denouncing the plan throughout the consultation period. All major political parties opposed the measure.<br><br>Activists had accused Tang of robbing the poor to pay the rich, with protesters saying a sales tax would decimate the booming tourism industry by making shopping in Hong Kong - one of its biggest draws - less attractive. - AFP/ch<br><br></div></blockquote>Without GST, Hongkong will have a better edge over Singapore in terms<br>of attracting Foreign Investments and Investors.
