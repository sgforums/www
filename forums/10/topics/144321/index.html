Evidently, there has been no newspaper reports to account for the truth of that statement.

I didnÂ’t even see a bag to be quite honest.Â”<br><br>There was no visible threat from the guy, so the police canÂ’t claim act of self-defense. There was no indication that he had just planted a bomb, or left a suspicious article around somewhere, police canÂ’t say they were stopping him from committing a terrorist act. He was, in the mind of the police, convicted of terrorism and deserved to die, and therefore he was shot 5 times when he was already down on the floor. This sound like an execution to me.<br><br>Was the police triggerhappy or just panic? If they are armed to the teeth now, they better not be.<br><br>What puzzled me is the reference of a Brazilian as an Asian. Would the police do the same if he were a white British? This is not an accusation of racism but this is probably a situation of non differentiation between Hispanic, middle easterners, and asian (generally refer to Indians and Pakis). There is no difference between Chinese and Vietnamese to the brit. This is in Britain, a cosmopolitan city. Few years ago, a Jap youth was shot dead in US because he didnÂ’t understand Â“stopÂ” when confronted by an American with a gun. Why is this diversity of races and cultures still causing misunderstanding? Are they not in the same society? The confirmed suspects were locally born and bred in Britain.<br><br>The world ought to be on high alert after post-911, especially Britain, if not they ought to be after they joined the US in invading iraq. Terrorists today come from within. Many immigrants from middle east, India and Pakistan, especially those from their previous colonies, are now british nationals and is part of the society. Islam is there to stay and it is inevitable that some local muslims are influenced by fundamentalist from abroad. Is Britain ready to cope?? Are all muslims and those with darker skin and beard prime suspects of terrorists??<br><br>We pray that no terrorists succeed in Singapore, in the unlikely event that this happens, lets hope that Singaporeans are ready to handle. In whatever situation, anybody who is given a gun should be responsible for how he uses it. You shoot the wrong guy, you must face the trial. It doesnÂ’t mean that in war, soldiers donÂ’t have to watch who they shoot.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Jean Charles de Menezes shot a point blank range on the London tube carriage was a victim of police incompetence. London police chief confirmed that there was a shoot-to-kill policy for tackling suicide bombers and it would not change. Mr Menezes' death raised questions about the adoption of the shoot-to-kill policy by British police.<br><br>Mr Menezes was trailed by police and was under surveillance when he was on his way to work. The situation could be contained readily, officers could intercept him at any time while he journeyed to work. Reasonable force could be used to restrain him on probable grounds , a stop and search conducted to ascertain whether bombs were concealed in his jacket.<br><br>However, they elected not to stop him, allow him to try and board a train at stockwell, south London where an officer with a automatic pistol fired eight shots at him, seven of which aimed at the head, ensuring almost instantaneous death. Horrified passengers who described the victim as looking like a cornered rabbit. This is the use of excessive force against an unarmed innocent person.<br><br>A prudent approach is absolutely vital, utmost care to be taken to ensure that innocent people are not killed or more people could be shot due to overzealousness. The independent police complaints commission certainly should investigate this fatal overkill. They have their work cut out for them. Swift compensation for wrongful death may be on the cards.</div>
