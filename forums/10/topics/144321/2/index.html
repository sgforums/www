            <div class='col-md body'>As best as i can remember from the news, this is what happened:<br><br>The police had put a flat under surveillance. This was related to the hunt for the London Bombers. The block of flats in question only had one means of entry and exit. Mr M, the victim, was living below the flat under surveillance. When he walked out of the block of flats on the day in question, the police decided to follow him.<br><br>They followed Mr M to a bus-stop where he took a bus and alighted near stockwell station. By this time, the police armed response unit had been given orders to stop Mr M.<br><br>Mr M. was challenged by the police at the entrance of stockwell station by plain-clothes officers. He did not comply with orders to stop. He vaulted over the ticeketing barriers of the train station and ran down the escalators towards a train. He tripped and was then pinned down by pursuing officers. The officier in question fired 8 shots at him; 1 into his shoulder and 7 into his head.<br><br>Some pertinent facts:<br><br>- Mr M was olive skinned.<br><br>- Mr M had on a bulky jacket. This was mentioned by Mark Whitby, an eye-witness. One poster above had neglected to mention this. Tsk tsk.<br><br>- It was claimed by a TV station that MR M had outstayed his student visa. His parents dispute this, saying that all his paperwork were in order.<br><br>----<br><br>Personally, i think we should not be too quick to go on a witch hunt. This might very well be an honest mistake.<br><br>Some of you argue that there was no need to shoot him, or that there was no need to shoot him in the head. I disagree. This is because the only way to make safe a suicide bomber is to utterly and completely destroy his brain. One shot to the head might not be enough to stop all motor functions. I have not seen a man being shot in the head, but i have seen footage of farm animals being shot and from what i have seen, animals like cows retain some motor function even after having been shot in the head at close range.<br><br>I also feel that some are too eager to fling words like 'racist killing' around. This might very well be an honest mistake.<br><br>Mr M emerged from a block of flats that is under surveillance, He looked 'Asian' (which is what the london bombers can be described as), he had been wearing a bulky jacket when the temperature was around 23 deg Cel., and more importantly, he refused to stop when challenged. He might very well have been justified in running away because the officers were, after all, not in uniform. IMO, that is probably what happened. If so, then i do not think the fault lies with the officer who pulled the trigger. I think luck, fate and the met police share equal blame.<br><br>Kym, you argue that he could have been stopped earlier. I disagree. UK policemen do not generally carry firearms. Therefore, it would seem logical to let the firearms unit do the arrest.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The most crucial issue British police officers have to establish in the fatal shooting of Mr Menezes is how much of a threat the victim was believed to pose? Many other crucial questions remain unanswered. It appears Menezes travelled on a bus before reaching stockwell.

Above all, the victim who was suspected of having links to suicide bombers, why was he not confronted in a way which prevented him running into stockwell station?<br><br>Under British law, if Menezes had been a suicide bomber, it would have been lawful for the police to kill him in order to protect the lives of the officers and others around them.

They might have wanted to glean intelligence from him.<br><br>2. Like i said, british cops do not generally carry firearms. It would be foolish to try and arrest a suspected suicide bomber when you do not have firearms. I think what might have happened is that by the time the firearms unit were ready to challenge Mr M, he had already boarded the Bus. To try and arrest a suspected suicide bomber on a bus would be a very stupid and dangerous move. The only relatively safe place to challenge him then, would have been when he alighted. He alighted near or at Stockwell station where he was challenged.<br><br>Lets just wait for the Independent Police Complaints Commission to investigate the incident before we pass judgement shall we?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To dispute this matter, i reckon is two-sided. Judging by the scenario and the event of the bombings, everyone will be relatively nervous. Especially the police. Them failing to act will result in thier incompetence..  they they did a china man style. TRY LUCK. lol! But its true that u dun confront a bomber in bus as it would just jeapordise the ppl on board. I think they did what they had to do. The police should have produced his badge properly, the man understandably would panic.. if i were the cop, i would've done it too. Coz if i dun shoot him.. he may have a trigger anywhere and i would end up in the body bag too. So he bagged his ass. =P Thats what the terrorists wants.. want the people to doubt thier own law enformenct agencies. I bet they are laughing somewhere. As most suicide bombers are all of Arab origins.  Cant believe they thought the brazillian as asian too though..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by lwflee:</div><div class="quote_body">As best as i can remember from the news, this is what happened:<br><br>The police had put a flat under surveillance. This was related to the hunt for the London Bombers. The block of flats in question only had one means of entry and exit. Mr M, the victim, was living below the flat under surveillance. When he walked out of the block of flats on the day in question, the police decided to follow him.<br><br>They followed Mr M to a bus-stop where he took a bus and alighted near stockwell station. By this time, the police armed response unit had been given orders to stop Mr M.<br><br>Mr M. was challenged by the police at the entrance of stockwell station by plain-clothes officers. He did not comply with orders to stop. He vaulted over the ticeketing barriers of the train station and ran down the escalators towards a train. He tripped and was then pinned down by pursuing officers. The officier in question fired 8 shots at him; 1 into his shoulder and 7 into his head.<br><br>Some pertinent facts:<br><br>- Mr M was olive skinned.<br><br>- Mr M had on a bulky jacket. This was mentioned by Mark Whitby, an eye-witness. One poster above had neglected to mention this. Tsk tsk.<br><br>- It was claimed by a TV station that MR M had outstayed his student visa. His parents dispute this, saying that all his paperwork were in order.<br><br>----<br><br>Personally, i think we should not be too quick to go on a witch hunt. This might very well be an honest mistake.<br><br>Some of you argue that there was no need to shoot him, or that there was no need to shoot him in the head. I disagree. This is because the only way to make safe a suicide bomber is to utterly and completely destroy his brain. One shot to the head might not be enough to stop all motor functions. I have not seen a man being shot in the head, but i have seen footage of farm animals being shot and from what i have seen, animals like cows retain some motor function even after having been shot in the head at close range.<br><br>I also feel that some are too eager to fling words like 'racist killing' around. This might very well be an honest mistake.<br><br>Mr M emerged from a block of flats that is under surveillance, He looked 'Asian' (which is what the london bombers can be described as), he had been wearing a bulky jacket when the temperature was around 23 deg Cel., and more importantly, he refused to stop when challenged. He might very well have been justified in running away because the officers were, after all, not in uniform. IMO, that is probably what happened. If so, then i do not think the fault lies with the officer who pulled the trigger. I think luck, fate and the met police share equal blame.<br><br>Kym, you argue that he could have been stopped earlier. I disagree. UK policemen do not generally carry firearms. Therefore, it would seem logical to let the firearms unit do the arrest.<br><br></div></blockquote>I agree fully with you. For those who disagree, I have a question for you :<br><br>Do you think that there is a crime only if there is a victim? Or do you believe that there is crime even before there is a victim?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree with you. Whatever reason London police can come up with, it is indefensible to kill an innocent person. There is absolutely no justification. Life is the most precious thing and death is irreversible. Therefore, should the police decide to take away the life of a person, they must be dead sure that this person is a serious threat. Obviously this is a case of wrong judgement that resulted in a tragedy. The British government must compensate profusely for the death of Mr. M. For those who think that the police should not be held accountable because they did what they had to do, how would you react if Mr M is your family?<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by sgdiehard:</div><div class="quote_body">Do police tackle suspected suicide bombers the same way as they do with other type of terrorists?

            <div class='col-md body'>The bottom line is that a young innocent man with no connection to the bombings in London had lost his life. This is irrefutable. To say the least it must have deeply embrassed the Metropolitian police, reflecting on their inability to deal effectively with the threat of suicide bombings and the "quality" of their intelligence gathering. Nothing short of a full inquiry into the shooting should be carried if the diplomatic relations between Britain and Brazil was already not strained. No amount of swift compensation can bring Menezes back to life.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>When considering the death of Mr Menezes, it is right that there should be shock and an inquiry. People in Britain are not so inured to violence that they respond with indifference to an innocent man's death. The policeman who shot him would not be in line for a gallantry award.<br><br>The failures of the suicide bombers must have presented the police with large amounts of forensic material. It is hoped that this will make it easier to roll up the terrorist neworks to which the bombers were connected. But even if that proves to be so, it does not mean that we can roll up the map of Islamic terrorism. There are bound to be more attacks.<br><br>When the Blair Government passed the Human Rights Act, it became much harder either to imprison undesirable foreigners or to deport them. As a result, authorities can no longer take crucial decisions affecting security. They have allowed themselves to be overruled by legal constraint of foreign origin. Given all that, MI5 would hardly be popular with ministers if it recommended the arrest of everyone who might come under suspicion. The only desirable legal change is the repeal of the Human Rights Act, so that Home Secretaries regain the power to exclude undesirable aliens.<br><br></div>
